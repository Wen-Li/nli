in my personal opinion young people do not spend enough time helping their community when it is needed . our personal goal focus on ourselves whereas others generation 's goal focused on community . there may be many reason why this change came upon u , however , i guess the most important one is related to this our new style of life . our way of life push u to worry about personal thing rather than global one . we care about our personal image , our personal grant and our personal skill . we have to . however we must try to change and we ought to realize what it is happening outside and in fact we should give our helping hand . anyway , i think young people are no blame of this kind of selfishness but they are unaware . first of all , we have adquire a new way of life . we do live comfortable . our parent usually provide u everything we need . everywhere it seems a if nobody need anything from u a long . our community is rich and everyone can reach a good position a long a this person work . thus , our goal is not related to our community in which everything run `` perfectly well '' but it is focused in ourselves . our own complains and artificial need are highlighted . we have to be perfect not just good , but perfect . we have to worry about such thing in order to survived in this `` ideal community '' . inasmuch a we are so worried about ourselves we are not able to see the problem our community ha , we are not aware of that . regarding this lack of awareness we can explain why we do not help but we can not avoid trying people realize their selfishness . we have to take a look over our reality . we must do more for our community than we are doing up to now . it is a good chance not only for the community but for u to grow
