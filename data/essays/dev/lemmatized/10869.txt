i somewhat disagree with the statement because i believe that although it may be important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject , it is more effective for your future career if you specialize in one specific subject . for example , in school i learned about many subject including science , mathematics , drama , music , history , photography , ethic , etc. , which served me a basic knowledge for my day to day live . after i graduated i decided to study marketing , and i made a bachelor in business administration with a concentration in marketing . therefore i had to take finance and accounting clases , additional to the marketing concentration clases . i wa n't a happy with the accounting and finance clases , a i wa with the marketing clases , but i believe that it is imortant for me to have at least a general knowledge of other related subject . this two course served me a a supporting base for what i learned in marketing because it 's related . and `` related '' is the clue word here . i do n't find it necessary for me to study a little bit of medicine , architecture and politics in the university , just to have a broad knowledge in many subject . for me it 's more important to concentrate in subject related to my major if that 's where i want to work in my future . that 's why i 'm planning to do now a master degree , to even concentrate more and learn more in the studied before . therefore , i conclude that learning about other subject it 's usefull for your day to day live and general knowledge , but a you get older i believe you should concentrate more in the subject you want to work with . specializing in one specific subject make you a `` pro '' in it , and it is better to be a `` pro '' in a subject than to be a `` mediocre '' in many subject .
