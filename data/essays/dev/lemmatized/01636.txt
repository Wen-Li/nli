during almost 18 year , i studied many course and i know the best way to learn . so what i am sure about : the idea is the most important thing to understand than the fact . i will explain this in two general part : the first part will be about the idea that a fact is one example of the idea ; and the second one will deal with the fact that we can easier an idea than a fact . so first , it is obvious that the idea is most important thing to understand because the fact are just some case of the main idea . usually , during the class , the teacher try to explain u an example which permit to understand the idea . for example , to better understand the idea that people is calm when they listen music , it 's to give the example that in many medical room , we can hear some classical or jazz music . but it is not the point expected to learn . thus , this is something we can use to better understand something else . when we try to make our own opinion , we use the idea memorised to think . in this important case , we can see why it is so more important to learn the idea than the fact . if we continue with our previous example , what do we think about the importance of music in the world ? to answer , we could select the idea that music calm people and we could use it to conclude that without music , there will might be more wars in the world , and so , most of the population of the earth will be sad . it is in this way i see the importance of the idea . as i proved in this response , to better learn , we have to more concentrate on the idea than on the fact . but the fact are needed to understand the idea . so , in the perfect case , we would care about idea a well a fact .
