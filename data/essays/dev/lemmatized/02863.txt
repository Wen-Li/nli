advertisements often tease the pospective customer with the newest , most advanced and simply coolest good or service . to be unique in a diverse market environment it is literally inevitable to cheat the buyer . advertisements have to have a short and stong message . due to this briefness it is impossible to present the product in an appropriate and honest way . consumers who bought a product which wa advertised a reliable or easy to use often are unsatisfied with what they finally hold in their hand . but who is to blame ? of course the company are presenting the product in the best possible way , that 's what i would do too . on the other hand we , the customer , do n't want to hear lenghty advertisement in which product are explained in detail . the phenomenon of wrongly advertised product is not a new one . in my opinion people should be clever enough to know that company say whatever it take to sell a product . for example when a cellphone is advertised the commercial could say : the best cellphone ever built . this statement , of course , can not be prooved by anyone . therefore we have an exageration and probably even a false statement . another example is food and drink . how can a commercial seriously say : the most delicious burger ever . a customer who buy and try it ultimately ha the expectation of a great burger . but what if he doe n't like it . this mean the advertisement industry is neither able to shape our taste nor to advertise product in a proper way . so far i have been describing the black sheep among the advertising company . nonetheless there are company who present their product honestly without exaggeration or even lie . especially when comparison are made the customer can be sure to watch a good advertising . in the end it 's all up the the prospective custome whether a commercial is believed or not .
