cars are of vital importance for everyone 's life . today , we can not imagine a situation without car . even if we do not have one ourselves , other people utilize them to make our life easier - be it a transporter bringing food to the supermarket or the car that brings u to the hospital in case of a severe accident . in my opinion , we need car and the populatoin in our country know that . this is the reason why i think that the number of car will not diminish in the next 20 year . there are a myriad of argument for and against the use of car : the major argument against car is certainly the pollution of our environment . and it is true - car , a we know them today , need certain natural resource and do pollute our environment to a certain degree . if this is always true , there will probably be fewer car in use in 20 year that there are today . at some point in time , people would recognize the harm of car and would definitely try to reduce the number of car to protect the environment . but this may not be a realistic case : i am of the opinion , that our scientist get smarter and smarter . until today , they already invented hybrid engine and engine that are only run by solar energy or plant oil . today , those invention can not replace car that need gaz to produce power , because scientist are still trying to get more out of the new founding . but consider the time the gaz engine needed to be a perfect a we know today : it took long year for the car industry to be able to produce those engine . given this evolution , it is possible and very realistic that our scientist will make a huge contribution to the improvement of the ` new ' engine in the next 20 year . even if 20 year might be too short to develop a car that doe not pollute the environment at all , i think that the scientist are on a good way to find an engine that drastically reduces the pollution . and after another 20 year , we might already use car that do not need any natural resource like gaz . if this is the case , everyone will recognize the outstanding advantage of car , so that the number of car will rather increase .
