i believe that is very difficult to understand idea and concept and it is simpler and faster to learn fact . in my opinion , you can understand a fact without knowing idea and concept about it but you ca n't understand idea if there are not fact and practical example that support the idea ! it is difficult to understand idea because they are made by other people with concept and way of thinking different from yours . and also , people have different idea on different argument , so is not possible to explain or to describe something in one way or in one idea , everyone can have various and different idea . ideas can often be manipulated by people who want their idea to be dominant . a fact , to the contrary , ca n't be changed , it is the same for everybody and his evidence prof that it can not be change . a fact can also be funny , scary , interesting . .. it can give an emotional impression which is easier to remember then an idea . if student learn fact , they can make connection between those fact and idea and concept that they already have . on my way of thinking , for example , learning fact is very important while one is studying history : when child learn history about nazism and holocaust , they ca n't understand the meaning of this word if they do n't know what happened , so , they ca n't understand if they do n't know the fact ! tis could happen also in other subject like biology : concept and idea are mad only after a fact ha been observed ! only after knowing fact it 's possible to figure out the meaning of the concept . ideas have to be supported by fact ! the first step and the more efficient way to learn is to know and learn fact .
