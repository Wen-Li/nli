i think that advertisement are the best way to sell product . i think the selling and gaining money from a product ha a very important and coherant chain . and advertisement pley a very important role in this chain because without an advertisement the product wo n't be known by lot of people , then you will not be able to sell your product to many people because your product is not well known and also because you did n't sell enough to get poeple 's trust so your product is not enough trustfull and because of this you will not gain money . and because you dont have money you will be able to produce your good . and finally your company will be closed . if you look to the big company like coca-cola , you might understand what i am talking about . coca-cola today is a huge company and ha lot of factory in lot of country because it did introduced itself to the whole word by advertisement . eventhough in our country , turkey , they have a very big advertisement . in every mounth they produce a new `` creative '' advertisement to attract people to buy coca-cola . because they know that advertisement is a very important and helpful way to introduce new product and also to show and make them remember their old product too . so thats why they put lot of money to advertisement to make people buy their product even though coke is a very unhealthy thing . for another example fast food advertisement . we all know that fast food are very unhealty thing for u . it ha lot of chemical thing which are not needed by our body , but when you watch mc . donalds tw advertisement and see a billboard advertisement of burger king , you immediatelly think about eating a hamburger and drinking a coke and eating extremely unhealty french fries . so advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . eventhough they are extremly unhealty and and not needed by human you immediatelly want them . but this making much better seller advertisement are not just food and drink , it can be a car adv . or a game console adv . or clothing company adv . or every single think you think of . adverti
