in thenty year from now it doe n't look possible , in my view , to have fewer car in used in our society . indeed the car market is very important in country ' economy . it ha been important almost in the past century , but it seems like it 's becoming even more important today . the resaon for this developement is that developing country , or new developped one are developing their industry . and it 's well known that one of the major sector of the industry is the car industry . therefore more and more car are getting built every day in the world , and they will be in use in our street sooner or latter . for example asian country are becoming very powerfull in this area . we all know brand like toyota , honda . .. and if we pay attention to the car around u we 'll nottice how usual it becomes to see people with those car . besides this developement doe n't mean that the other developped country stopped making car . they actualy try to catch up with those country and are making new car too . for example , we have wolkswagen an bmw in germany , chevrolet , general motor in the united-states . .. and much more . they are all trying to be more competitive so they are all deveoping new car and saling more car too . cars industry is an important economic area for every country today , that 's why i personaly think that a huge amount of car is coming , and in twenty year it wo n't be solved at all . but , today we can also see the developement of environementals concerned . more and more organisation are opening in order to protect our planet : greenpeace wa the first one but definately not the last one created . and in my opinion it 's also becoming a political strategy , so me may have a `` solution '' to this environement damage : a new kind of car that wo n't polute a much . for example car using electricity . to conclude i would say that economics strategy wo n't let the car industry disapear but they might find new technique in order to combine strong economy and protection of our environement .
