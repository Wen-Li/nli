i believe that people who take risk are successful and smatter a well because life is all on taking risk especially on today society were it all about the compitition . for example if the college admission person see an application with someone who ha done what every else ha done a in requirement they will be dissapointed with the student . when they see someone who ha done thing that have never done before they will only not be impress but they will take a chance a well . if you already know how to do a expirement you should try to improve it by taking a risk and actually doing something much defferent . also if you want to be the owner of a restaurant and you really want this to be the best selling retaurant and you are diciding where there you name the place a name of a well known chain of restaurant or you could take a chance and find originality by naming it something thing else . if you become successful that way you will feel proud of your creativity and if you do n't become so successful at list you will feel proud that you failed with your own idea . this is what make you defferent from someone else originality a risk take is what succeds in life . knowing how to do something is one step closer to taking a risk and being more success then you were when you found out you knew how to do something . the next step is making it original and being proud of the possitive result or negetive in some case . being a brain cancer survivor ha taught me that taking risk in your life is the best way to live life . i took some risk in the hospital and know here i am being successful .
