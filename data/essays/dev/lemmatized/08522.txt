have n't you ever wondered why the laundry we see on tv is always perfectly clean after washing but we still find some stain when we wash at home ? this essay will discus the issue that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . firstly , the product is always in a perfetct light when we see it in an advertisement . obviously , the producing firm doe not want to show the product under worse circumstance . they want to sell the product in order to gain some profit . therefore it seems reasonable to me to show it in a rather perfect light . for instance , if someone drive a car in an advertisement he drive the car through a picturesque landscape . but we often face noisy traffic jam in dirty city . obviously the actor in the add seems to have more fun driving the car . furthermore , the add are often supported by music to stimulate the consumer desire to obtain the product . the sound of beautiful music also support that the product look better than it look the noisy real life . moreover , the actor in the advertisement are always happy and they really know how to use the product . sometimes we experiance some difficulty by using a product simply because we do not know how to use it proberly . imagine a new cellphone . there are so many function , we sipmly do not know how to handle it with all it possible feature . to conclude , i agree that the product seem better that they really are because in our daily life we are not using them under the perfect circumstance . but a far a i am concerned , this is no problem a long the basic statement of an advertisement is true and if we are aware of the fact that our daily life differs from the one we see on tv .
