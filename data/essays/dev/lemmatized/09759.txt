the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community is may right , but in my opinion it could be said not only for young people and not only nowadays . i think the time after childhood and befor adulthood have been a difficult time eversince . teenager have enough to do helping themselfe , so they are may even the only agegroup who should not be blamed for being a bit selfish . but even after you reached your twenty succesful , there is a high number of realy ignorrant and selfish people . it go on during every ageclass . it is easy to blame the young one , but even most middel-age and older people are looking away if something uncomfortable happens . anyway , this do not mean , that the statement , that young people nowadays do not care enough , is wrong . if there are too many people in every ageclass who do not spend enough time to help their community , the younger one are includet . but in my opinion , most time , they are at least the most helpful orientated group , at least after they maneged their teenage . just because there are more often more open minded young people than older one . wich brings u to the word `` nowadays '' . it is may likely that in passed time the family bond wa stronger , so there wa more help during most family for each other . but the community doe not mean only the people we love , but also people who are may totaly different , with opinion we do n't share , with behavior we do n't understand . but to help the community mean even to help them , if help is needed . to help some stranger on the street wa way more uncommon in past time but today . and even if most of the charity organisation have mostly older member and helper , it doe n't mean that the younger generation do n't care . most time the young people are tho who want to change something . i totaly agree that there are not enough people who spend enough time to help their community , but at the end you ca n't blame it only to the younger one nowadays . it is and wa a general problem .
