i do not believe that young people enjoy life more than older people . what make a young person happy may not make an older preson happy . to `` enjoy life '' is a very subjective concept that varies according to the age , cultural background , religious belief , social environment and many other factor . form my own experience , i learn to enjoy life every day . when i wa a child i wa completely unable to socialize , to relate to other child and have fun with my friend . family problem that i wa going through made me a very shy girl . in many occassions i could not find the way out from unconfortable situation . the inablity to ask for help made my childhood pretty sad . young people today have , sometimes , problem to express what make them happy because of `` peer pressure '' . most of the teenager who are `` follower '' ( meaning not leader ) may find themselves in awfull situation , doing and performing act they do n't want to do . as we grow up , we dare to be deffierent . we learn to say `` no '' and do not feel bad about it . our personality get stronger and we feel more comfortables with who we are . as we grow up we learn to overcome obstacle and a we get older we get wiser and learn from our own experience and other 's experience . the more we know about ourselves , the easier we find our way to happines . it take time to discover and understand what make u happy . that wisdom to understand and comprehend what joy mean to u come with age , with a life full experience , mistake and success . i strongly believe the opposite of that statement . a shy girl who doe not know how to ask for help , or a teenager who feel oppressed by his or her peer and a life with no experience will certainly have a harder time to find happiness , to enjoy life . as i get older , i get wiser . when i make a mistake i learn from it . i heard a long time ago that growing older is mandatory , growing up is optional . i agree with that .
