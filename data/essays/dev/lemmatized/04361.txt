we all pas by difficult moment in our life that will help u gain experience . i agree with the qoute that say 's `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , for many different reason . a person who try 's new thing in his life , will gain experience and knowledge . taking risk and learning new thing will develop a person emotionally and physically . it is a good thing for a person to be adventurous , and go through different kind 's of situation 's , because it help him learn new thing and lesson in life . by learning these new lesson 's , and by being more experienced , a person will suddenly see himself optimistic , and happy . his reason for living will increase , because he will love life more , and would like to do new stuff that will entertain , and teach him . i think that a risk taker is a very confident person , that know 's what he want 's in life , and he is lucky to have this characteristic . it is a positive action that each person must choose to sucsseed in live , unlike the peolpe that only do what they know . these people that are not risk taker 's will eventually find themselves not capable of doing anything in life . they will regret not being risky , and not doing and trying everything new in life , and will hope and wish for time to go back , and do whatever they did not do . the difference between these two kind of people is that one is ready and willing to learn new thing and lesson 's in live , while the other is being self-relient , scared , and lazy , and he will not sucsseed in live a much a the confident , risk taker . in conclusion , taking risk will never affect a person in a negative way . it will help a person to have a great self-esteam , will make his confidence grow , and will make him successful in any situation he is going to face in life .
