nowadays , car are major mean of transport . they have been used for over 100 year . somehow , people are now addicted to car . it ha become an essential thing in our everyday life . besides , it 's unlikely that people get rid of that mean of transport . there is always something new to learn , to discover . cars might be technologically advanced in twenty year , but i hardly think there will be fewer car in use . in saudi arabia , people tend to use more and more car , a every single family ha , in average , 2 car . actually , car need maintenance , energy , fuel . the only reason that could lead to the decreasing use of car are the unsuffiecient quantity of petroleum . as we all know , that ressource is limited on the earth , and we could run out of fuel in 50 year . however , the human being is known to be solution finder : we could probably invent new car that work on another energy , for example the sun energy . actually , some of these car are being tested all over the world . that suggests the fact that there is always a solution for every problem . in my opinion , i think car are very useful , even though they make air pollution . it ha served the man for century . but , eventually , if there is no more petroleum , car are useless . that natural factor could be the major reason of the usingless of that mean of transport . in conclusion , that statemnet is wrong if there is not that natural factor that stop u from providing energy to make our car work .
