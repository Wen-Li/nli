although some people like to learn thing that they want to use in their real life , i like to spend more time on the theory and i want others do the same thing a well . there are several reason : to advance our world , to contribute for a better fututre and to satisfy our need . many people think that human being improved their life a lot and they are the ruler of the planet , earth , i disagree . for example , a century ago , we even did not have electricity . what scholar did wa to develop theory and to care about science . for instance , if we did not have einstein or edison or other scholar , there would not have been electricity or new discovery . we may have been countinued our life with primary machine and in dark house . moreover , we have tremendous problem in our world . even though we have computer , rocket and flying car , the end of the world may too close . for example , the global warming contains a big threat and we need to save our world . how can we solve this problem ? most likely by thinking more about science ( theory ) , we probabely will solve the problem . in fact , we need more scientist to pay attention to this area and we need to encourage new generation to take science course and think more about theory . we do not have plenty of food and resource and we need to improve them more . without spending energy on the theory behind the genetically modified food , it would be imposible to grow healthier and numerous food . for example , i used to pay two dollar for a pound of apple containing a lot of disease , now i pay le for better apple . summing up , without spending more time on the theory , we could not improve our life standarts and i appriciate to the all scientist devoided their time on them .
