i have always considered travelling a excellent method to know many people and to know many different culture . but it could be a little bite expensive and dangerous if you do not have the apropriate instruction . in this paper i want to disscuss about the advantage and disadvantage that we could appear when we are travelling with out a suitable orientation . first at all , if we are travelling in a group led by a tour quide , we can feel safer and more confident to explore new thing and landscape . it is due to the expertise and experience that a tour guide could have . moreover , the guide could show to the traveller the important and interesting place that the group should visit during the trip . it is too important because it can be saved money and time . ! you go straight to the point . it is fantastic . on the other hand , if we travel in group led by a tour guide we can feel uncomfortable with many thing . one of them is that you can not visit some place when you want do it because it is usually that a tour guide ha a travelling route decided and scheduled before the trip ha started . adding this point , you can not enjoy isoleted space and activity because most of the time you have to share different activity with tthe all group and it can be boring experience . from my point of view it is very important to travel with someone else , but if i have the opportunity to do it in group it is wonderful . because of the mutual cultural and interpersonal exchange . youcan enjoy and involve in many activity easily . but if you group ha a tour guide is excelent tool to know a a lot of place using le time and money . i think the most important issue if you want to travel is to be prepared to do it alone , in a group or with a tour guide . it doesn not matter , jus take into account your happiness and your feeling to have fun .
