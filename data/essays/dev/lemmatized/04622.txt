yes . i do agree that most of the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . advertisements infact in today 's world do not only mean the disposition of the product 's essential feature and it look . instead they are supposed to be a glorified dispay of the product with the fake promise that it is and will prove out to be a very valuable product , which will indeed provide enough customer satisfaction . in some case the promise may turn out to be true a it totally depends on the the company and the `` product '' , the real one . advertisements are supposed to be in some case only heart winner ! i say only because the product of that same field , competitive product are all but equal in term of quality or quantity they provide . its only upon the marketing and advertising faculty of the organization if it can make it look `` much better than it really is '' . and only when it make a place in the customer ' heart would it be sold and the profitsfor the company flourish . in a world of competition , the manufacturer is compelled to make the product percieved a the best it can be . and indeed a supported by the study of the current market , the product that are well advertised are the most sought after by the particular segment customer . indeed if you add a bit of sheen to your product or make it look bigger , better , `` tasty '' or tempting to the public on the t.v , magazine or any other mean of the medium , chance are that the customer in and except your clientele would be atleast somewaht lured the product . and though they might buy it only after careful examination of the product and considerable review from there friend , they are atleast ushered to go to the market and check out how and what it really is . now the actual sale of a product would obviously depend partially on how well it really resembles the advertisement `` glorification '' and partially on the competition it face . so in my opinion the advertisement in today world is a neccessary part of the marketing process . as real it can be kept , it should be . but i would consider it compulsory to give a bit of weight to the product adn it feature .
