about this topic , different people have different point of view . however i think that is true that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first of all , we should know what is advertisement , that is a way to sell the product the company make , so that mean the advertisement ha to make the product attractive to people , that is a main reason lead people decide to buy it or not . for example , if you want to sell cookie , you may want to more and more people to buy it so you have to catch people 's eye . you may need to use some technology to improve your cookie 's feature . like the color should be more bright or make a suggestion that how to eat this cookie by the best way . thereby , that is impossible just to use the original feature of your cookie to make it advertisement . so you have to make your cookie seem much better than it really is . also , there have a interesting thing that advertisement may trick the kid to interested about the product , like transformer advertisement . in that advertisement , you will see that transformer can fly . we all know that is impossible because the transformer even not exsists . so when you buy a transformer to your child , they may dissappoints about this toy , because this is different from what they see from the transformer 's advertisement . that is another reason advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . beside that , competition is anotrher reason that advertisement m - ake product seem much better than they really are , because this is a competition society , all the businessman are compare with others , so advertisement is another way to improve their business , so that sometimes , they may focus on the affection of advertisement instead the quality of the product . when you watching the advertisement , you may have desire to buy it , that only prove that the advertisement of product affect you but not the real product , becuase before you want to buy it , you may even never use or taste the product before . from what ha been discussed above , we could safety draw the conclusion that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
