me a many other student face the decision either to have a general knowledge about many accademic field or to specialise in one field only in order to be considered an expertise . the decision that will come out will reflect the characteristic of the person . a person with many interest will never renounce to the pleasure of knowing more and more different thing . on the other hand , people with a passion will tend to specialise in a field that will make them happier and happier . a general education ha many positive aspect such a a greater flexibility in changing preferencies and vision for the future . this kind of preparation give the possibility to the student with no clear idea about the future to postpone this important decision and take time to identify the main desire . furthermore , a general education give much more flexibility in adapting to different job condition . a specific education focused only on a subject give the advantage to the student to be an expertise in a field . this is a great advantage on the job market . in the same time , these student usually are much more rigid , unable to change and to handle with change . these characteristic are not always required by employer . personally , i think that the best choice for a person would be a solution that take into account both it own personality and the inner desire , for this reason i do not think there is only one best education . furthermore i think that the accademic education that must be followed should reflect the requirement of the field that the student is studying , we can not compare the specificity required in medicine by the doctor with the general culture required by an teacher .
