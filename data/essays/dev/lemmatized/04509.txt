i am of the opinion that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . there are many reason and example that i would like to list in support of my position . first let u consider those case in which the author 's contensions , in fact my contensions , hold good . firstly let u consider the field of science and technology . consider for example a biology student is faced with the problem of replacing the burned out fuse . if he do not have any knowledge about the electrical subject he may not be able to fix a very simple task . also a student of technology should have minimum idea of what medicine to take when a minor health problem arise . so a broad knowledge of many academic subject is necessary . secondly , if for example a student is confined to study only the history of his own country which is his specific academic subject then he may face problem when asked about the world history and some important event in the world history . thirdly , consider the example of desiging a computer . many people who do different task are involved in desiging a computer . if the person who design a part of the computer do not understand the funtions of other part and the link between those part then a computer can not be designed . finally , also a person of sceince or technology may find difficulty in the bussiness world if he do not anything about the stock market . this can be extended even to politics . if the party member have idea only about their own party then they are at risk of losing their position if they do not have the knowlede about the other party . in sum , i would like to reiterate that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acdemic subject than to specialize in one specific subject which help an individual enhance his general knowledge in addition to the regular subject .
