i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is to merely learn fact . the following point can be reasonably made to support the above statment . to begin with , understanding of idea and concept enables one to really appreciate the mechanic of it and to possibly put the idea or concept into application . take the example of an electric motor . without proper understanding of how an electric motor really work , it is impossible for one to create motor of various size and for various utility . if one mearly learnt the fact about a motor , we would n't have all the pleasure in life made possible by all the miniature motor ! look at the car power window , whose operation is facilitated by small motor , or at many of useful the robot whose motion is made possible by various sizes/types of motor , or at many of the precision tool that use something called stepper motor to precisely control various operation . further , understanding of a concept enables one to look for way the concept can be extended to other application , or to find way two or more concept can be combined to come up with new idea that make exciting thing possible . take the example of a device that scan printed material and convert it into typed matter on a computer . this device is the result of a lot of different concept put together . the scanning technology - which scan the printed material , which is then combined with pattern matching technology - that can look at the scanned picture and recognize the letter based on their shape . simple learning of fact doe n't really allow for this kind of innovation . however , no one can deny the role fact play in helping people visualize thing and in putting thing in perspective . take for example the saturn rocket that took man to the moon . unless one know the size of the rocket , the amoount of fuel used , how many invention were required to make the flight possible , one may not really appreciate the scale of the device and the project . but one can still see that the fact help one gain a perspective of thing , but the really usefulness come only when one understand the concept that make it possible for the device to work . in summary , it is clear that it is far more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn just fact , despite the important role played by the fact .
