people who take risk are more likely to receive benefit from their action rather than people that simply do n't act . this is not only a logical assumption but it is also supported by evidence which are true at global scale . some of the richest people in the world were ordinary people with very good idea . an example for that is bill gates . instead of improving existing tool , he decided to project and invent a new instrument , the personal computer , which will cause a revolution in work and entertainment activity . he risked to waste many year of work on something uncertain that could just be a failure . it is now clear that he had employed his time in a very fruitful manner and that he will be remembered a a genius . on the other hand , some people succeeded in exporting good idea to other country with different cultural background . a good example is starbucks coffee which is now sold all over the world and even in china . it must have been a very controversial decision to take for the manager . but , although the chinese society is traditionally used to tea instead of coffee , now many chinese young people drink starbucks coffee to identifiy with american model . on smaller scale we all can experiment that if we take some risk we will have more chance to fulfill our desire and be more happy . for example , you can decide to go and study in the united states . at the beginning it will be difficult because of the language constraint and the distance from family and friend . but if you hold on and overcome difficulty you will get a valuable degree from an excellent university that will allow you to access to better job and income opportunity . in conclusion , i think it is always worthy to try new thing and take risk . we need to remember that we are given only one opportunity in this world and we should do our best to be happy and make other people happy .
