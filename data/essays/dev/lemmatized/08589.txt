i totally agree that in the next twenty year or so there will be much fewer car in use than there are today . although it may not be evident in the present scenario with car sale gong up each year but many factor like pollution , space crunch and increase of public awareness will see the more and more people relying on public transportation a their sole mean for travelling . with the price of gasoline skyrocketing beyond general public 's purchasing capability , people are slowly realizing that their car are becoming more of a liability to them . it is highly unlikely that the fuel price will ever decrease given the limited resource of fossil fuel . cars based on unconventional source of energy like fuel cell , solar power etc are yet to establish their financial viabilty . all these factor suggest that people will look upto public transportation a a permanent solution to their woe . besides being lighter on purse the statistic suggest that it is much more safer mode of transportation than car . also exploding population in metropolitan city is leading to major space crunch on road and parking lot . people are fed up of wasting hour in traffic jam and parking queue . they are realizing that if most of them use public transportation , it would benefit all in term of driving space and time . non polluting vehicle like cycle are once again gaining popularity among mass for various resons , health being a prominient one . infact many people in china go to their office daily on bicycle . therefore , it seems that the idea of the `` ford '' , the famous car manufacturer , to ensure car for all may not came true . with government strongly promoting the benefit of public transportation and increasing awareness among public reagarding the disadvantage of owning and driving a car we will see a sad but necessary demise of the era of car .
