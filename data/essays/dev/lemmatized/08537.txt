car ha became a part of life in the modern life . car is very much essential today to do the thing in the right time . i disagree with the given statement that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . in the olden day man used to travel from place to another by walking . the invention of the wheel chaged the evolution greatly . after the invention of wheel man introduced many new vechicles for transportation . he initially used bullock cart , tonga which were pulled by animal . in the later life he introduced bicycle , which served him in travelling later he introduced motor cycle inorder to reach quickly with le effort , inthis process man thought for luxirious way of travelling and he started to introduced vechicles run by fuel . he designed some of them for transportation of good , and some for human , such a truck , bus respectively . and he later thought about the luxory and privacy , then brought the car . car were luxirious mean of transportation in the earlier . but it is a compulsory now . this change had occured because of globalisation and neccesities . in the intial stage there very le number of car , people used to see it very intrestingly . but now day in the developed country many are having more than one car . the main problem with the car is they create alot of traffic problem and also pollution . for this reason many government are trying to decrease car by demanding for more tax , parkingamounts . but pepole are ready to pay that because they very much edicted to it . the question is that there will be le car with in 20 year than now but ithink it will not happen . the people possessing car will not throw them out . there will be many technology come which will reduce pollution already some are using car run by solar power . the other reason is that popullation is increasing day - day . and iconclude from the above reason that after twenty year the number of will not be decreased instead the go on increase .
