that is a very difficult question ! but me personally , i disagree . i think a older you get a more you will enjoy the life . it ha something to do with the life experiance , the money or the income , the knowledge . .. that should n't mean , that young people do not enjoy their life . but i think , they enjoy it in a different way ! and that 's the fun part in your younger age . when you are young , you normally do n't know that much about life , so you have to adventure it . normally with no or with much le money a you will earn when you 're geting older . and that mean , that you can concentrate more on the real thing you are interested in in life . as an example : when you are young and you want to go on vacation you 're looking for a cheap way of doing it . .. maybe a very cheap flight to mallorca/spain , a youth hostel for 10 buck per day . no breakfast , coz you still have enough alcohol in your stomach , from the night before . .. i am 30 now . and this kind of vacation would be way to hard for me know . but when i think back . .. 5-10 year ago i would have loved it . now i would rather flz somewhere very nice , with a nice hotel , maybe a rental car . some sightseeing . and in the evening i would go out for dinner . to a nice restaurant , with some delicious food and a nice wine !!!! so for me . .. i enjoy my life more when i 'm getting older !
