i agree that most advertisement make product seem better than they realy are . advertisements are there to attract customer to a certain product . the product is always displayed in a way where it seems appeling to the viewer . sometimes the company advertising the product tend to exadurate in advertising . they make the product seem to good to be real . each advertisement is there to target a certain age group . for example when advertising a toy on the television certain sound effect and bright colour are used to attract young child making them desire the product . therefore the parent take action and buy the toy for their child . advertising is the best way to minpulate with young child 's mind . advertisements doe not include the disadvantage of the product advertised . the product is always praised and made flawless . the company advertising a certain good main aim is profit . quality and customer service is the last thing considered . it is rare that you find an advertised product that is trustworthy and is exactly like it wa described on the advertisement . in a conclusion i would like to say that the problem we are facing nowadays is that we are letting those false advertisement affect u , but there is nothing we can do about it a they are every where . they 're displayed a bulletin board in the street , showed on the television a commercial and even played on the radio . in the end were just human and the least thing affect u !!!
