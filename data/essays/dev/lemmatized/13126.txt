most people have lost thier interest about thier community day by day . people also do n't want to involve in helping thier community . so it seems to me that these people that i am accused not of helping their comminities are specailly youngster . however , i ca n't accuse them directly since the sense of helping poeple around u should be taugth in their early education such a in elemantary school . moreover family should be take care of this issue . the first point that i would like to make is that if you are willingto help your community you should n't wait earning money . as a result young people think that helping to other people or partipating in some charlty organization is waste of time . however thinking like that it is not their fault yet their family do n't talk with their child about the importance of helping to people . moreover teacher or school department do n't encourage the youngster to help their comminities . for instance when i wa in highschool , our teacher encourage u to go to the house for elderly . furhermore they were bringing u to the forest in order to culture a tree in everymonths . but the school stopped doing this activity because of it cost . in addition i am conviced that young people ca n't understand the benefit of helping their community . let u look another reason why younsters do n't help their community . i believe that their circulum in the school is so busy . they have to study and they have to pas their class . it is apparent that those responsibility are stressing them out . however they can help their comminities in their spare time . i am convinced that most youngster spend their time playing video game , chatting internet or interesting in celebrity ' life . they can take a action in some helping organization instead of doing these activity . to sum up , i agree with young people do n't help their comminitiees a much a they should . but , the most importanly , it is not their fault . some shoul teach them the importanceof participating to help their comminities such a their parent and their teacher .
