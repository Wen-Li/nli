although young peolpe are more outgoing than older people , i do not agree with this statement . older people are mostly retired and have much more time and money to go on trip and travel to other country . younger people on the other hand have to learn often and do not have that much money to travel a lot . but they are more interested in discovering new country and make new experience . in comparison , older people already have a lot of experience and they often , just want to visite place where they have been before rather than go on exiting trip . however , older peole often have problem with their health and therefore they are not a flexible a young people are . young people can do whatever they want , whithout thinking about their health . older people therefore are more interested in their own family , which is often the most important topic in their life . and to my opinion it is far better to see your own grantchildren growing up than going into disco and stay up all night , what a lot of younger people do . to sum up the main point , i do not think that younger people enjoy their life more than older people do , because there are so many thing that older people can do which younger can not do . to my opinion older people enjoy their life different than younger people do , but there is no better way .
