the idea that student should learn idea and concept rather than fact neither look logic nor rational . i would completely disagree with that idea for a lot of reason . i do think that in order for young growing people to learn fact of life and science in different speciality in order to be able to have the idea of their own , otherwise they will just come with mixed out idea and concept . so it is sort of chronological process . i do not think for example how would a student could come up with certain invention or innovation in certain machine or subject without clearly taking in all the basic fact of how this machine is working and the basic scientic factor contolling it function or he may end up with catastrophy . another reason , is that study of fact broadens the horizon of the student vision , then he would be quite capable of finding out the concept and basic idea by himself , by studying how every thing in life would correctly work . it is only after passing that stage of basic learnig that his ability to investigate and relate new concept and theory . young student tend to be arrogant if they believe that they know concept and idea , that would be useful only after ensuring they really learn the fact and be able use them in the proper context . and last but not least , education is an active process , and unless the student forced from their younghood to learn hard and given fact and certain assignment they would be reluctant to offer any thing useful to the world or be aid in world 's progress . it is that young age that student could be taught all the human science and knowlege and if we start by the idea of coming off teaching them the fact and basic science we will end up with ignorant generation . in conclusion , i belief student should be taught fact and basic of science rather than merely giving them idea and concept a it would not help them enough to proceed in their career .
