i agree this statemen . successful people try new thing because they want to get new degree . there are several reason for this . all people who have alot of achievement do n't satisfied to try new thing . as their ambitious force them a new achievement , they want to learn new thing even if it is risky . they consider taking a risk about one different thing they did n't know before about it because this kind of people do n't like monotone life . in my opinion , this kife is better than the other . trying to new thing add to our life numerous new concept . for example , i like playing soccer . when i wa in my country , i played soccer every weekend . after for a while , i bored to play soccer . i want to change someting in my life style . before i came us , i did n't know about american football . now i am learning about it . i also like it , i learn several new rule about sport , so it encourage me to play it . the other example about risky . i had took phd education for two year in my country . i want to change my education place even if it ha many riskies . these are spending alot of money , passing the toefl exam , and complete a new phd education in us . they did't know how much money i spend before . i also did't know whether or not i will pas the toelf an complete a new education . i take i people who are successful develope theirselves by trying new thing . they create new method to do something , so they help them to try new thing . now , we assume that a student who prepare for toefl . he developes new studying method , so he find better solution for studying . then , he can use the method for the other exam such a gre . every person who have alot of success try to new thing because of yheir life style . they do n't like doing someting they already know . their ha a kind of sense , so it push them to learn new thing .
