i believe the statement which tell `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject '' because more knowledge youhave , more job you can get , and sometimes broad knowledge make you become more trustful person after the graduation from the university because people are tend to trust a person who have more knowledge than they do . if person have broad knowledge , it will make people around you to be more unitize , and it will make this person a a great leader . for example , i trust the person who have more knoeledge than i do . my football coach have a lot of experience than i do because he play football in nfl for 4 year . because of he have more professional skill and knowledge , everybody trust him . then i realize that the more knowledge you have more trust you got from other people . the trust unit the team , and it make a team stronger . it is not only for sport , this statement fit in the company too . if you have trustful bos , your company will unit more than having a untrustful bos . however , broad knowledge make change of your surrounding , and it also help to be a great leader . because of people are tend to believe a person who have more knowledge than they do , the broad knowledge will be needed by a person who like to have a lot of frineds around you . the people who have a lot of kind friend always have broad knowledge . they have friend who is good at history , math , computer , and sport because the people who have a lot of friend have a lot of connection between these kind of people . without any connection , nobody want to be a friend because they will not have a topic that they are going to talk about . however the broad knowledge are needed to make a lot of friend who will support your life after the gruduation . it is better to learning a lot of academic subject before you graduate from university because it will help you after the schoollife .
