i agree , because the advertisement exagerate the efficiency or quality of the product sound like a salesman in the shop . the marketing in some many brand are aggresive that it is because , they want to compete with others and then show how are the brand is better than the others . example of that is the walt disney 's company over the year we saw many commercial announcement in television , internet , movie and mailing letter , they bombarding to u with this promotion over and over again but in some many way they sellit a `` dream may come true '' but it is not true when you dedide to start a vacation in walt disney the do n't tell you about the long line in the sun waiting for the attraction or waiting for eat in restaurant . this is sort of a kind of huge mistake when the advertisement capture our attention and became more attractive that the reality . this is an example so how the people is enchanted for some advertisement and the reality is other when arrive to `` walt disney '' . other advertisement just like food or diet show the specific people achieve their goal when entering to this plan , but the reality is other , because they never tell you how much is cost when you became interested in that program , the reality is they manipulate the statistic and sold dream and stole money for the customer , who failed to achieve that goal . in my opinion the people need to be more wisely when they attracted and impressed with an advertisement , just because they want your money and not your need or satisfaction that you want . that why they called marketing .
