on the one hand i think young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people are more active , they can make journey and sport . they go to party , spend much time with friend and have not much responsiblities . older people often have problem with their health . some older people need permanent medical and are not able to leave their home . furthermore they know the most of their life is over . i think this is not an amusing thought . so one can say many older people have not the possibility to enjoy life , but there are also older people who do not want to enjoy life . i know some older people who are healthy and well-off but nevertheless they do not go out , but sit in their hous and are sad . on the other hand young people are just at the beginning of their life and therefore they have to fight for their place in society . this struggle is not only fun , too . in school they have to work hard , because they want to rise their job opportunity and in university this situation is continued . when young people have leisure time , many of them waste their time in order to play vidoe game at the computer . other young people are unsatisfied by society and lead life a outcast . in contrast to that there are many healthy older people who earn a comfortable income or are even retired . they often afford luxurious trip and they have not so much pressure to be succesful . instead of stress in school , in university or at the beginning of a career , older people can play with their grandchild or can go for a walk with other older person . i think this is a great perspective . older people can look back and see what they have achieved over the year . that can also be great pleasure . resuming all that reason , i think both young and older people can enjoy life , but i am convinced that older people more often do so .
