i do agree with the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . successful people usually come from many failure and risk and after overcoming all this situation they gain success . so those people have a clear idea about how to tackle or overcome with risk and problem . the man or woman who is usually successful prefer gaining more success from more new thing or the thing which he or she is unfamiliar with . and in order to try new thing they never hesitate , whereas , the man who is usually under a nonsuccess stage fear to try for new thing . there are many example which support the answer . for instance , in the consturction field people usually succeeded in the field of consturcting huge building , dam , tower and flyover which is usually a risky factor at those day . because they have succeeded in there field they are trying for more new thing like going for more huge or enormous work which is also a bit kind of risky . because the consturction field people know a lot about there work and failure which they will meet in achieving thing they try to solve them in more logical manner or say in an planned order . not only in consturction field , we can go for other field like the most happening scientist field where they try only for new thing rather than going for the know one . scientists always think of inventing about new thing . if they would have taught that they cant take risk in inventing anything which we had now then we couldnt get many luxories and also disease preventing medicine for many hazardous disease which is usually harmful to human . when we go for new thing then only we get new thing in our day to day life which are becoming part of our daily life now-a-days and also daily routine . hence in this fast moving world , successful people should try for new thing and should take the risk to become more success , rather than sticking of only doing what they already know how to do well .
