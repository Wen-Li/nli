understanding idea and concept is very important for student , because it help to remember process easily , for exemple . in the subject biology , it is very hard to learn fact without knowing for what the fact are necessary in a biological system or process . in history class it is also important to know about the date of event . but if you understand the idea and the development of an event , you can easier put the event in an chronological order . learning fact is very important for student who educate a language for exemple . they have to learn vocabulary to improve their new language . jura student have to learn fact , too , and they have no chance to let that out . students who study medicine also have to learn a lot of vocabulary for anatomy . learning fact about a theme cost a lot of time and is not really helpful in your later work for an enterprise . understanding idea and concept is more likely . it is easier to learn and to understand than fact . facts are just ficional and you often do not know how to use fact properly in an important situation . for exemple : if there is a machine which doe not work any more , it is very difficult to check every single fact of the machine . it is easier to think about the whole concept of the machine : how doe it work and what doe it produce ? in this way it is more easier to find the problem of the defective machine . so , i think , student who want to take a job in an enterprise which is in the trade buisness or in buisnesses with process , have to know more about idea and concept . it is very important to know about the whole work of a process than to know about fact you can easily look up in a book . understanding idea and concept support the ability of thinking about a problem . and the skill to be able of finding a solution for a problem is a skill that make you desirable for a lot of employee . in my opinion , it is supportable to declare that understanding idea and concept is the most important skill for buisness . and that is what student should learn at their university .
