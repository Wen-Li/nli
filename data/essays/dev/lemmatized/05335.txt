i agree with the following statement . in my oppinion successful people are successful only because , at one point of their life they were faced with a chalenge and they had to take a risk in order to succeed . people that only stick to what they are good at will only be ` good ' yet they will not succeed if they do not take risk and face new challenge . trying new thing , idea , and being able to overcome new challenge is what defines a succesful person in my opinion . for example , if a person is quite gifted at a certain sport and is considered talented , it is still not enough for him to be ` labeld ' a successful . this person will have to test his ability against other people , try improving these ability , and risk injury or loss , and improve even more in order to move forward and become successful . if this person did not risk losing to people better than him and overcoming them , he would never know how good he actually is . another example could be opening a new business . if a businessman doe not risk losing some of his money while starting the business , he would not be able to make-up for his loss and gain even more money . not only is it important for a person to face new chalenges to imporve on himself , but it is also important to proceed forward , and see his level compared to other people or any other competition around him . facing new challenge , and taking risk is the only way a person would be able to succeed in life overall . talent is important yet it 's not the only factor towards success . all the famous athlete , business men , superstar , etc. have faced many challenge and were able to overcome them regardless of how talented they were , and that 's what make them successful .
