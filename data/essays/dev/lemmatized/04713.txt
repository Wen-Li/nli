sucess and failure lie in the hand of the person andalso depends on the the dedication and effort which he give on his particular work . i feel that succesfull people doe different thing and enjoy doing doing them . these people generally dont depend on the result of the work which wa done by them but they concentrate on the effort which put on it . this the best and most fascinating thing in them . when they donot try new thing and work stick to one kind of work which they are habituated to do which any risk and problem the man would certainly not called a a successful person . for example take a biologist resercher , he start reasearch in one particular feild and conduct experiment draw hypothisis and he continues the process till he succeed . he go for expedations and also do many adventure to study the nature of a particular specie and draw conclusion by observing the behaviour of differnt animal in that specie . his journey would be certainly though and it also take long time to make conclusion , if his conclusion is right and matched he is succeesful in his reaserch , but he donot stop till he will reaserch on another specie and his life go on . if he is confied to one particular reserch in his life time that would be that effective a thing go on changing and the specie can adapt to differnt environment so he had to succed further . the same is the case of a bussiness manager or a owner of a bussiness . a bussiness man is succesful in the coprate world with his product and one a lot of profit with this product , but he will not be restricted to make that particular product only he would certainly do experiment and launch new product , if the product click he is succeesful but if the product doesnt click still he would be succeesful and would try to make implication on that . another thing is succes doesnot lie in doing a routine job , everyone should experiment and do differnt thing a there is a lot in the world to still learn and we can come through them . if we are not succesful in any of the experiment we did it doesnt matter to do the experiment we get through the subject and we can then finnaly have a pool of knowledge on differnt fei
