i totally agree with the statement which state `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . according to me , to understand idea and concept are more important for a student than to learn fact . firstly , to understand the topic for example any topic related to physical science like light . we should know the basic concept to deal with it and basic idea like to think ourselves from where actually it is coming i think thats enough to understand the topic . concept should be more clear like various law of reflection and rarefraction to use them for further study not about the fact that from where it is orignated etc etc . after seeing the student prospective we should be clear with the concept first and the basic idea like for example taking the ` brain where it never been before about the topic ' . these genrated thought called a idea . generating idea are really brain storming technique which help to increase the morale of a student . similarly if a student go in search of a fact there are 9 out of 10 time he will fail . this failure will lead to lower in the morale of a student through which feeling of negativity can come in his/her mind . this will lead to build up of negative attitude which can hamper his/her future also . facts are those which we go and try to find after completing our bachelor 's or even after master . therefore , at a student age we should only learn the concept involved . one more thing i would like to add to make my assumption stronger is that when we appear in any subjective class at school/college level . what our teacher main aim or where they more stress . they stress more on concept building system then to go in search of a fact . i agree that fact are also required we should know but major focussig point should be concept and develope student to think beyond the limit . at the end in a nut shell i would like to say that concept are the one which make student more clear about the topic able to judge it properly . these concept are the major supported element in a student life which help him/her to think more , to create/generate idea , to be able to get the thing done in more fruitfull way which are basically needed academically and in professional life to .
