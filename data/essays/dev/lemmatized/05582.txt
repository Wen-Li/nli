i agree with this opinion . ofcouse there is also chance to enjoy older age however it ups to younger age which people had spended . so i wanna point out three pointsto explain why young people enjoy life more than older people do . first of all , young people have power to gain what they want or to achieve some kind of goal . in the phisical , they are so young that they can work all of the day without sleeping , sometimes . besides it , they are not too tired after working . it is one of the important thing to achieve the goal . in the mentality , they do n't feel responsibility for society or family so they can cahllenge something important or need to hard work without thinking deeply . if people become having family or need to care their palents , there is some negative factor to challenge something . second , there are opporturnities to make them change or study or grow up . there are chance to take education and study abroad or something . older people , mostly it 's palents , give younger people to have time to concentrate on themselves , in ohter word , to think about themseoves . it is most important thihg to grow up and have identification on theirselves . thirdly , younger people can have time to have comunication with many people who have different background . older people mostly have job and it is limited to opportunity to comunicate with people in the office and people . on the other hand , younger people have the cahnces to have conversation and have time together with many kind of people . they have time to go all around the world , a mntality , there is nothing for them to lose . there is only to gain . so
