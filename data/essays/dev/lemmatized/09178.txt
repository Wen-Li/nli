many people would be propose that student are understanded idea and concept more siginificant than they are learned the fact . i can hardly agree with . the student learn fact are more beneficial for them . first of all , text raraly measure a student 's social ability , a student 's ability to communicate , and a student 's ability to successiful integrate into the world . in contrast , if student are learnd fact , they can have these quality more easily . besides , if the student are going to successful in today 's society , only understand the idea and concept is not enough . they learn fact lead to them to become a successful person . for example , it is rare that one find stimulating employment that doe not requir at least a basic on computer . if student is learned the skill of computer , they will be more well-liked . last but not least , learning the fact allows the student become well-developed adluts . if the student only understand the idea and concept , they will be a mean-spirited person . in conclusion , from my perspective , learning fact is more momentous than understanding idea and concept .
