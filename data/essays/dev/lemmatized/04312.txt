in my opinion enjoyment have avery different meaning . it varies from one perspective to other . some people think that singing dancing or other entertainment is enjoyment . and others think that reading book , helping others watching the nature is their kind of enjoyment . so if we think about age group mostly younger people want to enjoy life more than the older people . whatever ma be the type of enjoyment younger people want to do it copletely without hesitation , restriction . young age is the only stage in the life where everyone full of colous , ambitious . the people feeling are just like beautiful butterfly . eventhough now a day the younger generaation baame so competitive , careeroriented , they just dont want to suppress their joy . they are sharing their happiness , sadness . they are going to disco , concert , cinema . here exactly the older genaration is opoosing the younger one . old people are usally more mature and behaves like a stioic to the sitations . they take whaeever come in their life in the same way because their experience taught them a lot in their life . one imortant reason for this variation in enjoyment is differances in the hormanal leval . a the person becomes old his hormonal influence become le evident . their enjoyment level and expression directly corresponds with it . even though some exception for this are ther but on the whole , younger people enjoyment is higher than the older people . in my house also i want to celebrete all the festival in a grand way . but my parent are always restricting me to that . though at that moment i feel bt later in my life who know that i might do the same thing ! so in my opinion in general youngster enjoy more than the old age group . the reason might be hormonal influence or attitude towards life or theeir experience or they know the value of the monet better .
