personally , i do not think that fewer car will be used in twenty year than today . probably , the author of the statement base his view on the fact that the increase of the used number of car ha been decreasing for the last 25 year . furthermore , another thesis supporting his view might be that public transport will become not only more accessible but also le expensive . the invention of a new form of transportation might a well contribute to a reducing number of car . another very important point is , that the street are overwhelmed by the number of car and simply can not provide space to even more vehicle . the last point seems to be pretty evident , especially in a country like germany . however , in country like china or in other third-world country , space is not a restricting factor . in opposite , the development of those country will even increase the demand for high-priced technology a is the car . development happens rapidly and the chance that country like india or south africa join the club of the developed country within the next twenty year is more than realistic . also the invention of a new form of transportation might not be absolutely out of space but it is nowhere in sight and it would take much longer to gain general acceptance than the given 20 year to have any impact on the number of car in use . what i definitely hope and a well believe is the fall of price for public transport and it spread over the world - even in country where it is not established yet . however , i am afraid that the car a much more comfortable choice will always attract human enough to convince people to take it . i myself used the car for my way to this toefl center instead of taking bus or train . germany again serf a a good example . while the public transport system surely is one of the best in the world , street are filled with car . this demonstrates that even the existence of a public transport system doe not have great effect on the number of car used . furthermore , outside europe , country are much more rural than here . the establishment of a public transport system is by far more expensive than the building of road . the statement that the increase in the number of car decrease is definitly true but this doe not necessarily mean the end of an increasing number of car is close . as stated before , though europe reached a peak which can hardly be increased , in other country the demand will rise during the following year and outnumber potential decrease in europe . this effect is even promoted by a rising population on the world . though in germany and in other highly developed country , the number of inhabitant decrease slightly , the total number of people still increase fastly . this will not change during the following 20 summer . conclusively , i can not see any convenient reason why the number of car might decrease during the next two decade - maybe an atomic war or a meteor - but nothing realistic to happen . though i do not appreciate the trend of more car , i am absolutely sure that it will hold on .
