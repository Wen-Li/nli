it is often believed that young people enjoy life more than old people , due to several reason , which , in my opinion , are related to the availability of time and other physical and mental resource , such a enthusiasm . i believe that this view is , in some way , incomplete , although not entirely wrong . the incompleteness of the view , is given by the fact that old people are people with experience . this mean that they can ass value to certain action on the basis of their past experience . they know what to do in order to enjoy certain positive feeling , a well a they know what to avoid . this mean that people , once they become old , have all the necessary resource in order to exploit their knowledge on themselves , and hence collect the fruit of their life a young people . in addition , although some people believe that money doe not make happiness , old people are more likely to have money to spend for themselves , making them enjoy life in more way . this would imply that you start to enjoy life only at a certain age . however , there is the opposite pont of view , which is the one of the statement . young people , or at least most of them , do not have many thing to worry about . it is up to their parent to control and administer the so called ` dirty work` , whilst they are free to grow up . this show that people , during the early stage of life , have plenty of time to dedicate to themselves , to the discovery of new thing . if it is true that old people know what thing they like and what they do n't , with the advantage of not having to experiment anymore , it is also true that youngster have the possibility of going through the process of discovering , which is probably the most interesting and fulfilling of all , a it give you the opportunity of knowing new thing and experiencing new feeling , which were previously unknown . for example , people usually remember their first kiss , rather than their last . in conclusion , i would say that life can be enjoyed at every stage , when you are young and when you are old , although in different way . the first period of life should be dedicated to discover what you like and enjoy , whilst the last should be dedicated to the exploitation of such discovery .
