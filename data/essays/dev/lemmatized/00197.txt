i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help the community . in many organization and foundation , there are a lot of young people working to help the community . a lot of school also require student to do community service . sometimes doing community service is a relax for u . we young people do want to get involve in the community . community service is required by most of the school in united states . students are required to do amount of hour whether they like it or not . by doing community service , student help in theirt community and make time for the community because they need to finish their community service requirement in order to pas the grade . some school will also give out honor to those who work over the requirement . we student will work harder and give out more hour to the community to gain those honor . even though some studnets are not willing to do the community service , they still give out a lot of time to the community because of the requirement . a lot of young people give out their time to the community to relax and get way from their school work . a lot of time student , including me , are tired of the school work and material and want relax . i found helping the community allows me to relax and not think about my work . at the same time , i 'm using my relaxing time to help my commuity and the people who need my help . it is benefitial to both my community and myself . in conclusion , young people nowadays do give enough time to help their community in many way . whether we young people do community service for the school requirement or to relax from school work , we are giving time and energy to our community and to get involve in the community .
