nowadays , there are evolving interesting discussion pertaining to whether young people do give enough time to help their community or not . in this connection , and based upon my experience a undergraduate and graduate student at the american university in cairo ( auc ) , i would state that it is my belief that young people are actually devoting enough time to develop and make life better in their small and large community . first , i would provide express example of how aucians have invested effort to support their small living community , that is auc . in this regard , it is worth noting that prior to start of the new academic year , aucians usually gather in organized group that tend to make orientation to the new freshman . usually , there are group that cover wide spectrum of service that include orientation to the auc campus including class , lab , library , and department . also , these group introduce the new student to the university catalogue and related matter such a advising , course registeration , and requirement for joining any specific major . moreover , the same group make the new student familiar with the various extra corricular activity that are available on campus . another aspect of devotion of young aucians are devoted to their small community is that they join certain group that target alumnus and other sponsor in order to provide adequate funding for many of the activity that are arranged at auc . in this way , it is evident that how the young aucians prove to be effective in serving their small community . on the other hand , and a far a aucians service for their large community are concerned , it will be essential to highlight the role of the different club at auc . auc host many club that are fully operated through young student and aim at making life better in egypt . there are many club that include , inter alia , help club , cancer club , and hand in hand club . the help club is a club that aim at providing the poor people in egypt with better living condition . this is attained via gathering donation from auc young student and using the same to buy food , clothes , home , and shelter for the poor people . furthermore , the cancer club concentrate it effort on collecting donation to support patient of cancer in their tough struggle with this severe disease . along the same line , the hand in hand club aim at visiting elder people who are hosted in various elder house . during these visit member of the hand in hand club tend to provide the said elder with their need and try to draw a smile on their face a a simple reciprocation for the sincere effort in their youth . accordingly , it go beyound doubt that the young student at auc play a vital role in serving their large community . in light of the above , and based on life example of the young student at auc , it can be concluded that young student have feel their belonging beleonging to their society . thus , they have enthusiasm and dedication to help and serve their community .
