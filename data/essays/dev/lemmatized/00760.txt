yes , i agree this statement , `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than the there are today '' . at present technology ha been improved . at same time car model are increased . in twenty year past there only two or three model of car available . but present there are some model of car and with technology car are manufacturing . there will keep the people in safe mode even if accident will appear . for example in olden day there facility to see television in the car , listen music in the car . it used only for travelling purpose . but at present by reading newspaper also we can drive car . that much ha been improved the technology . if car ha been accident there is no harm to the human being because all safety ha been arranged in the car . the old car are polluting the climate so much by leaving smoke . but the present car are using the gas instead of petro or disel . it will reduce pollution of climate . in past car this facility is not available . different car have different technology . at present population also increased at same timeusage of car also incerased . finally i conclude that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . at persent technology car have good selling in the maarket .
