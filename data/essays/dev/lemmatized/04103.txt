yes i do agree with that young people nowadays do not giving enough time to helping community . bcause nowadays young people very much intersted in enjoyment and they don n't care what is happening in their community . what is a community ? . community is group of people living place with similar custooms , and helpling each other in need . even though if you are busy with your work , study or somthing else a member of your community you need to help in the development of your community . but the present youth not helping thier community rather they are wasting thier time by spending time in internet cafe , watching movie , or romonig around the city . they could help thier community by doing some volunteer work . mainely the youth is getting distracted into unnessasory thing , like wasting tmie on browsing , chatting rubbish with somebody . what the youth thinking is enjoyment , for that they are drinking in the pub . spending the whole evening in the pub or road . rather they could do some thin in the evening or at any time when ever they are free , by participating in progarmmes which were planned for community development . in addition they don n't luistening to their parent about thier involvement in development of their community . on the whole , i can conclude one main thing is that a a part of your community youth should help their community by spending soome daily you could do some thing which id usel to your community .
