i do agree with the statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' to understand idea and concept is not very easy but once you understand , to know the fact is easy job i think . i would like to talk about based on my experience , when i wa study i used to learn fact first then try to understand idea . that wa a huge mistake for me , i thought i understood what i learnt but it wa not . i wa understood totally different way so i had to study again which take much more time . also when we had group work i wa the one who always give wrong suggestion and it wa very embarasing in fornt of my friend . so , from that point i decided to change which wa understand idea first and learn fact . it wa little hard for me at the first time but time go by it wa much easier for me to learn fact after understood idea . well not only that , after i understood idea and concept i had a lot of question to ask and opinion to suggest . also time that i spent on to understand became much more shorter so i can study other thing a well . in the class i wa the one who never ask question and suggest my opinion in class but i changed . how ? i became the one who most talkative in class because to understand what i learnt i had so many thing to ask and want to know . so i knew from that time , because i did n't understand the concept i had no question to ask and no interest to think about that topic . from my experience i do strongly agree with the statement . to do easy work or better work , to understand what is the idea and concept are the first thing to do then learn fact will be the faster way to learn from my opinion .
