presently our life is a big full-immersion into the most different kind of advertisement . no more possibility to escape . not yet . some people think that a lot of advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , others believe that advertisement are the image of a safe market . i think the most advertisement do n't tell u the truth but obviously make product seem much better than they really are , in order to enlarge their profit and be competitive on the global market . first of all , these day we can assist at the death of the local dimension of market and at the enlargment of the economic actor , therefore the key word to understand this current process is competition . in order to resist , the economic operator try to sold a much a possible making product seem much better than they really are . second , it is important underline how today the advertisement sold dream behind the product trying to convince u for example that it is enough buying a particular model of a car to find the happyness ! in conclusion i am totally agree with the statement and more , i consider this behaviour terrible and not ethic a it would be !
