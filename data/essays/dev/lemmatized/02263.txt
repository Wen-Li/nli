i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . it ha lot of advantage like u do n't need to be panicked in a foreign country , the tour guide will direct you to all worth sight seeign place and provide you the background information about the same . the comfort and security offered while travelling with a group is better than travelling on your own . . u build new friendship and see different facet of life . moreover the cost of the trip are realtively le since most of the guides/operators have tie ups with diffrent resort , transportation company etc . .. it give a better deal for the consumer . your trip is organized and any problem arising can be dealt by the guide since he is a seasoned and experienced in the trip . however , there are few disadvantage even . we may/may not get individual attention during the trip by the guide . if he ha many tourist under him . sometimes a consumer may also feel that he is not gettign a raw deal i.e. not a good deal and it expensive because the tour operator margin ( commision ) will be added to the package cost . immaterial of the disadvantage , i feel that the best way to travel is ina group led by a guide since you tend to enjoy more and any hassle realting to foreign exchange visa etc are dealt with effectivey etc . . anyways , a the saying go , `` the more the merrier ''
