i agree is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i think you have to know the source of the fact not only the answer . the how and why is important to understand the fact . i think is more important understand concept and idea for two reason : you know the source of the fact and you learn more about one topic . first , when you understand idea and concept from the beginning you are able to understand the fact better . when you only know the fact you ignore how start . for example you know that a earthquake is danger and the earth move , but if you know the concept and the idea you can take precaution and stay save , even you can move to some place where dont have earthquake . second , this help you to study and learn about one materia . you can answer how and why and this is going to give you a deep knowledge about one area . for example you know if you put the hand in the fire you going to burn . if you know the concept and the idea you know what to to after the burn . maybe you need go to the hospital or only put an antibacterial oinment . in others word know the concept an idea give you an extraordinary advantage over the student only learn fact . you know how , why and
