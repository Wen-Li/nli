`` fact '' - '' a true statement '' is the literal meaning of this word . facts are fact which can not be challenged or can never be changed . i believe that learning fact is important but more importantly it the idea and concept generated in a student mind which are helpful for a successfully learning . when a student grasp a concept clearly his able to apply his own brain and produce more impotant concept which is absolutly non - replaceable by anyother thing . i understand , knowing and learning fact is impotant but without a good understanding a student knowledge is crippled , he can not shape his own opinion and originate idea on his own . his knowledge will be fact based rather than good reasoning . its impotant that a student should devote time alone for himself for building and constructing his own idea , a when he / she step into the practical world , there one need to face lot of practical hurdle where fact might not be of any use , take an example when a student grows to become a doctor and is challenged professionaly to deal with some medical issue urgently , i dont think in that situation he can use his / her factual knowledge , because fact will only satisfy his query about the ailment maybe but the treatment would be according to the patient behavior which he ha to judge and analyse on his own . maybe the process is not same a it wa there in the text book . also a conceptual knowledge always help a student to progress and build and provide this world with new idea , it might be possible the possible source of information ha any kind of discripencies which can only be resolved when cthe concept is clear . then only a student caqn question and probably will be able to look for an answer on his own rather than waiting for someone else to provide him / her with new set of fact and figure .
