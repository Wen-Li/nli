teaching , learning , studying : it 's all a method ! during our school and college year , we have all had the chance to experience many teaching method throughout our professor . when some teacher believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept , other believe that what matter is learning the fact . during lecture , professors try to pas along a certain idea or concept to his student . undoubtedly , lecture are too theoratical and not too exciting , but remain essential . what will the student remember on the day of his exam from his lecture ? what is he supposed to remember ? i believe that part of making studying an enjoyable experience , is understanding the material we are studying . once we have understood the material , it is printed logically in our head . understanding a lesson begin with understanding the idea and concept , a they form the essence of the material . but to understand the idea and concept , especially when it come to complex idea and concept , it seems useful to start by learning the fact . learning the fact make you understand the idea and concept more easily . for example , if a student want to understand einsten 's concept of relativity , a revolutionary concept in physic , it would better to start with the fact . once the student would have understood the fact about the relativity concept , he could be more capable of understanding the concept a a whole . therefore , i believe that it is a important to understand idea and concept , a it is to learn fact : the two being linked to one another , leading to a better understanding of the material .
