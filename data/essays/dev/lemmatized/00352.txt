the development of the car is an uncertain issue . actually , people used to live without car but since it ha been created , there have been more and more car all around the world . yet , i trully believe that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year . first of all , considering all the new technology and the constant evolution of the world , i 'm convinced that the car will finally disappeared . actually , people change their mind very fastly nowadays and they will soon be bored by the car , they 'll need something new . for instance , i hope we 'll soon be able to move just by thinking about the place we want to go , it will be easier and will save energy and time . besides , even if the teleportation is n't created , it 's obvious that the car will disappear a fastly a it came . thus , a new mean of transport will be created , more powerful and more useful . furthermore , all the country are getting engaged for the reduction of toxic gas on earth and kyoto agreement is the perfect example of the world we all want to fight for . even if some country do n't really apply the rule at the moment , i 'm sure they will finally realize what the emergency is and they wo n't have any other choice than making effort . moreover , people are more and more aware that we are acting for the future and for the next generation . therefore , if we want the future human to be able to live on earth in the future , we have to stop using the car and then stop polluting . in a nutshell , even if i 'm not sure that there will be more and more pedestrian , i 'm trully convinced that car do n't belong to future but to past and that we 'll find solution to be able to move a we wish without polluting too much .
