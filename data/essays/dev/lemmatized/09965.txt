people always said that if you want to learn more about a unfamiliar city or place , just stop reading , making a trip there is a definite way to solve this problem . i do agree with this , but should we travel with a group by a tour gaide or just go there by ourselves ? i believe that the attitude that people maintained to this question will be differ . i would rether say that i 'd like to go to a new place on my own . first of all , it is hard to be denied that the goal of our travel is to feel and enjoy different culture , in most part . i would say that i am a boy who like to adventure , because that is more exciting than going with a group . the culture could be seen a a representation of a place , and also should be respected . if i get a great amount of knowledge about those culture from the tour guide , that will make me feel disappoint and those knowledge will becoming tedious and boring to me , the only way that i get to know a kind of new culture is to feel it by myself . in addition , joining a group that led by a tour guide is seems freeless , because our journey is already projected by guide and the guide can even trying to convince u to by some expensive local craft which can benefit the guide . that will make our trip unacceptable . forthermore , it is impossible that the travel with a group is cheap . if i go somewhere on my own , i will make a precise project to control my cost and i can even live in my friend 's home that beside that place i want to visit , which can not only cut down numorous money , but also let my trip have more wondeful feeling and more significant mean . as what i have mentioned above , i would rather say that i do like to travel a place on my own .
