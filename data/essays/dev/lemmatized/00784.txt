travelling play a predominent role in the life of all the middle class family . there are two major issue involved while travelling , one is by travalling along with other people initiated by a tour guide , in other word he is the person lead by a travelling agency . another issue deal with the people taking their own way to travel to a particular place . according to my view i stongly beleive in going along with a tour guide because , he know about the culture and tradition prevailing in that place , he also know about the history beyond each and every monument present in that place . as far a the place is concerned there may be dangerous place where their is prohibition for the tourist and without getting initiated by a proper guide , we may fall in to problem by entrying in to that place . the main reason in going along with a tour guide is that we can know about the place in depth i.e what are the culture and tradition of the people living in yhat place , and we can really enjoy our journey . . we can know about the culture , ritual , symbol of religion an so on . so i think it is better to go along with tour guide . another reason i want to make is about the monument present in the place . when we are moving along with our tour guide we could know about the monument . for example , when we want to visit . '' the statue of liberty at manhatan '' , we have to know the basic purpose or the history beyond statue of liberty . however , without a proper guide also we can the visit the place , but we can not know about the beauty of the place a we are missing the thesis of the place . in conclusion , the main reason for u going to a particular place is completely fulfilled if , we are accompanied by a tour guide . moreover , by going to these place we can improve our knowledge about the culture and tradition . as a result we can increase `` international cooperation amomg the people '' and this will lead to a world of peace and gratitude .
