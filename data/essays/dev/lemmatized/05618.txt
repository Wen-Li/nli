in this world full of selfish , helping the others turn to be a way of life for many people , and a great number of them are young . despite the generalized idea of the young boy drinking during all the weekend , having a many fun a he can , in my opinion , there are a pretty important number of young people that think in the others , in their community . nowadays , it is welll known that , we have a great problem , at least in spain , with the young people and their motivation in life . but , there are also , a lot of people with strong principle , who enjoy expressing themselves in strike , forum , etc . there are people who take part of different sort of non gubernamental organitations , for which they spend most of their free time . moreover , it is possible to see people cleaning the forest during the weekend , helping in the hospital , being volunteer in local campaign for the adaptation and the integration of foreign people . the non gubernamental organisations have changed the way of working in human right field , by the introducing of the figure of the volunteer . a volunteer use to be a young person who want to participate more activetly in the life of their neighbour . it is a person who care about thing like , the environment , the climate , the human right , the animal , the globalisation , summarizing , their community . the truth is that many people is concerned about how the thing are going , how everything is developing , and among them , the young peolpe . despite all the war , and destruction , the world is full of people that truly relief in a better world . i think that we are many reason to be proud of our young people , because they will be able to go , further than our generation , with all their purpose of a better world .
