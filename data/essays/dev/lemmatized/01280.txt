it need people like benjamin franklin , who wa risking his own life for the sake of science , when he used a parachute during a thunderstorm to study the characteristic of electricity , in order to enhance our technological but also philosophical understanding . there are countless example of man in history who risked there own wealth or even there life to try out a ` new thing ' in which they believed and put their faith . it is inherent to the human nature to strive for new knowledge and wisdom . but new knowlegde can only be gained by daring the step aside of the enlighted path and search in the darkness . risk ha to be accepted a a part of this search . to become successful you need to distinguish yourself from the crowd and this also mean to accept some risk . one possibilty to do so is by exploring new way and , thereby , invent something new or develop new skill . successful entrepreneur , for example , are usually recognised a risk-taking people . innovation is the result of their effort to become better and make thing better . with their success the shape our economy and our society . it is people like bill gates who changed the world we are living in today ; and he started in a small garage , working on something people at that time might have called ` crazy ' and ` useless ' . he definetely tried a ` new thing ' and that is wad made him very successful . another proof that success and risk-taking go together can be provided by the financial market . it is taking the risk which pay off . but that doe not necessarily mean that risk is uncontrollable . information can be gained and used through personal effort to ass the quality of the risk . so to become successful it is also necessary to get informed , implying that one can not only do what he know how to do well already but ha to try ` new thing ' . acknowledging this , i have to agree with the given statement .
