education is the cornerstone in our society , it 's the main path that lead a person into the large , endless world of knowledge . knowledge can be broad , a well a narrow . but which one is better to have ? to be able to answer this question properly , this topic will be divided into two part : the undergraduate and the graduate student . the undergradutate student will take a diversity of course . this will provide them with a large opportunity that allows them to choose in which field to go later on . for example , in the first two year of the pre-pharmacy degree , we used to take , for instance , cultural study course , art course , which are not related to pharmacy . and many student shifted their major after taking these course . they found themselves brilliant in other field . this diversity in course , gave them the chance to choose the major that suit them the best . imagine that the student take only major pharmacy course from the first year . this could lead to the failure of many student , because they were not given the chance to study other course . it 's a serious situation , especially in the academic major that are related to the public health and safety , such a medicine , pharmacy , engineering , etc . .. however , the graduate student do n't have this problem . they decided to go through a specific field , after taking this diversity of course , when they used to be undergraduate student . so , having a broad knowledge of many academic subject will not last forever . and it 's a complementary of the narrow knowledge .
