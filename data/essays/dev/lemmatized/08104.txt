being asked , the question , whether there would be le car in twenty year in use than today , my answer would be a strong `` no '' . firstly a raise in population and wealth can be seen all over the planet . more and more people from the asian country are able to buy a car and they do so . and this is just today . probably in twenty year peole from africa will be also able to buy car , so a greater need will be there on the market . secondly the automotive industry develops new car each year . this tendency to create nicer and fancier model from year to year probably will contiune . public resonds exited to it . just have a look at the crowded exhibition like iaa or genfer salon . people from all class come there to watch the car and they are fascinated . so in spite of not having enough money to buy a certain car , people tend to do so anyway . this is shown in statistic of car dealer , which show , that more and more car are not paid when bought , but on a monthly base afterwards . there might be some critical voice , stating , that there will be some law in future day , to cut the use of car extremly in order to protect the environment . being an engineer in the automotive industry i do not believe that might occur . teams of expert spend hour day by day to improve the car , to make them more effective and to reduce the amount of poisson , that come out of the exhaust . for being prepared for the day , when oil will become a rare good , the engineer already today think about method of building new engine , that work without oil . so to summarize my statement it can not be said , that there will be le car in twenty year than today . for reason such a general welth developement , no political restricions due to better technics and mainly because people will be just a fascinated a today by the new car , developed from the automotive industry .
