before attempting to give a definit answer to that question i would like to discus the pro and con of the group let by a tour guide . i will then conclude summarizing the different point made . first of all , let ask ourselves why do people use tour guide to travel . a possible answer to that question might be that people do not necessarily have a lot of time to visit a certain place , and therefore intend to make the most out of their time . in that case , people are shown the most popular monument and location for sightseeing by their tour guide , and visit a much a possible in a short amount of time . so i personaly think that in the case of a short trip , it is a good solution in order to see the main thing to see . however , the major drawback of this alternative appears to me to be that a you intend to make the most out of your limited time , every visit is carefully timed and scheduled . therefore , in the event that you would like to learn more about a certain monument or place , it turn out to be quite difficult a the group might be already leaving for the next visit , or you just might not have enough time ahead of you to do so . consequently , if a deep understanding of a certain place or monument is the major concern of the trip , tour appear to me not to be the best alternative , making such a wish difficult to come true . to conclude , i believe that group led by a tour guide can be both a good or le good alternative depending on the major aim of the journey . in my opinion , if the thourough understanding of a certain monument or place is the objective , then a different alternative should be taken . however , if the objective of a short journey is to go around the main sightseeing spot , then i beleive it is the alternative to adopt .
