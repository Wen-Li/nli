i strongly believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . whether the advertisement one see is through a television or a magazine , this particular individual is bound to receive some sort of effect upon the immediate exposure . this exposure can be explained in two interesting way . one is explained via visual effect and the other is through the mean of incorporating one 's psychological effect . as we all know , in order to advertise a certain product , excessive visual luring is to be expected from the viewer . the maker of these advertisement will try in every conceivable way to present their product at it finest . this is where the visual effect come in . there will be many trial and error and thorough , various step will also be required in order to complete one final advertisement before they are presented in the buyer ' eye . when that item is then advertised , the viewer will inevitably be tricked and allusioned to see beyond the actual practicality and state of that particular item . the second effect , the psychological one derives from the audience 's point of view . sometimes the product being advertised in the medium just look nice , glamorous and even useful simply because they are unattainable . at time that particular item may be too costly that it is one 's out of budget . this explains our natural human instinct to need and want what we can not have . therefore , the hope to be able to posse a certain product - perhaps in the near future or never at all - will push your desire to purchse that product even more . hence , when a buyer doe not conveniently have the item at hand while seeing the advertisement , it is only natural to make that particular item seem much better than they really are . to conclude , the reason whether they are external or internal , bring the same result to the viewer of these advertisement . they are not necessarily good or bad but the need to control one 's perception is important in deciding if that reason is valid . the viewer , the buyer must therefore reason and fight for what is real and what is not . sometime it is simply our mind that trick u into buying . this is when you realize you 've made the wrong decision .
