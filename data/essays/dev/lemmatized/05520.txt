the tour guide is very meaningful word for me. becuse i am a student from the institute of tourism . i should say that a tour guide in a group to travel is the best way . for the starter , the tour guide must be the person who live in the local place that traveling destination . so the tour guide should understand the fellow type of the habit in there . of course , the beautiful sight and people . for example , my hometown is sahnghai , there is a deeply history and revolutionary meaning city before the last century . i will take a group of traveller to some significant place , like the `` chenghuang '' temple , and the `` wai tan '' bay and so on . i can provide the variety of their life , from food to communication . by the way , i remember a story of my country , a group of traveller from a foreigner country , came the hunan --- a province of our country . they had stay there for three day , but they have nothing to guide their travel . the heavy rain wa caused a flood . after that , they had a sick , they had no medical to care them . fortunately , a tour guide from the local helped them from danger , because she could commnication with them and found some pill that made from a special plant . so that is why the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide . even it could save the life . finally , i will talk a word tour guide in acient china ---- xu xiakeng . he ever told some word `` do n't change your tour propose , but a guide will help. '' the word claim that a tour guide is so much important to a group , because everyone who want to travel have a same dream
