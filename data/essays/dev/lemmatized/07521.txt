based on my traveling experience , i would say that , indeed , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . by traveling with an experienced person , you learn from that person 's knowledge of the place , and you are able to develop a deep and intelligent opinion about what you see and experience while traveling . two year ago , i visited new york with my family , and i wa surprised by the great difference between traveling on your won or with a tour guide . while we were traveling on our own around the city , we realized that we were only wandering in the street , looking at the tall building , but not learning anything interesting about the city ; besides , without an appropiate knowledge of the city , we had a lot of problem in trying to find our hotel after we walked some street . the next day , we decided to pay a tour guide in order to learn more about the city and it most important touristic spot . with the help of the tour guide , we were able to know more about the city 's story , important place , good restaurant , and many other useful fact that we would ignore if we had continued our self-guided and ignorant traveling . traveling with a group led by a tour guide surely ha more benefit than just avoiding getting lost in the street : you learn more about the fact , the secret and the essence of the place you visit . another example i can mention to reinforce my opinion about tour guide is the trip i made with my family to china last year . as i said before , with the help of a tour guide you can develop a deep and intelligent opinion about the place you visit . when we arrived to this asian country , i had the idea that we were going to find poor people living under a communist regime ; after we traveled some time by ourselves , my opinion about this communist country did n't change . however , when we took our tour around beijing , the guide began to explain the current situation of the country from the chinese perspective . i wa surprised by the significant knowledge i acquired about the chinese culture after hearing the tour guide 's opinion of her country and the information she had regarding the situation of communist china . after learning from this new perspective , which i may not have noticed without a tour guide , i wa able to change my point of view about china , and to develop a more critical and intellectual opinion about the chinese culture and current economic , political and social situation . after traveling in new york and china in a group led by a tour guide , i reaffirmed my opinion about traveling about this kind of trip . i hold my position of complete acceptance for guided traveling . if we had not had the help of a tour guide , my family and me would never have been able to visit new york a a true new yorker or to learn from the chinese culture from a reliable and original source , an authentic chinese tour guide .
