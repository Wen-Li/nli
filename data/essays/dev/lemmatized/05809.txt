i beleive that young people enjoy life more than older people . first of all , the young have much more free time than the older people . a typical older person would spend their time at work . most of the time the older people do not enjoy going to work , but have to go anyways to make a living . on the other hand , the young do not have work and often enjoy their free time with friend or their interest . also , the physical make up of the young and the older people make a difference in the enjoyment of life . many of the young people enjoy their time playing active sport and/or game . however , the older people can not physically able to enjoy these active sport or game . the human body is constructed to become weaker and feable a they become older at a certain age . for example , there wa a young man that loved football and became a star high school football player , but thirty year later , he can not play his favorite sport anymore because of his physical fitness . even if the old man kept his physical fitness and played football , he would not fully enjoy the sport a much a he did when he wa in high school , since he doe not have his old friend to play with . another reason is that the young people have school which he/she can go to find many friend to enjoy her/his time with . on the other hand , older people have le chance to meet new friend that can give them enjoyment .
