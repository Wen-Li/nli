the issue of specialization is difficult to deal with since plenty of different view have been expressed on this subject . on the one hand , one can be tempted to think that a great variety of knowledge allow somebody to enlarge his view of certain matter . however , we can not deny that a deeper knowledge in a specific subject can sometimes be required to solve some technical problem . taking all aspect into account , i am strongly convinced that specialization doe have more advantage than broad knowledge . to begin with , specialization surely allows a better efficency in problem solving . who would ask a mathematician to read moliere while he can ask an actor ? as far a i am concerned , i am firmly convinced that each of u ha one or several special skill , that make him different from the others : one play the piano , his brother cook well and i see no reason why the pianist should learn to cook ! on the contrary , he should continue learning piano to improve this particular skill . another way to justify my point of view is to consider it under the professional aspect . in relationship marketing , one make the difference between the ` waiting time ' , which is the time the client wait before it problem is taken into account by a firm , and the ` solving time ' which is the time needed to solve this particular problem . by choosing specialist , the firm considerably reduces it ` solving time ' . furthermore , the more different these specialist are , the shorter the ` waiting time ' will become , since a great variety of problem will be thus quickly taken into account . lastly , specialization may require from a firm to have a good internal organization . indeed , without such an efficient organization , special skill of each employee may not be used a well a it should be . however , if a firm doe settle down such an organization , and doe prefer hiring specialized worker , it efficiency will surely improve . to conclude , my strong belief is that specialization is a key answer to some persistent economical and political problem . a major stake will thus be to accept the fact that one could not do everything perferctly . afterall , billy wilder wa probably right when he wrote that ` nobody is perfect ' !
