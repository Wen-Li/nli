i agree with the statement that product seem to be much better than they really are , because of the advertisement which is used . the marketing department of every company try to make successful advertisement , so that they sell more of these product . their aim is to influence the consumer to buy the article or product . because of this , they are using different thing for different product to catch the potential user : the marketing department us kid and a happy family to make an advertisement for an family car , so that the husband of the family hopefully think : `` that 's the perfect car for our family . i will buy this one next week . '' you can see advertisement like this everywhere : during the break in a movie or between tv-shows there are always spot with the aim to buy the product . another example for that could be an advertisement for washing machine : `` it 's the cheapest washing machine of the world , you will save a lot of money buying this one ! '' but on the other side it is probably not an economy product , so that the consumer have to pay a lot for water and electricity , because of the bad technology . the manager try with this strategy that the article look like the best . they want to sell more than the other company . that 's why the consumer need to decide by their one which product is the best for them . the best way to realize it , is not listen or watch to too much advertisement . in the most way it is better look behind the advertisement , that mean you need to look what can i realy do with it . the consumer need to make a comparison between some product - which one ha the best property or is the most economiesly and not which one look like the best in the advertisement .
