i agress that it is more important for student to understand idras and concept than itis for them to learn fact . first , if student can understand idea and concept , they will utilize them . understanding them make student more better . for example , student understanding them can make thier opinion useful . in addition to , understanding idea and concept is more eassier than learning fact . because , if student were able to understand them , maybe , they can not forget them . but learning is not . secondly , to larn fact is difficult . for example , if student try to remember fact , they might spend more time than understanding the idea and concept . we should save our life 's time . if student learn fact , they might forget them . this is poor activies . third , learning fact is not cheeper than understanding idea and concept . if we try to learn fact we pay the fee . and if we choose to understand idea and concept , we can understand alone . for example we can read book . reading book is useful in understanding idea and concept . learning fact is unuseful way to gain knowleges . we should gain knowleges . so , we can get a job . getting job is very difficult . the world economic is unclearly because of high oil price , weaken dolloar and so on . therefore , possibly , i recommend understanding idea and concept . if i could back to the past , i would understand idea and concept . i never could learn fact . because i do not have little time . time is money . remember my word . so your child will be happy .
