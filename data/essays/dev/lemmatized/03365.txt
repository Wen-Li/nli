i disagree with this statement . there are some disadvantage for having a trip in a group i think . first it is quite difficult for in a group to decide the best destination everyone feel satisfied with . second during a trip in a group , we can not have a trip in the way we each like . i think such a trip is far from enjoyment and relax . we need to think well about the true purpose of trip . travering definitely is not getting stress . in a group we can not help but feel certain stress . it is better for u not to have a trip if it applies to u . on the other hand , having a trip by myself i think i can make my trip meaningful , free from stress and of course fun . there are some reason for this . first i can go to the destination which i think i want to visit . second , i do not have to care about other people . in such a situation i can enjoy seeing sight for much time which i thought would like to more . that is why i think the best way yo enjyo a trip is to do it by myself .
