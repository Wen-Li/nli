personally i do n't agree with the given statement and i think that if you do what you know and do that well you can be a successful a a risky person . todays people are most likely more risky and like to be challengend but this is why they can easily fail . for instance i had a friend who had a very good job a a banker . he had a good position and earned enough money but he wanted to make more out of his life . he started studying again in another field and had to give up all the little luxury he wa used too ( like his car , old apartment etc . ) unfortunately that wa five year ago and his `` risk '' did n't work out that well . the normal study time would have been four year but during the time he figured out that this field seems not to be the right thing . he developed bad grade and ha to retake class plus when he finally finish his study it might be very hard for him to get a good job because the demand in his field went drastically down . if he would stayed in his old job he could have been the director by now . another reason for disagreeing with this statement is that i think you should treat all people equal and not judge their success based on the way how they got to a certain point . for example if it come to a job offer and there are two people who applied for it i think that the person who worked for year at the same place and ha a lot of experience in that specific area might be more successfull than any other person . but i found it very surprising that people oversee those people and are more interested in hiring somebody who ha a way more interesting past and took some risk to get there . on the other side taking a risk might open you new door that you could n't have had imagined before . given those reason and the choice beween trying new thing and taking risk or sticking to familiar behavior i personally think that you can be very successfull either way .
