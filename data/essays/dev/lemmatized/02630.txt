in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subejcts by number of reason . first , to know about many kind of thing be great influence for the future . when you get job , you will not do same kind of work for whole life . my father is priest and keep a kindergarden . he knoews about child because his major wa teaching in his college . after he left grduated the college , he went to another college and studyed about religion . he talk to so many people and ha good activity and hobby . second , you will be able to make good relationship with other people . there are so many people around you and everyone is different and have defferent interest . if you have only limited knowledge and if a conversation is not about the subject you know , the conversation may be boring for each other . finally , if you specialize in one specific subject , you will know about the subject very well . but so many thing will be limited such a job , relationship . i think it is not interesting to live .
