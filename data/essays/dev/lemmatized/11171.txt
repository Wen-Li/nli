i disagree with the idea that young people do not enough time to helping their community for the following reason , first , young people have a lot of concern about receiveing others respect through contibuting to their comumnities . for example , some tokyo universtiy student who live near my city nowadays began to clean the river-side . they ususlly come to rive-side to bring up trash , can desposed on it . as the result , the river became vey clean . then the people in the area appreicated to them very much . and they are proud of the activity . this show that young people want to receive respect of others by helping community . second , the rise of concern for environment help young people contribute to their commuities . they have had more chance to learn environmental issue . as the result , young peolpe have more concern to environment surronding them . for example , when i wa a freshman in kyoto university in japan , there wa a lot of lecture about an environment . the universty student often join event conducted by the near-by city for preserving the environment . thus , i strongly believe that young people contribute to their commnity . therefore , i am strongly against hte idea that young people do not give enough time to hepling their community .
