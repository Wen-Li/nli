nowadays , due to the fact that life time is becoming longer for all human being , everyone can enjoy life in each moment . however , i do think that young people are still more welling to afford life in a more enjoyable manner than older people do . so , i do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than younger people do . in my essay , i will provide some resons that make my agreeing with that statement . the first reson why young people are able to enjoy life more that older peole are , is that , a they are young , they have a lot of experinces to do , young peolple may wish to experince emotion that they have never tried before because of their age . they might like to have a family , and so they try al they can to find a good partner , enjoying any occasion they will have inorder to reach taht aim . moreover , they wold like to experince work . they wold like to enjoy the job that they eventually find and they will try to apprecite all the aspect of them , a they rapresent their first experince in the labour market . younger people might enjoy life more than the ealderlies , because , a they are young , they have more energy to afford life itself . on the contrary of old people , young people enjoy sport , such a fotball , or basketball , which are an essentail part of life , and which request a lot of energy that older people , in general doe not have . furthermore , thanks to the energy that young people have because of thei age , they have more opportunity than older peole to make fanny and relaxing thing , suchs a trip or party , which are so helpful in order to enjoy life . to coclude , i do think that young people enjoy life more than old people do , because of the experinces they wolu like to try in their future , and because of the energy they allowed them to exploit the most enjoiable aspect of life . job
