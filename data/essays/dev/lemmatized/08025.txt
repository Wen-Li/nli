imagne one situation : you are sleeping well on your warm bed and you are dreaming kissing someone you admired , however all the romantic stopped by a sequence of loud knocking to tell you wake up and go for a trip . what is your response ? terrible , please send to me the hell ! on my point of view , i think it is rediculous to travel in a group led by a tour guide . the situation is one of the problem . i am a lazy guy and i really want to have appointment with my lover in my dream , however , you disturb it and ask me to go travelling ! the member of a group are diver , a a consequnce , it is hard to set a time good for everyone . when the tour guide waked the member up , perhraps some guy felt unwilling to get up to go . this will not only make the group tired and also make them unhappy . the situation is not the only problem . if we are forming a group , that mean we can not go separetly . we are just like small child following our teather ( tour guide ) to travel . it is inconvinent for the group member and may lose some beauty . just think i found somewhere really beautiful but the tour guide said they are not in the plan ! how can i do ? can i jump out of the group ? no . those two situation almost drive the group member crazy , but the worst is still to come ! the tour guide become the dominant of the group . how bad ? bloody bad . without that guy , we can do nothing but sleeping and waiting . that mean if the tour guide want u to go some place that we do not intereting , we should go because our `` king '' ask u to go ! all of group member must listen to the tour guide or they will be cast away . all the thing happened on the way of the travelling is suffer for all of the group member . what i learn from the just referred situation that drive the poor group member crazy is that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way to travel .
