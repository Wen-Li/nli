there are many advanges in any field of knowledge . they have some connection with each other . if student only learn one specific area that will be misunderstood some part of academic subject . in my opinion , i agree with people are better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . some academic subject need student know the others subject first . otherwise , they could not totally understnad it meaning or how to figure out the answer . for example , student have to know mathemtic class first and then they can use it on the accounting class . on the other hand , if people have broad knowledge , they can understnad the newspaper what they talk . they also can join any kind of topic to share their opinion . if people only concentre on their area that will be lost many chance to know new friend . people specialize in one area that 's good for their career in the future because they can deeply understnad their professionl knowledge . as the matter fact , after graduation , people can gain more specific knowledge when they work . it would be better than learn specific knowlege in school so they do n't need to focus on it . if student learn specific subject in university , they will lost oppontunity to gain more than others area .
