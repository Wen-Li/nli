nowadays , young people do not give enough time to helping their community . i agree with that statement and i think that there are several reason for that . first , condition of life ha changed , everything is going faster now , people do not have much free time , they time is separated between their study , their part time job , sport , and some social activity so after all this they do not have much time left to do something else . second , people now are no longer attached one to another a they used to be , it just like if they use the mean of friendship and communication directly with others . so a a result , if they not communicate well they will not be able to help their community a a group . finally , before in a neighbourhood eveybody know everybody because there wa not much people , but now it getting crowded and they may not know who is their second neighbour . so how would they meet and try to help their community if they do not even know each other . to sum up , i think that people should well organize their schedule and find some time to help their community because after all that is where they live .
