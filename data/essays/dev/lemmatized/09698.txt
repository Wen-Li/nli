to my mind , it is not possible to generally say whether young or old people enjoy life more ; i think one can enjoy life at any age , it depends on the age in which way one enjoys it . being young a well a being old have both negative and positive aspect . of course younger people have the great advantage of being physically more able than older people , this way they have more possibility to enjoy life by playing sport . but usually , they do not have much time to realize that since they are busy with school or job . older people , when they are already retired , have a lot of time to do all those thing they have not had time for yet , for example reading literature or even begin studying , a for example an old teacher of mine who started studying philosophy after he left school . because of their many experience , it is also easier for old people to deal with problem while young people are often discouraged and feel insecure about the future . old people already lived through many thing , they do not have to worry about finding a job or a partner any more . while young people often have problem with their family , old people already have their own and can spend nice time with them . the greatest problem of being old are certainly the many illness . it is much more dangerous for old people to walk outside if it is cold , they might get pneumonia while young people remain healthy and could slip on the ice and brake a leg while their grandchild are able to fall without hurting themselves . in addition , it is very sad to be old when one 's friend , or one 's partner , become older , too , and die one by one . my grandfather became 93 year old and had not had friend for the last ten year of his life , which seems incredible to me . finally , a young person still ha all his life before him ; an old one expects the death to come soon . both can be positive or negative , it depends on the specific person 's situation . on the whole , i think it is possible to enjoy one 's life at any age , it just matter what one make out of it .
