i strongly agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time for helping their community . on of the reason is that they do not have time to spend time on those thing . they must spend most of their time on studying in order to get good grade and go to well-known university . also young people nowadays are not good at comunicating with others and are hestate to meet new people . it occures a people no longer talk with neibour a much a we did before . there is one example in my community . there wa an opportunity visiting a house , which were for eldery people to live , in the community . it wa an opportunity only for child but there were only two people attended . the reason why rest did n't come wa that they were afraid to meet and talk with new people . the other reason is that young people nowadays are not intrested in helping community . school doe not teach how important it is to help the community and join the activity , they only teach thing that the student need for exam . adult should encourage young people to give more time on helping community .
