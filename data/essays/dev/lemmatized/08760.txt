today , i am going to talk about my opinion on the topic which is most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i agree with the topic . i have a experience that i bought a bag through the internet . when i saw the bag though the internet , i wa eagering to have that big bag right away . so , i bought that bag with the credit card . when i recieve the bag , i wa disappoint to the bag which is not a big a the photo . then i swore not to buy any bag through the internet anymore . my parent had bought a masage machine through the television . they said that it seems to be very comfortable and would make them feel relax . so , they determined to buy that . but they felt that machine is not a comfortable a they thought . they said the person who use it to masage seems really satisfied . how come they did not have the same feeling a that person ? my older brother had bought through the internet , too . he bought a t-shirt which size is xl and have a really cool design on it . but when he received that t-shirt , he have difficulty to wear it on . so , i agree with this statement .
