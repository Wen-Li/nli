enjoyment is a part of the human life and all human want to enjoy at their own pace some by going to tour , by having party , going for drive , etc . i agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than the older people do '' . as the title suggests young and old , we can say that young will have more capability and ability than old to enjoy the life . there are many factor for that like improvement in technology , considering the age factor , stress factor etc . as there is improvement in the technology day-by-day , there are new thing for enjoyment like going for drive , spending their liesure time with friend in pub and resturants , many amusement park which give recreation from their daily workload , etc . normally older people can not make their way to the above mentioned place bacause it may be because of their age , health and some may not knew also who stay in remote area about these kind of place and what mostly older people want is to spend their life peacefully-free from all the tension and most of them will spend at their home itself with their grand child and by some other mean . most of the young people will enjoy more compared to older people because of stress also . it is also one of the factor bacause they have to work all the time from morning to evening with full stress and to overcome that stress , there should be some mean of enjoyment which were not available at the time of their older one . moreover a they were young , they are energetic and they have the ability to roam around the place with complete enthusiasum . consider an example of a 20 year old boy and his grand father . the boy have many way and opportunity to enjoy his life a he is energetic firstly and there are many way for his enjoyment a there is improvement in the technology where a his grand father can not enjoy a the boy doe because he is older and his age may not be cooperatative with that . it may be also that he may not be familiar with new kind of enjoyment which were brought by technology . as there is more improvement in the technology , there are many way to enjoy a mentioned in the above paragraph and surely our next generation will enjoy more than what we are enjoying now a there will be improvement in the technology in the coming year and they will have better opportunity morethan what we have . ofcourse there are some way for the older people also to enjoy but their health condition may not support for that . so i strongly support the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do by considering certain factor and example which were mentioned in the above paragraph .
