i agree with the fact that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , but the fact is that people is afected when is not aware of this . also i understand that although there is some regulation obout this topic the mean to make it work are not a hard a they should . is truth that marketing us strategy like give misinformation about a product or try to convice u that their product is what we need to solve our problem or just to make u happy . but it could be a real problem like in a medical example , some vitamin suplements are announce to be all we need if we feel tired or weak , but the people who make the publicity do not care or inform consummers about the risk of do not go toa medical check when these synthoms are present . also there are docummentated case of people who stop taking their medication or cutted their medical treatment because of using a new product seen on tv . another example could be the resistance of a ladder or a new kind tool , because the client could be expecting that this tool or appliance ha a certain lasting , when the real thing is that it is going to break even putting in danger his life . as a final conclution or a personal peace of advice . i think that even though company have the necesitty to increase their profit they also should have a social conscience . that is to say be more concerned about the responsability of lie or misinformate about the feature of a product . and this doe not mean that the client should leave everything in the hand of the enterpices , but be more concerned about the posibility of being buying something which is not what he is expecting .
