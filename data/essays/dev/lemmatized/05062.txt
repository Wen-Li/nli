young people nowadays often live in a society where education and work becomes a more and more difficult task due to high competition . today 's young people also live in a modern world with much more accessible distraction than before . on the one hand , i think the society we live in ha become highly competitive in all aspect . since good education is becoming more and more accessible , university , company now require an even higher level of education . in my opinion , that is why some people now work harder than before . on the other hand , the invention of computer , video game , and all the other different accesories made the young people of today much busier . these reason are why i agree with this statement in most case . i think that young people nowadays simply do n't have the time to help their community . i also think that these young people are not to blame , modern society is . if i talk about my personal experience , i can say that i do not give enough time to helping my community . one of the reason why i do n't is because nobody encourages me to do it . people around me are becoming le and le aware of the problem in their community and are becoming more selfish . i think it is also important to say that it is not 100 % true that all young people do not give enough time to helping their community . i think it applies more to rich and weathy country . in the third world country , i think people are more aware of poverty and a a result are le distracted by all the new technology .
