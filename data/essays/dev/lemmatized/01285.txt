the reason of success are multiple . on one hand , many people think that to be successful we need to find new solution , anticipate new trend and by the way take risk . on the other hand , people tend to think that experience prevails and that the best way to succeed is to focus on and master what you are already able to do . in my opinion , success is directly linked to the risk you are able to take . in the business world , one of the most usual word to explain the success of a company is `` innovation '' . nowadays , client or shareholder are attrated by company which take risk by offering really new product . the world is moving and changing , the company which will survive is the company which is able to aniticipate new social or economic trend . for example , easyjet is very successful because this firm understood and analysed the trend of `` low-cost '' before anyone else . it wa risky compared to the traditional and expensive offer . but finally , easyjet or ryanair are the most popular . indeed , it is quite important to focus on one speciality to be the best in what we do . nonetheless , people who give the priority to experience are more static in their way of thinking , and have a weak ability of adaptation toward a changing environment . people who take risk , for example in an artistical activity , will be awarded because they go against a kind of conformism . this is exactly what we are looking for , in globalised economy . to be successful , we need to be `` different '' , and take risk for that . to conclude , exploring new field brings new idea of business . risks are the basis of success . simply , we can say that `` who dare , win '' , and even if your objective is not to succeed , risk are important in life because they spice up our daily life .
