taking risk is the only way to improve our knowledge and to succeed in life . keeping this in view i would like to agree with the statement that successful people try newer thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . this may include many aspect like inventing many thing , knowing other side of coin or the other solution of problem . firstly , take the point of inventing new thing the inventor who would discover a new thing couldn , t either know whats the result is going to be it a saught of risk that is taken by them . but what if they are suceeded inventing that then there will add some more glory to them instead of just sitting quite simply because they already have done well and fearing about the risk they ha to take . after all , failures are stepping stones to succcess '' .they may learn a new thing by failure which will be definitely useful again . secondly , take the point of finding other solution to the existing problem . if the indian president a.p.j.abdul kalam could not have risked the launch of rocket into space people could not knoe the information of what actually hapens in other planet or the interesting point about space that we know now . thogh it wa a failure for the fiorst time he did not stop there and followed the saying `` try and try until you succeed '' which broght him graet fame . thirdly , consider the case of invention of many metal by scientist which is invented by the experiment which risked their life itself . but those people are more successful in life because they had the fame and importance even after their period . these people did not do what they already know how to do well . infact , they risked their life for the discovery they have done . finally , i conclude by saying that each and every individual should always risk on doing new thing which will definitely yield better result .
