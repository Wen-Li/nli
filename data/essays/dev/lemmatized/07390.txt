although the basic concept of advertising is itself to promote a product or a service , i do agree with the statement that most advertisements make product seem much better than they actually are . advertising for product is essentially the process used to convince potential buyer that the product in question is fit and suitable and the best in the market . however most advertisement blow this definition completely out of propotion by marketing a product which end up being radically different when finally used . the degree of exaggeration used in advertisement to convince the buyer is at time ridiculous . advertisements in the fast moving consumer good domain especially strictly adhere to the policy of displaying a completely wrong image of the product which make them seem much better than they actually are . an example that come to mind is a commercial for a leading shampoo product which claim to not only put hair back on the head of of it balding user but also rejuvenate them to the extent that they will be able to compete with the best driver in the world on a formula one car racing track . advertisements in various other sector also mislead user to believe that the product will offer quality that it wa never designed to provide in the first place . although one of the selling point of a good advertisement is in some case to provide a tinge of humor to go with the product , certain advertisement and brand use this to the extent that make their product seem too good to be true . various mail order catalog for exercising system are also another a clear example of how the end product differs vastly from the advertised one especially in today 's wolrd where common opinion ha it that medium over power print , people look to advertisement especially on television , to help them make informed choice about which product suit their need better . this dependency may not be large when it come to everyday product , but in case of product which are highly expensive and involve large investment , some advertisement can often mislead people 's desicions . an example to illustrate this are the advertisement for real estate project or finance and tax saving instrument and more recently even in job searching portal . some of the advertisement have caused people to make incorrect decision due to their assured but unrealistic claim . all in all , my belief is that advertisement should help people make informed choice and should make people aware of the product . a certain degree of humor and make believe is alright but the core functionality of the product itself should not be made a fantasy a is the case with many of the advertisement in today world . i therefore ardently agree with the fact that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
