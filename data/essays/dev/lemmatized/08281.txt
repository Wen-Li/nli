i think it is very much essential for a student to understand the idea and concept rather than learning the fact . these day the technology ha developed , new thing are been invented this is only because of the main reason that is logical thinking about some thing . the invention of the telephone doe not made graham bell ( who invented telephone ) to refering for the fact . instead , he thought it logically and implemented physical experiment by using concept . as we look at many of the scientist of the early age they donot think much about the fact , rather they understood the idea about how to implement it . so it is better for a student to study different concept and implement his idea . let u consider another example . if the student do think only about the fact they only bother about few thing like only oil , petrol , kerosine and white petrole are the combustion fuel , and automotives can not run without petrol or diesel . if that is the case , sastry who wa a student would not have discovered the fuel for the automobies . he extracted some solution by using a plant 's leaf and mixed that with some chemical and finally used a a fuel for automobile . this is mainly depends on lot of understanding about the concept and keeping a hard effort to implement his idea . this idea would be great benificial for the society . and coming to the secondary of the topic which deal with the learning of fact . it is useful to some extent for the student . this is because when we deal about the solar system , and a student is being asked about what is the shape of the earth , or how many planet are there in the solar system ? then the student may refer to the fact rather than experimenting on that .
