i do not agree with this statement . in my opinion it is not possible to do such a statement and to make clear what i mean , i 'm going to explain my point of view with some example . befor i started studying medicin i worked a a rettungsassistentin . i met a few pepole , old and young one and i often had the time to talk with them for a while . everyone had his own live-story and many of them really liked to tell me about their position to live and their experience . now i would like to describe two really sicnificant conversation i had . the first conversation i had wa with an older woman . she wa about 80 year old and lived in a pension for old . she wa very sick but always with a smile on her month . we met a several time and we always talk a lot . she told me great story about her and her husband karl who died 2 year ago . all the time she felt absolutely fine with herself and the world around and that ' s why i asked her one day what her miracle is like . she laught and answered me > young lady , do not belief that i do not know how crule life can be , i have seen it . but this is the reason why i am so lucky . i thank good for what i have and i enjoy everyday in my life . it is a question of position . > the other situation i would like to describe wa with a girl in my age . she wanted to kill herself becaus her boyfriend left her two day ago and she thougt life would be over know . for her there were no more sense in life . i think this statement made at the beginning is not right . it is important to look individually at everyone ! it is a question of view !
