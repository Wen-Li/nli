in order to compare the life of young people and older one , it seems necessay to start off with a brief description of that average young and the average older person . young people enjoy themselves in activity such a meeting friend , going out , doing sport or listening to music . on one hand , these activity are fun and help a young person to relax after an exhausting day at school or work . but on the other hand all these activity can not be enjoyed without a certain amount of money . because of that , young people can easily get into a rush of working real hard , maybe even having a job while studying at a high school or university , and spending the money in the evening and on their weekend . they keep switching directly from the status of making money into spending it and forget to just settle down for a moment and simply sit down and read a book or something like that . sometimes young people even start working almost nonstop so that they can just stop most of their work and have fun later in life , which is the worst of all case . older people are usually the opposite . most of the retired people enjoy a slow day without getting in rush or being stressed . they have no fear of sticking to everyday habit , which provides a basis for a settled and enjoyable life . they do n't feel like they miss out on thing when they go to bed early every once in a while which is a problem a lot of young people share . if people try to compare these two different type of enjoying life , a basic problem show up immediately . if someone put a older person into a young person position , he or she would think it unbelievably stressful . on the other hand , the young person would probably call the older person life enitrely boring . the only difference is that most of the young people enjoy their life at a way higher risk of becoming stressed and getting in a rush with thing . so after all , a young person doe n't enjoy life more than an older person doe , both enjoy life just in totally different way . still one should not forget the fact that we are discussing stereotype here ; there might still be a lot of people at all age that do n't enjoy their life .
