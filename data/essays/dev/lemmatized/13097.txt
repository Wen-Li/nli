i agree with this idea because of 4 reason on it . color , size , word , and the feeling of people . the first one is the color impression . in fact , i am eaasily faked by this strategy . for example , most advertisement , of course , have it specifis characteristic . but my brain always get in color . my composition of the brain is , at first , color , and then , the personality . even if the ability is bad , i often buy the product . the second one is size . in the bill , we can not know the size of the product . this sometimes happens in case that buying something big or large ( refrigerator , car ) . on the internet shopping , it is cheaper than usual shopping , however , this kind of shock can be easily occured . the third one is word . words make our heart dramatically change . take an example . the cloth is 100 left in vintage shop . 50 clothes sell 1 or 2 for a day . the owner is confused . one day , he made a poster that written : the clothes are left only 50 !! this made meaningful effect that the product are sold out for only 1day . like this instance , word are very significant in the advertisement activity . the last one is feeling of people ( personality ) . on the tv commercial , various famous person advertise many product . in fact , the profit can become high and low by the person who is acting the cm .
