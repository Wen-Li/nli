advertisements are usually a particular kind of product developed form many people working together , each one with a different role and each one with different skill . those people are paied from company and they have a great interest in improving company ' profit just because if they don-t they risk to loose their job . i think this is enough for showing how advertisement present product in better way then the one tey really are . first when a company decide to spend money in advertisement it ' s usually waiting a reward from that . an advertisement campaign is costly . for this reason they expects more people will buy the product in order to achieve an higher profict . this is why people who produce advertise ha to attract more buyer that their competitor and so will try to present their product a the best product people can desire to buy . they must convince people if they buy that they are doing the right chooise . second people who are payed to produce advertisement have a lot of different skill , they usually know a lot about marketing and they know who they are going to refear to sell the product . for example some day ago i wa in the library and i wa really surprised when some boy and girl near me began to talk about a marketing research project they were developing . they did n't care at all about the quality of the product , they care just about how to sell it . they tried to find the best way of convincing people and did n't care at all about beeing honest in the way they had to do that . moreover i can surely add some personal experience . for example , i 've got an eleven year hold sister always asking my mom for many product she see in advertisement . sometimes my mother buy her the product she want and even if she spends a lot of money doing that often they are not hight quality product . i noticed this can happend easily for product they sell to kid or teen-agers just because this public usually care le about quality and more of how the product itself appears . in conclusion my opinion is that advertisement is often a way of earning more proficts for company or a way of creating a brand name . the market itself is cometitive . how can they reveal the weakness of their product ?
