personally , i think that this statement is a perfect reflect of what i think and do , i have always thought that you have to understand everything that you are taught . this is a very controversial topic , but i think i have a clear panorama of what i think . the first reason for which i incline to this decision is for the fact that learning fact do n't give you an internal satistaction of a certain topic . there is a famous quote stated by ignatius of loyola s.j. which is : `` the knowing doe n't satisfies the soul , but the interpretation and likeness of the thing internally doe '' . this is a very reflexive quote , because when you learn a fact you do n't adquire it 's concept completely , you have like an empty space . for example in philosophy , you can know the point of view from every philosopher , but if you do n't understand them , you could never know what they really meant . the second reason is that human brain tends to forget easily thing learned but not interpretated . for example , the thing that you learned in 9th grade , sometimes you forget them when you are in 10th or 11th , because you do n't really get the concept completely . on the other hand , if you learn something and you understand it well , you will remember it for ever , or if you forget it , with a little thinking you will remember it and could use it right for other aspect in your cotidian life . finally , i would like to say that people who always memorize fact and do n't understand them completely , usually have le resource for having success in life , because of their lack of understanding and interpretation in essential manner . however , people who really understands all the thing that they are taught , usually develop an ability to solve problem faster , or be more original in their thinking .
