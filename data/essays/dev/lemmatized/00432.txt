i mainly agree with the statement that people enjoy life more when they are young than when they get older . but some detail need to be analysed to proove this idea . the first point is related to brithday anniversary . it is common that child and teenager are often very happy when they get one year older . this is often related to present , party , and lot of friend wishing a happy birthday . but old people , are very often sad and ashamed of getting older , and they anniversary remind them of those feeling . the way people enjoy life depends on their age . it is different if we consider child , or teenager , or adult . children seem to be happy very often . they can enjoy any little trick during hour and keep smiling and laughing without any relevant reason . children do not have to worry about important thing , indeed , they even do not know about them thanks to their parent that try to keep them apart of any trouble . the way of enjoying life change a the child become teenager . the main reason of teenager enjoying life is freedom . even this often go along with little fight with their parent , teenager have the will to create their freedom by prooving that they can be independant . as they feel free , teenager have new hobby , sometimes forbidden , but they enjoy the risk they take . in opposition with the happyness of child and teenager , adult can not enjoy life a easily . being an adult mean having reponsabilities . adults have to work to earn money and have lot of bond which keep them out or entertaining and enjoying life . moreover , when adult have child , they manage to offer their child the happiest life they can . so they do not hesitate to sacrifice their own happyness to the benefit of their family . but even if that is difficult , parent enjoy every little moment of happyness they can share with their child .
