a lot of people always ask : `` would be better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjets than to specialize in one specific subject '' , and i always base my answer in my personal opinion to answer yes . i answer with a yes because if i have knowledge in many academemic subject , i will have more option to find a job . i say is important to have knowledge in many subjetcs because the live in every country is different . the life is like fill with stone where you need to be prepare to move to do not fall . i am a high school student hopping to get accepted in a university . i want to major in physic . i do not know if i will be able to find a job when i finish college , but i am sure the most i know , the more opportunity i will have to find a job . in the life is necessary to know a little bit of anything . this is simple . i am from ecuador , and in my country the life is very difficult . if i have knowledge in a specific subjet , i am no going to have any money to live like a normal person , this mean , i can not pay for my food , i can not pay a place to live , and i can not pay my study . the life ha stone . if i am invited to a important phisics meeting , i would know i am going to participate in the meeting , but what will happen if somebody ask me something different than physic , and i do not have an answer . i will be remember that pour situation for year and i do not want that . finally , if for any reason that happen , that would encourage me to study more and more .
