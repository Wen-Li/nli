i read , i forget . i learn , i still forget . i understand , i remember . this translation of a chinese proverb say it all . a strong and sturdy base is mandatory for every building to stand tall . an understanding of thing is like a base to a human being in the building of his life . it is obviously more important to understand thing that it is to learn fact about them . it is this understanding of a particular topic or a phenomenon which encourages an individual to analyse thing occuring around him or her . this can be clarified better a we take a look at the following example : for instance , we consider the example of an electrical engineer . he ha learnt from the book fact about domestic power supply . but he ha not understood how the process of delivering power is taking place . in case of an emergency , if he is required to tackle some power problem , he would n't be able to repair it , or trying to troubleshoot it might even prove fatal to him , if he doe not have an understanding of the fundamental . considering the example of swimming would not be difficult . if a person ha learnt the archimedes ' principle of buoyancy , it obviously would not help him swim . but it would only be possible if a person understands how to swim under proper guidance . all the research expert and scientist around the globe are responsible for new innovation not because they have mugged up fact and figure relating to their area , but because they have created their own fact and law using their understanding of the subject . considering the above example and illustration it can be very well said that - it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . for only this would bring them up a better individual and better thinker who would help in development of their country
