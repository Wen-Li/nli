i completely agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . our modern world is full of such example where people took risk and created new thing . upto a large extent , our modern age is made by these people . i will classify these activity in mainly two way . first , where people just change the way in which we do thing . for example , take the music industry . few year back , music industry wa dominated by the walkman from sony . if you wanted to hear music then you need to buy a walkman and cassette . sony thought that this wa the best way but steve jobs from apple had different idea . he created i-pod where you can download your music in flash memory . this wa more efficient and one can download large amount of music that wa not possible with walkmans . this made steve jobs famous but sony lost a market because sony executive were just making more efficient walkmans . they never tried to try a new thing . second , where people leapfrog the current way of doing thing and create a totally different solution of the problem . for example , take the postal service . earlier , if you want to send a letter to your loved one then you have to write that in paper and send it by mail . it used to take time and process wa in-efficient . few people thought about the electronic transmission of information and internet wa born . now , sending a letter to someone is a click away by e-mail . e-mail is much efficient and much faster . some people will not agree with the statement and they will say that trying new thing is risky so we should not try new thing . i would like to tell them that if our ancestor would have thought in the same way then we would have been living in stone world today . i agree that once you try new thing then you might fail , but , learning lesson from failure and trying again make some one successful .
