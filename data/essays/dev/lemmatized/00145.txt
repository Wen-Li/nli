i would disagree with the given statement i.e. `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . i strongly feel that the best way to travel would be alone or with a bunch of people sharing similar interest . the reason for this would be for the simple fact that the tour guide would take you to a set of place which is the city is famous for and these place might not necessarily interest me in particular . i would like to cite a simple example . last year for the new year i had to gone to goa ( which happens to be a major tourist destination in india ) . goa is known for a lot of thing . great beach , brilliant churches ( goa wa under the portugese control for over 200 year , so lot of european influence in the architechture ) and a pretty rocking night life . i and my friend decided against having a tour guide a `` goan music '' , in other word `` psy trance '' , interest u more than the church or the beautiful beach out there . the tour guide would have charged u a bomb for showing the church , talking a bit about the local culture and walking u down the beach ! we went to goa for the simple fact that it happens to be the hub for some great electronic music and since every one in my group wa inclined to the same objective , all of u started exploring the city all by ourselves ! we bought some local map , hired a couple of bike , bugged people for direction and it all added to the experience ! i wouldnt have enjoyed it to this extent had i gone for a tour operator . guides are only out there to make money and in today world , guide arent a neccessity while going on a trip because you have enough information available in the form of book , internet etc . so i would strongly recommend to go alone and do away with a tour guide just beacuase it would add to the whole expereince of travel .
