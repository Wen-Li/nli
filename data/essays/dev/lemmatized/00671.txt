i strongly believe the statement of , it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . understanding the idea is more important for every student in the class room . the understanding the idea and concept give the overall picture of that particular lecture . for example in my college day i had more concentrated on my lesson , at that time i know the central idea of the topic . this type of skill will improve the ability of study and ability of remembering . this skill are also reducing the study time . the student can learn more in formaton quickly . learn fact is good but every time we dont want to study . we dont want to sparemuch time on learn fact . at that time these skill are very helpful . it is very time consuming process . understand ides and concept will helpful any time . for example i want to go to exam , first i will go to through the topic then understand the main idea of that topic and concept of that one . i regularly follow this rule of studying . so in this way i get more information with in time , i save my time also . in this way o studying igot good mark in my exam . for example we will go one reading passage first of all we skim the passage then get the main idea of the passage . this time the reading is easy otherwise it will tough . in this way of getting idea studens get lot of exposure , the thinking ability will also increase . in this way learning fact is difficult to rembering with idea of the topic . so i strongly believe this statement , it will helpful alot in education and futere aspect .
