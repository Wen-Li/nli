i agree with this statement partially ; because although we have to explore new area where to pursue success , it is almost obligatory to gain a high level of expertise to attain it . i should be admitted that there are several good reason for trying new thing . first of all , it is difficult to be successful in an already developed field . people in that field have been specializing and putting their effort and energy for a longtime . for example , the technics for shoe = making is already very wel established and people in this sector know very well how to produce high quality shoe for low cost . secondly , the change is unavoidable in virtually all the area of human activity and people not taking any risk for exploring new thing are deemed to be surpassed by the '' risk = taker '' . sticking to the same example , a person using leather a the raw material for making shoe and not willing to learn about how to use other potentially useful material , would one day have to retire . maybe the most important reason for trying new thing is the potential of generating synergy between what we already know and wwhat we will explore : the world is divided into '' thing '' artificially by the human and we can always find fruitful relation between one '' thing '' that we already know and another one that we get to know . on the other hand , history is also full of famous people who caught the success via persevering in a well = defined field , from army commander to artist to shoemaker and athlete . the reason is that in any given area , there are many very talented people trying to be the number one ; through improving their related skill and also via obtaining relevant knowledge both of which require long period of hard work . so the definitoin of success is always pushed furhter in term of required perfection . although the first man on the earth had naturally to try new thinghs he also had to improve on his skill for not failing = if he had not ; we would not be here . there are always new area potentially very useful for the humanity to explore . but the process of exploration requierd l
