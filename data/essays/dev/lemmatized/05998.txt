i disagree wtih that to understand idea and concept is important for student . there are two reason ; step of study and correct idea . the first reason is that it is neccessay to learn basic knowlege for understanding idea and concept . if student are lack of basic knowlege , they can not understand all of it . for example , student in japanese university primaly learn basic fact . then , they begin to study application one . it is derived the evidence during long educational history in japan . so , it is important step of study for student . the second reason is that learning fact is essential for correct idea . it is doubt that student truely understand idea and concept unless learning fact . for instance , nutritional study , student do not know nutrient , they can not understand metabolism of their body , and can not find new idea and passway of body system . for these reason , i disagree with that to understand idea and concept is more important for student than to learn fact .
