most people think that enjoyment come from experience , but in my opinion , when we first experience something we enjoy it more . there is a saying that a thing is attractive untill you get it , in other word , when you wish for something and do not get it easily , you are more keen to get it . after getting that thing , you loose your interest in it . this is the human nature . so the meaning is that younger people enjoy their life more than older , because they experience thing for very first time . i also agree with this opinion that young person enjoy life more than older people . to support my opinion , firstly , i would like to disscuss the tendency or the nature of youngers . first of all , they are very curious about new thing . they want to explore everything regardless of danger associated with it . for example , when i wa a kid , i wa always curious about parachute , and one day what happened , i just jumped from my roof top with an umbrella . at that time i did not know , what is fear . so meaning is that , you can not expect this kind of absurd behavior from an older person . even , if an old person doe not know the harm associated with the task , he/she might not take risk . secondly , youth do not care for moral value , whereas old people do follow them strictly . from their experience of life , senior people know the value of ethic and would like to follow always . on the other hand , teenager are unlikely to follow the moral value , or they follow reluctantly . thirdly , in my opinion , you can enjoy the life if you do n't have restriction on you activity . old people have resposibilities towards society , a well a towards their own family . while youngers are free to do whatever they want . for an instance , i like to dance publically , and i do whenever i get chance to do it . but i know some older people can not do it because first they think about others opinion such a , what would the society think , or what would be the impact on child . last but not the least , young people are always open to new idea or culture , while older people have narrow mind . it is easy for a younger to adapt a new culture in order to learn it . on the other hand , senior person are rigid to their own culture in order to preserve it . conclusion is that , although it is true that older people enjoy life based on their own life time experience , i strongly hold the view that youngers enjoy the life more than them . the main reason are , will to explore new thing , no responsibility , le regard for value or ethic , and more energy to enjoy life .
