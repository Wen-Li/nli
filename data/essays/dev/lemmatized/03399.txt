my opinion about the topic that young people do not give enough time to helping their community is ambuoules . on the one hand i think many of young people are egoistic today , on the other i know that it is not easy to manage social ambition today , espacially for the youth . i can imagine the young pepole because iam one of them . i do not help in my community or neither i work in a social programm . the reason for that are my few time between the duty 's wich filling my whole day . i think the possibilty to help without any pay in community is better at a younger age of child , from eleven till fifteen . many older young people are busy with their education and own future and too young child maybe are not in the confidence or have the responsibility to work for the community . many of the work wich is to do in a german community is made by so called young people who finished school . if thez do n't want to go to the army , they can choose a social work in community , hospital , etc . . the truth is that young people do n't help for free . they are always looking for a payment and do n't do anz help benfitly . iam sure that there are many thing wich young people could do in a community
