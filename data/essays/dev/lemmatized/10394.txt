i agree with the fact , that if you want to be successful , you have to take risk sometimes . i want to stress that it doe depend on the individual 's situation . for example , if a creative director of an advertising agency ha had lot of success with using one certain method in creating an ad , it is smart to stick with that method . at some point , a time change , people 's interest change and the creative director need to consider a differnt method in creating an ad . if the director wo n't consider doing so , he might lose his client . this is when i would say that it is important to take a risk and do something different with your ad . based on my own experience i have to say that i had more success with taking risk at time . for example , i have great passion for the art and therefore , i have taken quite a few drawing and painting class in the past . at some point , one of my teacher graded me down on one of my project , because apparently i always used the same method in drawing , and i never tried something new . this is when i decided to try pastell paint , instead of the good old charcoal . my teacher wa impressed by the color composition , which wa a change from just black and white drawing . my teacher gave me a better grade , not necessarily because the picture wa better than my other picture , but rather because of the fact that i wa able to deal with something new , such a pastell . trying new thing give you exposure to different perspective , which make you a more open person to new thing . if you constantly stick with the same old thing , you show a lack of flexibility . it also show that you can only be successful in the same area . if you try and practice different thing , it give you the opportunity to show more expertise in different area . if you do n't take the risk of trying something new , you never know whether you could be more successful or not .
