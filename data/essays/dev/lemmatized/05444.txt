i do agree with the following statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . it is a known fact that in today society the word community is not that usual anymore . it shourly doe still have a strong meanig in the village or small town but if you look at bigger city you will find most people living along without even knowing their neighbour name . especially the young people are not involved in the community so actually giving time to helping their community probably doe not occure to them at all . one problem is deffinatly that young people already grow into a society that is doe not realy care about society any more . so they do not realy have a chance to learn how to be part of a society and that beeing part of a society , in this case a communitie , also involves beeing motivated to give something back to it . of course they are supposed to learn it at school but if the parent do not care than the child will keep it the same way . another problem is that young people often have a lot of other stuff on their mind . like going to town with friend or to a disco . working for your community is not realy considered a `` cool '' and your friend might even start making fun of you if you start giving your free time to help your community . at last helping your community normaly mean working for it a a volunter so you will not gain any money for it . many young people that want to finance their live or have a bit plus will invest their time doing something they will be paid for . all these reason show why young people do not invest enough time into their community . but it would be so important that they would do so . first of all your community is not just a couple of people living at the same pace on this planet but it can be a wonderfull social network that might help you in hard time . but if you want to be part of it you will have to get to know the people and be part of the team . that is only possible if you show that you are interested in your community and realy try to be part of it . communities also have a lot of financial problem . so they need volunters working for them so everybody can keep the standard of living people now have . young peolple tend to believe thing would just be given to them without thinking about the work behind it . if the people giving time to their community become le thing will start to disapear . probably young people than will wonder where the bus went driving kid to school or where the mall come from where there used to be a park . all these reason make it so important that young people start to learn how to be an active part of community and why it is so important that they start giving time to helping their community .
