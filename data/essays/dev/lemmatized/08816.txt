i strongly agree with the statement saying that the young people enjoy life more than older people , yes ; because they have the time , the energy and the ability to do that . young people looking for the life from defferant view , they have clear mind and not that much responsablities and concern . the young people looking for some thing make them happy and they try to find out what is the ejoyable thing on the life and they will do it , when they have a example a brand new car you find them spend a long time driving this car and going trip with the friend and they will satisfied with the complement about having like this car . on the other hand when you looking for the older people you will find them busy with the life concers and family issue if they have a family , also they do n't have a lot of time to spend in fun , mainly you find them concern about defferant issue like politics or build up good future for their kid , but some of older people whom thinking about the vacation is important a much a the work and mony important , so they always have the time to enjoy their live and ivest some time for entertainment and recreation . a a conclusion i think the young people more able to enjoy their live because they are still young and they are looking for the coming day with a bright future but a i said befor the older people can enjoy the live a if the young do because they have experiance and they can organize their life obviously better than the young people .
