i believe that is better the person specialize in one subjetc . we need study evrything to choose this subjets , depending of a quality . we quality are so differentes one to the other , but always , we have more develop in one to the other . it is my opinion about this topic . . for example : i love play tennis and i practice every day , i can play with the other person and understand everything about that . if i have a problem or the people ask me something about that , i can explain because i know about tennis . but , if other people ask me to the soccer and he want play with me , is so different , because i 'm not play soccer and i not have practice to that sport . if he teach me i will can play , but i 'm better to other sport . if i want to learn to sport at the same time , i will learn but i ca n't develop all day in only one sport . i need concentration in the two sport . we need have different observation about different subjetc or in this cause sport before to choose any one . is neccesary stay sure about your decision . is the same with the subject 's , i can to learn the basic to each one but i need prepare in only and in my future will know everything about my career . if you can develop perfect the subject , now , you can find out to the other and can the same effort that the first . sometimes we hide many positive thing , but we dont know about that , with the practice we can take off and show this hability ! we can plan our future is only our decision . but for my life or for you life is neccesary of the study .
