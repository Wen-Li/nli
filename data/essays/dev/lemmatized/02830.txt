the student ' teaching method is very controversive between the approach focused on the fact and the other more based on the concept and the idea . i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact for three main reason : understanding idea can help the student to understant fact , it is easier to learn fact individually , understanding idea allow the student to develop it own reflexion and criticism . firstly it seems to me than when a student understands idea and concept than will help it to understand the fact . indeed it would be not very interesting for a student to learn a succesion of fact without knowing why these fact are happening . for example the history fact are numerous and it is impossible to keep all of them but if you understand the idea of an special historical event you can learn better all the fact that are associated with this event . secondly i think that it is easier to learn the fact individually than understand idea and concept . as a matter of fact , the professor can give to their student key that will help them to understand the idea . at the contrary the fact are not difficult to understand and also the support of the professor is not indispensable . the professor can illustrate the fact with personal experience and therefore making them more interesting but he will not change the fact . finally , i believe that the understanding of idea and concept for a student is the basis of the development of it own reflexion and also to have criticism . by identifying the structure of a conceptor a idea , the student can develop it own idea and build also a thinking system . for instance a student that understand well a special philosophy concept can do it own theory about the concept . to conclude i can say that the understanding of idea and concept is the most important part of a student learning process , even if it is not unnecessary to learn fact but not a the first priority .
