i agree with the fact that it is important for student to understand the idea and concept than to learn fact . ideas and concept are two essential factor for learning . ideas are the way by which one would learn about something by his past knowledge , by his past experience or by your imagination . concepts are the one that provide you the with the fundamental of learning thing . take an example of car and an aircraft . both are different object for tranportation . the idea behind developing them wa to develop different mean of tranportation fulfilling the different need of human . the basic concept involved in developing them are the different law of motion , pure science . the fact is that a car is used for transport on land whereas an aircraft is used a mean of tranport in air . it is important for a student to understand the idea and concept rather than learning the fact first . the fact can be learnt once you are proficient with the idea and concept . if they only know the fact and not the concept , their learning would be limited . if they continue to learn thing this way ( by knowing fact ) , they would not be able to apply knowledge of their learning . emphasing further , it would be important for the student to learn the idea and concept first which when combined would give rise to fact . thus a student if learnt the basic idea and concept of law of motion could automatically understand the fact involved with that . ideas and concept , fact are different way of learning thing . but idea and concept are the foundation pillar of your knowledge . your building ( knowledge ) strength lie in your foundation and not on our asthetic view ( in this case the fact learning ) which just give a shallow knowledge about the strength of your building founadtion .
