i find it productive and rewarding to specialize on one subject because one is likely to progress better by staying focused on one area of thought . mathematicians like andrew wiles worked a huge amount of time to prove a single theorem , but he happened to solve one of the greatest enigma of mathematics . so devoting oneself completely to solve a problem or to structure a method may result in an effective , all-inclusive and creative solution or understanding . however , specialization could also mean boredom or a waste of time . staying up all night pursuing the same goal over and over again may cause someone to live an empty life , even to lose focus of what they were looking for in the first place and thereby make many year ' work obsolete . many great thinker got stuck in their own mind , thinking there wa only one important thing in the world , like religion or fancy metaphysical entity , shutting themselves down from the rest of the world and , more importantly , from the opportunity of growth and understanding they had a human being . the mind ha to flow and explore , take new chance , it is not contained in a box . after all , there are many idea and project out there , endless possibility of how to make a better world . a wide range of ability and knowledge of various subject enriches people 's life and open their mind . the only problem is that it is difficult to coordinate oneself to grow in each discipline , one can get easily distracted and it is hard to determine what requires one 's attention at what time . still , the statement could be wrongly put forward . going back to wiles 's experience , he could not have proved the theorem without having a wider mathematical understanding , if he had n't looked in archive others ( more specialized mathematician ) would have considered useless or out of the subject , if he had n't dared to try new method whenever it wa needed , nowadays it is hard to think what it would be like to focus on only one discipline or science , since they are all related with each other , and with technology , in significant way .
