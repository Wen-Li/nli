have you ever seen a boy playing with his toy ? do n't you think that they are in their own happy world ? i believe that child are extremely more happy than old people . when we analize old people 's life , there are to many thing involve that make them worried . for example , the bill that they have to pay every month , or that bos at work that ask them for more every day . it doe n't mean that they do n't enyoy life , because that is life . however , it is too much going on . as much a you know , a much a you are worried . children keep their life simple , and there is the secret of their success . they can watch the cartoon for hour without worried about what are they going to eat tonight because mom is there to take care of that . or , they can play with their neighbor all afternoon until they are so tired that it is time to take a nap . in the adult world , the situation is so much different . old people still have fun . they can have nice conversation with friend , go to the movie , or have dinner with their family , but there is not the same energy and entusiastic that young people have . yougn people are more optimistic , positive , because they have a whole life in front of them , so that motivate them to experience new thing . so , in conclusion , young people enjoy life more than older , otherwise it would n't be to common listen people saying how much they would like to be a child again .
