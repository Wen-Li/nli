the world we live in had a hard time because of several war . the victim of the war are not only this world , but also the old . old people had to reconstruct their world which had destroyed , whoever did . even though there are still several war , this world relatively got recovered . old people struggled to get out of the hard time , bringing bacon home for their family , and they kept living for their family . now they have child who all grown-up , and time to spend for themselves . people say that the old do n't know how to enjoy their life ; i do n't think so . they had a hard time , so they know how thankful they are being alive now , and how precious their life are . they might look like they are still only working , but they know what the life is . they enjoy their life thinking their life profoundly . young people consider enjoying their to be very important . they go surfing in summer and snowboarding in winter , and they say , `` i 'm enjoying my life . '' yeh , they enjoy their life , but they , i think , enjoy life just for fun . there is no purpose to enjoy their life . they take it for granted . enjoying life need responsibility with purpose . without it , people underestimate how important their life are . a young man who always `` enjoy '' his life commits suicide suddenly one day . even though it might be true that he enjoyed his life , he had no purpose . old people have a lot of experience . they get to have responsibility on their family , and know how awesome their life are . who 's more enjoying life ? i think we have to enjoy with pupose .
