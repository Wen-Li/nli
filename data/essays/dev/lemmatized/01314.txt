i agree with the statement . i think that fact show that most successfull people have tried new thing and taken more risk that unsuccessful peolple . for example , most of big computer corporation are owned or managed by people that took many risk in the 1970s and 1980s by betting in the new emerging computer product . those people took many risk and succeded . such reality is in accordance with the economic principle that `` more risk involves more gain '' . therefore , it is probable that a person who take risk will have more profit that a person that only doe what he know best . this is under the assumption that the person who take such risk is a well educated person and not just a gambler . also , if a person only doe what he already know how to do best , it will not gain more experience and the knowledge that it will require in order to be successful . for example , if a person only doe what he already know how to do best it will probably never fail . this may seem something good but it is not . it is very important to fail in order to learn from our mistake . that is why successful person have often failed numerous time . for example , many of today 's rich people have been declared in bankrupcy many time . finally , the result of trying something new is most of the time a new product , which , after having the corresponding trademark right declared , give a person the exclusive right to sell it . for example , most successful farmaceuticals have became such due to the invention of new drug . this could only be achieved because such farmaceuticals took many risk and did thing in a different way . it is important to mention that this doe not only apply to proffesionals but also to artist . many artist have been successful because they have performed it art in a different way , taken many risk .
