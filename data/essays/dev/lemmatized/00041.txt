well it a kind of statement that can be made just to encourage kid to learn more and new thing in their life . but a the saying go that `` all that glitter is not gold '' the same can be applied to successful people a well . the fundamental cause of this problem is not in the people we talk about , but it within u . it is because we always measure a successful person only when his / her work achieves more recognition / fame and or money and that he/she is really worth something which most of u are not . thus it very hard to judge and measure success in term of money or fame or recognition , a for him it just a task he wanted to accomplish for himself . lets consider a sport say soccer . we know that some of the player do play very well compared to rest of the player of that game , but in reality they only play those game which they practiced for year without having to gain success in other game . the very same way we can not just say the founder of microsoft ha been a very successful person a he did not do any thing apart from being in the business of providing software for computer . i wonder how much of knowledge or expertise he would have in the area of mining , the same would be the case in the designer ware and clothing segment of business . interestingly there wa an argument that walmart or the other chain store should be considered successful people . i would opine against the people a well in term of success a what they had been doing is that of selling . i definitely would have said some peron successful if he would have achieved a good name and money in the area of selling , also gaining the same momentum in other area such a manufacturing and in research . thus i would rather say that some people remain successful even when they try new thing .
