in my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject in study life . this ha a lot of benefit than trying to learn a lot of subject in fact it is impossible to have a deep understanding of various subject . first of all you can choose your aim easily and it brings you to reach your destination at the shortest time possible . also one specific subject would be helpfull in your business career . in the business life , executor look for more specilized individual . for example it is not enough to graduate from business administration to acquire a good position . one also should have the specific knowledge of finance or marketing in order to get good salary . for instance i work in forest industry and i graduated in foretsry so now i know a lot of thing about timber , plant , solid wood , and like this . secondly , in today fast grow'ng world if one want to be employed with a high position in one company and have enough salary to have high standarts of living , he must concantrate on one specific subject and be expert about that position . taking into consideration everything one should prefer specializing obout one specific issue and utilize this information to have high career throughout his life . that is why i am choosing .
