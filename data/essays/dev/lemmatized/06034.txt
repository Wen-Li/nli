i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . due to advancement in technological and financial market , access to money is easy . because of the excess liquidity in the current economy around the world many company are expanding their business . there are a number of company that are producing same kind of product . they themselves know that it is extremely difficult to produce something different every now and then . but they all have realised one way of selling same product in different packaging to customer . advertisements !! now technically they know that they ca n't differentiate their own product from other product available in the market . let 's take an example of a car advertisement . it 's an entry level car hyundai santro . they have mr. shahrukh khan ( popular filmstar ) a their brand ambassador for india . in their advertisement it 's shown that mr. shahrukh go for a long drive with his girlfriend ( who is again a big filmstar ) . now everyone in the world know that mr. shahrukh sends a bmw to pick up his kid from school and drove santro in the advertisement for first and the last time in his life . but people are fascinated by this and buy car just believing that if he us it it ha to be a good car . having one myself , i know it is a good car but not because of the advertisement . they show that if you use this car then you may get good looking girl freinds but actually it ha nothing to do with the car . i think it is appropriate to discus example of an advertisement of bournvita . it is a drink for growing child . they claim in advertisement that if child drink this they will grow faster and healthier . now if that wa the case then producer should be the richest person on planet earth . i agree with their claim regarding content of the drink mix , calorie content and presence of protein etc but i ca n't believe this increase in height part . let 's take another example for a telecom service provider . in it 's advertisement they claim that they provide hassle free and customer oriented service in their outlet . i fell into the trap and took the connection . for the first time when i went to the outlet for a complaint i wa left there to wait for half an hour . eventually after having a verbal argument i took a pledge not to believe advertisement . i belive that to survive in this cut throat world company will always invent way to sell their product . advertisements is one of them . whatever you see on tv , you should not believe it a nothing in this world is a simple a it appears .
