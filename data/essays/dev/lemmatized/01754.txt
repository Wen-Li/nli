no wonder young people enjoy life more than older people . in my opinion , in the early age people can do lot of thing easily without worring anything . they just decide and enjoy what they do . i agree that young people have more chance to enjoy life for the following reason : having le dependency than older people , and the desire of learning new information and having experience . first , young people have le dependency such a looking after someone , the need of earning money or health issue - obstacle for travelling country - than older people have . young people are able to travel different country easily without thinking anybody stay back like child . for example , my parent have three child including me . if they want to travel to spain during the rest of their time , they can not leave their child because child need to be looked after . in this case , young people who do not have any child can easily go for travelling . moreover , young people usually want to learn and gain a lot of different kind of experience during their early age . i can remember , when my brother wa nineteen he used to go to music festival , theathers , and travel a lot . basically , he enjoyed a lot because he had time , sufficent amount of money and energy . also , he could easily adapt difficult condition whatever he faced with . i can not imagine that older people join a party and a boat trip at the same day . in conclusion , older people and young people can not be compared ehether young people enjoy the life more than older people or not . so basically , young people should be aware of their opportunity in order to enjoy the time .
