do i agree ? well , i do not agree . i wa young once and i 'm getting old now , so that make me somewhat an expert in the matter . first of all there are many reason that would not support that theory , such a : inexperience , carelesness , finaces and the fact that youngster think that they know it all . lets elaborate on the first one ; it summarizes in one phrase , `` a person can only gain experience one day at the time . '' finances , are a big deal big deal in your younger year , you are living on a tight budget and most of the time you can not adhere to it , because all the medium , peer pressure and nevertheless inmaturity . finaces can very easy make your younger year hard and like we all know that generates an snowball effect on everything else . moving on , carelesness and `` know-it-all syndrome '' , what can i say , in a way they all derive from eachother . these theory are backed up by fact and figure that wont lie , i live through them . these are the reason why i do not agree with that statement ; older people are wiser , more thougthful , financialy secure and of course more careful about doing again the stupid thing they did in their earlier year . also when you are older there is a great chance that you are finacially secure , and can afford the nicer thing in life . in conclusion , a we all know , life is a race . .. so by far older people the winner in this race .
