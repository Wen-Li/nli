some peple like indivisual travel , others like to travel in a group led by a tour guide . in my opinion , i prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide . i would like to show three point referring rational and example . first of all , a group trip make u easy to go unfamilier spot in the famous sight seeing place . since tour a guide ha professional knowledge on the place , they can advise u to see unknown but good spot . in my experience , when i went to china in a school trip , i could find beautiul scene of forest and river from unknown spot . if i had not travel in a group , it mutst have been impossibe since i wa unfamilier with china . also , a tour guide can help u to communicate efficiently with foeigners in a foeign travel . in general , a tour guide , especially who often go to foegin country , ha a good command of the ingenious language . therefore , we can communicate with ingenious people through their language help . if we do not have tour guide , especially in foreign country which we have not learned the language , we can not directly communicate with them . since one of big advantage to go abroad is to communicate with native people , and to learn the life and culture , no language support doe not bring beneficial time . lastly , referring to an advangage of a travel in the form of group , it ensures to communicate with other people who are in the same tour . it is a good opportunity to see other people , because , in my case , i do not have much opportunity to meet other unfamilier japanese . since i am a university student , i always meet same people such a classmate or friend who belong to the same club activity . if i could meet someone who have same the tasts , i would be able to have eternal relationship with them . thus , due to three point : going to unfamilier spot , communication with ingenious people , and having relationship with people in the same travel , i prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
