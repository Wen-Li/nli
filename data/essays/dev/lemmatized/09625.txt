i do not agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . the reason being specialized study in one subject provides an indepth understanding of the subject . it is critical for research and innovation . it also help to make a positive contribution towards societal development . most modern day innovation can be attributed to indepth study and research . for example , the development in telecommunication could not have happened but for the innovation in fibre optic . these development have revolutionized modern communication . distances no longer matter . life ha become more easy . in depth study in management are critical in finding solution to an ever growing and complex world . so , by pursuing indepth study in a specific subject one could contribute meaningfully and effectively to the development of the world . it is easy to dabble in many subject . but serious study is critical for success . no doubt reading varied subject help broaden one 's thinking . but , one could gather basic knowledge and information about other subject without much effort . in this age of information and technological revolution one can have easy access to information . further , we do not live in isolation in a society . so social exchange and interaction would help build our information and knowledge base on other subject . the modern world is driven by technology and science . in this modern world one could contribute more meaninfully if one is focused and doe an indepth study . even a social scientist need to do more indepth study to contribute meaningfully .
