advertising , which is a tool used by many bussiness expert or techie to gain much more profit and also reputaion . the art of advertising brought a dramatical change in the marketing world . the product shown in the `` add '' , the short form of advertising , may not be the same a they really are . the purpose of advertising is to grab the look of the consumer towards the product . if a product gain the look of the consumer , it may get them buying it . the sample shown in the advertisement may vary with real . for example , the automobile industry , they show the the performance and accessory of thier product in a speculating way , but the real differs from the shown and also during the advertisement , they make an asterisk mark on the mileage or any other they show , but none observes that , which mean below of that `` under standard testing condition '' . generally consumer can not notice that because the font size is very small . not only the automobile , let take the financial area . in this the finanace company show thier plan of insurance are much better among the other . they only announces the benifits of the plan but not the risk of the plan . which is a clever way of cheating the public . if and only if the company make a good reputation among the market , it can survive long with profit . to achieve this main objective , the product are shown much better in the advertisement . ofcourse , there are some product which are real , forexample , the jewellary product which are shown wil bwe the same a the real . the use of latest technology in photography also one of the cause of this debate . the use of xeon light make a product glitter and also the highly sophistcated camera can capture even trash a a beautiful thing . how ever , i agree with the statement that `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' .
