in my opinion in some case it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject , instead , in another case , it 's better to specialize in only one or two specific subject . i think that at the primary , secondary and high school it 's better to have a generical knowledge , like what is actually in use in the majour state of the world ( i belive and i hope it is truth ) , than to specialize in only one specific subject . here we have a thirteen generical year knowledge and i think it is not bad ! i think that when we arrive at university it is right to specialize in only one or two specific subject because actually we live in a world where everyone think to be able to do everythihg but this is not the truth ! i think it 's important to be a very good professionist in one thing to be different from the mass . in italy ours university are not good able to prepare student for the work world and when we finish school , after eigthteen year , we are not able to work and we have to wait another two or three year to be consider by big agensy , compa
