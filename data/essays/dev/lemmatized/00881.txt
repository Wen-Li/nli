i agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are several reason for supporting this position . the first reason is that young people have much ability than older people . they can do anything they want to do . their power is stronger than older people . they hardly get tired . if they dont do thing that they want to do until they are young , they can do nothing after getting old . especially sport like surfin , running , soccer , squba diving , and so on . my hobby is traveling abroad . taking plane is so tired that i cant endure for a long time . last winter i went to orlando , florida alone . i have to change the plane for two time . totally , it took thirty hour to get there ! i think order people cant endure no longer . the second reason is that young people can return soon . when they make a mistake , young people can take other way . but once older people make a mistake , even though such a small mistake , they cant do again . they cant have another chance . for exsample , young people made mistake and they quit their job , they are able to hire another company soon . because they are young . but older people cant do so . maybe they are not able to hire a company . because of their age . '' too much older ! '' for these reason , i agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
