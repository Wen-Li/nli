i think that there are a lot of young people which give a lot of time to helping their community and therefore i disagree with the statement and i can give some reason and a lot of example . nowadays in italy there are a lot of people which do civil service . it is a public no-profit organisation that doe a lot of free service for the community and the people , which work in it , are often young men or woman . in addition there are many private organisation which do not have financial aid from the state and where people work without any wage . in these organisation there are also a lot of young people . i can state this because i have some friend and my girlfriend too which do it and i admire a lot for their choice . for example my girlfriend work a a volunteer in a first aid organisation and i know that a lot of service are done by it a healthcare to the elderly people or first aid when an accident occured and wounded people must be saved . furthermore it is very common to view young people in these organisation when there are sport or music event . in fact , when there is in my city a football match , there are very often young people in first aid organisation , which is always present in these case . although i admire this choice and i would like to do it i can not do because i have a very hard university and so i do not have much time for beginning this activity . in conclusion because of many example that i did in this essay , i can affirm that i disagree with the statement of the question and i can state that a lot of young people give time to their community .
