in a leaning process , the aim should be well defined in order to get closer to the target , being awarness of where to reach and what to get . to me this is a must for the learning process . i strongly belive that we need to differenciate the conceps , idea and fact . to me student need to learn what is necessart yo analyse and differenciate the fact and result . . to analyse the fact and result they need to learn idea and conceps ; ok , why ? first of all idea and conceps are the main resource of the behaviour , invention , expressing emotion and etc . so to make connection with result we need to consider idaes and concept that based on . to me student will learn both of them , unporved concept or idea can turn to fact tomorrow .. but also learning fact is necessary to anaylse the root af fact . what are the resource of the fact ? as a second student need to learn the methodology of comparing conceps and fact . this help student to anylse the fact and also make easy to learn . in the learning process a an additional thing we can put to learn how to make comparison . further more while determing the aim of learning ; it should be to learn fact but being aware of idea and conceps . . it is like learning three situation of matter , but now scientis proved that there is one more sitiation of the matter . so being aware of conceps is helpful ' it is like not to close our eye from what others thinking . as a consequence stundents should have an idea that why they need to learn , and how ? and they need to learn make connection and comparison with fact and conceps while learning . .. l belive that learning conceps is not harmfull and wasting of time and also learing just learning fact is like closing our eye to the other . students need to learn both and make comparison of fact and idea while learning .
