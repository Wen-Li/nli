the idea of whether broading knowledge of many academic subject than specialize and focus in one specific subject ha been a matter of debat recently in many country . in my point of view , i believe that broading different many knowledge will give studnt the ability and the basic background to understand the real life to be able to disscuss different subject , argue in many issue , and to improve himself . also , be awaring of many academic subject will give the studnt the ability to go through different field and chose the best major he want to drill in . i believe that spread more than one subject in the academic year especially in the first and second year will allow the student to be aware of what is going around his world . studnt who is going to study about education , social study , politics , arts , and may be math will be able to understand his country and his socity peroblems and will have more idea than a student who never heared about politics or art and only study for his math major . moreover , student in their first year will never be able to take the right decision for their career life and chossing the major they want to enroll-in a they dont have the enough knowledeg and experiance to chose among all these alternative . for example , in my first year and directly after the high school i had to chose my career and my whole future based on my zero experiance and approximatley zero knowledge , of course if in my country i wa able to gain and aquire the basic of more than a knowledge absolutly i wa going to chose something else or if i didnt chose something else ; at least i would know that my choice wa the right chice for me . to conclude , i strongly recommend and agree with having broad knowaledge of many academic subject before focusing in the specific field of knowledge which i believe it will be the best for my future career and which will be helpful for my socity .
