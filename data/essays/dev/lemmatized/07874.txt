i agree with the statement that successful people are tend to do the thing which is not familliar with them and get risk . i have several reason for this . first , to challenge new thing make people well-round . to take a personal example , when i wa junior high school student , i hated to study liberal subject , history , art , music . i had never been to musiums or concert hall . however , when i wa university student , i changed my mind and tried to study liberal subject . thanks for the change , i became to well-round person who can talk any person . as above example illustrate , to try new thing make peaple well-round . second , the people can find their best way when they try new thing . for instance , four year ago , i applied the new project in my company which i did not know how to do well . althogh i had been sale person for five year , i tried the production field of computer company . i did well because i know what the client want to for our product . if i had not tried new fileld , i would not success for the job . therefore , i defenetly agree with the statement trying new thing and taking risk rather than doing what people know well make peaple successful .
