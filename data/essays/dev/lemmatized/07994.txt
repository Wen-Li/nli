in my opinion , young people actually enjoy life more than older people do . i hold this opinion because young people are le weak , le afraid , and le fragile than older people tend to be . first of all , the majority of young people have alot of energy they can disperse without becoming tired easily . while most aged people get tired after just one activity , young people , like student , can do many activity in just one day . even after long hour of work in school , they can easily take part in an afterschool activity , and then come home to do homework and chore . on the other hand , older people get tired quickly even after one activity , such a cleaning the house . being able to do many activity in one day promotes the sense of accomplishment and happiness , and thus young people who have more energy enjoy life more than older people . in addition , young people tend to be more brave than older people , and take more risk . risks , because no outcome can be predicted , add excitement to the life of young people . however , most older people prefer being stable and assured , and do not take risk . for example , alot of young people will travel to distant country , and gain more experience . however older people prefer remaining where they are . thus in the life of older people thing are monotonuous and predictable , whereas in the life of young people , nothing can be predicted and everything is exciting . furthermore , young people are also more mentally capable than older people . as people grow old , they lose their ability to concentrate for long period of time , or to learn new thing . in contrast , young people are full of potential and can learn new thing , like another language or a new recipe . learning new thing is very enjoyable , and younger people who have the advantage of better mental capability , enjoy life more than older people . older people are restrained by various factor , such a fragility and inability to continue activity for long period of time . however , because young people are stronger physically , mentally , and also have le fear , their life are filled with excitement and fun , enabling them to enjoy life more than older people do .
