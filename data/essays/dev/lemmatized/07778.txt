over time , marketing and advertising strategy have being changed and improved in order to attract more and more the attention of the public . one way to this is creating advertisement that make product seem much better than they really are , which i trully believe for several reason . first of all , i had a personal experience where a i bought a lotion that promised to make a person loose certain amount of inch in the waist line . the actual advertisement showed the typical before and after picture . after using the product for a while , and even finishing it all , nothing happened . i did n't loose any inch , in fact . and these second , some company make the product look better by simply omitting some information or having it appear on the advertisement in small letter . this information , is in some case crucial such a side effect , contraindication , among other . on the other hand , if company advertisement strategy do not maximize the benefit of the product , wo n't be able to compete successfully with other product in the market and therefore wo n't be able to mantain a position the economy . in conclusion , most company nowadays have to make their product look really efficient , oherwise people wo n't buy what they do n't believe will work properly or wo n't meet their need .
