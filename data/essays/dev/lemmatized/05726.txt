i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are two reason to support my opinion . the first reason why most advertisement make product seem better is that the most important thing is to sell more product in term of the producer . in selling product , advertisement are very important because there are many product of the same kind in the world today . in this situation , attractive advertisement are indispensable to compete with product from other company . let 's take cell phone for an example . there are many company producing cell phone all over the world , and each company also provides many different type . last year , i lost a cell phone and decided to buy a new one . i wa a t a loss a to what to buy , and i finally bought one with the most attractable advertisement in a store . after i used it for a while , i easily found that it wa difficult for me to use it because of many unnecessary accessory function . i usually use cell phone only a a mobile telephone , and so i do not need a function of taking a picyure . therefore , i really found that it is important to discern the advertisement more carefully . the second reason is that the producer partly believe that the real quality of the product are first known after many people use them . in this regard , producer are eager to sell the product in the first place . they consider the problem of the product after the consumer claim to them . it is not really a good attitude , but this idea is also rampant and is derived from the idea that selling product is the most important thing for producer a i metioned in the first reason . however , society ha changed it regard of a recall movement , so this attitude becomes riskier and riskier in the developed country . in summary , i agree with the opinion that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
