it is said that fortune favour the brave . on the same line , it can be said that success follows people who try new horizon , who extent their limit of vision and dare to take on new challenge in a world that is everchanging . i think that successful people keep trying new thing and do not get stuck on any one thing . the world ha seen many industialists who tried different business . though they succeeded on some and failed in others , on a whole they emerged a winner . one bright example that i would like to mention is that of an indian businessman - tata . tata put his first foot in the world of business with an automobile manufacturing unit . he collaborated with foreign company to provide best available technology to customer . the business started with truck but soon flourished to other class of vehicle . recently , tata introduced cheapest four wheeler on indian road for common man . this journey is amazing . but this is not the only thing that tata did . tata started different business apart from automobile . tea , salt , information technology , telecom - he seems to be ubiquitious . he is also successful in these business . now he is planning to take over world famous brand ` jaguar ' . certainly , tata took great risk when he started every new industry . but great return demand great risk . a man with vision can handle such risk and emerge out a a winner . these are all quality of a successful person . had tata been interested only with manufacturing of truck , he never had had such a great impact on all other business area . he tried out new thing and his effort paid off . his success surely belongs to the way he conquered new opportunity of business . thus , it can surely be said that one who doe same thing that he already know how to do well will have le chance to succeed than the one who try different thing and take calculated risk for greater reward .
