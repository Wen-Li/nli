in the next twenty yearas there will fewer car than at present . i dont agree with this notionbecause the demand and the importance of the car is ever increasing day by day . with the advancement in techonology and the statistic produced by the car manufacturer are anything to go by then in the next few year there will be a major incresase in the number of consumer for car . i think that there could be a increase in the number of car used depending on the policy issus . i say so becaus e with the ever increasing development in technology there is reduction in price of the previous model and certain additional featurs are being added int he new car which would only be a dream a few year earlier . moreover the notion of a car being a necessity than a luxury thing is changing a even member of not so affluent family or well to do family also own car . this change could be attributed due to various factor such a easy payment option given by the car manufacturer or the installment given by them . the other reason could also be that the willingness of the bank authority to give various loan for the purchase of car or for the cganges to be made in car . another reason could be that the company 's exchange offer which say that you can exchange your old car for a new one for an additiona payment which keep on increasing the sale of the car . plus there are additional benefit of using a car which make it hard to resist object or abandon it . the benefit of the car are you can go with your family whereever you want and at whatever time plus useful in case of emergency . more than the benefit car are usually associated with social status . that there is ever an increase for the demand for a new car with certain added feature that it precedent is not having . then there are car which hold special status a being the royal car or having your own vintage collection . basically you can reach to different destination according to your own schedule at your own speed . now-a-days there is a whole lot of variety being offered wherein special additional feature are buiklt in it like conference room setting or bedroom setting . with such offer it ha lot of benefit for the people who are really busy and cant afford to waste time . well with so many benefit it really hard to think that there will be a decline in the number of car in the near future . with the benefit there are also certain disadvantage like the gas emitted from the exhaust of the car is polluting the environment and that the fuel used for the functioning of the car is depleting the natural resource . well for the fact that car are increasing the air pollution with the development in technology various model are being developed which donot emit any dangerous gas in the atmosphereand for the second disadvantage that they are using the energy resourses new car are being developed and some have already being developed which use solar energy a fuel or run on electrical energy . thus with so many advantage i think the demand for the increase in caras will outnumber it decrease or there wont be any drastic change in the numbe rof car in the near future . thus i think that in the near future there will be an additional number of car than there are today .
