in general , young generation enjoy their life more than older generation do . this is because young people have knowledge or skill to adopt now . older people are difficult to do that . but , the older people had the time to adjust world , and they must have enjoyed at that time . so , i agree that young people enjoy life than older people do . in fact , i am in yong generation right now . i , of course , enjoy my life . going to school , exrcising body and exploring new world are all enjoyable for me and other young people . for doing them , pioneer spirit , health body and motivation for getting new thing are required . however , it is heavy task for olders . among them , some people are still have those power , but most people tend to be le motivated . for example , my grandmother doe not want to do anything except for her rutines which are to take care of household or talking to only similar people in day . one time , i asked her to travel with my family . but , she refused even if she wa very healthy . she just did not want to leave her house and nomal enviroment she spent with . on the other hand , we young people do not be afraid of new life or enviroment because we have a lot of dream for new world . it make u more enjoyable than the olders . i think that the olders ought to have interest to enjoy their life . it might help them to suit society and public . if they do not do that , only thing they have is that they spend rest of their life unhappy or boring . to avoid this situation , they should try to have interest .
