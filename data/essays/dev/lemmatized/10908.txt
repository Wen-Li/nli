i disagree with the statement . it mat be true that the group tour is a most convinient way to travel because a tour guide know a lot about the place and there seems no waste time thanks to the all well prepered plan . however i think that to travel by ourselves is more enjoyable than group tour and there are three reason that support my idea . first , by traveling individually , you can go anywhere at anytime . for example , if you go to one tourrist attraction in a group and you find the place attracting , you have to just pas through and can not see the place well because of the time limit . next , you can meet local people . if you are in a group tour , local people are not interested in them because you already have a lot of conpany and the local people see you a one of them . however , if you go to the sight alone , it draw local people 's attention and they might talk to you or at least nice to you . moreover since they live there , they know where to go better than guide or guidebook . in addition , you can know what the tradition and culture of the region , which the guidebook do not tell you . finally , you can be independent . to travel alone is not always just a fun . there are a lot of danger around you . however you can learn how to protect yourself when you are in danger . what you learned from the dangerous situation will be helpful for your latter life .
