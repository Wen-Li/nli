i agree in part with the statement that the `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . the statement stated by the author seems to be correct at some situation and prof to be wrong at other situation making this statement a debatable . i will give some example to prove my point in this essay . the statement of author mention `` enjoyment of life '' . this term is very relative in respect of people . every person try to live his life colourfully in his own way . if enjoy mean partying then it may be possible that young people are doing more frequently than older people but when it come to celebrate then older people are not step back from the younger generation . i do agree sometimes because younger generation are having better and suitable condition for the time to enjoy . young people are enthusiastic , active and having energy to enjoy the sport event by playing and cheering , they are very eager to explore the new place . young people having interest for movie go for it whenever they get time , they go for picnic to have a change and the thing that generally many young people enjoy that is to dance continuously for hour . they enjoy various food of different taste at many of the time . this can be termed a enjoyment . if we accept the author statement then it would be like that older people are not enjoying but carrying thier life ahead only . the thing which are done by younger generation are being done by older generation earlier and thus they lost the charm in those thing and they are not having enough strength to do the same thing continously . but they are enjoying in different manner , sitting on a chair taking sunbath , reading newspaper and giving advice to younger generation . they are not able to taste various food because of their physical condition but even taking that food by hiding from other people . they are the leader of the house , they are having certain responsibility to be taken care of . this can also be termed a enjoyment but of some different kind . in sum we can say this point is quite debatable and need to do sampling of people and other technique to reach some conclusion .
