i 'm not so sure that is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i think that this statement is quite generic and incomplete . if it is referred to historical study , it could be accettable . for example , it is more important for a student tho understand why the world war had occurred than the specific fact and date linked to war 's history . and this example could extended to the general comprenshion of the actual world 's politic situation . but without knowing fact it 's difficult to make a personal idea on an argoument . if we take for example scientific field we have to refuse this statement , it 's impossible to discus about a scientific idea without knowing the specific fact ( rule , law , property ) connected to this idea . so , my personal opinion is that there is n't a division between fact and concept , they are strongly connected . ( here we could open a philosophical discussion about fact and judments in kant 's theory ) i suggests to the other student to make sure to know very well a fact before giving an opinion , and to investigate a fact before accepting other 's opinion . this problem involved the eternal problem of the historical fount : scholar have to believe in historical narration whithout the real possibility to control themselves the truely of a fact on the contrary , the figure of the critic should be an example of a person who can see and study a fact and than give his opinion about that fact . so , in order to give a correct and credible opinion about something , is very very important to study the fact themselves .
