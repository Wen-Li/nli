parents always say that you have to work very hard at your younger age , so a to enjoy your older age . i do n't think that this is a valid deal cause i dont think that i will be able to enjoy more in my older day than when i am young . cause at older age you would like to settle down in a calm village and enjoy the peaceful and pleasant climate rather than living in a crowded city , with lot of thing happening around you and that interest you . at your younger age , you will have the energy to go around different place and view some of the beautiful creation in the world . but when you become old , maybe your health will not allow you to do adventure . at your younger age , you have many thing to enjoy because of le responsibility and more energy . at young age you can also have a great enjoyment with your romantic life too . enjoying to the highest at your younger age and also working hard to get settled in the future is my moto of life . normally people think that they will enjoy there life after they are old and they only work . but this can be harmfull if they dont get a chance to enjoy at thier older stage after so many year of hardwork . normally youngster do enjoy a lot by arranging disco party and trip to different location with friend . they get in touch with the latest technology and gadget like ipod , mobile phone , game and many more . they do spend a luxurious life . youngsters also enjoy sport and have a abilitiy to take part in it . so finally i can say that , young people enjoy more than older people with respect to health , responsibilties , technology and much more . so , i prefer enjoying my younger age and getting settled in my older age .
