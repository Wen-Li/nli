traffic issue are certainly a huge problem in our current world . a distance of ten kilometer would usually take about ten minute to cross twenty year ago ; however , nowadays that same distance would take about fourty minute to cross . people are beginning to wonder if a person walked a certain distance , or drove in a car , doe the walking individual reach the designated point faster ? such issue are becoming a serious concern to our world . yet every problem must have a solution , and earth ha a trait that when a human creates a problem , eventually he will find a solution . yet that solution , would cause another problem . i personally agree with the statement since already certain protocol are being done in order to deal with such a problem . mass transit ha be extremely subsidized and an incentive to carpool is being stressed upon . subway rail , train , and monorail are being created inorder to draw away all the individual found on the road . in twenty year their will be definatly fewer car than what is present today , since individual would no longer depend on a biast form of transport . certain city in our world today can prove how mass transit is an effective way of reducing the number of car . london , england is a perfect example to be used a a city who us all it transportation method and incentive to the max . a person who life in london doe not necesarilly need to be stuck in rush hour when he is tired from work and just want to go home . such an individual can just enter the tube station and ride the subway to the nearest station to his residence . this type of transportation when people began to adapt to it greatly affected the road of london , a year by year the street began to clear up . countries would probably follow the footstep of london in the near future . tokyo , japan is another example of a country that enforces mass transit ; however poorly exectued . underground station are present within the city , yet the transit system doe not support such a mass amount of individual . such a situation might solve the problem of fewer car on the road , but it cause the problem of more people crowded at underground station . the example presented support the theory behind this argument , which is yes their will be fewer car in twenty year than their is today ; however , that doe not solve the main problem . cars on their own do not cause a crowding effect , people driving the car cause the crowding effect . when mass transit are used efficiently , than that certain amount of individual will be evenly distributed among different route of transport . yet if mass transit is provoked , than that mass of individual would just yield to another route , transfering the same problem from point a to point b. fewer car will be present in twenty year , but it up to each individual country to distribute the main problem .
