in my opinion , i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than the other . the reason why i prefer this one is that if someone is specialized in one specific subject , i think this person is quite boring person . lets say he know very wel about the animal in the sea and whenever you meet with them . he talk only about thing that he is good at and nothingelse . as i am a listener of him , i would have very boring time . on the other hand , if you know broad knowledge of many academic subject , people who talked with think that you are very smart . you dont have to talk that much but little bit of information about many thing . thats all you need . usually listener dont try to argue with you , unless they are professioners of what you are talking . of course it is also good to specialize in one specific subject . especially if you are teacher or doctor , anyone who teach or give advice . then the one specific subject would be very valuable . actually both personality are valuable and better than knowing nothing because you know something at least . i had one friend who wa usually quiet . but when i let him talk about car , he didnt stop talking untill i changed the topic . he wa so interested in car and he like to spent his time for car .
