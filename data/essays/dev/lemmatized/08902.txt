very few people in france think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic than to specialise in one specifice subject . indead , they think that you need to go through all the detail of a specific field if you want to be efficient . is that true or not ? i do n't agree with such a prejudice . on the contrary , i think the more you know , the more efficient you are . for example , if someone want to work in a library , will he be more efficient if he know everything about book , publishing and printing ? i do n't think so . i think he will be more efficient if he know about different thing such a history , anthropology , philosophy , litterature or science . practice can give you all technical knowledge but it will never replace broad knowledge provided by school and university . the second reason why i think a broad knowledge is important in our society is that people who have broad knowledge are more flexible . they are able to switch from one field to another . in other word , they are what i would call ` complete person ' . the can adapt themselves to every change . for example , you can be a banker today and become a manager tomorrow . my last point is about my political vision of a modern society : i think that a good citizen need to have a broad knowledge of all academic subject in order to make good choice . reality is complex : if you want to understand what is happening in your contry and in the whole world you need to have a solid knowledge in different field such a geography , economy or technology . to conclude about this subject , i would say that the british ideal of the ` gentleman ' who know about all aspect of human thing continues to be important in our modern world .
