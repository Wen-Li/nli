i think that both understanding idea and learning fact are equally important for a student , but if i were forced to choose between the option i would say that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning a list of fact . the comprehension of the idea that give the meaning to a fact will enable the student to understand all the fact that are based on that same idea . for example : teacher teach the child how to add number by explaining them how addition work , not by telling them that 2 + 2 = 4 , that 2 + 3 = 5 and so on . when a child ha understood the idea and the concept of addition he 'll be able to make all sort of addition . what i really mean to say is that the understanding of a concept will lead you to the full comprehension of several fact of the same kind . on the other hand i can not avoid to notice that we face a big risk in focusing too much on idea and concept : the risk of leaving out the reality . reality is very important because it 's the point we tend to : all idea and concept are studied to give reason on thing we 've seen in our experience , if we do not refer to reality we would be just speaking about nothing , our talking would be only speculation which is not usefull to u . i would say that we need a balance between the two thing , because they are both important to the student : i think that a good method of making them understand a theory or a concept would be giving them example , because talking about experience is effecive in making them realize what concept we are dealing with . on the other hand i think that when a teacher talk about a specific fact he should always say what is the idea that stay behind that fact so that he woul obtain two important result : fistly the student would fully understand the fact in it implication , cause , consequence ( for example why a war wa declared , what consequence it had . . ) and secondly the student would be able to understand many fact of the same kind because they may recognize the same idea behind other fact .
