`` variety is the spice of life '' the word ` success ' is not only associated with the work that you do but at the same time being successful in the new dimension that you have adopted in your life . i completely agree with the statement that ` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' . this can be well explained by citing some example of a few legend in different field like the one that have been mentioned below . firstly i would like to start with the richest person in indian market dhirubhai ambani wa once working a a vegetable vendor , he wa a master of selling those vegetable no doubt , but drew interest in the communication field and started researching in that field . its a completely different field that he opted for but the determination he had in his work and the confidence he had in his ability made him a successful person and finally he became the master in that field . secondly the all time legend in the field of cricket ` sachin tendulkar ' wa pursuing his enginnerg because he wanted to become a successful engineer but had a lot of interest in cricket . so he opted for cricket after he got to enggineering , though it wa a big risky decision that he had taken up , he wa ready to work hard for that . and now he s a renown cricketer . the risk that he had taken wa a huge one but it really paid him off . thus i certainly feel that a person who is versatile in his work and at the same time diversified in his thinking moral can become a successful person . thus a succesful person is not the one who take risk but at the same time strives hard for that and make his risky decision count at the end of the day .
