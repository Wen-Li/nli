yes , i totally agree with this term of travelling in a group led by a tour guide . it is mainly because a we are a tourist so we dont know much about the place in a particular place . we will visit only those place which are known to u . but if you travel in a gruoup led by a tour guide you will be able to see more new place that u have neevr imagined to see in that particular place . the tour guide play a very important role in making our tour very intresting and adventurous . he tell u about the story of the different place of that place and make u feel more and more excited to visit that place . i visited agra ( india ) . i wa traveling with my friend and we all planned to hire for a tour that is led by a guide so that we can visit more and more place and can come to know about the history of those place . as i know , agra is a city of history . it have lot of history in it and i wanted to know the proper history of that place . i wa sure that only a group tour guide can only tell u about it and i wa not wrong at all . he told the whole group about the history of all those historical place in that town . as we know one of the seven wonders ` taj mahal ' is also located in that city . i wa touched by listning the history of that wonder . not only me but the whole group wa touched by what all he told u about it . i think i wa not in that group with that guide i would have never enjoyed my trip to agra . as i would not have come to know all wat he told to the whole group . the history of great taj mahal . since then i love to travel in a group which is led by a tour guide . actually what i think one should must visit new place in a group led by a tour guide . im saying so mainly because you come to know about the place of that town and everything about that town . if you like it then you can come again on your own without a torurist guide . but if you are visitng a new place for the first time then you have to travel in a group which is lead by a tour guide . if you have a tour guide then you need not have to take ant tension for accomodation traveeling from one place to another . all these task are done by a tour guide only . we dont even have to buy ticket again and again . in all when we are travelling in a group led by a tour guide we are in a full mood of enjoying . no work tension nothing . only enjoyment and enjoyment . so i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
