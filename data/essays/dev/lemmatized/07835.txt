i agree with the statement which is successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . it depends on what the value of the successful is , so i take successful a become famous and change better world . one of the example of successful company is mcdonuld 's , the famous fast food chain in the united states . i just read the book about mcdonuld 's . the founder of the mcdonuld 's is mcdonuld 's brother in the south of the united states . they were selling humbergers at the store which can buy food getting on the car , drive-through . it wa the major thinking of restrants at that time . but they changed the style . they changed all of the cycle to make humberger . it mean that one person do only one job , like just bake the meat . before that , there were one person did every step to make humberger . this idea made more faster to serve food . because of there effort , mcdonuld 's became the biggest humberger company in the world . trying to do new thing is always with some risk . it would be good if the new thing brought success . but if the new thing failed , it would be a nightmere . i think charenging new thing is a kind of lottary . we can not know if the thing would be success . another good example of successful people is the person who maid the i-pod . this product is the most hit product of apple company which used to produce apple computer . the idea of making i-pod a the lightest and having a big capacity of music is the fashionate idea . apple company is the first company to create product such a i-pod . the attitude of challenging of new thing would make apple to accomplish to be successful . because of these reason , i agree with the idea of successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
