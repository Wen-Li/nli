advertisements are a source to reach out to the people and to pas on a message that one want to say . people are influenced in a wide range on watching these advertisement . many product are marketed through this procedure . most of the product are not a worthed a they are shown in the advertisement . marketing personal do not actually show the reality but try to convince the public that their product contains good quality and quantity : but they dont . for instance , the advertisement of a beauty cream or a face pack is marketed with an attractive presentation but that product actually doesnt show much effect on anyone and the side effect will not be mentioned in that advertisement . similarly , the product of food and snack also do not show any growth regarding health but are shown in such a way that they can produce lot of energy and strength in a person . offcourse , one cant find the clothes shining so brightly forever , with a detergent or wash powder a it is shown in the advertisement . its all about attracting people in a false manner towards their product . it would be fare enough if the real quality of the product are shown in the advertisement . only few product do effect on the people a the way they are displayed . in conclusion , i do agree that the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
