most advertisement today are aiming to capture the audience to purchase their product and compete with the other product in the market and so they tend to project their product a an essential purchase for one 's happiness and well being . i personally feel that they make their producta appear much better and useful than they actually are . some advertisement inflate the use of their product a little while some others make them appear to create outstanding result or even miracle in one 's life . for example , take any of the aerated drink ' advertisement . they use prominent sportmen like david becham or michael jordon to endorse their product to show the audience how their drink would enhance one 's performance to become like their idol . everyone know that having a drink would'nt make them a star or play like one but just their idol being there in the advertisement maybe persuade them to purchase it . this may work for any purchase not costing much and people may make the small purchase either way without the advertisement , just the matter of which brand to go for . another way by which they make make their product look much better is by persuading people to purchase the product because it will make them look attractive and will influence their personal life a well . take the case of all the beaty product which promise to make you look better and attractive by spending a small amount on them . these advertisement may actually get the audience ' attention because everyone want to look better by spending the minimal amount of money . these advertisement may particularly catch the attention of teenager who always are ready to spend on any product that make them look better in front of their peer . while some product may rope in big star to get their point across , some may cash in on the small desire of the audience and ultimately market their product in the best possible way . by and large in most advertisement , overexaggeration of the product is what we witness . the competing product are shown in a light where we feel incomlete without using them .
