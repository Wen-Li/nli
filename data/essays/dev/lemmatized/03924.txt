i think that this statement can summarize an important problem of the actual society . in my opinion we live in the society of appearance , where exterior aspect sometimes have considered more than the substance of the thing ! i think that it is evident in one million of situation . let 's think for instance at our market , they are full of colored box and bottle and i am sure that everyone of u , at least one time in the own life , ha bought a kind of food or beverage just for how well it wa showed on the box that contained it ! we can think also at the spot on tv , that everyday introduce to u so many kind of , i call them usefull thing , that seems to be the new and perfect solution at a lot of our problem ( and the most of the time they solve just one `` problem '' : how to spend our money ! ) another example come from the fashion world , it is a little bit different from the previous one , but i think that in a different key it can reflect the same problem . how many time we have seen some perfectly slim model that seemed to be healty and , of course , satisfacted by their own body ? and how many time we have heard ( some time later ) that they had a lot of problem with anorexy , their everyday lunch wa a carrot and their life were unhappy ? it ha happened a lot of time i guess . .. now the point is that the society present to u some pattern that are almost never real , or better it show to u , thanks to some advertisement or something else , what it doe want to show to u , but not all the truth ! i think that it is not easy today to not be impressed by the external side of the thing that are around u but , i think also that to not going into a lot of delusion in our life we should start to look behind the appearance of the thing that are presented to u to understand what they really are !
