i agree with this statement which is that , `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' i feel this way because if we go for the product by just looking at the advertisement then we can not really judge a product just by sitting at home and looking at an advertisement . first reason that think that advertisement do n't at all make product better than what they are , is that , what we see can not be true or a right thing most of the time . for example an adverisement on tv showing about a new car launched by some xyz company . well to buy a car we really need to go out to a showroom and have a look at it a well a test drive it . but just by looking at an ad we ca n't predict the way in which a car would be handling at severe turn and bend . well secondly nowadays a lot of advertisemnt endorsing is done by popular face like the actor sportsman and so on . well i saw an advertisement of a bike recently on tv . this bike wa endorsed by rising sportstar . in my hometown a lot of people by seeing this advertisement went to the showroom and bought that bike . well i certainly know from the response from which iam hearing about the bike from my fellow friend is that the bike wa n't even worth a penny . it wa so poorly designed . the electronics the engine wa the major problem concerning that bike . now my friend are complaining to the dealer about their sorry state . so i do feel that by just following an advertisement one should not loose his normal sens and end up buying false product . additionally people who are making these advertisement about the product a well a those endorsing these product do they really use these product ? well it seems to be an interesting question . for example an actor in my hometown is endorsing a product of personal computer and laptop . but recently at a film production unit my friend did see him using a laptop of another brand . this mean that he is sure that the product which he is endorsing is unreliable . mostly we would not find all of the above people who make these advertisement , using these product . they would be using product from more famous brand and reputed one . hence we should not always look at an advertisement an buy the product . in conlusion to the above mentioned point i firmly believe that today advertisement are no more than a fake piece of information that is shown on television to make money out of the innocent people . thus i believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
