different way of learning can be taught by a professor or lecturer in order to make it easier for their student to memorize certain study matter . some believe , that trying to help their student to understand idea and concept is more important than just learning fact . to begin with , encouraging student to develop their own idea and concept about a certain topic and in the end to draw a conclusion , is very likely to have a positive aspect on the student 's memory . for example , if a student in a history class ha the task to think about the way the geman people must have felt at the end of the second world war , and s/he work out their feeling of desperation and hopelessness , s/he ha learned through experience . moreover , through having understood certain idea and concept , a student can basically transfer them to nowadays situation and a well to another subject or theme . for instance , having learned the concept of social behaviour on a specific example and having understood the idea of it , the student will be easily able to observe the social behaviour , it cause and consequence , in his/her own environment and to compare them to other unsocial behaviour and the way it differs in every country and continent . learning fact surely ha it disadvantage in specific exam situation . for example , if a student is beeing asked about when certain historical event took place . especially in the subject of history , learning date by heart is rather important , mostly in order to avoid getting mixed up with situation that happened before another event and to recieve a basic overview of certain period of time . all thing considered , there are more benefit for student , not only in school but for the entire life , to beeing able to use learned idea and concept in a variety of field than to learn fact that can be easily forgotten just after the exam ha finished .
