i agree with having broad knowledge of many academic subject than specialinzing in one specific subject . there are some reason why i think that way . first of all , it is crucial to choose someone 's future once . because it is too early to decide what to study . the more we experience , the more we can choose . we do n't know what we really want to do yet . because , we could n't have such a enough time to think . most university student are not sure about their future . in my case , i choosed french a my major . and i have worked with french . after 2 year , i wa confused if my choice wa right or not . i decided to take some english class and talked to professor about my situation . i could think of my problem enoughly after it . lastly , i decided to dounble major english and french . if i did n't take english class , i would n't know what i exactly want to study in the university because i would n't even know i like to study english . secondly , sometimes people do n't have many knowledge out of their major . and this can make boring person . now day , society want people who have many interest and talent . and we can learn those information from other activity such a other academic subject . from those study , we can explore other major . for instance , there are leisure sport deparment in my university . many of my friend were interested in jazz danses and physical exercise like body building . even though their major wa not leisure sport , they took those class and had a lot of fun . from those subject , not only could they enjoy their campus life but also could make great memory and experience . until graduating from highschool , we could n't choose what i want to study , and we have right to choose many subject and to get interesting information from outside of our major . this can be very helpful in our campus life .
