first of all , i strongly disagree the idea of young people enjoy life more than older people do . i am thinking that older people could enjoy their life . evidently , young people are busy to prepare their future life . specially , after starting school , they spend the most of time to study and learn skill . also , they have a lot of question of real life a they are growing and try to figure out the problelm through talk with friend or parent . they could enjoy life to spend time with friend but this is not enjoying . i would like to say that is one of learning how to stand between people in our society . some young people are not like that i mention in above . they are just spend time for fun . they do not thinking about their future . however , in this case is not only for all of young generation . on the other hand , older people could enjoy their life . they have comfortable time and money . older people who have a career on their job and good health , of caurse they can do . also , it cuold be good model to young gerneration . even my parent usually have a short trip together on weekend . when i see them , i am very envy them and i could have a chance to think about my life . there are many kind of way to enjoy life and everyone do . i support that many older people do comfortably enjoy life .
