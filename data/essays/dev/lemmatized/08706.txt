i agree with that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . the great oppourtinity to go to some different place come . it 's better to go by group and with a tour guide . because , we do n't know the history of the place and we do n't know the manoments of the place . if we have an tour guide , then he know all about the history of the place . while we are having a tour guide , we have no worry about to plan a schedule for were to vist . because , the tour guide know all the place in perticular location or all . he may plane the schedule by our requirments . generally , he know all place and moreover he is having myraid collection for the historic event which we have to know . which is the best place to see first and which is the place to see last . the tour guide guide where we have to stay , approximate budget for the planning of the tour . and he may know the shortcut to vist more place and bording and lodging facautilies . he explains about the place with there people culture , behavoiurs and historic event of that place . we may save the money while we are having a tour guide by his right direction about the shopping , lodging , boarding etc . because , he is having lack of experiance in travelling and in demonistration different place . if we are able to go without guide . then some of the problem will occurs a , we do n't know the specific location correctly . we do n't know where we have vist moreover we do n't know the historic event of the place . we may have a chance to divert the root map . so , it 's better to go with the tour guide who is very helpfull in all different angle .
