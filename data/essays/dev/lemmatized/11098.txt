in these society , most people will spend for 6 to 12 year in different school to study . the main purpose is to gain konwledge . while some student think to understand idea and concept is more important than to learn fact , so they just learn to understand . i do n't agree with that . i think the fact of konwledge is importand a well a the idea and concept . the two con not be without in the process to study . first of all . we should konw the purpose of study really . everyone konw that the purpose is to gain konwledge . but what will we do use the konwledge ? we should use the konledge to become out sklls and abilitise , which could use in the work and real life . for example if a student think understand idase and concepst is more important than to learn fact . he will easly ingore the significant of the fact . and then do n't like to learn them . after the student graduate , they just master many different concept , but he is difficult to find a good job . becouse he can not use his konledge in the work . so learn fact is very importan for the student ' future . on the other hand , learn fact is also a good way to help the student to understand the idea and concept . as we all konw , most of the idea and concept are consist of word and fomulars . they are verg boring for student . while when the student leare the idea and concept , the teacher tell them some fact about the concept . the student will become more interesting and understand the boring concept more quickly . so the fact ii good for the student to learn . the last but not the least , student can learn some experisence and lestens from the fact . the fact are some event , somethings happened in the past or some example of unsuccess . these is very important . if the sutents do n't learn some experience from the fact , they will learn in the future by themselves , maybe form the falure . from all above , i can draw the conclusion that learn fact is very important for student . everyone can not ingorne them .
