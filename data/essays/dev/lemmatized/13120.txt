i do not agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . as far a i know , in my university , there are hundred of club that provide extracurriculer activity for student to join in and many of the club are focus on sevices , including remote primiary school sevices , fisher village sevices and of couse , community service . all of them are part of student ' society service . usually , those severcing club are very popular around student in my university . their common main concern is to help the whole society to become better , but because they focus on different group of people , they devide to various kind of club . these club will recruit new member at the bigining of the semester and then arrange all the member into different group to design helping project . sometimes , it take whole semester to prepare for a big project which may concludes several university and carry out together duing summer or winter vacation . these student really do some miricles to the community , even the society , by donating their idea and effort to go on some activity such a picking up every piece of paper on one specific community , giving a bath to the old who life alone or offering free after-school tutor for child in remote rigion . how could one said that there are no young people willing to spend time participating in those work for simply because there are many student spend thier time right before the computer or in ktv ? however , there are still shortage for human resource when it come to helping the community or society . we need more young volunteer to go outdoor and take part in the project that club or government ha designed . there is always a need for one more hand in any place .
