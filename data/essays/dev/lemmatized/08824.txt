in my opinion , for a student , it 's far more important to understand idea and concept than learn fact . in the procedure of teaching there are two conponments to establish : the fact of learning itself and the interpretation the student may give it to . at first , a student ha to learn the basis of a subject . the teacher 's job is to give him a many information a he can . these information have to be general . a teacher is not an amateur ( a he ha already learned the subject before ) so he ha already his on point of view . the teacher is just here to give general information and in any case he could influence the student ' mind . so learning fact is too tuned on theory and not in practice . then , once the student know the basis , the general fact , he ha to go further from the given-informations by himself , in order to understand all the specific of the subject . i think that understanding idea and concept is something personal . it is something made by oneself . nobody would never ha the same interpretation of idea . it depends on the experience of the student and it possible story or link to a subject . for example , in a theorical course of law , the teacher can teach student the evolution of something in particular like the stance of society with the homosexual marriage . but i think is for more important for the student to understand how this stance ha emerged and learn all the discourse of both of the people for or against it . thus , the student can make his own opinion even if it is not the same a the majority of the population .
