there are a lot of reason and fact that agree with that statement but there are also fact that do not agree with it . in the following i will first talk about young peolpe like teenager and then old people and after come to a reasonable conclusion . young peolpe quite enjoy their life since they are very activ and energetic . they have the power to party and have fun for most of the time . the main factor i would say that they enjoy life more than old one is because they do not have that many responsibilties and worry in life a old people . they are helped financiallz and mentally by their parent so they do not have to work or suffer in any kind of dispute like this . another reason that they enjoy life more is that they probably have so many thing to try out and so many place to visit , since everything is better when you try it for the first time , they have a big advantage there . old people though have also a lot of reason to enjoy life at it maximum . if you have been a nice and fun person throughout your life which could mean that you could have more friend than younger people since you have more experience in friendship than them . when you are an adult , you have a lot more freedom than younger people . so you can do thing that they can not do , for example small incident like going on vacation without anyones permission or making a decision that can affect your whole life style . in my opinion i agree with that statement because even though youg people are more limited in doing thing , it is much more fun and exciting . and you do not have to worry about that many thing like your future , your job or your financial status .
