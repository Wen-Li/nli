having broad knowledge of many academic subject prevents one 's true learning , and therefore is not a reliable way to study , compared to specializing in one specific subject . when i wa in middle school in korea , student had much more subject to learn than in new york , where i live in now . we had to master physics to endineering , and had major test each term . studying the twelve or more subject that i wa supposed to get a high score a possible , i wondered if that type of study really helped me to learn , and achieve what i needed to survive in society . many of the subject , such a engineerng , cooking , or music in my case , were unatractive to me , and most of all , unnecessary for my future . many other student would have similar preoblem . also , it is very hard , or impossible , for a person to master such many subject . one may argue that in order to well adapted in our society , people need multiple number of field which one can do well . for example , in typical company , employee need to be good at claculating and annalyzing informattion , socializing with other people , which might require various kind of skill . however , if one try to maste too many discipline , it is more likely not to be helpful for one 's career , because still , he/she need to be professionally good at only one discipline , which the person will be working on through out the career . the most ultimate reason for studying many discipline is that it prevets one from truely learning something , no matter what it is . when a person have broad knowledge of many subject , it mean that he/she ha no professional knowlegde abut anything . what is the use of knowing so many thing , when one know nothing really useful , valuable , and professional ? why should one struggle to have so many meaningless knowledge that everyone else can easily learn also ? there is no meaning nor fun to have broad and common knowledge of many subject . the fun of learning , and concentrating on one discipline sincerely and truely is at consuming the subject which you love , and which fascinates you .
