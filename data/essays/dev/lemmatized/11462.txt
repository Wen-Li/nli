i agree with the statement . the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . people travel in order to enjoy and take a break from our routine . some people travel for pleasure purpose but the main reason for travelling is to see new place and meet new people . we can not meet new people unless we do not travel in group and a far a seing new place is concerned , we can not know the history of the place without having sumone told it to u . a person who ha all the knowledge about the past present and the future of a monument , city or a country . this knowledge is best given to a traveller by tour guide . travelling alone doe not serve the purpose of travellin itself . we go to new place and want to explore them but we are unable to because we are new to the place and do not know where to go and what to do . a tour guide leeds u to the right place and the tell u thing we would never know if it wasnt told to u . specialy historical monument . there is a reason behind every historical structure ever made and visiting the structure and not knowing when , why and by who wa it made is like seeing the picture in a book and saying we have read it . only a tour guide ha the knowledge and the communication skill to make the people more familiar to a new place . we have heard about the saying ` the more the merrier ' , this is the right way to describe a trip taken in a group . when there are others traveling with u we not only get to know them and make new friend but they also add to the whole experience of travelling by sharing their background , culture and experience . the kind of excitement it add to your trip is worth it . what do people get by tarevlling alone ? not even half the experience of the people who travel in a group led by a tour guide . because they have n't met new people , made new friend , gathered knowledge about the place they have visited . for a person like me who love to talk and make friend and learn from my experience of travelling to new place with new people there can not be a better option for travel other than travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
