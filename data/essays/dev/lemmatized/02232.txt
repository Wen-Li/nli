some one ha ver rightly said , `` it is not the destination that matter , but it is the journey thats the real adventure '' it is not only the destination that you should enjoy you should also enjoy the fun of reaching there , which can only be done in a group . travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best possible way to travel . when you travel in a group you have more fun and you end up doing a lot of activity that you would not do if your travelling alone . man is a social animal and we always like it if we have some one to talk to and some one with whom we can we can share our emotion . when travelling in a group , you have this chance . for instance is you go to an old church and you are in awe at it beauty and archetecural design having some one there with whom you can share these feeling always feel nice . secondly , having a tour guide is major advantage when it come to travelling around in a new city . a the guide is famaliar with the city and the tourist spot in that city . he is the right person who can show you around the city and take you to the right place . if you were to do it alone it would take you hour just to figure out how to go from one place to the other . thirdly , travelling in a group is a lot of fun , a you are never alone and are always with some one , playing chatting or doing something fun . also travelling with people make you try new thing which you would never do on your own . for example if someone in your group like adventure sport , seeing him the other peole in the group would also get motivated to try their hand at it . you might never know someone might actually turnout to be very good at it . thus we see that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is much more fun and adventurous . eventhough the tour guide might charge you some extra money , but he cover it up with the fact that he save a lot of your time and help you relax on your holiday a he is taking care of everything . travelling in a group help you have a holiday in the true sense of the word and let you enjoy to the fullest .
