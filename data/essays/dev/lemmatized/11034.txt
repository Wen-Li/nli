young people now a day do not spend enough time to help their community . i agree with the statement that most of the young people of the present generation do not show any kind of intrest to spend atleast little time of their valuable time . its only because people now a day are enagaged with many thing about themselves that they dont have time to think about the community . young people , considering from shcool age to a person who is working or into a bussiness ha got his own tension . once when he is back from his daily routine work he is tired and want to spend some time in front of the tv or relax for some time . but he hardly think about his communtity or rather about himself . comparing to past , our ancesstors and grand parent were always concerned about their family a well a their community . though they had very le facilties available they made best out of it . with thier communication and interaction with people in the society where a a person of today dosent have time to go and meet his old friend or his relative atleast . i think people should be tought to learn about their society and other peple who are living with them in the society so that he can directly look at the people who are no having any facility and sleeping on the road so that they make out little of their time and money to protect them and care for them . i would like to share one of my experience , when i wa in my college i saw a man who met with an accident lying on the road with blood flowing , none of them showed any concern to take him to the hospital . .. a they were busy tied up with their own work and that they can not spend liitle time for that old man bcause of which we all had to see him dead on the road . i think such thing should not be repeated . every person should involve in the community help the community in one way or the other a much a he can . this show his concern for the people and helpiing nature . right from the scratch they should be tought about moral and about society , patriotic people , one who learns moral never try to neglect his society . and every person should take their time in helping the community . i have seen many old age people who do a lot for the community , the place where i live we dont have medical service for u for which our area people who were all 55 yr old grouped together and made a request to that area head that we are in need of a hospital which can help u in odd time for child and people living in this area . they have taken the risk for the community but people who are young were least bothered about this issue a they were much worried about their career and settlement rather others they were selfish with thier behavior . i think every individual should take part in doing something for the society this give him nothing but self satisfaction which is more than anything for a human .
