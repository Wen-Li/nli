people get education because the knowledge serf a the background setting for young adult which mean that those complex math question or the date for a historical event are not applied directly on the society . thus , if i have to choose between understanding idea and concept on certain subject or learning fact , i would choose to understand idea and concept . there are two reason for agreeing with the statement . the first reason is because if you focus on understanding idea and concept , you can obtain knowledge much easier and faster . this is because when you try to obtain idea and concept to yours , it is easier to concentrate a the process of learning them is fun and interesting . for example , when i get the report card from school , i could divide them into two group . the subject with high grade were the subject i understood the concept and idea very well . the other group is consist of low grade which i considered boring and waited the class to end . as you see from my experience , the quality of outcome differs whether you understand idea or just try to learn fact . this show why it understanding is more important than learning fact . the next reason is that the idea and concept you understand remains for longer time . this reason is conceivable among people . in my case , i still remember the math formula i understand in my high school day . this is because if you understand the idea or concept a yours , it can be applied to other area thereby the formula or other fact can be used and remembered on and on even you become old . to sum up , the two reason presented above show why understanding fact is more curcial than just learning fact . understanding fact help your knowledge be installed in your brain in shorter amount of time with positive attitude towards it , and can be applied to other sphere a well . as i have experienced variety of case related to this statement during my high school life , i strongly agree with the statement .
