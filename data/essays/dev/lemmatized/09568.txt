i am happy . i am young , and i am happy . i never been old in my life so i can not know if i agree or disagree whit the statement , basing myself on my own life experience . but i do can answer basing on what i live since this time and on what i seen around me during this time . and i will say that i agree . their is a lot of avantages in getting older . older people have more freedom ( they can do whatever they wanted to and do not have to ask anyone ) , they earn their life in their own so they are able to plan it better than a young people because they do not have to rely onto their parent . .. but i am still thinking that young people enjoy life more than older people do . their is just much more thing to do , thing to enjoy , for young people . they do not have a much responsabilities than older people , so they do not have a much thing to worry about . for example , i said that older people have more freedom , earning their own life . it is thrue . but what i did not say then , it is that their is more fun , to me , in enjoying life basicly , without any trouble in mind , or much le importants one . furthemore , young people have often much more possibility to meet new people and make new friend than older one . older people have to have a job to earn their life . and most of time , after the fisrt week im their compagny , they will see the same people , collegues , maybe for the rest of their life . a young people , doing his study , meet a lot of new people each year when he come to a new class . he could even meet more new people if he change of university . so young people meet more people , make more friend , have more fun , and have le problem to worry about . .. well , i am also exciting to getting older and have more freedom and responsability every day , but i think that i may regret these year one day ,
