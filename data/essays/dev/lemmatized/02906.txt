i agree , it is the best way to travell in a group led by a tour guide because in group the tour may be fulfilled with full of fun and joy . one can always feel boring to travell a accompained . the tour in group all together can fell like one family a brother , sister , uncle grandfather and grandmother . so there we feel very happy by spending with all the group people and there is no worry a there is a guide who help and show all the location all the way . in group there is no need of a security problem no feeling of lonelyness . in group we may have many concession in the fair and some package which were offered at low rate this wa an advantage for travelling in group . the best example when i 'm in high school we had a tour to newdelhi in meanwhile we enjoyed all the way in the train by singing song , dancing and commenting one another . after reaching there we in group visited all the tourist spot and spent very jolly . it wa the time when i visited the same location alone and i felt very bad , even not intrested to see all the place . another reason is the people with whom do we like to have the tour may is always busy or unable to have time to come with u . so we never feel missing them when we move in group . we dont know the time spent with them it is like a magic me may forget all the thing and move to the new world of dream . everyone like to visit all the place , bu mostly they think about the travelling time and the expences . if we travell in single the expences will be more we should spent moreon the comodities for our need . in the group travellin expences for person to person may vary a the number of person is incresaing cost for head to head may vary . so within the low budget , with security , with company we may have our tour sucessfully with lot of joy and happiness .
