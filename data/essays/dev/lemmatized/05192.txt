scholar 's main goal is to make sure their alumnus have learned their teaching . understanding idea assures them that the student ha a clear image of what wa taught by portraing it into concept . once they have knowledge about these statement and idea they can develop their own , expand the already made or come up with counter idea . all of the previously mentioned force student to keep on with their mental growth . facts are obvioulsly helpful , however that 's a much you 'll get from them . facts will avoid learning because most you do with them is memorize and file them in a redundant folder of your brain . they 'll show up when their convinient ; idea will stick around . i attended a model un annual debate meeting in 2005 . me and my classmate chosen to represent our school in the meeting were newcomer and needed explanation in order to fulfill expectation . we were n't clear about the process . our highly demmandig teacher made u participate in an re-enactment of last year 's meeting and even though it took u a while to get the idea once we got the hang of it we cleared our doubs and understood the concept . model un is not just another extra-curricular activity it wa an opportunity for sucess . we were training our mind to think for others , to speak for the one that ca n't for themselves and to come up with resolution to world wide problem . that is the thruthful concept of the model un and we knew that even before getting there . once we got to la ceiba , model un scenary , we had an ultimate learning experience . our instructor could of listed a serie of fact and sure it 'd help but we 'd have to wait until next meeting to outstand and get the idea . it is always a clever move to be able to have an image of what is the teaching suppose go and not walk blindly through a learning path . therefore , understanding idea and concept is much important than learning fact .
