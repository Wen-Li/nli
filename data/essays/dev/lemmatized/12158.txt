i agree that young people do not invest much time in helping their community . there are many influence on all people , so also on the young one , that are different nowadays and in the past . these influence change people 's behaviour . in the past the personal contact someone had wa within a relatively small area and the dependency on each other wa greater than today . therefore there wa more social community and also young people did their part for the community . nowadays the range of people someone know is spread over a much bigger area so that there is not longer the close relationship to people in your nearby community . there are other factor that encourage young people to focus more on themsleves than on others . in the whole society there is the pressure of being successful with everything that someone is doing . because these people need the time for being successful there is none or only little time left to spend it for the community . also , the interest moved from caring about the community to caring about oneself . mainly people follow just their own business and do not care about others , wether they belong to the same community or not . another reason may be that life is more anonymous than it wa in the past . people do not know each other , even if they live in one house , they might not have been met . if the people do not know their community , why and how should they care about them ? finally i would like to consider the point of responsibility for relative and the money included . in the past family lived together much closer than nowadays . people have another opinion of being responsible . today they do not care that much anymore about their relative themselves , they rather care by spending money that someone take care about the family member . there are many influence today that are different in comparison to the past , that changed the willingness of young people to help their community .
