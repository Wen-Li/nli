i agree with this statement , but i would also say that nowadays are even a lot of young people , who help in their community , but most of them are not be register . i think , the reason why some many young people do not spend enough time or even no time helping their community is that our whole society ha growen during the last century . the result of this development is that our society is anonyme and there are no real community . during the last thirty year , i think , most of the community growed into large city , because of the processe of globalization , which is a mant factore , why community broke and even break . in this case it is not really suprising that many young people do not spend enough time to help their community . another reason , why i think this development is not suprinsing , is that the most city and community do not offer the young people the oppertunity to help . for example in germany , where i live , the government decided to close more than the half of institution where young people can get into and help the community , maybe to plan a party for the whole community or even a special event on eastern . this aspect is also the reason why i say that the most do not recognizes that a lot of young people support the community , because they do it in private organisation or only for their own . so my conclusion is that it is not only the fault of the young perosns that they do not help so much , because they can not change the development of last year and of the processe of globalization and also they can not influence the decision of the government , because most of them are not allow to vote , because of their age . however , i think that young perosns are responsible for the communtiy and so i think they should support them in anyway . i also try to support my communtiy . i live in a village with a large and beautiful landscape . the problem is that this area is shaped into two statepart and so no state think that it is responsible for saving this area . so , the young member of the riding club , included my own , clean it twice a year . however the state government do not realises that .
