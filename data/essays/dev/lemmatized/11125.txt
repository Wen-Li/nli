in today 's world , car are the main kind of transportation used for transportation on land . as the city grow and distance get longer , people need way of transportation more and more in everyday life . therefore , nowadays almost every person that can afford it over 18 and ha a lincence owns a car . if you consider the number of people living on this planet , that would make quite a number . however , on the other hand , way of public transportation are developing , which reduces the necessity for car . so what will happen in twenty year ? first of all , there is the fact that to get from one place to another , you need to have a way of transportation . for most people , in the large city they live in today , it is impossible to get to work or to go shopping or anywhere within walking distance . so , they need to have a car or a way of public transportation . most people prefer having there own car and it 's easy to see why : method of public transportation are slow and unreliable . you never know when the bus is going to come and it 's almost certain that you will be late to wherever you 're going . also , bus go slow and stop many time for passenger to get on and off . metros are usually very crowded and it is very uncomfortable to travel squeezed against people that you do n't even know . taxis are usually very expensive . plus , if you go grocery shopping , there is no way you can carry all your bag unless you have a trunk to put them into . picture yourself in a crowded bus or metro with ten bag full of heavy fruit and vegetable , gallon of milk and juice , meat that is about to get spoiled and ice cream that is melting all over the floor . not very conveniant , nor is it going to work . this is an example of why at least one car is needen for every family . however , there is the growing problem of pollution and traffic . there are so many car that it take you an hour to get home during rush hour when it usually take fifteen minute . plus , when you get to work , or the mall , there is always the problem of parking . would n't it just be great to go and catch a movie or get a bite to eat in the time you use looking for parking space ? that is why shopping mall and working place have started to schedule service bus which will take you directly from home to work or wherever you are going . also , there is the problem of the oil resource running out , and put that aside , car heavily pollute the air . so , instead of twenty people going to a place in separate car , imagine how much it would reduce pollution and traffic if all twenty people used a bus to go there . my opinion is that the number of car will reduce in the next twenty year . governments that are aware of the pollution and traffic problem are developing method of public transportation to encourage their people to use those method instead of car . for example , in the united states , carpool lane have been arranged in big city like los angeles which you can use only if you have more than one passanger in your car . so , in my opinion , the rising public awareness of pollution , the raise in the cost for fuel for car and the development in public transportation will reduce the number of car in the future .
