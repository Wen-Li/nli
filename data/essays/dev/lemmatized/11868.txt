i firmly believe that young people do enjoy life more than older people . as they are young and healthy they can do such thing which older people could only imagine for their day of youth which have already passed . for instance an older person can not participate in an adventure spoort . they can only sit back and relax while watching younger people do it . with their back pain and long list of medicine to take it even hard to imagine it . even if they have a heart to do it and brain to work for it even then they are unable to do it a their body dose not respond to these lofty thought . its easier for younger people to adopt new thing but it is quite difficult for old people to do the same . as a person matures in life even his thought process change . he get more into the guiding thing than doing it actually and in that also generally people dont like guidance they want to learn it on their own by experimenting with it . this further lead to the cut off of elder people from the younger onces . when you dont have much people around life can not be enjoyable . ever wondered why all the player , worker , etc retire after a certain age . its because of their reducing ability and diminishing spirit . an old person ha to give way to a younger one no matter whether he like it or not . imagine life a a coach of a team shouting order at the team player and thinking of the day when he himself ruled the field . he is their not because he wasnt good but because he can not do it any more . to some extent this can be explained biologically a well . at older age your sens begin to diminish and these are the only source of communication with the outer world . in such a condition how can you expect a person to enjoy more . with age body begin to wear down and healing process start taking longer time . older people can not enjoy anything to it limit . everyone must have heard his or her parent or grand parent saying - `` those were the best day of my life . '' a broad grin come on their face when you talk to them about the day when they were young . you can not expect a bigger proof than this when they are themselves admitting it . so it can be concluded without doubt that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
