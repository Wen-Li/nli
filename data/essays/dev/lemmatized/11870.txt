for my part i disagree with the idea that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . this go back to a varity of reason . primarily car today are indispensible to go to work for a lot of people . secondary car are more than that , their use is comfortable . what also matter a lot is the lack of an alternative . and there are no factor prospected , which could chance the need of car during the next twenty year . first of all car are neccessary for many people to reach their place of work . both of my parent can only get to work by car since the way are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportion . if you consider big city , you can not always make use of public transportion . especially in smaller city , where public transportion may only exist in small or even doe not exist at all and taking a bike is not possible either , you really need a car . furthermore i can not see any reason , why this state of being should change during the next twenty year . there will be no doubt . having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exception - the fastes and therefore most comfortable way . since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily . everyone , who one had the comfort of owing a car appreciates it . so i can so no reason in the future whz this would chance , either . lastly we lack an alternative . there is no more convienient way to travel and there are so many job in the car business . in decrease in consume would help to kill manz thousand job . worldwide car producing industry hold so manz job . their falling apart would be fatal . furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business , which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil . here another job giving area exist that manz people depend on . i can not see that the influence politician might chance that . still a lot of car are sold and , in my opinion will be sold . world population doe decrease in the industrial state slightly , but it will not have the effect , that le car will be in use in twenty year . considering the fact it may be a good thing , if there were fewer car for this would help our environment get healthier again . even so the need and lacking alternative will not chance the amount of car during the next twenty year .
