i think success can be achieved in different way , not only by taking risk and chance . in the coming paragraph , different point will be stated and discussed in order to properly analyze the statement given . first of all , success can be a relative term , because for some it may mean owning a private jet and having million of dollar , but for others success could simply be having a good , small business that maintains their family and give them a decent life . not everybody want the same thing , some just want to live a quiet , normal life and nothing more . taking a risk is a possibility , but never a sure thing . also , it 's difficult to achieve succes in life , since it requires many ability from a person . there are many key ingredient involved in the process of maybe achieving success . it take hard work , dedication , being fully prepared and intelligence . usually people do n't acheive success by accident . it take year and year , and sometimes that is not enough . just because a person ha all those ingredient doe n't guarantee them a bright future full of rich . most people have worked hard all their life but have n't gotten anywhere they want to go . another important point is the fact that succes can be achieved by doing what a person already know how to do well . sometimes it 's a simple a that . to work hard at you 're craft and make smart move can equally take you towards success . for example , if a person study economics and end up working at the nycse , he can achieve a fortune by just putting to work all those year of studying he did in college or university . by just applying his knowledge to the stock market and making smart choice , he can become rich , but he can also lose it all . it 's not so much about risk but about making smart choice . in conclusion , i would like to be clear that while many people have taken risk and tried new thing in order to achieve succes , where some have won many more have failed . success is never a sure thing , and even if a person achieves it , the possibility still exists that it wo n't last for long . once you get to the top , the only other way to go is down , sicne it 's not only difficult to reach the top but to be able to stay there . so in the end i do n't agree with the statement given . nothing in life is certain , only death and tax .
