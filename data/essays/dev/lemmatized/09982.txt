i 'm totaly agree with the statement because if the product seller make advertisement for their product it will effect of the product 's sell . for example , in my country some company make cheap product but they advertises it like no one can make this product like u , we are the best . after that , they sell like a million of it . then some people get poision of that product because they use cheap thing . also , in the us , some company give an advertisement to a telvision channel like 10 time a day . they are making their product in asia , because there is no handwork in there . so , they can make whatever they ca n't in us . most country do that , even though a person can make his or her product by himself or herself . because they just print where the product made in . however , people know advertisement is a way to intorduce to sell . so , people could decide either buy it or not . if the producters make their advertisement well , everybody will be agree that the product sell very well . a person can recognize that a product is most powerful or harmful . people should get the idea of the advertisement , if they do n't they can feel like `` what wa that advertisement all about ? '' . so the person will be complicated . finally , if producters want to sell too much , they should make them good . also they should n't use cheap thing . sda asd a asd asd a fsdag ntr rngkj uiy h bby ni ulk
