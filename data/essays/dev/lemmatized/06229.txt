there are two way for training to work and to live . one of these is speecializing in one specific subject , the other is studying in order to have a broad knowledge . in my opinion each of these way ha some advantagesand some disadvantage , but the second is the best . as regard the first possibilty , that is having a specific knowledge , i think that the most important advantage is that who ha a specific education , have a high possibility to find a job , a well rewarding job , in the field where he or she study in depht . indeed , nowadays , firm and company , look for people who can give a sensible help to the firm . students well prepared are a competitive factor that allow firm to gather much money . on another hand , people or student who have a wide range of interest , who study different subject , have the possibility to use the information they gather during their training in order to create a good social life . moreover i think that these people are more flexible in change their work during their life . for these reason , even if at first view , the first kind of knowledge could seem better , i think that , expecially in the liong time , for example during the whole life , the second kind of knoledge is more useful for people . i think so , because i chose to study a subjet in depht , that is management engineering , and i study this subject in depht for making myself more competitive that the others student in the world of job . whene i have some free time i prefer not to spend it in reading because i 'm very tired for my work at university . but when i meet people studing something different from economical , mechanical or industial subject , and i talk with them about something they have discussed in class or they have read in a magazine i alway feel that i 'm incomplete , my education is incomplete , because even if i 'm clever i have n't the basic information to say my opinion about the topic . so i think that everyone should be spend part of the day to read magazine , journal and so on in order to have a rewarding life .
