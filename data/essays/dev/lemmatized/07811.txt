i disagree with the saying that understanding idea and concept is important for a student than it is to learn fact . idea give the student a invoke for what and how a task ha to be done . concept are studied from the earlier edition of book and from some written or , generally saying , from an abstract on wat is already done . concept also mean basic idea of what is to be done . concept is the general background of any subject considered . ofcourse , without concept nothing is done properly , for example taking a major . a student doe not catch up with the course if he ha no idea about the concept or the basic of the course . facts is a very lively word to listen . fact explains which is true , true and only true . fact are the thing to be considered in every particular task . according to me , learning fact always put u in the place where we have to be . learning fact sound to something like behaviour , personal experience , something done . for example , giving a test wchich is relly new to a student . he ha to give many practice test in order to face the experience when on the real test . if the student just go to the test with all idea and fully known concept , it woud not be that good resulting a it would be when he take practise test before . another example is putting up a new business.a man planning to start a new business , he ha to learn the idea , the concept of marketing , and a well the experiense . he ha to observe some businessman , how they work with the daily share . having an idea an the basic knowledge about the business doe not just click into the market . there would be le profit in the work done without learning fact . so , these observation conclude that half knowledge is always dangerous . thus , i disagree with the saying , more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
