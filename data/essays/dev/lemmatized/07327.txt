i do not believe that the given statement is true . indeed , i understand the logic which lie under that assumption but personally , i do n't have the impression that it is a veracity . first of all , it is important to analyse why someone who only meet success is more likely to take risk than somebody else . as a matter of fact , when you succeed a project , you feel satisfied . the more you achieve what you want , the more you become confident . then , it is like a spiral : the more you get , the more you want to get . in fact , when you plan to start a business and it work well , you think about expanding your activity . if it work and you are already at the head of a big company , you may diversify your business . that is why big company like bouygues are in building , mobile phone and so on . virgin make disc but also develops it own mobile phone program . those company take risk , while entering new market . they believe in their success because they are supported by their customer . however , new thing are not always done by successful people . creativity , for instance , ha nothing to do with sucess ; it is about personality . so an artist doe not always meet success . nonetheless , his or her desire to create will still go on . that explains why a lot of painter did a lot of breakthrough after many failure . another example is alain baraton , a famous gardner in versailles . he ha failed during his school year but then , while he worked in versailles he developed a passion for gardening and created new arrangement around the castle . besides , you can not be successful all the time but it doe not mean that you are le willing to do new thing . in addition to that , someone , who really want to be recognised by the society and ha never achieved that goal , will probably try everything he or she can . as a conclusion , success is not so closely tied to ` boldness ' a the statement suggests .
