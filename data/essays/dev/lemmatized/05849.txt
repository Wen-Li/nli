i believe that a strong conclusion telling that having a broad knowledge of academic subject are better than specializing in one specific subject would be faulty . there are both advantage and disadvantage of the two . first , being an expert on a specialized field is unquestionably necessary . the development of science is based on using the knowledge gained by our ancestor . so . in order to make use of previously conducted research on specific topic and to take them to further point , we need specialist . a man having a broad knowledge in many field would not work in this kind of a situation . second , in our daily life , we can clearly observe the necessity for specialist . for example , think of a situation that you are sick and went to the doctor . the first doctor you went to would probably be a representative of a person that ha a broader knowledge on human body . you would expect that doctor to direct you to a specialist for the specific health problem you have . then you would need a doctor specialized on your problem . this situation also illustrates the necessity for both . finally , people that are specialized on a topic may sometimes become blinded by the long time of same kind of work they are dealing with . in such case , a broader knowledge person could see the big picture and would be more beneficial to solve the problem . to illustrate , industrial engineering , which is my major field , requires seeing the big picture in a company a we try to solve the problem in it . when we deal with the problem stated by a department in the company , we observe that the department doe not consider the possible cause of the problem which can actually be caused by any other department . so , this experience of me from summer internship indicates the possible disadvantage of working on the same topic all the time . in conclusion , we need both specialist and people having broad knowledge since they are both needed for solving the problem of human being in the real life . so , a clear conclusion that one of the position is better than the other would be very misleading .
