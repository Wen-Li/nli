i agree with this statement . i think successful people take risk and try new thing rather than just doing the same thing . trying new thing make people to realize about their new side . when i wa in south korea , i wa a successful student . i studied really hard to get good grade in middle school . i wa always making a from korean class . i loved to study korean literature and i wa successful writing creative story and poem . one day , my dad suggested me to study in america . he thought i could experience new culture and learn new language . i wa really concerned when i heard about my father 's suggestion . i thought i wa only capable to learn korean . moving to america seemed really difficult for me . for a long time , i thought about advantage that i can get from america . i had an opportunity to learn a new language and i could experience western culture . after 3 month , i decided to leave south korea . i took a risk to go to america and i wa ready to challange myself . when i first arrived at dallas , i wa amazed by the size of my high school . there were so many great student and teacher . it wa difficult for me to follow the class but i did n't give up . i always studied after school and i tried to speak with student from different countires . this made me to develop my english skill . i studied really hard and now i am very satisfied with myself . i am making good grade at school and i made a lot of friend . also i am learning spanish in my school . the thing that seemed impossible are happening now . the risk and change developed me a a more skilled and better person . i think i made a good decision . coming to america gave me opportunity for my future . i am not going to stop from here . i am planing to learn about journalism and photography . these are the thing that i have never studied before . i think taking risk and trying new thing made me to develop . i learned a lot from new experience and i am pleased with it . i will keep learning and i am confident that this will make me a a successful person in future .
