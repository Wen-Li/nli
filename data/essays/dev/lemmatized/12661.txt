many people lose thier life , thier job , or maybe thier family . all of them were not learn from other 's fault . successful person who ha many choses that help him in his life . so , what we lose if we learn one more thing in our life . actually , by learning from the life we come more open minded . we read every day about the most ritch people in the world and all of them are the example for successful person . they have a job beside some buisness . they know that the life is difficult , so they learn every day how to extand thier own . i agree with this statement , because i have a personal experince in this field . long time ago , after i graduted from univesity , i wa looking for the best career form me with a high salary . so , after while i found what exactly i want . it wa wa a good position in a commomn company in my country . i got a perfect salary every month , but i wa asking myself is it really enogh to reach to my goal ? actually , no , because i have to save some money preparing to my weeding day . i have to buy house , car , and puy for the day . after a while i decided to join to the stock market . it wa the risk step that i ever take it in my life . also . it is really good to learn about new thing and how to successed . i came to u. s. to get master degree , but not in my same major . my major is mining engineering and i will study here environmental engineering . i do that to have more than one chance . i can work in mining field or environmental a well . in conclusion , the person could be successed in his life , but he will not lose anything if he try to learn a new thing . in addition , the life by itself teach u a lot of thing every day just we have to open our mind .
