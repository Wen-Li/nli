as i am a advanture liking person , i doe not agree this statement . to enjoy any tour that must be in group but that need not to be guided by any guide. reason for my this thinking are a follows : firstly , guide is a professional person . his aim will be only one and that is to make his coustmer go arround the each of the visiting point without giving the time to enjoy that place fully . if we all friend together can make our own way by our own . secondly , without a guide you can travel by your own convenience . for example , last month i wa gone to a tour for bombay ( boolywood city ) , lonavalla and khandala ( tourist place ) with my collage friend . these place are very beautiful and full of natural scence . over there we had hire a guide to take u to different place . that guide rounded all the place within one and a half hour . many place were there to which he shown u from a long distance . i and my friend requested him to spent fraction of time over every place ,, but unfortunatly he doesnot allowed . our bad luck . but for another example , last year me with my relative gone to the tour without the guide . the place wa definatly unknown to u . but by our own afforts we reached to that so i donot prefer to have a guied on tour .
