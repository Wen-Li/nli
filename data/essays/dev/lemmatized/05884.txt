some people disagree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . however , i agree with the statement for the following reason . first of all , a famous person who advertises product may make u misunderstand the product . for example , i bought a new car three year ago . because a new car wa very high for me , i searched a lot of car by using internet and talking with salesperson . this searching process continued for about five month . however , the most important factor to buy my car wa the t.v. commercial that ichiro , who wa the most famous baseball player in japan , advertised the car . i loved him very much and if i bought the car , i would feel to be close to him . however , this decision resulted in failure since this car had a lot of problem . if ichiro had not advertised this car , i would not have bought it . this experience definitely demonstrates that a famous person who advertise product may make u misunderstand the product . additionally , advertisement often emphasize on only merit of prodctus . for example , i bought a new computer last year . because his computer wa advertised a the cheapest and latest machine , i decided to buy it very quickly . however , i found that the most of the software , such a `` word '' and `` excel '' , were not incorporated in it . generally speaking , familiar software are incorporated in a computer in japan . however , this advertisement did not express this weak point . if had have all of the information about the computer , i would not have bought it . this example clearly explains that advertisement often emphasize on only good point of product . in conclusion , i definitely agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
