should we learn or should we understand ? this question may have been a debate for age . everybody wonder if he had better to learn or to understand . but could we really understand without learning ? i agree this the statement , because i really think that it is not always helpful to learn by heart . i think it is more important to understand something and to develop our critical judgement . but both are really important . nevertheless , i think we should learn in order to be able to understand what happen is our life or in our society . let 's take an example . if we want to understand a politic debate or we want to vote . we should know and learn what is a republican or a demorcrate , in order to vote right . in our life , we always need to know something to understand it . thus the importance of learning . however , we should be carful of not learn without understanding , which is completly stupid . an example may be when somebody ha well learned how to write word . if he doe not practice or understand how to make a sentance , it is completly useless to know word . despite the fact that learning by heart something could be very boring , we should be able to do it . because the more we will have learned a subject , the more we will be able to talk about it and to understand it . so if we learn how is the american parliament , we should better understand the role of g. bush for example . therfore , i think that we should not decide only to understand or only to learn . these two notion should go together , they are complementary . although nobody really like to learn by heart , we must do it , in order to understant better what happens in our life or in our societz .
