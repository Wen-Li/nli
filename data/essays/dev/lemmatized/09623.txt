i definitely agree with the statement at hand . in fact , in my opinion , this is the main goal of education itself . education should give to the student main idea and concept , thing that the student can absorbe , make their own , and use a a basis for further education or even for their choice in life . facts are like evidence in a trial , thing that support the main idea and concept . the student have to read the fact , understand them and , even more important , understand how the fact give an example or an explanation of the main idea . they are very important for the understanding process , but at the end they are notion , they are something specific that we learn at eventually we forget . on the contrary , what really last in our memory is the main idea , the concept and this is the very important thing . the first example that i can cite is history . when we study history we study a large number of fact , date , event , meaning that we learn a large amount of notion , that we are most likely going to forget in the future . but all these fact are necessary to understand what happened in a specific period and to analyze the cause and effect that took place in those year . the fact are the instrument at our disposal to build a broader vision of the period at hand and to have a general idea of the economical or sociological or religious force that interacted in that historical moment . even if we eventually forget the specific date or fact , we still keep a concept , an idea of what wa happening in the past . moreover i think that it is sometimes even impossible for our mind to store and remember all the notion and information we read . computer database are in fact very good instrument to store and retain information . our mind , on the contrary , ha the wonderful ability of elaborating information , putting them together and drawing conclusion , in form of main idea and concept . again , we see what is really important : idea and concept . in conclusion i definitely agree with the statement at hand a i demonstrated with the example i gave .
