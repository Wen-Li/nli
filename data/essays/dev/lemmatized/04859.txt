i agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are two reason for this : more active than olders and having experienceis . first of all , young people is more active than olders . therefore , they have so many energy to do everithing . for example , body condition is quite defferent between young poople and old people . when our family trisd to hike the mt . fuji which is the most biggest mountain in japan . sister and i could get to the top . hoeever , my parent could not do that . moreover , obiously young people 's body function is better than olders . if the have examine of body , the result is easy to expect . thus , young people have to enjoy their life . second of all , young people need having a lot of experiencies . they are young so much . their experiencies are naturally poor . older people already had experienced a lot of thing . and , they steped to be an adult which mean that they can decide thing themselves . in conclusion , i support that young people enjoy life more than older people do . if they enjoyed their life , they will be a good person .
