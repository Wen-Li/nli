this topic reminds u of the popular question `` what is better : quantity or quality '' . the essay is going to focus of the advantage and disadvantage of having a broadng knowledge of many academic subject versus being specialized in a particular one . the first part of our essay will enumerate and expalin the advantage of each of them and the second part would discus the disadvantage . the elementary and seconday education is mostly an all subject teaching rather than a specific . it give the student the opportunity to have an idea of the different field of study and also give them a variety of choice a per their future career or postseconday education . in may case the student ha enough time to see if he would choose a particular option or career orientation . for example a student who take physic and biology ha various choice of career : he could decide to go into the technical or engineering field or the medical field . in the other hand a student who focus on a particular subject would definately excell in it in the future because of the time spent studying it . this is particularly true for student in technical school , who choose their career option from the elementary or seconday level . a student whop attend an aviation maintenance school from his secondary level would have all the necessary tool to succeed in aeronautical engineering for example . recalling tghe popular say `` jack of all trade and master of none '' : we see that student who focus on too many subject end up not mastering any . having a broad knowledge of many academic subject could lead to more confusion also when the time come to choose a specialization . in the other hand being specialized in only one subject reduces or limit your option for a future career and also expose you to the economical and geographical change . after specializing on only one subject and the career is no more attractive , we will be forced to change orientation and start at fresh . an exanple of a student who specializes in nursing from seconday level would only end up enrolling for a nursing degree in in conclusion we would say that what is better depends greatly on the individual and his ability to use what he ha learned .
