i do not believe that in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . many factor contribute to my belief . these factor include the current state of driving , current driver and development in the area of driving . through this investigation , it will be shown why i disagree with the statement . the current state of driving today , is one that ha morphed several time , to reach where it is at . before car ever existed , people found other way of transport such a boat and horse . the general aim wa to be transported or transport item from place to place . the first car that wa produced , revolutionized the transportation system . people became more time efficient in reaching where they want to arrive at . technological advance are made everyday , so a car started to become faster , people started to lose sight of the purpose of a car . now faster car constitute faster driver . people now place more importance on the pleasure of speeding and performing stunt , rather than getting to where they need to be . this state of driving ha an effect on the driver . today , we find that more adolescent are interested in car than before . as young adult , they enjoy extreme and risk , and the young age at which they are granted a license doe not help . most accident in my country of bahrain are attributed to speeding of young people , and the fact that the mortality rate increase each year , seems to have no effect whatsoever . now , for a driver seeking an adrenalin rush and a living on the edge attitute , the right technology ha to be developed . as i mentioned before , car today are faster and technologically better than before . we should acknowledge that advancement will not cease , and if we take other life factor into consideration , we see that car are demanded and are needed even more . as job requirement relating to car change , so do car expectation . new road are always being built and so faster , more reliable car need to be engineered according to the newly built road . no matter what is done to reduce car usage , such a increasing the age requirement , or investment in other mode of transportation , i believe that people can not give up on car due to the privacy and efficiency it provides . logically speaking , if the world progress we go forward , not backward , and so in conclusion , forward to me mean more car and not le .
