today is an era of compititons and for surviving in this competitive age man ha found various trend . publicity is one of the trend man us to increase the popularity of his product . so i m kind of disagree with the statement that `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' now a day we get to see big celebrity like tv and film actor and actress and even sport person flashing every now and then on the television endorsing a product or in a news paper . . pepole may fall for these trap and can end up havin a product which is actually not worth of those huge amount if not inspected properly . i cant deny the fact that , sometimes in competing with the similar brand these advertisement do show some false statement and just because people trust these brand ambassedors blindly , end up buying that product . so thats why i dont completely disagree with the above statement . but at the same time in my opinion , viewer should see these advertisement vigilantly and before buying them they shuld examine the product and check out the validity of the statement and claim made in those commercial . it is the duty of the customer to keep in mind that there are some agency who overrate their own product to improve the sale . also , in a country like india there is a governing body called `` iso '' which check the authenticity of product and after series of close inspection give them the authority to be sold in the market . so with such authority lik `` iso '' overrating a product and advertising is not easily possible . advertisemnts help the viewer to discriminate the good and bad quality of the product by comparing it with other similar brand . it also creates awareness in the mind of customer about the newer and technologically advanced product . so in conclusion , keeping in mind the advantage of advertising we cant make a generalised statement that product are made to seem better than they really are . it is a a `` customer '' our job to check the authenticity of such product .
