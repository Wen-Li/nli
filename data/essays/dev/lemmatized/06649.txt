someone suggests that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . but i quite disagree with it . first of all , i like to enjoy the journey in my own way . i always like the pleasure of freedom . arranging the travel is a hard work , but it is quite intreseting . but to be led by a tour guide , i have to obey the instruction he make . i have to follow the whole group to go to somewhere i do n't want to , i have to go to the place ordered by tour guide , eat the food ordered by tour guide , even go to toilet at the time fixed by tour guide . so we hire a tour guide or we hire a commander ? furthermore , the tour guide always say the same thing just like the travel book . i can see it in the hotel , or through the internet , why i should hire a tour guide for this ? second , which is even worse , is that tour guide only have most profitablt route , so there are many place i can n't find a tour guide . especially for some very exciting undeveloped district , it 's very hard to get a tour guide . last time , some friend and i wanted to go the a moutain in our province , after we explorered all the website of the tour company , none of them had this route . we had to go by ourselves . third , someone acclaim that traval in a group led by a tour guide will save money . it make sense sometime . but business is business , you have to pay extra money for the guide not the journey itself . moreover , some tour guide will bring tourist to shop , mall but not the place we want to . just because this shop , mall will pay tour guide for bringing business . i even heard that some tour guide cheated and blackmailed the tourist about eating , transportation , etc . it 's quite difficult to find a good tour guide . to sum up , i do not like to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
