traveling in a group and being led by a tour guide ha both advantage and disadvantage and the consideration about whether it is a best way of traveling or not depends on many factor . suppose you are a busy working man and you want to spend your vacation or annual leave . you have a week or two and you plan to go somewhere . first of all , most people want comfort in such case and they would want go to the major sightseeing . in such case , organized tour led by a guide is the best option : the tourist company will arrange everything for you - all you have to do is enjoy . the guide will tell you what most traveler would like to know and you do n't have refer to a book to find out about the sightseeing you 're at . you are free of all the uncertainty and risk involved in traveling alone and being responsible for yourself . but traveling in a group led by a tour guide ha several restriction and they are even frustrating if you are seeking adventure or totally personal experience . i felt it personally when i went to a turkic tombstone in rural mongolia with a group of tourist . the tombstone wa awsome at least for me for i wa interested in turkic history . it had inscription on it and i wa badly wanting to try to read it on my own ( i once spent some time trying to learn the old letter ) . but the group had only 2 hour to spend there and i had to leave the tombstone with them too because other member of the group did not share the same interest and the schedule said that we should be at the tourist camp by 4 o'clock . i felt so frustrated that i decided then that i will go there alone sometime afterwards . so this example of mine illustrates the bad point of guided travel - you 're not free to decide where to go or where to stay for how long . you ca n't actually , if i can put it this way , `` taste '' the activity and the place because the experience is not all yours : it rather turn out to be a group experience and it doe not give you that feeling when you find do something , think about something out , experience something on your own without being distracted . personally , therefore , i prefer to travel alone if i have enough time but at the same time , i agree that organized travel can be useful and enjoyable experience if you doe not have enough time or if you are not really into the destination of your travel .
