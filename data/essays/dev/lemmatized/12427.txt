i agree with the statement that say that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , if i go back in time and i start to do some memory of my time a an student at school and at the university , all those thing that i learned it wa because i understood the idea and concept that my teacher explained to me and my classmate . when i finally understood the process of the french revolution i never forget it , because i did n't learned it a a fact . second , is really great when you get the concept of the different thing and you can start to make some interesting relation between them and with the experience of your own life . i think that is nice when you can make question about what you learned and give some conclutions about it . i also found that is nice when you meet with friend and you start a conversation with them , talking and exchanging idea of all those thing that in a moment you learned and understand them . i really have a very good time when i have those kind of opportunity to share with friend what i have learned and also to be sure that i can do my own statement . futhermore , i consider that facts are too weak , you learn this fact for the test and then you erase them . is like a foreing learning , from one moment to onother it flyes away , from your mind . instead , when you really understand the idea or concept yo can be sure that this knowlege will never forget , never more . finally i can say that , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
