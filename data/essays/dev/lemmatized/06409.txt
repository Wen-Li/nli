i disagree with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' , because i think that when you travel and you want to see new thing is better to have your own time and to manage your time acording to your preference and your need . sometimes when you are traveling and you have to be whit a guide and with a group of people , you dont have enogh time to look at the thing you like , to analize the thing you see , or the time to enjoy the thing you like best . for example , for me is very important not only to see the monument and learn about the history of a place , but to teast the food of the place i 'm visiting , and to have time to talk with the people that live their . in conclution i believe that not everybody ha the same interest when their are traveling , and that many time a good book can replace a guide , it is only a matter of reading about the pleace your visting . so i would recomend to buy a good book , look for information in the internet , and then take all your time to do the thing you really like , to enjoy your trip .
