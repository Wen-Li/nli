i agree with this statement that it is much better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject , because if you just one way to a solution , sometimes you can not be able to make a solution , so it is very important to have a broad knowledge . for example you are only able to write with your hand and you are not used to write on a pc , you will get in troble in many situation in daylie business live . an other problem can be , if you are specialized and someody want to dicuss an problem with you which is also imprtant for you to get aware of but you can not say anything because you do not understand what the problem mean to others . that is a big problem in our society , because everyone is kind specialized in one 's own life and you often see only your problem whether other 's have much more problemes . the next problem for specialized people is , that they normally can only do one job in their whole life . i think if you get rid of the job you do , it is much better to have the ability to change it and that will be much easier with an broad knowledge . but if you are specialized in one specific subject it will be very hard to get an other job without losing time by taking course to ` improve ' one 's knowledge . not to forget the money you can not earn in this period o time . as a result i would say that a broad knowledge give you much more quality of life and a higher varety of job .
