i agree with the statement that successful people are more adventurous and brave than ordinary people . it take a lot of effort and time to be successful . the succeful people try new thing starting with established knowledge and belief . in order to be considered successful , one need to practice beyond what is perceived ordinary and common . by experimenting new thing based on common knowledge and belief , one can be able to find a new way to reach or meet what is demanding beyond the common practice . the successful people also do not afraid of taking risk . they are further brave than ordinary people . they try new thing that enables them to find a solution that others have not yet found by doing thing in common way . to be considered successful , one need to have creative perspective and exceptional mindset in viewing a society . such a character can only be built by by trying new thing in spite of making error and taking risk . without adventuring risk and trial , one is only considered to be ordinary and common .
