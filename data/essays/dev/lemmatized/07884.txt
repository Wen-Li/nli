i do not think that in twenty year there will be le car in use than today . it is no likely to happen because automobile represent a huge engine for today 's economy and some people wo n't let their gold mine to be closed . for example , let think about the tire industry and the position of goodyear or pirelli about the decrease in the number of car in the near future . i have no doubt they would use a many resource a they have to undermine every idea or project that could result in a contraction of their market . another example is the fuel industry , better said the business of mobil , bp , texaco and a few more brand . they have been investing billion of dollar trying to avoid the development of alternative source of energy for automobile . their biggest business is to produce car 's fuel and they wo n't let it go so easily . if they are contrary to car transformation , logically they will fight fiercely against automobile diminishing . another example of how economic issue wo n't let the number of car go smaller is the fact that public investment in the western country consists mainly in road building . about 50 % of the public budget all around the western country are used to aloud car circulation . if the number of that kind of vehicle radically go down , it will produce a huge administrative collapse since the traditional political economy would be mennaced . in conclussion , neither the tire industry , nor the fuel producer or the public planner and administrator of the western country will aloud the number of car in use to decrease . in fact , i think in twenty year the economic pressure around the car related industry and economic field will not only impede the decrease , but will boost the automobile use .
