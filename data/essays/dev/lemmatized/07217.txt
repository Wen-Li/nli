the speaker hit truth when he say that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . commercials were originally a mode of informing consumer about the availability of a product . but over the year , the sheer innocence of an old banner proclaiming the opening of a new kfc restaurant in the neighbourhood ha been lost in the relentless wrath of commercialisation . today , a commercial informing the viewer of what the product actually is would not even be noticed , much le lure prospective buyer to a hopeful brand . in the deadlock of efficient brand we find ourselves in today , advertisement need to be one step ahead of each other , a phenomenon previously seen only amongst the firm employing them . and this very much involves enhancing the feature of the product they endorse . the world of advertising revolves around competition offered by others , and that ha brought it to such a stage where enhancing a product is a common practice . probably the most appropriate example would be that of a recent advertisement my eye fell on a few day back . it promised of a `` mansion draped in greenery '' , but the actual house wa ironically different . it wa a modest two bedroomed flat , hardly something you could refer to a a mansion . but sometimes advertisement cross the limit of what would still be classified a acceptable . perhaps the most blatant of these are the one employed by the automobile industry . in a recent controversy , one automobile dealer in new delhi wa fined and barred from operating for a year because he had promised a prospective buyer a sedan , which turned out be be a mess of pure lie and thievery . although sheer malpractice is evident in this `` enhancement '' of product , some people still advocate the validity of these advertisement . a recent survey in the united states of america brought to light a staggering number of people who see nothing wrong in this new trend . it only go to show one thing ; that we have learnt to live with it and although unwanted , it ha become an integral part of advertising today . so much so , that all you need to do to be sure of it is look into the local newspaper . even though it might not tickle our fancy , if statistic are anything to go by , this practice is here to stay .
