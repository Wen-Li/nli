some people try to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , while others wish to specialize in one specific subject . i believe it is more preferable to first have vast knowledge . first , knowledge is good for my child . if i have more knowledge , i will be able to educate my child better . my father used to teach me thing that i did not learn at school . for example , my school did not teach why water is formed around a glass of cold water . i wa always curious about it , and it wa my fater who told me the answer . as my father taught me , i want to do the same thing to my child . in addition , the chance of getting a job increase . let 's say that i took geometry , biology , and psychology in college . although i did not specialize in one subject , i still have a lot of information in each subject . i can be a math teacher , a worker in biological museum , or a guidance counselor at middle school . what will happen if i specialized only in geometry ? once i can not be a geometry teacher , i will have nothing to do , but just wait . finally , i can pick a subject and specialize in it later . i will experience and evaluate the subject while i learn many subject . after the education , i will have a pretty good idea which subject fit my interest . using the same example a before , let 's assume that i became very interested in biology . people say there is no end to learning ; i will not hesitate to take biology again and go deeper into it . in conclusion , i think learning a variety of subject is important , because it allows me to teach my child , get a job , and specialize in subject that is suitable for me .
