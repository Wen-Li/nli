this is a very important issue with respect to the community and the youngster who are part of this community . the issue which doe need the attention and analysis . although it is not that whole young crowd ha become indifferent to helping the community but i certainly believe that looking upon it wholly , the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping the community . there are several reason for my acceptance of the statement and i would like to state them in the following paragraph . the main reason i feel this is because today youngster have become too narcissist . they are all self-centered and bothered about their personal progress . this is due to the ever increasing competitiveness . in this competitive world , to catch up with the pace each youngster is busy polishing himself/herself for the contend . and in this course he remisses the community . he is too worried about his own progress and achievement to look into the community matter . each of them want to be the best and they dont want to afford wasting time on others . the other reason which make me accept the statement is the prevalence of the corruption , violence , robbery , murder etc and whole lot of crime taking place . if the youngster gave enough time to the well being of the community , would n't be the scenario different ? all those murderer , robber , rapist constitute of whom ? are n't the major chunk of them the youth of the community . instead of being helpful to their community they are becoming the cause of all sort of suffering and trauma to the community , i must say . further , i feel that youngster are not contributing to help the community because they are getting away from moral value and discipline of the society . todays youngster want to be more independent and doe not want to be taught all those lesson of helping others . what he learns from the today growing technological world is how to make himself modernize and how to cope up with rest of the competitor . admist this , he doe not care for the community . for example , today most of the young people spend half of their time on internet . now , by exploiting internet what are the possibility of them using it for other 's sake or to help someone compared to the possibility of chatting , browsing , looking for job opportunity , searching for institute for further education etc . certainly , the probablities of utilizing it for personal benefit is quite higher . all these reason and example make me accept the statement that nowadays , youngster are not much interested and hence not devoting much time to help the community . this can be attributed to their ignorance about the well being of others and zeal for personal holistic development .
