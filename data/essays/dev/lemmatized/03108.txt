there is one or two thing make a country more powerfull and more beatiful . on of them is young people in the country . if they can work for their community good they can make their country very beautiful too . however i think it so hard to set young people for this type action . because they grow up so stupidly and so lazy . they have been train from their parent to act like these . at this time young people start to think their self more than otherthing when they are a little child . they force their family to do their want with cry and other thing to whichs are family dont see in their child . they act like this beause family dont give them to thinking to understand what happened in the world and what should them do to survive in this wolrd . they grow up and enter a world which they dont know to live with . they are not ready to see real world how can they live in this world . they did more thing when they are growing but they dont give time to understand their community . so how can they help to their community even if they dont know their community requirement . howevet i think this is not young adult fault . this is their parent fault , this is fault of who manage their country or their world . because of all of these young people do not give time to helping their community . yes i accept this 's not all of their fault . they can easily trained to be good child , good citizen and so good people . we can solve this problem with some formules if we are really want to solve this . we can give our teen responsibility to their community . we can give them good opportunity to think more and help their community .
