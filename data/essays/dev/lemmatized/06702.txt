i think it depends on individual 's preference . someone like to trip in a group led by a tour , and others do not . i 'm a person of the latter type and i disagree with that statement . i do n't like to travel in a group led by a tour guide , because travel in a group led by a tour guide will deprive flexibility from the trip . it is true that relying on a tour guide is comfortable . someone should think that even planning where to visit is bothering . a group trip led by a tour guide is suitable for such a person . tour guide are professional to plan and to travel safely . the trip led by a guide should be easy and safe . traveling in a group led by a tour guide , however , lack flexibility in the plan . in some city , there are too many famous place , and traveler are forced to choose some from them . in london or new york , for instance , we have to spent three or four day in a museum if we try to see every thing exhibited there . in such a case , traveler should obey the plan of the tour if they participate in a tour led by a tour guide . a people who are especially interested in art and want to stay longer at a museum should prefer traveling freely . sometimes i change my plan during a trip . when i visited germanany when i wa an undergraduate student , i planned to visit five city during the one week trip . at the first place i visit , however , i wa so impressed by the beautiful scene of a river and castle that i changed my plan and stayed there for one week . consequently , i visited only one city during the trip . when we travel , we often encounter impressive scenary or event at the place we visit during the trip . traveling in a group led by a tour guide do not allow u to change the plan stay there for longer time than we planned before .
