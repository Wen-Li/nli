it is true that there are many reason such a increasing number of using public transportaion that support decline of car supply . however i have other opinins why there will be more car on the road instead of decline . first people try to have their own car personally , not one in a family . in family , for exaple , father need his car to go his workplace . mother need her car to go her workplace . even though she doe not have job , she also need car to use pick up her kid or go shopping . there is also demand from child when they grow up and become age of owinig a car ; when they go to colloege . as a result all member need . therefore each person need car . as a result , increasing car in society . second , trend of living a little distance from workplace increase demand of car . nowdays korea people , internationally also , prefer to live 30min . to 1hr . distance from their work . this mean they need automobils to go their work . for insatace , my professor who life one hour distance from college , ha her own car . she come school every morning using her car , not subway . it is true that there is increasing number of people who use public transportation to save money , oil or etc . however , this doe not mean they do not have car . they have car their own but just use public transportation in order to save money . when they are run out of time , when they feel tired to waitng bus , or when they want to go somewhere where public transportation do not go , they will take out their personal car and drive . therfore , the need of owning car each of one person , the trend of move distance from workplace make increasing of car demand . futhermore , even though some people use pblic transportation , they surely posse car . a a result , there will be more car in the road than now .
