i completely agree with the point that it is always best to travel in a group led by a guide . guide is a person who is especially appointed by the govt . for the benefit of the visitor . he is capable of providing explicit information about the tourist place . so why not to take the benefit of the service provided when one is in a group . suppose you are travelling down in india with a group of friend . here the inscription giving tourist place 's technical detail are very limited . so a guide will thoroughly relish one with the date 's , histroy and all it related matter . moreover if the guide is not hired it might happen that some of your friend may go to other direction a per their interest , loose the fun of being together , acknowledge le information . it 's always greater fun to be together while visiting place . else one may get bored . so if a group ha hired a guide it will be rather involutary that the group will stay bonded . so there 's no risk of loosing someone behind on the trip . the process of seeing new thing will be extrememly sequential and meaningful because the guide will proceed step by step giving out inrtrigue infromation . the group member might have some doubt regarding the monument . so it might happen that one might be able to understand the history better based on other 's doubt . they could even discus more thing if they have come on a school assignment trip for the history class . also the guide will not dare to skip thing inorder to save time and get more money a he fear the number of people . it usaually happens in india though . but more the people , greater the interest and this directly affect the enthusiasm of the guide . a group could even share the tour guide 's expense so they could hire better guide than an individual . it 's more a harmless option giving all the group member equal benefit with all the fun combined with travelling .
