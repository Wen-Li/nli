advertisements are seen all over . they catch public attention in newspaper , television , billboard . nowadays advertisement are also seen in cinema . but i personally feel these advertisement are often exaggerating . advertisements usually do n't mention hidden cost , do n't mention the efficiency of the product and hence deceive people . first , the advertisement projected nowadays do not mention about the hidden detail they have for a particular product . for example in the master card advertisement the advertisement mainly portrays the advantage like le interest rate , surprise gift . but they do not mention a detailed information about the product . my friend received a bill for 500 $ just because he crossed the due date , which wa not mentioned to him when he bought the card . moreover for the gift they give to customer they actually demand money from the customes . another example about such hidden cost is in the mobile phone industry , last month i got a call from my service provider and they launched a new offer which they mentioned it wa free of cost . but when i activated and started using this facility my bill started to shoot up . the service provider did not mention about the usage cost . second , the advertisement do not mention about the efficiency of the product . for example , i started using a calculator from a local market . but the calculator did not work for more than two day . it did not respond to several button . the advertisement which i referred did not mention about the life of the calculator . another example is when i bought a blackberry the advertisement said `` free bluetooth headsets for every blackberry '' . but it failed to work after one month . finally , advertisement primarily deceive people . they project the product in a bigger size in television but actually the seem to look so small . moreover they mention that that the entire product is free and once we go and buy they would say that the scheme is under exchange . several such way are followed by company to fool the public . for the above mentioned reason , advertisement are depicting an entire wrong picture of the product and tend to exaggerate the product . i personally believe that company must project correct fact about product .
