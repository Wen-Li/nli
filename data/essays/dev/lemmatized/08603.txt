being committet to your community can have various form . it start from helping your family in it daily chore , taking care of the neighbour ' house while they are away or spending some time in charity organisation . at the core of all the above is the recognition that we are not just individual , but part of a community . there is also the sense of gratitude for one 's gift in life , such a youth , health or any skill , and the sense of enrichment that come from sharing those gift and making them useful to others . overall i agree with the idea that young people do not seem focused enough on the need of their community , and i actually think that they are fairly detached from the concept of community altogehter . i think this is a very complex phenomenon and linked to a great number of reason . first of all , it seems that our society and culture put a high value on time , especially spare time . partly because modern life is very demanding , partly because the offer of entertainment and outdoor stimulation is so varied , we praise our time a a supreme luxury and feel very frustrated when we can not use it in complete frredom . secondly , i think western society have developed more and more in a hedonistic direction . in other word , we feel it is our own right to enjoy ourselves , feel free in our choice and simply follow instant gratification . i think this is particularly apparent in young people , a they claim they right to play and have fun , and resent any request of help or support a a form of injustice . in a dominant culture of self-absorption and pleasure , taking the time to communicate with people that are different , for background and frame of mind , seems unjustified and this lead to another worrying trend . it seems to me that there is a general detachment between young people and older generation or people in need . these are generally the people that need more time and support within the community , and it would be the duty of the younger generation to look after them . in conclusion , i think that value that have become more and more present in our society are now central in young people 's vision of life . as a consequence , there seems to be a more selfish conception of one 's use of time and gift , that unfortunately lead to the neglect of part of teh community that might be in need .
