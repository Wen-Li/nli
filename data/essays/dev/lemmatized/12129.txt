i think successful people trying new thing and taking risk when doing new thing is better than doing what they already know . i agree with the successfull people , because if the people are successful for wat they are then they can be able to think for new thing . obviously while trying new thing risk may taken place , but if we are worrying about the risk then no one can be successful in their life . for example the scientist will produce new thing by taking may risk if they are thinking that this work is very risky to do then now we ca n't get this light , radio , tv and satellite and many more which we are using in in our daily life . so for every achievement there are many risk taken for the thing to do . so successful people only can think of the future , for every achivement there are many risk taken by many person for those achievement . for example if we are not trying for better future and being happy for what we have , then we will never succeed in our life . finally my opinion is to agree with the hard working people i.e. , successful people . because if the people are not successful then they ca n't think for their further future . so for every success there are many risk had been taken to achieve it . so finally i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk is better .
