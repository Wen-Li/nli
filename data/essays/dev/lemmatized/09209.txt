it is more important for student to understand idea and cocnepts than it is for them to learn , i agree with this because it is important for every student to understand anything rather than learning it , the student can continue the path of the knowledge and can get more information to confirm that the student understood it before learning the fact . a student is a human being so he cant skip the main idea of understanding and concept of the study , with out understanding the student would get struggled and cant learn the fact clearily , understanding the study in step help a lot because it avoids all the mistake that a student can make . understanding idea and concept is a must for all student 's , but it ha to be done in step before learning it directly , the student can learn the fact easily after understanding it , school are located to give the student a breif exlanation of how it 's done and how to understand the idea before analysing them and learning the fact of it . colleges in different administration and major give the student a chance for understanding the idea of the study that student is in , school are located to give the understanding to the student , after that the student when is graduated from school go to the college and would be ready to learn the fact because the student would be ready , but it 's not very important for the student to learn the fact than understanding the idea and concept . the main idea of the essay is for any student in anywere in the world should understand the idea and concept before thinking about learning the fact because understanding the idea and cocepts give the student a chance to know the subject .
