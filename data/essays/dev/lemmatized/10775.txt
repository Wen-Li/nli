many product are advertised in tv because it 's the main medium nowsaday . many people think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , others believe that most advertisement put the product a they really are . i think that advertisement make product to seem better to make more money , atract more people and exapand their bussines one reason is to make lot of money . many of this owner do n't have any respect for others . these person just want to buy you something for a high price and maybe the price is lower than they said it is . like my grandfather . she wanted to buy a computer and she saw an advertisement on tv that said that the computer worth three thousand dollar . because she wa naive in computer , she bought it . when she told to my father that she bought a computer fotr that price , my father almost kill her because he said that the computer only worth one thousand dollar . another reason is beacuse the owner want to atract people with this product . they just car to atract the maximum quantity of people . for example , my mother bought a vacuum machine that she saw on tv . she said that this wa the best one that she have aver seen . when the vacuum arrived , she wa excited and she started to use it . in four day the vacuum broke and she could n't use it anymore . finally , this advertisement make product better because the owner want to expand their bussines . for this reason they can sell more thing and also make maore money . first they start selling only one product but with the money they made with this product , they will start making other product a a result , they will expand their bussines . to conclude i would say that many advertisement make product much better than really are because the owner want to make more money , atract more peolpe and expand their bussines . i think that these people should have more respect whith their customer and make advertisement to show the product the way they are and not the way they want to look like .
