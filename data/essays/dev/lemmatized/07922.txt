as our topic is about the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i strongly agree with the note , a it ha adavantages over the travelling with out a guide . first we discus about the travel with out guide . as everyone interested to go to new place a per their knowledge . they want to know the each and every thing present over there . before going everyone will do research about that , and information we got is very little when compare when we encountered it . sometimes it miss out good place sourrounded to that , no one is ready to explain the histroy of culture and history of that place and also the how the importance came to that place , all these information is known to the people who staying overthere or people who visit often to the place . now come to the travel with guide , a they have very best of information . now i will give my personal experince so that it elevates the advantage of travel with guide , during my college day we went to the nothern part of the india , it included few place . when went to tajmahal there we found very beautifull monument ever built , the guide explained the when it wa built , who statrted this , and culture followed that time , and some important thing he told , after listening the lecture he made about tajmahal , we came to know we had very little information about that . we very much excited about the information , we really felt like we are viewing that constuction and art . as we thought tajmahal wa the only place to visit , but the guide showed another beautiful monument just away from tajmahal . we dont about that before , that wa also a good piece too . after that we faced some problem regarding our trip , just lack of enough time , in that time our guide wa so helpful , he planned accordingly out timing so that we not lost even single location . as the guide wa a local guy he provided good food too . throughout the journey we made with guide is very interesting and very helpful , after the tour we heard and learned good thing like history information about the place etc . finally my conclusion wa it not possible to know the thing that really happened at the historical place , few thing we can read or listen about those place but some we may not . so taking a guide is really helpful and informative . so that we can get more information than when we went to the travel without guide .
