if people have to try new thing , in order to become successful , depends on the kind of success of those people . for me it is clear that people have to take risk , in order to achive there goal , if they start a new business . pushing the own company to success , is not just related with hard work , but also with the ability to take risk . going new way ha many advantage . for instance , the company ha le competition . in addition , the costumer 's are usually open for new idea and product 's . thus , going new way in combination with hard work , could lead to the desired goal . moreover , one imagine an enterprenuer who is willing to achive success in a businees , just by hard work and an old idea . it is clear tha he will stand against a huge competi on the other hand , if the person is employed , it could be more efficient to just consentrate on the thing which he can do well and what is requiered in his position . in fact , person 's who consentrate on there ability and push them furthermore , are more likely to become promoted then employee who are often trying new thing . however , since promotion is the most important thing in an employee life , i disagree with the above mentioned statment . in addition , people who wa n't to get in power , even in a multinational company , would go better , if they learn the structure of the company well , instead of greating it new . in summ , it could be said that success is for different people different . nevertheless , to be successful , people have to be aware of many aspect . in addition they must have a varity of ability , but for each business there are other rule .
