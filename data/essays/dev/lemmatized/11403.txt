education is ongoing for our entire life . in addition , it is commonly known that education at school is one of the most important part of continuous education of life . i am totally agree with the statement that is `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact `` with two reason . my first reason come from the fact that is it is impossible to give all idea and information at school . that is , because of the limited time , you can not teach every thing to student at school . that 's why , student must be provided to understand idea and concept . for example , last year i took a mathematics class and we discus about theory of a certain subject . there were plenty of theory to study but the class wa once per week for a semester . the professor provided u to understand the subject completely , afterwards , we could handle other theory by ourselves . my second reason is that we educated at school to have some idea to practise into our life after school . if we understand idea and concept at school , we can have a change to apply them into the rest of our life . hence all information and idea can be valued to worth our time that is spend at school . to give a specific example , i am a professional female now , and last week i met a realy complex problem at work . a studying at university with my mathematics project helped me surprisingly . because that time , i really understood the idea in the project . i also felt that i wa not regret for the time that i spend at university . to sum up , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact to give a hand to them for their future . finally it must the main point for education at school . t
