when i wa 16 year old i traveled with my mother all around europe . she paid to a travel agency to have a guide in our trip . that adventure wa amazing ! if i would have the chance to experiment the same situation , i would not have second thoghts about paying a tour guide again . so i am completely agree with the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide . first of all , i am agree with paying someone to show me around because it is the best way to visit everything in a city , in which i do not know anything about it . furthermore , this guide can show me the history , the monument , the anegdotes , traditional restaurant and place to party , and all of these for the same price ! for instance , in the trip that i mencionated at the begining , the one that i did with my mother , this guide showed u every single place of france ; actually my mother went by her self three year before we did and thank this guide she learnt new more thing about paris . second of all , if i travel with a guide tour i am going to be save because this person supposes to know the right way at the best time to visit the city so i do not have to worry about which rout should i take to not surprise my self with any problem . to summarize i prefer to travel with a tour guide because i think that it is the best way to learn thing about a new place . in addition , a person is better than a book , because any question you have she or he can answer it at the moment and also the personal experience of a tour guide are more interesting that the onces that you can find in a book .
