i think , the main point of inventing is curiosity . i absolutaly agree with this statement . succesful people try new thing and take risk rather tahn only ding what they already know how to do well . there are many charecteristics that make a person successful . tenecity and intellenge are only two of these . f ? rstly , if a person ha tenacity , he/she never give up , never accepts ` no ' for an answer . he/she study hard to succeeds his/her goal . he is curious about his target . he doe his best to achieve his goal for this target . he is so willing to learn new information and making new invention . for example , one of the great genious of our world is einstein . he wa a big inventor . and we are still using his theory in our class . i think he gather his ambition , intellegence and tenecity and form a person who will not be forget at any time of the world . secondly , intellegence is a vey important factor that make a person successful . if a person is intellegent , he/she can understand the problem easyly and doe his/her best to cope with it . if people in our world do not be curious about new invention , nothing could be found . for example , tecnology can not be improved widely , beneficial investigation about our era 's diseas cancer can not be found . these are all beneficial to human being . to sum up , nothing can be done without risking anything . the world is improving rapidly . people must always learn something to cope with these change . they mustnot be frighten of the new improvement and new tecnology . also , they must think ` what must i do to improve myself ' instead of doing well what they already know . they have to do this not only for theirselves , also for the beneficial of all people around world .
