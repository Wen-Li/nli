i agree with the fact that most of the advertisement ( ad . ) make product seem much better that they in fact are . in my opinion many time ad . fail to meet the spectations created when you finally get or check what advertised . ads . have many time very few to do with reality because of several reason . i will discus about some of them from my point of view . first of all , the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy make the company exaggerate the benefit or characteristic of their product . every company show their product in the ad . a the best and far away better than the others made by competitor . when i wa a child many time i got dissapointed with most ot the toy i received a gift at birthday , those toy seemed to be much bigger on tv that in my hand . another point ha to do with quality . many time the quality you get is much worst that what is offered or suggested in ad . for example the sport shoe never last me so longer than i expect from the ad . i see and the price i pay for them . moreover another issue is customer service of service given to customer once he or she bought something . in ad . most of the company focus on their quality and responsibility . unfortunately most of the time you can not get easily a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised . i faced bad experience with the call center of the telecom company wasting a lot of time and money in uselless reclamation . another trick used by ad . is the way those ad . are showed . normally on tv you can see gorgeous people or aggressive music , so you rather pay attention to the person or musich announcing the item than the annonced item itself . linked to this is when famous people a actor , actress , film maker , sportmen or sportwoman are used in the ad . to sum up , i do not believe what is showed in the ad . since they make the producs be more attractive than they really are . ads . are not factual most of the time .
