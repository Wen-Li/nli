i agree only partially with the statement that broad knowledge in many academic subject is better than to specialize on one specific subject . in my opinion it is not enough to have a vast knowledge in one subject . people tend to be narrow-minded if they do not know about any subject but their specific one . a mathematic for example can make up a theoretic statistic about the spread of a disease for example but he will have to conclude certain irregularity to show the real process . furthermore , a certain amount of basic knowledge is important to everyone to participate in daily discussion or to built up a political attitude for instance . and every employer expects basic knowledge from his potential employee . for example about the current political and economic situation . therefore it is definetly important to be familiar with more than one single topic . nevertheless , it is obvious that student have to concentrate on one academic topic if they want to compete with others in a job . they have to know a much a possible about this one specific subject and they have to pay attention to learn about the newest change and innovation in this subject . and apart from the competitiveness it some situation it could also be very dangerous if someone ha only broad knowledge of a subject . a doctor with broad knowledge of medicine for example is the worst imaginable danger . apart from that the whole service sector is based on the fact that people know about one single topic in detail while others know about another . nobody can learn enough about every subject for professional would be superfluent . to draw a conclusion , student should specialize on one specific subject and apart from that they should learn a much a possible about other subject . everybody should use his talent to the greatest extention .
