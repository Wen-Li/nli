nowadys , there is a interesting thing that a lot new product are `` young people '' . it seems like young peopel may enjoy their life more than the older generation . every one ha his own value about life and different value lead to a compeletely different way of life , so we can not say who enjoys himself better . being full of experience , old people have a different thinking about the life from the young people . some old people who survive from the second world war can understand how important the food or the money is , so in stead of wasting wealth on enjoying life , they choose to lead a quite simple life . but they never feel their life are borin . second , young people have a strong willing to show their themself to attract a boyfriend or a girlfriend . in order to be popular , young people may like to stay in pub and bar , they drink , dance and joke with each other . however amost all the older people have already found an acompany , and fashion , car are le important for them , even they do not want to live a the younger people . if it is not necessary , it doe n't make sense to the judgement that young people enjoy life better . in addtion , age may be very important in some culture . for example , older people can control the younger one in china or kera . in these country , age can influence many thing especially when people is having fun . in these culture , the society will provide more benefit to the old people . if chinese people have a lot of food , the old one can obtain more . so it is not ture that young people can ejoy their life better within a le supply . in concusion , old people are equal with the young people , that is why nobody augre about that at all .
