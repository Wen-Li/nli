it is undoubtedly true that in twenty year the number of circulating car will be strongly reduced . although many people may believe that this statement is simply ludicrous , it is possible to provide some good reason to support it . two main aspect of this explanation are the consequence of the environmental problem caused by car and the problem caused by the constantly rising oil price . as everybody know , car produce toxic smoke that pollutes the air in big city . for this reason many government and city administration are restricting the number of car that are allowed to circulate in city centre . in the long term this will led to a change in citizen 's preferencies , i.e. they will prefer using public transportation to using their car because it will become simply too difficult to drive a car in a big city . to support this opinion i could quote a research study on this topic carried out at my university that show that people are becoming more and more unwilling to drive their car in big city . another point that could be made is that having a car is becoming more and more expensive . the first reason for this phenomenon is that oil price ha become very prone to rise consistently at any threatened decrease in production . grassroots people have already many economical problem and this one will become too awkward for them . another thing that influence the cost of having a car is the fact that government are discouraging car buying by imposing tax on some ecologically dangerous car . for example the italian government is willing to pas a law that imposes a tax on big car . these two reason given , itis not difficult to understand why i think that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than
