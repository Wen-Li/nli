nowadays , do you think young people give enough time to help their community ? i can surely answer you , no ! but why ? in my view , i think the young people spend all their time together with the computer , game , karaoke , something like that . i remember that when i wa young , there have n't got any gameboy , playstation , computer , my only entertament when i finished my homework is to see the television , swimming , running or play the basketball with my dad , very seldomly my faher will bring me to my cusion 's home to play the tv-games . but now , the only after school function of the young people is sit in front of the computer and chat with their friend , or somehow play the online game . because there are too many funny thing on the internet . then how can they get extre time to help their community ?
