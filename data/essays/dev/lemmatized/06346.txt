the answer to this question depends of the situation that a particular person is at a time . in the case that the person doe not know the city or place that is being visited , i would recomend to contract a tour guide and doing it in a group because he is going to take you to the most important place in a quick , safe and with all the explanation needed to know the place that you are visiting , and also you can enjoy the company of other people , giving you the oportunity to meet and share experience . one of the most important thing when you are traveling is to see the culture of the place , for example the food , dance , festival , etc. and i think that a tour guide can help you to accomplish this goal , also the tour guide can give you historical information about the place which is very important when trying to understand the way the resident of the region visited behave . on the other hand i think that if you have been before in the region and specially if you have been there for a couple time , hiring a tour giude is a waste of money and time , because this kind of service are usually expensive and you can use that money in something more productive in you trip , also the tour guide is going to take you to place where you have already been . instead of that you can use that time to visit new place of the region , doing something different than your last visit . so the conclusion for this is that it depends based on you previos experience on visiting the region . i will absolutly recomend so in the case that it is you first time , but if you have been before i do not see any reason to take a tour .
