i agree with this statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . successful people are those who keep on doing experiment to make existing thing le complicated and they are the one who develop new thing . for example in earlyman 's time people used to do travelling by cart . but nowadays we are able to travel overseas . we use car , aeroplane , helicopter . if man had n't tried new thing or man had n't used his innovative mind , he would n't been able to design new and fastest way of transportation . moreover for success taking risk and doing new thing is necessary . for example in my family my mother is a house wife , my grandmother wa also a housewife . but i want to be a scientist , so i am going against our conventional rule and regulation . i am trying new thing which in our family nobody ha tried like i am planning to go abroad to get a doctoral degree a my country is a develoding one . so , i personally believe in the above statement . we should always try new thing and should give innovative thing to this world . making new technology by taking risk is they key to success . for example if nobody had tried going to moon , we wont be able to explore and know how doe moon look and what are the property of moon . but sometimes trying new thing can be dangerous too . for example `` kalpana chawla '' famous astronaut of nasa , died when her spacecraft wa coming back to the earth after doing some valuable discovery . but in the long run `` success go to those people who keep on trying new thing instead of sticking to old thing '' .
