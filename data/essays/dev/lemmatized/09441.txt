i disagree with the idea that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way . there are two reason to support my opinion . first , in a group tour , you ca n't visit place freely . if the place you want to visit is not very popular , there are a few plan you can choose . when i wa a high school student , i visited kyoto in a group of my school . then , i wanted to go to sanzyusangen temple . however , the plan of the tour doe n't include the temple . therefore , i could n't visit there . second , although the time to look around the place is usually limited in a group tour , you can spend time to look around a much a possible . you would n't be able to understand the history of the place if the time for sightseeing is limited . when i went to todaiji temple in my school trip , i could't check carefully the explanation of the temple or statue of god because i did n't have enough time . furthermore , when you walk around the place or the town , you may notice good thing that you could n't find in a group tour , for example , the kindness of people there or delicious food . when i traveled to tokyo alone , i got lost . then people there helped me . this is very important exper
