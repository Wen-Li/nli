i disagree the statement said about how advertisement are . there are several reason . firstly , an excesive advertisement confuses the consumer . usually , the consumer buy the good based on the information that the company advertised . when the good are not what they tought about , they must be confused . for me , i want to lose my weight , so i buy the execesise machine . the advertisement said i could lose my weight without suffering , and thet wa very attractive for me . i immediately decided to buy the machine . once use of that , i found that it is very difficult to use and demanding . i gave up the using the machine . secondly , i think that the company by which the excesive advertisement prevailed lose their repetition . as i suffered that probrem mentioned above , i do not have any confident toward the company . the company have still sold the same machine and the progress method of the losing the weight , i perfectly doubt for the advertisement , if they were acutually good for me . thirdly , that is not good at my country 's society . although excesive advertisement is needed for gaining more money , it doe not permit by the nation . that is telling a lie to the customer . once permitting that advertisement , it would be wide spread all over my country . that situation is not good at my country 's society . for example , food are to be sold with the deadline of comsumption , because that food is safe to eat . but rcently , date deadline of comsumption date is intentionally changed by the company . this is very discoraged toward my country 's nation . so that reason , i disagree with the statement .
