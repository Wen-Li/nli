it ha been almost a century since the birth of the car . and these specie have made a tremendous impact into the life of human . they have made our life faster , easier and have helped to spur the industrial growth . however , the technological advancement , the increasing reliance of people on other mode of transport and the more organized lifestyle that this new age is comming up with give me an impression that over the year the number of automobile will reduce . the technology is advancing at a rapid pace . in recent year itself we have witnessed new mode of transport comming up . the howecrafts , the underground rail , the overhead rail , supersonic aircraft are just a few of them . with such novel and efficient mean of transport spriniging up by the minute and with people becoming increasingly reliable on these novel mean of transport , we can say for sure that the car on road will reduce . we often read in the daily newspaper report that new airline company are opening up . the low-cost airlines have been a big success in europe and the same model is being tried out in country like india . people have changed their preference of travelling from one city to another or from a country to the neighbouring country due to the new form of airline . this is because these low-cost airline offer cheap rate , especially to the everyday business traveller and these traveller have such a plethora of option in choosing the cheapest deal . as a result , people have started abondoning car a their mode of transport for short route . with the success of such airline it is definite that in near future we will see many more such business model which will ultimately result in the number of car being reduced . the organization of society is fast changing . two major form establishment are comming up . one , in which the residential and business locality are under one roof and the other in which they will be independent . if such structure are adopted on a world wide basis , then people will have to resort to different mode of travel . in the first case , they will not need to travel and in the second case they will prefer public transport mode such a underground or overhead rail . this is because it will help them reach their workplace faster . this in turn will cause the reliance of people on automobile . thus we see that with the time changing , people have come to rely on various other mean of transport which assist them to reach their coveted destination faster and in a much easier manner . these factor give u an indication that over the year car will be replaced by many other mean of transport . i only hope that like the dinosaur , these four-wheeled specie do not become extinct .
