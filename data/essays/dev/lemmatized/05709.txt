nowadays , there are alot of thing the make the young people busy and keep them away from their community . one of these is the technology facility like celluar phone , tv , and internet access . i am not saying that to keep them away but not to spending alot of time with unneccessary thing . to starting to teach the people how to be an effective member in their community they are suposed to recieve lecture or class that shifting them from personal intraction to community interaction like to be volunteer or participate in the social activity without any refund . once the nowadays young people get the meaning of the life they will be binifial in their community . nowdays young people some time they have enough opportunity to help their community with good output . but they need help from the community just to guid such people to the safe coast . nowadays people are more oriented than the former people because of the technology facility availability .
