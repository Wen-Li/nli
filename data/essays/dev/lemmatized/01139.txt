i agree with the opinion that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are for the following two reason . first , i think that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are in order to attract many people . for example , i think upon the advertisement of nintendo ds , which is the portable video game machine sold by nintendo , japanse famous company of video game . at the tv commertical , fujisaki nanako , who is one of the most famous actress in japan , seems to enjoy playing it . then , last year i bought it . at first , it is interesting for me . by contrast , within three day , i became boring . now my nintendo ds put on the bottom of the box . nintendo ds is not attracted for me . this example illustrates that in order to attract many people advertisement try to show that product are better than they really are . second , many people agree with the situation that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . for example , when i wa a student at kyoto university , which is one of the most famous college in japan , i took a brand strategie class , in which we thoght how to make the brand image of the company through case study . when professor okada , who wa my teacher at the class , discussed about an advertisement of car . in the class discussion , okaie , who wa the best student in my class , stated that in the tv commercial , such a toyota and nissan , the car run along the very beautiful road which we had never seen . he mentioned that this situation wa only brand strategie and everyone knew that there wa not such a beautiful road in japan . every student agreed with his opinion . at that time i understood that advertisement made product seem much better than they really were . therefore , i definitely agree with the opinion that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
