i agree with this statement . basically , travel should be enjoyable and fun to talk many people on during tour group , not only people local cevilians . on a group tour have more chance to talk people than travel alone . first , traveler will be a friend with tour guide , that is a first oppotunity . there is many advantage that travel in a group led by a tour guide . first of all , traveler just follow tour guide . it is neccesary to make any tour plan or sightsee schedule . just listen and see what tour guide explains and sightseeing spot . travelers concentrate what ever they want to see or whatever they want to learn or listen . secondly , travel with group led by a tour guide is safer . tour guide have a responsibility to be in safe with traveler that mean traveler do not go to any unpeace place . even traveler doe n't know sightseeing place is safe or not , definitely safe during tour . in case travel alone or no local friend , nobody know if traveler in unpeace place or not . it is danger . thirdly , travel with group led by a tour guide will be convenience . which mean , traveler do n't wast a time a lost in place , do n't wast a money by cheat . as i mentioned above , sightseeing place and time schedule were scheduled by tour guide . so traveler going on schedule that mean there is no way to wast time and see anything traveler want , and traveler going in safe place to buy such a in shopping mall or meal . there is no way to anyone cheat them . those reason are not only domestic travel . i can say it internatinal travel a well . i recommend to go to travel with group led by a tour guide especially internetinal travel . without saying , people in foreign country speaks different lunguage than traveler and there is not peacefull place . those are reason why i agree with statement .
