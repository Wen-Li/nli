in today modern life every individual want to understand and capability to estimate the idea and concept of the other person . by which he improvises his idea and overcome withbetterideas than the other person . so i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i would like to support this statement for following reason . first , by understanding the idea and concept we get the clear image on the aspect . for example if we are studying a particular subject . in that subject it is impportant for u to identify the main idea of the topic and the concept involved in that particular topic . by simply learning the subject without understanding the concept then it will be mystery for u that subject even if we spend lot of time on that . second , by understanding the idea and concept we are able to know how to live in the society . that mean we are capable how to deal with the problem and our colliques . for example if we want to ride a car , we must first understand the idea and concept that mean how to start the car , how to accelerate , how to move an gear . by understanding all these and thes if we practice then it will be easy for to ride the car , not only just learning help u . third , when we find out with new software or subject , it will be better for u sif we have understand the main idea and waht are the improvement ovewr previous one then these softwartes will be useful fo u . consequently the conclusion is that we must learn fact and we must also understand the idea and concept what we learn then only it will be useful for u . simply learning will not help u
