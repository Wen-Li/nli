that is evident , life is not living in the same way when we are child or young adult and adult or aged person . in my opinion , young people enjoy life more than older people do , and particularly very young people like child . i do not mean that being old is boring , but i think it is more exciting to be young . it recall me a french proverb that said `` we are not every day twenty year '' . first of all , it is a fact , child and teenager are more insouciant than adult and elder people . they do not matter about any problem adult have oftently . their only priority is to go to school . that leaf plenty of time to enjoy life . by the way , young people have a lot of thing to discover . specially child who do not have any experience of life . going to the cinema , to the zoo , to the circus , unable child to apprehend the world he is living in . a few year later , young adult will discover new aspect of life such a sexuality and human relationship . futhermore , young adult meet le problem than their parent . they are not still confronted by renting a house , paying insurrance , managing to get a job , et cetera .
