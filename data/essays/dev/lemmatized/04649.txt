the world is changed , also people are changed . young people became more irresponsible , the world became more competitive and young people started not to care about thing happening around themselves . first of all , young people are irresponsible to what they do . young people are not helping the community . we ca n't say , not at all . but it is reduced compare to long ago when it wa 1900s , when the revolution were occured . at that time the leading group wa university student . but these day , those age people are harming and ruin the society . since they do n't have any difficulty such a coup de ta't , war , or revolution . they became addicted to drug , crime and other bad stuff . they are not responsible to what they did , especially for rich people when they make problem , they ask their parent to solve the problem . these irresposible act by young people ruin the society more than past . secondly , the world became more competitive . since , the unemployment go high and competition rasies . young people do n't have time to help their own community , besides community service which they have to do a a school work . young people should spend their time more in the studying to get a job or to make their business bigger . otherwise they will be buried from the society . for example , my country during the 1970s people who graduated university could choose company where they want to work . but these day , even from the first rank university ca n't get a job . the percentage they get a job wa 77 percent . it mean it will become harder and harder . also , the competition will be more and more . lastly , young people do not care about thing happening around them . young people became selfish because of the second reason . so that they became dull about other people 's harshness and hardship . so when they see old people standing in the bus when they are sitting down . they rather ignore them or pretend sleeping . young people do n't want to involve other people 's business , especially dangerous thing . when i wa watching news program , i saw an interesting news that show the survey . the surveyer asked people that when they see pervert in a crowded subway . most of people answered they will ignore it . they think that that 's not their business . as time go by , the world became harder to live . and lesser people are helping the difficulty in society , even though the society becomes harder , i want to encourage young people to help their society . when they ask me why , i will answer that `` you will see the different .
