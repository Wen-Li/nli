i am agree , student need to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , because that will make easier in the time to study for the test , and will be able to participate any time the teacher ak a question , it is really important to understand everything about the subject that help to earn time , to study for all subject . a clear example i had , in quemistry is a class in which you have to understand what the teacher is explaining because it ha some exercise that even if you study you ca n't figure it out easily , so everytime i did not understand i asked my teacher . and i successfully got a good grade . many time student are to shy and they are afraid to ask somebody to help her in a different subject , or even the teacher doe n't like to help student , so we a student we need to have a positive mind and fight for what we want , doing our best at school and been obedient following direction . another example i have , i am really proud of my sister she is really smart , in her test she always got good grade , and i ask her if she can give me some clue , and the answer i received from her is that i have to understand what i am reading or studying so i try to understand , now i am successful in my subject and in my own life . finally , i can encourage all student have a positive mind and put their heart on god , he is the only person we can trust .
