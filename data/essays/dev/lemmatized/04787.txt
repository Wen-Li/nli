`` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' traveling is really important to my life . traveling can show u a lot of thing and make u learn about a lot of culture . traveling in a group can certainly make the trip fun and nicer . in my opinion , a group doe not need a guide to help him . discovering and taking risk , in a group , of getting lost is fun and is an unforgotten memory . traveling in a group is always part of my vacation . last summer for exemple , i traveled with my friend to spain to discover the country and to get to see a new culture . there when we arrived , we did n't have any guide . so we taked a taxi , gave him the adress of the hotel and he dopped u in the right place . after we deposited our bag in our room , and talked to one of the employee , we went to the resterants he talked u about and had so much fun . on our waybak , we got lost in the city and could n't find the hotel . after three hour of walking and the help of the others , we arrived to the hotel and sleeped . what is interesting , is , when i talk to my friend about how we got lost and how scared we were , they laugh and they dream if these day can come back . so we can think that traveling in a group with no guide and getting lost , is an entertaining part of the trip . another reason why people doe n't need a guide anymore . because of the internet and the easy way to know the place where we want to go . when my family organise a trip to a country or anywhere , they take and do everything on the internet , including the address . also with the flourishment of the technology , we have the gps that can locate our place if we are lost . in the end , traveling with a guide is not necessarly the best way to travel . there is a lot of other way that can be enjoyed .
