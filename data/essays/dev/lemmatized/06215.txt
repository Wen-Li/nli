successful people have different way and strategy to be unique and successful among the others . the main way of successful are either , by taking the risk or by doing and applying what they already know or plan for . the two type of people might consider different factor in their living environment that will guide them to the best succeeding path or way . people who like to take risk , their surrounding evironment force them or encourage them to take the risk . their environment might be poor , tough , or ha a lot of shortage so this will let them search for new and creative way to satisfy their need , and these way mostly risky because no one have ever tried their way before . an example for this , is the inventor case . inventors taked the risk to tried risky or unfamiliar procedure to come up with a unique , new usaable invention that turned their life into the sucessful life . another example is a company owner , who will take a risky decision to solve an wanted or sudden market condition . people who like to do what they planned for , are usually have a stable life and environment . they go through regular path a any one else , but they do more effort and plan wisely to achieve their predetermined goal . most of people from this type do not like to take risk before making an intensive analysis for all the consecutive result for taking any risk . as a result they will end up with not changing their plan . an example of this , are people who doe not like to change their career . or the people who take the same path a their father or mother , for example being a doctor or professor in the college same a their parent . in my opinion i like to do what i already planned for , with out taking the risk . because it is more safer for my career and social position , also i do not have the strong ability to find alternative solution in case of failure of any risky action . more over it is more convenient for me to live in the same pattern through my life with a reasonable improvement same a the average people . i also strongly consider my stable life that doe not force me to take any risk .
