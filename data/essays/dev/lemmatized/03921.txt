the demand of mobility and access is not likely to cease for modern life , however the supply which will enable people to mobilize will certainly shift from conventional method established today . with this fact , one can go further and argue that twenty year from now there will be fewer car than there are now . such argument can be coherent in itself if one is to see changing trend in mobility regarding alternative and enviromental issue . when it come to compare car with their alternative such a plane , train and ferry they all seem to be better than car on some certain aspect stated below . for instance it is a known fact that the average use of car is around 1 , 5 people per car worldwide which prof how inefficient car are compared to massive transportation way such a train , ship and plane . in addition to this car aslo create a trafic problem which is uncomparable to it alternative . despite car seem like providing more accesibility than their alternative since one can drive whereever he want and whenever , this fact also seems like it is changing . it may be the case that , twenty year from now , plane and train will develop to an extend that they will be cheaper to use and more frequent in destination . at this point it should also be remembered that car have considerable upkeep cost due to repair and tax which will eventually became a luxury compared to it alternative . apart from loosing it chance among it alternative car will most likely be forced to reduce in number due to their harmful affect on the enviroment . the fundamental need of a car to run is oil and this fact is unlikely to change in coming twenty year . regarding increasing concern on the global warming this need of car will make it likely to be replaced . in addition to harmful gas released car also damage enviromet by creating sound pollution and indirectly by driver demanding more road . the more car there will be the more road and sound pollution there will be a well . subsequently these will make people take a decision between altering their mobility style or facing result of enviroamental disorder . in conclusion , it seems that because of the drive mentioned here and many possible others that extend the limit of this esasy , car are going to be replaced realtively by it alternative . maybe these drive will let car industry to develop new cheap and enviroment friendly solution but even this isnt likely to stop a change in choice . it is because that maybe other industry will take the advantage of their increasing usage and will develop futher technology which will make them uncomperable to car .
