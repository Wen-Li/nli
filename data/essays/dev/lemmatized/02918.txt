it is a challenging question that whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . first of all , i want to mention that both of them are good but it is impossible to be the best in many academic subject . in my opinion , unlike having a broad knowledge of many subject , being the best in one specific subject is much more valuable . i think that the specialization in one specific area can give person much more advantage when we compare it to the broaden knowledge . for example , if you have only broaden knowledge about many subject , this tell people that you are not a qualified person . it only make you more intellectual but spacialization is required in order to have a good job opportunity . today being intellectual doe not enough in order to live well . unless you have any specialization , you can not earn good amount of money . moreover , being specialized can be seen a the reflection of the success . you can be the most successful person in your specialized area with researching and working more and more . for instance , you can be a well known scientist or professor in your field . this is impossible for the person who ha a broaden knowledge in many area because life is short and you do not have lot of time to learn the everything about every subject . instead of this you should use your time in one area which can make you the best . in order to summarize , a i mention in my essay , i am disagree with the idea that it is better to heve broad knowledge of many subject . according to me , being the best in one area is much better than having a broaden knowledge . specialization is not only the chance of the good position but also the reflection of the success .
