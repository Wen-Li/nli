i claim learning fact is more important than understanding idea and concept . i explain my idea by using the example of controversy of article 9 of japanese constitution . just knowing the idea and concept do not directly mean we have the understanding on the topic and having the opinion to act for it . thinking about the controversy over article 9 , the argument wether revising it or not . surely , understanding it history that have kept our country peaceful for 60 year , and it idea and concept of renouncing the war after the tragetic memory of hiroshima and nagasaki is very important . but by just `` understanding '' the idea of exsitance of it , we can not protect ourselves from the threat of terrorism . so what are we needed to live ? we are strongly needed to be `` learning '' the fact of the japan facing now , and the way we can take for maintaining the peace . what happens when north korean missile are launched to japan ? do we not fight for it ? or we fight with self defence force which is well known to be not suit the article 9 itself . therefore , understanding the idea and concept are not helpful in our life . it is a very idealism . its good to have , but doe not do anything to u . it 's not practical . what i want to claim in this essay is that is not the importance of article 9 , but that learning fact and to know what we can do for it next , is much more important in our real life .
