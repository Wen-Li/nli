by the name of allah in the first we will describe the main line of our subject :: first : student understand idea . second : student concept idea . the main goal of this subject is `` learn fact '' . now , i will begin from the presentation of subject to the student , it depends if the subject concern to the : a. scientific subject : i will say it not important to understand because the student should take the subject from other look , for example if the teacher talking about the sun rise from the east side no one must descuss the teacher for that because there is no result for the descussion if they talk day for that , they would not take any additional information , so , i think and my opinion in the scientific subject not important for student to understand idea but may the teacher explain that upon the earth movement in short briefly word . b. art subject : now here the subject is opened why because the subject it ha not any constant rather than the scientific subject . so , may the teacher gived the information to the student and part of them agree for that or may another part do not agree , for example let we talk about the beauty of the '' monaliza board '' , so may the most student agree there are secret in her smile but not all could deal that set from the art or it came while he do not know - i talk about '' leonardo davincy '' , so i think not important for student to understand idea and concept c : medical subject : that regard for the medecin student they must be understand every thing about human there is no data pas a it is every detail should be discussed , so here i think there is needing for the student to understand to learn the fact finally , i talk about subject from out look may my opinion is mistak but in the last i will say that not for the student school because they in building stage they must understand every thing and my opinion may applied for the upstair student like in the university or high studentd level , but i think you must understand to learn fact until the fact keeped in your brain a much a .
