i absolutely agree whit the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their comunities because they have other worry in life and do not have more time to be involved with their community . nowadays young people ha many other worry and doe not have time to spend for their community . this problem are that some youngers while are studying they have to work in order to pay their study . other youngers have problem with money and a nowadays life is very expensive they have to work so many hour in order to go on with everything . and if we talk about youngers that have already child , it is not viable . for instance , i am 27 year old and i finished my degree and now i would like to do a postgraduated program overseas in order to improve my professional skill and knowledge . in order to do that now i have to spend most of my time working so many hour so i will be able to carry on with my study . not only i have to worry for my study but for my flat , the bill , the rent . and in a few year i would like to have a child . eventhough this pitty situation i would really like to have a little of time helping my cummunity but since the rythm of life go so fast i think that it is impossible at least at the moment . as life go so fast in my opinion i understand that young people nowadays have so many problem to spend helping their community . maybe if the rythm change thing will go better and
