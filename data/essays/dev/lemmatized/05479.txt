recently , you may realiz the there are more and more advertisement , not just on the tv program , but also in some newpaper and magzines . that make u into a deep thougt of whether the advertisment make product seem better than they really , are . in my opinion , i agree with that statement to begin with , a product of beed quality cost much on advertisments , most company spend a lot of money on advertising their product , overcloud the fonction and the use . that is harmful and not resposible to the customer . actually , many product of good quality do n't afford to the expensive advertisement , so they can not attract many customer . what 's more , most customer like to find their perference product according to the tv . as you know , most people spend about 1-2 hour before tv . they think the advertisements is very faithful , especially the advertisement anounce by a famous person . if they like the person , they will trust the fonction of the product . so they waste a lot of money on that . in fact the product is not really what they think of . finally , many beatiful word and describe of the product really make it seem to be useful . many people add some use that is not really existed in the product and also over state the founction of it . many word soud very reasonable and trustable , it hard for you to analysis the fork and true . so people will easily spend money on pursusing one to have a try . for instant , a medicine can not cure head ache , but the in the advertisement firmly say it can cure you head ache , and make you easy go to sleep . in a word , most advertisement can make product seem better than they really are , in different way . you must be careful in your like
