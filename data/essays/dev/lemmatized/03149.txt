i completely agree that student should pay more emphasis to understanding idea and concept rather than superficially mugging up fact . a mugged up fact with no basic understanding of the idea behind it may seem le time-consuming initially , may enable you score quite well also but in the long run it doe no good to you . for . e.g. in a math test in primary if you merely cram all word problem solution , then please be ready to cram another set of word probelms in primary 6 , 7 , so on . . but if you have understood the concept , you just need to apply the same . and score a in all the class . this is my personal experience . primary 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 , i only studied word probelms in primary 6 and never thereafter . merely cramming not only hinders your clear vision towards the matter but also block your mental ability to think deeper and in a way block your mental growth . if we dont ask ourselves question about subject and donot try to find out answer we are blocking our own vision . for e.g. if newton didnot ask himself or make himself to think of why the apple fell , he would not have gone to find out answer and give his theory . deeper understanding of a matter not only enables you clearly understand but on it own or in other word automatically generated your interest into a subject . and what better than this if you are really enjoying what you are doing ? every art come with practice , demand time , devotion and , of course , interest . learning , not only painting , but infact doing science is an art a well . for e.g. , if in your secondary school you learn and understand what titration is conceptually , you will definitely enjoy the moment spent in chemistry lab when you are performing it with your own hand and then seeing ph becoming neutral . another interesting example is that of understanding cancer . if you really understand what is the cellular mechanism of cancer and what gene or protein are increased or decreased during the process , it will be so fascinating to study the response or development of cancer merely by studying the level of gene and then see the result and then understand them also and then make others to look at what result you have got in your laboratory with appropriate explanation and relate them to cancer , rather than merely acting a a foolish worker in your own lab . learning a technique make you merely a worker , a good a a blue collar guy , learning a subject make you a scientist . so in-depth knowledge is not important but mandatory . mugging or learning fact make you a worker but to really enjoy and rule a subject one should understand the concept which is something that is going to take one a long way .
