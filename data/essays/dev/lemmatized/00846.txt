traveling is very interesting for me , but there is a controversy how to travel ; going alone or in a group . i disagree with this theme and i raise four reason for this . first of all , i 'd like to go wherever i can go . it is very useful to go with a tour guide , specially to the place that i 've never been to , because i have little knowledge of dangerous place to visit . but in guide tour , there are something that i do n't want to go to . also , planning for the place that i want to go is also precious time . itime to traval is limited , and from planning to travel , it is a starting point ! secondly , traveling is expanding our eye . i traveled brazil a lot and i wa capable of knowing foreign people . to know what they do , think and like wa an very interesting chance . i like foreigner , including brazilians , and also want to communicate with foreign people . traveing is knowing and expanding friend , but this will happen only when going abroad alone , and i would have never had such an experience with travailing by myself . at last , travailing is a chance of thinking what i am and what i am going to be . in a place where we live , i ca n't be stimulated and there are n't good for my health , but in a new place , i can be fresh in my mind , and i want to know about this . i know that travaling with a group , for example with friend , family , but it is not interesting largely because i ca n't see , think alone . it is a chance to go , think , enjoy by myself , not for others . i want to go every year alone travailing wherever i want , and expand my ability .
