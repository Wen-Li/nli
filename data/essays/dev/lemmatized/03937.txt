i do agree with the fact that successful people have challenging career that conduct them to have risky position . a successful person may be qualified in that way because he or she ha been distinguished from other people who ha not faced the same success . and someone ha of course many more opportunity to be distinguished in a challenging and difficult environment than is an simple one . actually in that last kind of environment , a lot of people may fullfill the duty in a cogent way and we generally expect them to do so , consequently it is a normal situation that doe not lead to any particular kind of success . at the opposite , by having a challenging carrer someone may face many quandary and diverse kind of problem . the exposition is bigger . by being in risky position , people are not expected to success every time , they may fail but when they manage to solve a problem or develop a difficult or new business , then they are distinguished and become successful people . another important point is that being in a challenging environment and taking risk allow people to break the everyday life routine . actually , by facing new and difficult situation , people do not have time to get borred . their motivation can be very huge considerating the stake . by following that idea we can assume that people may fullfull their duty with more enthusiasm that in le risky position . actually , we can easily get bored by doing something we know well so we could give le importance for our job and replace it with other thing which is not at all to be unerconsiderated . people may have different priority or quality in life that are not suited to a complex environment . for these reason i do agree with the statement , and my opinion can be easily verified with successfull people such a politics or businessmen who faced difficult position .
