i absolutely agree in that somebody who want to succeed in any aspect of life , definitely ha to take some risk . there are so many example in which we can observ this difficult part of life . one of these situation is when people decide to marry . nobody know exactly if the person he/she is dating will be the best or the right one to share the rest of his/her life with , therefore when you decide to take this kind of decision there is always a great risk involved , unless you do n't want to risk anything and remain single the rest of your life , but if the person who decide to do this just because the fear of marriage is more powerful that the decision to take risk , then some problem might arise and this person could spend the rest of his/her life in loneliness . talking about another field , profession to be exact , this is an important part of every individual 's life and it is very important to decide what kind of job you want to do in the future . you may feel attracted to a career but feel inside that you are not smart enough to accomplish all the responsibility that this kind of profession implies , therefore you decide to stay where you are or choose another field which look much easier for you or probably you will be doing something that you already have an idea of what to do , even though you feel that you really would like to try something different . when this happens , is not a good idea to close your mind to the world of possibility and give to the `` highly complicated '' career a try and after trying , then it becames acceptable the failure but i absolutely dissagree in giving up situation that can change your status in life . before putting a negative attitude of pesimism or self-consciousness it is better to get up , look up and try to move on to the world of opportunity where there is no room for anybody who doe not take risk .
