there is no doubt that learning academic subject is very good at the begnning of learning , but ithink learning aspecific subject after that is very important . i think learning one specific subiect we will be more creative in this kind of subject or field . and ihave my self for example , ispecialized in teaching and ithink i became avery creative teacher , and ithink ibecame one of the most greatest teacher in my country . as aspecialized theacher , i managed to add anew idea for the teaching , a new meathods , anew tool and avey great thing to my student . i believe , by learning aspecific subject we will be able to find the creative doctor , like my brotherfor example , he becam one of the most famous doctor in my country , one of the most creative and successful doctor every where in my country and ithink this is because his choice to study one specific subject which is medicine . in concolusion , ithink every one should choose one specific subject to learn , and be good in it and creative in it instead of learning too much stuff . ibelieve also by learning one subject we will find tle creative person evey where .
