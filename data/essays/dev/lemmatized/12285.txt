i certainly disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . i will explain my point of view along with some example . first of all this statement can not be generalized . there might be some young people that do enjoy their life more than some people that are older . although i do not think this is connected with their age but more with a general attitude towards life . for example an older person could be more pessimistic than a younger person . but this person might have been more pessimistic througout his hole life , even when he or she still used to be young . i do believe that there is different way of enjoyment and different area that old and young people do get enjoment from . in my opinion this is connected to the differentent life span people are in at different age . each life span , like the toddler 's , the teenager 's or the adult one , brings along different task . let 's say a teenager doe live more on the riskier side of life and doe take drug from time to time or have more liberal sex habit than an adult would practize , this might be due to his wish to experience independence or to define his own personality by testing his own and the society 's limit . that is a normal behavoiur for his age and role in our western society . in today society a more liberal way of life and expression is often taken a a symbol for a happier life . this doe not neccessary hold true . some of these teen , asked about their amount of joy in life , might not be happy with what they have at all . on the other hand an older adult , living more quietly with his family and having a satisfiying job , might not look a happy at first but if asked migth show a quiet high level of life satisfaction . this so called joy in life could maybe better be described by the word happiness or life satisfaction . also another point is that there is a confusion between seeing the older people 's life style , that indeed might look a little boring an le enjoable to a younger person , a connected to their age . even when the really old people of todaz were young their value were different to ours . thez just continued living them until today . this is not boring for them , but to u it look b
