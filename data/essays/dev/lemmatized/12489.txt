the argument that successful people are characterized by being people that continuously take risk and enter new venture , and avoid task that they are familiar with is controversial one . on the one hand , more risk mean more return , and greater chance of reaching and building creative idea and result . on the other hand , working on a task that you know well will promise sure success , a compared to risky avenue that have a tendancy to result in huge failure a much a resulting in success . personally i believe successful people are the one that stick to the task that they can master , and i support my argument with the following three reason . first , entering risky avenue without the knowledge and experience in the chosen risky task is similar to a gamble , the chance of winning are equal to the chance of losing . it may also be that the chance of losing are higher , a any task requires the performer to learn and educate himself , and also familiarize himself with the task . take snowboarding a an example , you ca n't successfully snowboard without practicing for long hour and taking lesson , you will end up injured . second , working on thing that you are familiar with is the beginning of any process of innovation . a number of human resource book state that any process of innovation within any field first requires that you have the knowledge and experience within this field . third , a number of loss faced by risk taker that enter field they have no knowledge about lead to very severe loss that may very likely impair the person 's ability to undergo other task in the future . as an example , the market crash in the late 1990 's lead to subtantial loss for the naive investor that devoted their time and a significant amount of their saving in a venture that they had no knowledge about . many really went bancrupt , lost their family , and their health . all in all , i believe success can be reached if people undertake the task they are familiar with . a the choice of the familiar task lead to a much more positive outcome , compared to an outcome of entering risky avenue that you have no knowledge about .
