i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . the first reason why i agree with this statement is that young people have changed . in old day in korea , young people were very helpful . they helped to build house and fix thing , which are dangerous and hard . this work were for young people and they did it without hesitation . however , these day young people do not care about their community . young people , nowadays , have different attitude . another reason that i think is that young people are not connected with community . in korea , young people , who assume a student , are very busy studying . they go school at 7 in the morning and come back in the mid-night . they have no time to participate for their community . whereas , in old day in korea , there were more people who were not student and also school work were not hard . last but not least , some young people want to help their community . for example , helping and taking care of elderly people or child . however , i am not sure about other country , but in korea , parent usually do not want their child , who are student , to help for their community . the reason is obvious that they want their child to study for their future university rather than caring about their community . taking into account of all factor , people are becoming more egoistic , not only young people , but also their parent and adult . anyhow , we may reach the conclusion that the statement is correct .
