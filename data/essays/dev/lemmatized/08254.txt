in our world which is surrounded by the technology and it 's equipment people start to with the tecnology and it 's affect to the daily life ; everybody started to meet new thing which make their life easier than before . for example ; wash machine ; dish machine ; frigator ; television and a a last step of today there are cellphone ; computer ; internet etc . all of them which i mentioned are making easier our life and i am sure there will be invented more thing later . before these invention there wa cooperation in every area ; woman were doing the washing duty together near the river ; they bake a bread together too or farmer were helped by others to clean the farm . from the time the technology interfere their life ; people started to do this activity at home . this lead people to be a little bit alone . maybe this can be defined a good but i personally define it a ` bad` . on the other hand ; what i can define a ` good ' is ; helping people is more easier now . for example if you want to make a donation you do not need to go to the charity or the bank ; you just open the internet ; type the address and give the credit card number . it is so easy . finally because of these reason i strongly believe that young people are giving enough time to helping the community .
