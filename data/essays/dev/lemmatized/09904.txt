traveling is one of the good opportunity to get to know the outside world , so i strongly oppose to this statement . i think we can discover new thing more by traveling alone or with few friend or family . firstly , we can be flexible with our scedule when we travel ourselves . this mean we can pick place we want to go and arrange the most effective rout . when i went to spain with my son last month , we picked where we wanted to go first and organized our rout carefully . we moved around using a subway and visited historical site and museum . whenever we felt like changing our plan , we had a cup of coffe and made another plan . for example , after we saw gaudi 's famous cathedral in barcerona , my son wantted to visit other architecture of his , so we decided to see other building rather than go to picaso museum . secondly , we can go where our interest are . in granada , we visited an old historical town called albishin . this town is located on the hill and it seemed to be very difficult for tour group to go , a these road are too narrow for large bus to drive and there are many pass to get out of the town . if i were a tour guide , i might lose my customer a these road are like a huge maze . but when i think back our trip , this town wa the most exciting and attractive place for u . if we had gone to spain in a group tour , we could not have visited this marvelous historical town . for these reasos , i prefer traveling on my own or with few people . we can go where we really want to go and enjoy what we really want to see . the spain trip with my son became one of the most memorable trip for me .
