we can always listen some old person that is not delight with the behaviour of young people . often old person say that young people are change , are very different to people of their time . these change can be find in all aspect of our life . nowdays young people have always a lot of thing to do , so i agree with the statement . nowdays young people have often a very busy life . almost all people of 19-25 year go to university and sometimes they work too . infact work during the week is often a possible solution to resolve economic problem but at the same time it allow them to attent at school . then they play different kind of sport , they want to go out with their friend they also want to have time to relax at home . so they do not have any time to helping their comunity or to do some social and useful activity . if i look for between all my friend i think that only a small part of them reserve part of their time to help comunities . i do not think that it 's a right behaviour but i think it depends on our society also . the most important value of our society seem to be our carrer , to enjoy , to have a relaxed life . most people do not consider to importance of helping people who live worse . even if i recognized the importance of these aspect i can also say that it is very difficult , also for me , manage to concetrate on these kind of people . i do not have enough free time : i have to study , i have to go to university , i have to go to work in the weekend or i have to clear my house ( i ha been living alone for 3 year ) and so if i have free time i prefer going to shopping , or to the cinema . i do not think this is a good reason but
