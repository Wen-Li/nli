business meaning of advertisement is to show what you are not . so i completely agree with the fact that advertisement tell speak ` bad ' product ` good ' . mostly advertisement talk about the bad product . today advertisement are everywhere . turn on your idiot box , it will show you advertisement mainly with certain gap which are called program . you turn on your pc , cross a busy road , or do whatever ; you can not get rid of an ad . now come the business aspect . why there is need of so many advertisement ? two word have the answer . ` purchase ' and ` profit ' . all advertisement are the brainchild of some unsuccessful product which the creator want to make it successful . so why one person need to advertise his product ? to make it famous ? yes maybe but the most dominant reason is to sell and to make profit . why you need an ad if your product is so good ? i witnessed the same situation when i wa young . i loved one chocolate of a particular brand . i never saw it ' advertisement in tv or in any journal . now suddenly oneday i saw it ad which told me that it ha changed . joyfully i went to a shop , i bought one , only to discover that price had increased and the cover pack became more glossy . thats the magic of an ad , when the product is right you dont need to advertise it . advertisements are very lucrative because of it ` free ' offer . i have seen thousand gather in front of mall to get a free offer with a particular product . so what is the motive of the free offer ? nothings come for free . free is the word that is seen by all , we need to see some invisible information such a decrese in quality in place of free . once my mom bought vegetable oil after seeing a wonderful new ad of the reduced price product . later she discovered that the expiary date is already over . in some case what an ad tell are completely lie . our favourite actor and actress dont bath with that particular soap which they advertise . these are just to promote sell . i mostly got worst product whenever i wa prompted by an advertisement , so my suggestion is ' do n't be fooled by any advertisement ' .
