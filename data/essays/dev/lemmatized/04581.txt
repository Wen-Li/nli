broading kowledge of many academic subject is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion . not only because it will be more interesting but also because people will benifit more if the subejects are varied . the main reason that broading knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many thing in this world . they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too . if the subject are limited , a lot of people wont care to know about other thing in the world or in the kingdom which we live in . they will be satisfied to have the information that are circuld around the environment they live in . i cant judge and say that all people will have poor knowledge , but i 'm sure that the majority wont have that good knowledge . in other word , our society will be weak . also if knowledge is limited to omly one subject , scientist would n't have reached the success which they have today . for example , if nuoten did n't bother to expand his research on the gravity and stayed on figuring out why the apple had fallen toward the ground , i do n't think he would have known the formula of gravity at all . he could have spend his whole life thinking alone and not knowing the reason of gravity . i think that his effort in studying every single detail made him conclude the concept of gravity . if i were given the choice in any university or in any school whether to study only my major or have additional subject , i would choose to study both my major and other additional subject . that way i will be not only well educated but also my mind will have a good understanding of the world which i 'm living in .
