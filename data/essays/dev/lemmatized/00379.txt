i completly agree with satement about the most advertisement , there are no of thing to be consiredered in this aspect . firstly to say about the advertising of cellular service like hutch and airtel communication system they advertise they are the best in the market in term of cost , efficiency and service . once we get into the their service they start leveing all the hidden cost which doe n't appear at the time of advertising . this is really sort of cheating the people . secondly there are no of product in the market , their advertisment showing the best appearence , which make u feel like the real one , when we start using them they dont meet the expected level , eventhough the cost is high , for example soap , shampoo , and variety of cosmetic avalable in the market , here appearence of the object and the way they are presented make u easil attracted and buy them . thirdly the most of the advertisement use the clebrities for advertisement which make a lot of impact on the product , people just buy them only because thier favoutite star ha advertised for it . in india most of drink like coke , pepsi are advertised by the famous local film star , and people started using them , eventhough they are proved to contain harmful residue of pesticide , after a concern of the medium they reduced their usage . in some context they make u feel they are modified product , eventhough in reality they are not done so , the world ha completly paced itself to the world of advertisement , a product any comidity can be made success only by advertising , to sum up , it is one of the biggest magic or thing to the manufacturer to sell thier product or commidites in the market , at the expense of people faith , in their product .
