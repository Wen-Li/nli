young people now-a-days do not give enough time to helping their community . i agree with the above statement that young people do not give enough time to help their community . there are many reason to support this . firstly , in this competetive world young people are much concerned with their carreer , goal and their aim so , they are more involved in their study . as a purpose they go to college regularly and study their day to day lesson regularly . the subject ha become so vast that they have to refer many book and it take much time for them . so , they do not have much time on other activity such a , helping their community . secondly , the people now a day show much interest in enjoying themselves with their friend . they either go to movie or restaurant or pub or to the play ground with their friend . they are always in a mood to enjoy themselves . they do not help the community because they do not spare their time to work on good thing and helping their community . thirdly , the people these day became very selfish and they do their own work which is helpful to that particular individual . they doe not want to help his community which is beneficial to all . that is why he concentrate mainly on his work rather than helping the community . finally , now-a-days people are more attracted to medium such a television , newspaper , magazine , weekly etc . , . people are more concentrating on these knowing about the world through news paper and news on television and other mean . there is also a rapid growth of importance for computer and internet and it draw the attention of young people towards it . young people are much attracted to find the new thing and they browse the internet spending most of their time finding out the information that is useful to them . due to these above stated reason , now - a-days people , mainly youngster do not spend enough time to help their community .
