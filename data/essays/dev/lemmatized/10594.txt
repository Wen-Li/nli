i believe that is treue that the young people do not give enough time to helping their comunities but this is caused for the society and the parent . i am a young girl and i am totally agree with this statement . in my opinion the youngers are busy in their own thing and don-t worry of the trouble that appear in their own comunity . they and i think that there are people that worry of the thing of the society yet and they will look for some solution . the youngers that have a good life are the le worried because their parent help them and will solve their problem and they don-t think that when they will be adult won-t stay their parent . i know that this position is worse but this is that our parent teach our . some exemples are when we throw some paper at floor and we aren-t be able to take the paper and put in the rubbish . or when somebody paint with a spray on the door . .. this person don-t think when they do that , they do that they like . i wish that the youngers were more careful and that they think before to do anything . they have to know that whole the worse of the society is bad for they . i like that the politics would do more programes for the young people because this would help to envelope on the trouble of the society . and believe that with the help of the whole our own comunity will became to be better !
