the community association are formed in order to serve their community , to make it develop . as the engine need petroleum product to work ; the community need young people 's attention to be strong and well-organized . however , because of the education that young people have , the way of living that the others , with whom the young people live with , the daily event , which make the young people think pessimistic , young people do not pay enough attention to their community a they do before . firstly , education , that we have during our life , ha really important effect on people 's way of living . it can be easily seen that , well-educated people are caring their community more than the other people , who are not well-educated . for example , think of somebody who graduated from university . the person , we are talking about , ha a knowledge of thing that a community need and can give a decision about what to do for the community . secondly , young people can get easily affected from the people they are living with . is not it right that young people want to be like their parent ? nor , their parent do care about the community that they live in , neither the young people are the small version of parent . these are not all the factor that can affect young people in a bad way like this . has anybody ever thought the idea of daily event can affect young people in a bad way ? for instance , think about the topic of war , occuring in the middle eastern country . this can be told a one of the reason that young people are pessimistic about the future and their community . finally , from my standpoint it is true that young people do not give enough time to their community . i do strongly believe the thing this can be so
