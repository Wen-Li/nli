nowadays young people seem to be more concerned about their look than about the happiness of their community . i think indeed young people are very selfish nowadays . we can take the example of th riot in france in november , we saw indeed that some of young people did n't care about good of people and community . so i agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . first young people have an obsession with their look , they want to wear only expensive clothes . they do n't have any respect for their parent . they demand always the best the most expensive jean , the last mobile . .. without thinking to their poor parent who work hard in order to spoil their child . secondly i find that child are n't polite anymore . they do n't have any respect for old people . some of young delinquances do n't hesitate to attack a old woman in order to steal her bag . i think it is sad . then young people don ` t care about the cleanless in the public transport , they do n't preserve the infrastructure . they let their waste on the floor and do n't care about who will clean up .
