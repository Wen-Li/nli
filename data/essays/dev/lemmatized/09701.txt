some people believe that is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide but i disagree with sentence . first , if we should n't travel with tour guide , we can sight seeing any where for example , in the past year i went to japan with my freinds without tour guide . i think it is not at all also we could arrive to the japan well and went on a shopping , took the picture with native people . ect . in this travel , we get along with my freinds . second , we can be known to travel place history . by without a tour guide , we can study about the travel place history . nowdays , according the international social develop , we can saw many japan 's informationg and history . such a read a tour guide book and the internet web surffing . in this reason , i think i like the best way to travel is in a group without tour guide leader .
