i agree with the statement that , `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' my opinion about this topic is based on personal experience a well a personal opinion . who ha not seen an advertisement that appealed to his/her own need and want ? furthermore , i will go a step further and say that i am sure that almost everyone ha bought a product because he/she remembered an advertisement about it . advertisements are temptous and play with the customer 's emotion . in addition , the way they are put together they appeal to the viewer ' eye ; it make them want to have whatever is displayed on the advertisement . in the center of advertisements is usually a woman with a perfect body , few clothes , a big smile . moreover , this kind of advertisement make woman want to be her and men want to get her . at this point the product being sold is not a important a the emotion involved in the advertisement . for example an advertisement for a cigarette company sell a cancerous stick to people by presenting a tan , attractive , and good-looking woman with a glowing cigarette in her hand on a huge billboard . do people really want to start smoking or rather be a good-looking a the woman . now , this support the fact that the advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are . another point to be made in this commentary about the statement is that even is people do not try to be influenced by the product sold on advertisement , they are still influenced by them . as soon a people leave their house they are surrounded by advertisement on huge billboard , on truck driving by , on school blackboard , or in magazine and newspaper . these advertisement will store subconsciously . if people then go to the crocery store to make their weekly supply they will remember what they saw on the billboard . they might buy those product and recognize that what they bought wa not a good a they thought it would be . they are surprised by the fact that the advertisement sold them this product and , more important , made it look better than it actually wa . in conclusion , it seems athat in today 's world we are surrounded and enclosed by advertisement and people who try to sell thing . this is the reason why it is hard to distinguish whether the product being sold is actally worth buying or if it is just trying to trick our eye . it is important for people to recognize that not everything advertised will have exactly the same effect on everybody or will taste the same way to everyone . but also i had to make the experience first before i recognized that `` advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
