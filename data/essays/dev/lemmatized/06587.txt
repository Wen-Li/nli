the older generation sometimes say that the younger generation doe not play an active role in helping their community anymore . they think that the younger generation is selfish and only want to earn a lot of money . there are a few point supporting this opinion but there are also a few against it . the first thing to say is that the traditional bond between the younger and older generation have dissolved nearly completely . e.g. it is not common anymore that both generation live together in one house . therefore the younger generation can not feel this strong sense of community that once existed . from this on i think that the younger generation is involved in several other activitites to help their community . first , there are a lot of teenager who help the church or the local administration , e.g. during election . i have some friend doing that and i can say that the work they do there is really admirable . second , there are many teenager who are involved fighting against environmental problem . these activity are really beneficial to the local community because they help to achive a sustainable lifestyle . the last point is that many student are working hard for school or university . that doe not only mean that they want to achive professional success but they also want to improve life at school or university for theirselves and for all other student . now let me talk about a point i 've just mentioned : the hard work for school or university . of course this mean that they have to spend a lot of time learning and not directly helping their community . but i think that learning is the best way to achive a good life for the whole community . the young generation know that without working hard they wo n't be able to achive a good life for their community , e.g. if there are no skilled worker in town economy and finally the whole community will suffer a lot . finally you could say that it 's not true that young people today do not spend enough time to help their community . as we 've seen , young people engage in a lot of activity in order to help their community but they do this differently than the generation before .
