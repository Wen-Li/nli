one could wonder if , in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i personally think , that because of a lot of factor we will explore , this statement is not ag on my way to this test this morning i wa able to read a copy of the ` le monde ' newspaper . inside it , an article stated that the state of california ha decided to cut down on co2 gas emission by taking car manifacturers to court . the reason i mention this article , is that it stated that there are about 36 million car in california for about 35 million housholds . in my opinion california is one of the best example of a region in which the use of the car is essential in order to be able to move around it vast territory . but california is also the most prosperous of all american state and therefore can demonstate to u the type of situation that could arise if a country developped to such a scale and therefore had this type of need for car . it ha become common knowlege , or fear , or indeed both for many people , that in twenty year , china will be a lot more prosperous that it is today . if we just considered the fact that it gdp grows of 7 % a year , we could say that by 2026 , china would have equaled california 's prosperity . what make me tend to refute the proposed statement , is the fact that china ha a population of about 1 billion , this would probably equate to about 400 million household and therefore potentially about 350 million car needed by a new prosperous population to wonder through their vast country and city . i am of course not stating that china is a car free environement at the moment but the increase with the volume of car the country experience today would be monumental . furthermore , one would have to consider other growning economy such a india . europe is saturated with car and effort are made in order to diminish pollution by increasing alternative mean of transport . but this is possible because the territory are relatively small in comparison to immensity such a india or china . one could also say that , a demographic are increasing , there will always be more people on earth , until we finally destroy it , and therefore more potential car driver and buyer a a whole . it must also be pointed out that , since the apparition of the ford t model in the 1920s , the first affordable and mass produced car , the car ha become an object that simbolizes liberty . no indication seem to show that , in a near future , men will invente a new symbol and vector of liberty to replace the car . if they do , the psychological aspect gone , and only the practical aspect of owning and driving a car remaining , we might witness an increase in alternative transportation method and therefore car usage would slowlz decrease . however , it is very ulikely that this will happen during the next twenty year , and even if it did , that twenty year will be enough to witness a drop in car usage . a change of people ' psychology take time . finally , one ha to point out that the arguement that petrol will not be available in a couple of decade is not valid . firstly , this theory ha been enounced many time and new petrol reserve are being found day after day . secondly , new energy supply are being developped , such a the biometric fuel or the eletric car . the car may be cleaner and even potentially out of date in twenty year , but , a far a the proposed statement is concerned , there will not be fewer of them on a global scale , a long a there will be more human and more economic groath on this planet .
