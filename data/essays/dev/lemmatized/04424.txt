i firmly belive that recently young people doesnt have enogh time to pay attentioning to their community . i am going to give some reason to support my opinion . first , in moder world society is being busy and there are many thing going on . i think young people is much busier than old time . study is getting hard and hard young people may need spend more time on that . becasue they want to get better job and better life in future which may give u happy feeling . however , i belive they will forget about important thing a they focus on to the only study . for instance friendship , helping people , caring parent and brother and sister . volunteer is one of the good idea . they helpong people and they are learnd something from it at the same time . therefore they shold make time to helping their community . second , i personally think it is a such a excuse . because actually young people have time . .. even they are studying very hard at that stage they will have . if this kind of young people continue to inclise i would concern about the future . because helping society is needed for our life . it is essential and to be familiar with the people and community . we could find improtant thing from there and it will be useful for our future . still some may say young people do not care about this , i think they belive because it is only short time that young people enjoyning thire life . nevertheless , i belive to helping somethign is essentialf for u to live in this world whatever that is . thus student shuld make time to helping their community . in conclusion , i would ague that it is better to give the enogh time to young people more often . therefore parent should care about their child seriously to tell them to make a time to do the helping community . i hope the young peple will think about this statement more carefully and wish luck to the future wourld .
