nowadays , purchasing behavior is more and more influenced by the advertisement . there are advertisement on tv , newspaper , radio , internet and street . these advertisement may guide u on how to buy a product . it is hard to imagine a life without advertisement . does these advertisement always play a positive role on u ? i am afraid that i can not agree . there are too many advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the advertisement will make the product very attractive , so people will buy more and more product under this motive ; however after purchasing , people find that the product is not a effective a it is advertised . the reason is that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . for example , there are many medicine advertisement state that the medicine will soothe pain and cure disease very quickly . people suffering from pain and disease will buy the medicine becuase they believe what is promoted in the advertisement . these medicine advertisement have exaggerated the fact . even though you follow the rule , the medicine will not solve your problem a easily a it is stated . further more , in order to attract more and more audience to buy the product , the advertisement may even provide false information to make product seem better . i have heard too many story from my friend that they purchase high price cosmetic after seeing advertisement . when they try on the cosmetic , it doe not improve the situation at all , some may even harm their skin . i have to say that these advertisement are not responsible at all . they only show u the best example , but do not explain the product in a moderate and correct way . i do not deny the fact that there may be some advertisement truly show and promote the product , but i think the number is pretty le . most of the advertisement appear not a good a they really are .
