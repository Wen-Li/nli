`` life is just one , and we have to substract from it all a we can '' , i mentioned and used that phrase all my life . since i wa a kid , i understood that i have goal , the one that made me work and continue through school and college . i experienced a lot of thing , which made me the man i am today . i took risk during that time , like moving from my town to get a better education , but at the same time i continue with the same goal and doing what i did best , math and science . i understand that people do both , they take risk , while they do what they know how to do well . for example , a story about a guy that know how to sell tv 's to people . after doing that for a long-time period for a `` x '' company , he realized that he could do that kind of job with his own company , and he quit the job . then he started his own company named with his son 's name . thats wa the huge risk he took but he understood that people like him had choice , and that he will be success because he know how to do the job . with that story , an integrationg of risk and experience can be observed . he do know where he is good at , and he use that to try new thing . my experience tell me , that i should integrate both , while they are acceptable . my life is made about experience , and each day i take risk to keep living . overall , i do not agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . people are the owner of your action , and the success will depend on it . a person can be success by just doing what they know how to do , or by trying new thing , which will take them again to the point of doing what they know how to do . i know that my future is around scieces , but i do know that i have to take risk to achieve my proffesional goal , be a meteorologist . i have to move from my home-country , knowing that is for my own good . thats the bigest risk i will experience next year , while at the same time i know how to talk to people , make new friend , and take the best from every opportunity i encounter . success is around the courner and should experience it with new thing or by just doing what they do best .
