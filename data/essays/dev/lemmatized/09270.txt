the statement asserts that understanding idea and concept is more important learning fact . before we move on to judge the merit of the assertion let try to differentiate between `` ideas and concept '' and `` fact '' . ideas and concept represent the fundamental `` line of thought '' or `` logical progression '' behind any phenomenon . for example different culture use kinship nomenclature e.g. uncle , father , mother etc. in order to express not just natural relationship , but also social relationship , status , power equation , economic situation etc . on the other hand , `` facts '' represent the `` hard example '' or `` expression '' which can be immediately placed in their context and are self explanatory . for example , uncle is term used for father 's or mother 's brother . but in many culture uncle is also a term used for any significantly older male , even if no biological relationship exists . what it essentially mean is that it is very difficult to understand `` idea and concept '' a separated from `` fact '' , and vice versa . the two are interlinked in many way . its only thorugh `` observation '' of similarity between fact that idea and concept emerge . that is if it is observed that in a culture all provider of food and security and termed a `` father/mother '' , it mean there is more to nomenclature than the biological relationship . its no conincidence that hitler wa termed `` fuherer '' i.e. father . on the other hand , once an idea or concept ha been `` obserevd '' and `` established '' through the study of `` fact '' , it provides a medium for understanding of all future factual observation . that is whether they support or oppose the idea or concept . hence , observation of `` fact '' is both the `` initiator '' and `` distiller '' of concept . in this light , it will be fool hardy to see idea and concept a opposed to fact . both of them are equally important for real learning . students need to understand a `` concept '' through assimilation of fact . concurrently a concept or idea provides the medium for assimilation of large number of fact . both are inseparable for complete learning .
