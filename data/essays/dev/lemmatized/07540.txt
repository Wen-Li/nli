during the last year , we have seen a big difference in the way of life of all people . a lot of event have occured during the 19th , like the world war , the development of capitalism , the conflict of religion etc . .. and all of that have modified our society in france , or in other country . i will take for my exemple the situation in france . what happened in may 68 have contributed to change people mind . before this period , young people were more obediant and structured in my opinion . moreover , i think that they were generally le individualist than today . capitalism have developped that feeling and the consequence of all that is the fact that young people are obsesed by their individual success because time are more and more difficult and people know that it will be certainly more difficult in the future . so young people are pressured and they are conscient that they have to succeed . they work harder at school or they have two job like i can see around me , and they have le time to make anything . to resume , i think there are two principal cause : one because young people are nowadays more individualist and do n't think in helping other person , two because they have le time due to the new social model . however , we can see in a few situation that young people are able to help everyone that is in a difficult situation . for example , during the tsunami , we have seen a lot of young people giving a gift to la croix rouge or other association . many of them have expressed the desire to go there to help people who were reached . in fact , we can see that these young people can help their community when there is an accident . so we can say that it 's ponctual and they g can give the best of them at certain moment . but i think too that these type of population do n't make enough effort to help other people who need their help .
