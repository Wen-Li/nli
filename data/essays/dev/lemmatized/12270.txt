getting success is not an easy job in any field . you need to work hard and struggle for what to wish to achieve . people who have succeded in their work try to to make new thing and take risk a success give them a boost to excel in thier field . once a person is successful in achieving his target he will try out new thing and would like to explore more and more in the same filed and to apply in various other field . consider an example of sir issac newton . if sir issac newton would have just stopped his theory of gravity after it discovery then many thing would have been undiscovered till now . he applied his theory in the field of mathematics , physic , science to name a few . just think if sir issac newton would have stopped taking risk and searching for new principle and theory then advancement would not have been possible . the law would have been at the receiving end . one more great scientist to name will be einstein . he proposed the theory e = mc2 , the theory of relativity . he started using the concept in his surroundings which stunned the entire world . these great men did not stop after achieving their target but used their success a the tool to find out various new thing . if the person who is success and doe not wish to explore the field of his interest then the success will be of not much importance . doing what which is known can be done by others too but implementing it can be done only by few , who assume their success a the strength to discover what is not known . being wise is good by applying your theory in a different manner but to get success you need to implement your theory in various field . successful people will always make an attempt to make new thing and take risk . they will never make their success a the ending point of research or work . success is not the end . keep on trying and taking risk will surely benefit even though you might not get success on each and every step you choose to take .
