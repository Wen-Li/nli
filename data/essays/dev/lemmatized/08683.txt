can it be that people turn to use horess and camals again for transportation ? i dont think soo , people over time are being better and better in discoviries , and the day will come when they start using airship and viecles that will be able to fly . i agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today because of the divlopment in discoviry , and the spread of air transportation . in every new generation there are new mind and new people that think about life in a different way . with all the discoviries that have been done and the new mind whicj are comin to the world they will surely discover a new way of transportation that will make car dissappear . nowadays air craft and air transportaion is the largist kind of transportation in the world , and with all this spreading in this kind of transportation and the knoledge in it are making car a way of transportation that will not last . therefor , i think that car woud'nt last and there will be some other way to move from some place to another in le time and le affort .
