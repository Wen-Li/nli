i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than sticking to what they already know how to do well . there is risk involved in many the thing people do . that doe n't stop successful people from doing them . an intelligent person take calculated risk , which would make him/her successful . imagine how the world would have been if bill gate had n't dropped out of school to pursue his passion . we would n't have had the luxury of using the window operating system ! he took a risk that could ruin his life but he believed in his dream . all the mission to space are risky , there is a huge risk of money and more importantly life . since some brave people have risked their life for their dream , ambition and for mankind to a large extent , we know lot of thing about the planet , the satellite and the space . astronaut , inspite of having doubt of their return to earth have travelled into space . if it wa n't for their effort , we would have remained ignorant of the universe and it 's miracle . business is a field in which a lot of risk is involved . nothing is guaranteed in business . there could be a huge loss incurred from the business which are undertaken . but still , risk are taken to achieve greater height . it 's the same with the stock market . the path to success in business is full of trap and they need to be avoided to reach success . that is what many successful people do . be it any field , many successful person have taken calculated risk to reach where they are today . the elegant cricket player kevin pitersen , who is originally from south africa ha moved to england to keep his passion alive . the reason for this wa stated to be discrimination and politics in sport . had n't kevin pietersen taken the risk of leaving south africa inspite of being warned by the official that he would n't be eligible to play for his country again , the cricket world would have missed a great sportsman . he wa also honored by the british government . he is now addressed a kevin pietersen mbe . the legendary mountaineer sir edumund hillary along with tenzing norgay climbed the mount everest . the risk involved in it is of the size of a mammoth . they risked their life to climb the tallest peak in the world with sheer hard work and now they have a place in history . the information gathered by them is a giant leap in geological study . these few example clearly indicate that success come at a price and risk have to be taken calculatedly .
