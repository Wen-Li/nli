i partly agree with the statement that young people now a day donot give enough time to helping their community because of the lack of time and do u lack of awareness . it also depends on the individual attitude of the people . most of the young people have a busy schedule and they dont find time in helping their community . again it depends on their individual attitude . i have seen many people who wantedly neglect . they wantedly neglect and think helping community is waste of time even though they have ample of time . young people always try to find fun and act reluctantly when they asked to help . it is because they are not aware of the benefit and the happiness they get out of it . studies alone dont count you should also have helping nature . on the other side there are many youth organisation who specifically aim at helping their community and people in need . we have many blood bank where many young people come and register everyday . they collect blood and send them to hospital when needed for free . they organise event and give prize for those who donated blood to inspire young people we also have organisation who go around and collect money and send them to people who get effected byenvironmental disaster . when the tsunami catastrophe left many people homeless these youth organisation collected huge amount of money andhanded over to them and won their heart . so it is not that young people dont help , it is that they dont spend time due to lack of awareness . it is only possible by young people because they are energitic and dynamic in what ever they do all we need to do is motivate them and tell about importance of helping . elders should teach young people about helping people and spending some of their time for those activity . so i conclude that young people dont give enough time for helping but they are not so cruel that they dont extend a helping hand when needed .
