i do agree with the statement that advertisement do make you feel that the product advertised is better than what it actually is . the reason is that it us people that are famous , perfect result , incredible situation , and many more to make their product look better than they really are . in advertisement they always make claim of excellent result . for example in an ad for a fairness cream it might claim that it will make you fair in six week but when you actually try it out the result are not a spectacular a the ad claim . thus the ad make the product seem better than it actually is . another way by which advertisement make their product look better is that they use star power . that is they hire either a big movie star or a sport celebrity to endorse their product . this attracts the public to the product without really paying all that attention on the product . thus the product will seem better to you just because a particular star is using the product . it will not matter to you if the product is not really all that good . what doe matter is that your favourite star is using it . thus star power help enhance the product and make it seem better than it actually is . also in advertisement , many time , the model is able to do incredible thing after using the product . for example the ad might show that after drinking their product the model is able to do incredible stunt . these stunt will make the product and the people who use it look cool and it will very much appeal to the young male population . they would only want to use the product , a it is associated with cool people and they would also want to become cool people . thus the product is made to look better than it actually is . last but not least the ad barely mention the disadvantage of using their product . for example in an ad for mutual fund the disadvantage is mentioned so quickly that the viewer barely pay attention to it . thus drawing attention only to it good point . thus advertisememts make their product look better by using star power , claiming exaggerated result and many psycological trick .
