nowadays , there are many advertisement . we also buy product a we see many advertisement . when we see advertisement , we may feel that we must buy the product . some people belive most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are but others do n't believe . given the choose between first and second opinion , i choose the first opinion . first , advertisement use the visual aspect . in detail , in case of the paper advertisement or internet advertisement , the product can seem much better in respect of color , size , shape , etc . for example , a week ago , i ordered the clothes on the internet site because the clothes are beautiful pink that i like . i wa so excited and expected . yesterday , the clothes wa finally delivered but when i saw the clothes , i wa quite disappointed because the clothes wa ugly densed pink that i loathe . so , following the example that visual aspect , advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . second , in case of home shopping , the cast introduce the product . to illustrate , my aunt called my mother a few day ago , and my mother told me about the story of my aunt . i will tell this story . a few day ago , my aunt watched tv home shopping channel about kimchi . the cast ate the kimchi so deliciously and said that kimchi wa so yammy . futhermore , all guest ate kimchi so deliciously and in my aunt 's opinion , it look so delicious because of the spiced color of the kimchi and eater 's attitude . so , my aunt ordered the kimchi but when my aunt ate the kimchi , taste is very bad and disgusting . on top of that , most company apply their product ' prize and prestige in the contest in advertisement so we believe and buy the product that but these may not be true . to sum up , by above reason and example , i think the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
