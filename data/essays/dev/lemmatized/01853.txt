how doe someone enjoy life at all ? what do you need in order to enjoy life ? young people usually have le problem . especially when they are very young they dont have much to worry about . everything they should worry about is already been taking care of by their parent . and they do n't even have a sense or a feeling yet for issue that are uncertain and one could worry about . since worrying is a stopper and is something that slows down enjoyment very young people enjoy life more that older in that respect . but to really enjoy something you have to be not only of no worry but you also have to aprecciate the action that you are performing , the situation that you are into and so on . young people having le experience in life and due to good partens le experience in unhappy and unsatisfied time of life can not aprecciate thing to the extend adult do . someone once said : you dont know that sugar is worth unless you have tasted salt . older people have tasted salt . so they know how to aprecciate when tasting sugar . enjoying life can also mean to accomplish the dream that you have . this can be a certain style of life with having a wife and child , a good job or a something materialistic . first of all young people do not have access to certain area like a good job , are not able to drive a car yet and when they are able to they mostly can not afford their dream car due to the lack of financial mean . again if they are really young they might not even think of these thing and so they wo n't miss them . but a soon a they get older they have all kind of dream and much of them are not fullfiled in the near past since young people dont have the money or age or knowledge for it . older people however had a fairly good time of their life to work towards their dream . they are more likely to be in a stage that they at least could accomlish the most urgent dream , the one that wa really important to them for all of their life . this enjoyment however can again be stopped . this is the case when older people look past and remember the thing the didnt achive rather then the one they did . young people do not often look backwards that way . they remember the good think first . in addition to that in an unsatisfied situation young people are happy again with so little . for example when a child drop his icecream it will start to cry . but a soon a he get a new one it will not only stop to cry but be happy again and smile . an adult might be thinking about wasting money all day long , about his goofyness and let the bad occasion erase the good one that he finally ha a new icecream . i can not agress or disagress with the statement a a whole . for me it depends on the atitude of the person . but when it is someone that is looking forward and recognizing his achievement then he enjoys his life more than anyone else .
