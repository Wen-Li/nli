in our life , all of u want to live in good , confortable condition , want to have a big house and also a nice car and money till death . but for this suitable life can not be won easily . it want successful . and for the success ; open mind , risk and new trial are necessary . there are two kind of people . one of what is successful and the other is unsuccessful in the life . in my opinion , successfull people are open minded and always ready to try something new and try to develop a process or a project or a subject . in addition to these they like to take risk for the success . but on the other hand , some people stay away from risk , new project and also they are afraid of trial . they live according to their life rule . if we focus on the professors-scholars working , educating and researching in the university , college and also in institudes , we could determine the success on their face by investigating their reliable behaviour , talking , smiling . .. etc we know that they dont get afraid of making mistake becouse they believe that if they m make mistake it will turn to them a success on the other hand if the other people afraid of making mistake , taking risk and stay dependent on their own rule , could not be successful . for example , if an unsuccessfull student is investigated , according to the student behaviour and life , random study time that wa set by her/hisself could be determined . in conclusion it could be said that successfull people are the people who are not afraid of making mistake and in addition to these who are not to take risk . they are always ready to find out something and development . but a comparised above , to do wahot is wanted doe not bring any success and olso a comfortable life we imagine . if life is just like a stair for people having beauty confort miney on the upside , in my opinion successfull people will go up easily but the others will not .
