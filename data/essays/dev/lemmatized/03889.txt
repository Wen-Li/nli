i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understanding idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is true that learning fact is important but not importan than idea and concept . as my experience , most of the professor give test based on the idea and concept of the what we learned . purpose of testing is the how much student get idea and concept of the content and how to apply it . none of my professor wanted the student to get pas the class without understanding idea and concept . according to korean newspaper , most succeceful student are getting idea and concept of the subject , not the fact . reseachers tested experiment in one high school . they had fifty people were studied only concept and idea , and fifty student were studied only fact . the result of the experiment wa forty out of fifty student who were in the idea and concept group got a 's and ten out of fifty student who were in the fact group got a 's in the test . after reading this researcher paper i focus on the understanding idea and concept of the content . as a result my grade were higher than studying fact . i think understand idea and concept is more important that learning a fact . just getting a good grade is not the good point for the student . student have to understand idea and concept and walk one step forward to the feature .
