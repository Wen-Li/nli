i disagree with the statement that idea and concept are more important than fact for student . actually from my point of view , fact are the same important just a idea and concept . first , without fact , how come the idea and concept ? ideas and concept can not be separated from fact . for example , when we learn the concept of force in physic , student need to do experiment to be aware of the fact that there are different kind of force everywhere in the world . the teacher will confuse the student if he or she just draw a simbol and point it to them , then say `` look , it is what we call force '' . by doing this , the teacher is at the rick of being fired . second , student should not just get the idea and the concept but also know the detail fact in order to pas the exam . for example , in a exam of a biological course , student should remember the exact example of animal in order to describe the progress of reproduction . i can not image a person can write down all the material the teacher want without any fact . although there may some exam which allowed student to take book with them , remembering the exact fact benifits the student pretty much , because ttey can save the time spent on referring to the book . third , student should learn fact in order to find a good job in some case . for example , i major in computer science and it involves a lot of programming . the mathematical concept and idea do help me learn theory of computer . however , it is the time when i tried to find a job that i realized that fact such a the parameter of the computer do me a big favor to find a job a a programmer . in conclution , while idea and concept are important in learning , fact are of the same weight to student .
