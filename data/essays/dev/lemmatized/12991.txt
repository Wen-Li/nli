america is considered a great country because it offer opportunity to common people to gain a better life trying something new , like pursuing a new business or getting real an extravagant idea . this example underline the great importance in our culture for conquering something new and taking the risk correlated . if we were born just to do the same life , the same job and the same experience of the peple lived before u , problably the humanity would still live in the cave . the evolution itself of the human person is strictly related to what some people discovered when they tryied to go under new way . thinking about cristoforo colombo , for example , if he did n't navigate his fleet trough the ocean , putting his life in danger , the americas would n't be discovered . of course , taking risk is the other face of the same coin . it 's very rare to try new thing without any cost , even the implicit one like loosing the credibility or the social status kept till that moment . for istance , in the past a lot of people died trying to develope aircraft . but with their persistance , we can now fly from one continent to another one just in few hour , and who succeded will be always remembered a a pioneer and a founder of our contemporary world . for me , the real issue is alway to understand the trade-off between the advantage that new thing or discovery can bring and the risk related to them or to the path to discory them . real successful men always analyse this relationship , because otherwise the result could be catastrofic , maybe not at the beginning but in the future . quick success without any solid analysis behind is to be avoided a much a the fear of running for your inspiration or new idea .
