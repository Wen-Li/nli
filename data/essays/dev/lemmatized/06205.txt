i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . from my point of view it is very important to have people within a society who try to do new thing . this is especially important when it come to innovation . up to now there would not be any automobile or plain if people did not try to do new thing allthough these thing were connected to high risk . on the one hand society need invention but on the other hand you need to have a look at the risk aswell . regarding albert einstein and his invention everybody would agree that he created huge value for our society . on the other hand the question must be raised if nuclear weapon existed today if he would not have been that innovative . as most people are part or member of a community or a company , i would like to focus my answer to the strategic management of a company within a highly competitive market . from my point of view the only possibility to be successful and to create sustainability is to be innovative and to have innovative employee . of course there are a few company staying in the market by focussing on their key competence and by `` doing what they already know how to do well '' but to become `` successful '' a mentioned in the question you have to be innovative . of course one could say that a company focussing on only one well known activity doe not have any risk but from my point of view the risk is to get kicked out of the market by another very innovative company . there is a famous statement referring to the strategic management of a company and it employee which can be used for all other people a well : `` often it is more important to do the right thing than to do thing right '' . i draw the conclusion that people trying new thing are successful allthough they must be aware of the risk .
