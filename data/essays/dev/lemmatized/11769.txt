with the development of our country 's economic . travelling becomes a new fashion of spending the time of holiday . now there is a heated concerning over whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . some people think travel in a group led by a tour guide is the best choice . from their point of view , the guide will give you a plan and arrange your travelling route . well , this might be good , if the place you want to go is in the plan of the tour guide . however , a far a i am concerned , travel in a group led by a tour guide is not the best choice . i prefer travelling alone . first and foremost , trave by oneself can do whatever you want to . you can go on the internet , search the place you admire , learn more knowledge about it , find the way to it . the following thing is to find some time , pick up your bag , take some food , go directly to the place you want . you do not need to go to the place you are not interested in or you have ever been to . equally important is that the time for travelling by oneself is flexible . you can do travelling by any time in any season . if you appreciate some place of interest , just stay a little long , look around more about it . it doe no matter with others . while in a group , you have to respect the opinion of others ' . in the end , another point that we should not forget is that some tour guiders will take traveller to some place that people do not want to . guiders may take traveller to some local market where the price are very high . meanwhile , the good are inferior . all in all , i disagree with the satement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . travelling by one 's own wiil much happier .
