i fully agree to that statement because of the following reason . first , an already successful person will accept a higher risk because he ha a larger security if he fails . when the new thing produce loss he still ha the gain of the successful working action he did before . so he ha a lower risk than a person who could lose everything by experimenting with new thing . secondly , the hunger for success grows with the success one ha . a successful person know there ha to be more than the already achieved . the known old pattern will only provide the known old amount of success . but to increase it there have to be found new unknown and maybe also unfamiliar kind of way which mostly have a higher risk but also a higher possible gain than the conventional one . if someone ha a risky character he will not stop at the first success but look for more the whole life . the third and i think most important argument deal with experience with fear of the future . if a person were successful at least once in his or her life by taking a risk he or she ha made an important step . by crossing the border in one 's own mind once the next time it will be easier because you get a kind of imagination what ist waiting for you on the other side . of course there is no possible calculation with all risk , there will always be some one did not think about . despite of that the person know how to deal with development that can not be foreseen , so he or she ha no or at least le fear of them . thes argument show , why success on a high level is not possible without risk at a high level and therefore i agree with the given statement .
