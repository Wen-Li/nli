nowadays , young people are more involved in many activity than in the past . for this way , someone can adfirm that young people do n't give much time to help their community . because of i 'm a young person , i can explain my opinion and i can support my disagreeded opinion with some example . the first example i support , is that young people have not so much time to help their community because they do n't wont to help them , not because they have n't such time : in fact , i can help my friend if he ask my an hand , even if i have to study for myself . if i am beloved to a friend , i help him in every way . but in this way , i have to renounce to spend some time to play the computer or to have a pause , going to commercial center , or runnig , for example . i supposed that the people that said this sentence , know just selfish people , that think just to their life . but in university , for example , student live together much time : they stay at the same lesson , they spoke in pause time , they have a lunch togegher and they become a a family . in a family , if a member ha a problem , the others help him . and in this way occur in university . in fact helping each together can consent to pas more simply the exam , and live the university life with no fear . also in family young people help fairly well ( and more than sometimes or seldom ) : in fact a a young person grows , his responsability grows itself and he recognize that helping parent is important . they can do it in different way : working in speare time , to learn some money to spent for their personal object , and they do n't ask money to their parent , or cleaning the house or their own room . naturally , exist many of young people that do n't help in none of this way their family , but i ca n't generalize . as the man who said that sentence can not generalize .
