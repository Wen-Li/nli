some people prefer to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . others believe that elder enjoy life more . when faced with the decison of who enjoys more , quite a few would claim that young people have more energy to enjoy life more and that is my point . there are numerous reason why young people enjoy life more . i will explore a few of the most important one here . the main reason for my opinion is that young people are at the begining of the life and they have more advantage . take my father and my brother a example , my father ha a lot of responsibility while my brother doe n't have any . when my father want to do something new , he should think himself and his family . my brother , in contrast , go out at night and come back whenever he want and he is n't bread earner . there is another factor that deserves some mention here . people are different . they have different trait , custom , belief and life style . some pfrefer to stay at home when they get older , others go out more than they did when they are young . similirly these reason also apply for young people . when we consider that some young people have a lot of responsibility , while other do n't . young people have opportunity to choose what they want . when they have opportunity , they can go for it and they can make the most of it . it seems very difficult for u to prefer one to another because some people are very emotional others very strict and small problem do n't usually get to them . in short , even tough young people have some problem choosing their career , they have more advantage to enjoy life . but that doe n't mean older people do n't have fun . they do . sometimes more than young people .
