the term `` successful '' is related to getting goal and dream , but to get a goal mean to take a risk , to do new thing . so that is why succesful people like to take risk , because they know they can take the opportunity and explote it to the maximum , and thats how they go ahead and with a risk there is always a finish line , the goal , so when succesful people see that goal in their life they see it and do not look back or look both side , they keep it mind to what they want and that is why they get success . now at day successful people take risk , try new thing and opportunity , opportunity in which they have to try new thing , opportunity in which they will earn experience because they do not do only what they do best , instead they are in search of new capacity they dont even know they have . for example bill gates , he wa a man that one day woke up and decided to take a risk , a new opportunity , a new thing , something that no one ha thinked about it , maybe at those day when microsoft did n't exist people thought that bill gates wa crazy , but they did n't know what would that decision make him what he is today . bill gates is successful now at day because he took an opportunity that anybody else wanted to grab . i agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' because we have to go out to the world and explore new thing to see if we are good in other thing , because there is a lot of people that ha being successful just for taking risk , so that mean we can do it to , we just have to decide to do it and do it and keep our mind and our eye focused on the goal we want to reach .
