the new things i agree if you try new thing and take more risk you can achieve your goal and earn big money . i am talking abaout money because my major is a international trade in my university and i would like to do this business buying an d selling somethings . i know how to do this job but i think trying new thing for instance you can buy another product and you can change it and sell . it ha more risk , may be you can not sell cahanged product . successfull people in my country always trying new thing for their goal . they are sometimes loosing but if they win , they would have more profit . for example , its a biggest turkish company . first it a shoe company , they produce shoe and export it . they know how to do well shoe . one day the owner who ha a company tried another thing they sell all of his property ( his factory , his business , his car , etc . ) and he bought a land for produce onion . he doesnt know anything about how to produce onion , how to sell . ? t like a gambling . he found a farmer who is living in a rural place . he helped to produce onion and selling process . and they found small package for onion . for example 1pound , 3 pound package and they sold directly market . it make more profitable and more usefull for consumer . and he ha a onion brand name . now the ex shoe producer ha a big onion 's farm and he earns 1 billion dollar a year , he is exporting onion all over the world it a big deal . in my opinion trying new thing and take a risk are not good for everyone because you need a little bit good luck in your business life .
