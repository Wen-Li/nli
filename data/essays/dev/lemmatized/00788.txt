so far a the question is concerned , i am not quite at home with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . although it may be argued that the young population is not interested with social and political affair a it wa in 1960s. , i believe that young people have willingness to help the communties in which they live . it is a well-known fact that the young population is aware of the communal issue a they are part of a family which belongs to the community . in other word , the more they live in family the more they give enough time for their community . for instance , in a village or in a minority group , the young population do not hesitate to participate in the charity program such a visiting the hospital , helping the oldest member of the community . they even became a member of ngos in order to demand or to help for the communal interest . on the other hand , we may acknowledge that there are some current problem to keep the youth intact with their community a well a with their family . the process of globalisation suscitates a global village where individual gain universal attribute and goal rather than interesting with their community . therefore , it becomes difficult to keep the interest of the internet-based youth appropriate with that of the community . however , this situation can not abandon the young willigness to help their community . consequently , we may consider that young people prefer interesting in private and global objective rather than communal or social one . yet , we should not ignore that they are also active in especially helping their community and they find time to helping even if they feel themselves busy and overloaded by the educational or professionnal life . briefly , young people nowadays give time to helping their community in spite of the difficulty in their globalised and internet-based life .
