in our study , we often have the choice between learning many academic subject and specialize in one in particular . it can be quite a dillema . in my opinion , specializing , at least in the end of our study , is more interresting . i will explain the advantage and disadvantage of each solution and explicit my feeling . broad knowledge of academic subject is appealing at first . you do n't have to make the choice between the theme you like , and learning from one can improve our understanding of another . for instance , learning the living of specie in biology class can help in ecology class . swithing between subject often also help on not getting bored . on the contrary you do n't have enough time to each class , and that can be really frustrating to learn only basic in the one you enjoy the most . the other choice that is offered to u is specializing . the great thing about it is learning more and more information about a subject you like ( or at least you should like ) and getting more and more confident about it . furtheremore you make le mistake . the major drawback is when you need knowledge ( even basic ) on other academic subject you do n't have them , and probably do n't have the time to learn them , and need to ask for help . this will result in a huge loss of time . an other negative aspect about specializing is that sometimes you are to much concentrate on your subject you ca n't see by yourself the mistake you are doing . finally , i prefer to specialize in a topic than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . the main reason is that you can be good in a topic only if you practice often , and i do n't mind asking for help if i need knowledge about another subject in order to fullfil my work . moreover , in order to begin in profesional life you need to be good at least one thing .
