i agree this sentence . young people every time enjoy life more than older people . in my opinion young people very active , make alot of sport , listening music , dancing , singing song , reading going cinema . but older people prefer to aloneto communite other people . young people doesnt like think life condations , financial problem by contrasting older people . although young people very powerfull they dont interest any problem for instance ; national economy , envoiremental poisionus , starvy . they think every time enjoible thing . in addition these young people spend a twice a older people . they dont like mension about their lesson . where a older people like travellng , resarching event , reading observing event , listening romantic music . conculision being young people is very entertaining thing . young people chance and give to our life movement . if they dont have our life make u unhappy . world is very active and peacefull them .
