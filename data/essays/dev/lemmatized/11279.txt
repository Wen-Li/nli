when it come to student learning , the discussion of the issue ha become a vogue during the last decade . considering soial atmosphere today , some people hold the opinion that learning fact is more important for student is superior to understanding idea and concept . others , however , contradict learning fact . personally , i agree on that understanding idea and concept because it ha more advantags . firstly , thoes people agree on learning forget a universal truth that a a old saying that `` know the smell until you teste it '' . as i remember , the people popular in the society all have strong ability that can paly a role in their work area . the ability can not be learned in the class , because it need to have more practise in the real society . inaddition , another more essential factor why i advocate understanding is more importan is that learning fact without understan will forget soon . an example i can give the detail of the argument : some people like to copy other 's work in order to hand in in to the teacher , but they never understand what the answer mean , because they just learn to do not understand to do . thus , they could't get the knowlogies . of couse , choosing the learning fact also ha advantage in some extent . for example , the tescher always give u right answer that could avoid to waste of time ; they also guide u a shortest way to reach the result ; and they do good for u to make a better life ; and so on . but if all these factor are contemplate , the advantage of understanding idaes and concept carry more weight than those of learning . to sum up , based on the above discussion , it is obvious to conclude that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than learning factor .
