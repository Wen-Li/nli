i completely agree with the fact that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . to support my stand there are three valid point . firstly , with the advancing technology newer and faster mode of transportation are coming up like metro , bullet train , intra city express which make it very convinient for people to travel from one place to another and actually consumes le amount of time a compared to car which generally take more time because of the traffic jam and all . people rather commute to far off place in metro and train and have already started using their car a mode of transporatation to nearest station if they have such an option . secondly , with the arrival of internet and video telecommunication most of the office find it convinient for it staff to work from their home , eg. software firm , business office and corporations related with trading of shares etc . with this trend on , it will take very few year when most of the people will be working from their home . this will automatically reduce the usage of car a most of the people use their car to go to their respective office . finally the most important factor which will determine the reduction in the usage of the car is the scarcity of the fuel . in today world the consumption of fuel is growing exponentially and it seems there are no mean to replenish it , even though various effort are being made world wide . with limited amount of fuel supply the world wont be able to sustain the demand of the market and finally , to come up with the solution so a to reduce the fuel consumption , people will be motivated not to use car and other such vehicle . this will automatically determine le usage of car in the future year . it might be hard to digest but the way thing are turning out to be it seems we will soon stop the usage of one of the most important invention of human history . and it can be very well assumed that this time duration will be not more than twenty yeras .
