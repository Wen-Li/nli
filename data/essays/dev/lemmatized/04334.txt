there ha been an argument about which is better ; having broad understanding in many topic or specialized knowledge in one specific subject . when it come to academic subject , i think that specialization is essential because of following reason . almost all area of knowledge require professional specialist to handle and develope them because they are very complicated nowadays . it is true that our society need generalist who have wide range of knowledge , but generalist ' knowledge is based on the specialist ' work in each area . it is specialist who make a new discovery and produce knowledge , having the ability to perform sound research on each specific subject . that 's why i assert that specialist ' role is primary . moreover , having broad knowledge is an easy job for everyone because sharing information is easier than ever before . we can easily search for the lastest knowledge in book and internet . this make the generalist ' role unsignificant to be a generalist especially in these day .
