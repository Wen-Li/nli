yes , i agree the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . willing to travel along with a group of people is a good option rather than travelling alone . there were many factor which will benfit u while we are travelling in a group led by a tour guide . firstly , by considering the security factor which is a big task in tour especially to forgien country , we can feel more security while we are along with a group of people rather than alone . even in case of some tough situation we will get the support of everybody in a group . secondly , travelling in a group is economically more recomended than travelling alone . we can share the experience and joy while we are travelling in a group and we can benfit from most of the expenditure we will face . many tourism department in various country are offering good tourism package for the people who are coming for forgien tour . they are providing discount and valid package especially people travelling in a group rather than travelling alone . thirdly , we can have a planned timetable and we can have lot of fun all along the tour along with our group member , we can plan more programme and event which will entertain u along with our fellow member and even we can had a large . even imagine if our group consist of various talented person , the we can organise seminar on research oriented topic in a forgine land . lastly apart from the above factor i.e ; security , reducing expenditure , presenting individual talent and joy we get while travelling in a group . we can also plan some industrial tour or join in a training programme which will enhance our skill in our job and all and travelling in a group will always show up the identity where ever we tour .
