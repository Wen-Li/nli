i do n't agree to the statement . i love to travel alone . there are some difference between travel alone and travel in a group led by a tour guide . first , i think that a travel must be free . if i have an oppotunity to my trip , the place i want to go is n't same with my friend or whole group member . joining the group and ledding by a tour guide make it impossible to go to the place where i want to go . a tour is a thing which go only to the place where someone selected before start . second , i think that a travel should be flexible . you may want to go many place like the place you see from a train window , or you find a place where doe n't printed on your guide book . to change the route from you thougut before your trip is one of preasures of travel . in the end , i think a travel give a chance to meet new friend . i do n't t need group member because i can find a new friend who ha same opottunity with me . if i had a question , there are someone who ha a lot of knowledge about there . so , i think the best way to travel is go alone .
