the most important time nowadays , most of young people do not have enough time to have their own time . some student can not have time for their own work or rest a their parent doe not allowed or they have really busy schedule for study . so i think young people doe not have enough time to help their community . now i want to talk about the time a they have and the reason why i think young people do not have time . i have seen many student who spend hard time to study their school work and keep their busy schedule . i think the student have to have enough time to help their community . it is because during they are helping their community , they can get lot of life experience which give them more important knowledge than the study in their school . some time life experience bring really important thing to people to know for their life . also the community are important just like life experience . they will get many thing which they want to know , when they are talking or chetting with others and friend . for example , if we study with others , we can get much imformations which very useful than studying by our self . nowadays , our life is changing and people can not get their own time anymore . also young people are busy to live in these day and it is same happening to student . in my opinion , if we have free time to communicate with people and have some rest time , even if we have busy schedule , it will bring better condition and result to them . i believe that if they have time to help their communication , they will get clear idea to study more effectively with better condition .
