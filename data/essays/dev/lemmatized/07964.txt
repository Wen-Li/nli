there are many way to travel , such a travelling with our family , with our friend , a an individual or in a group led by a tour guide . also the way we choose to travel is highly dependent on a place we choose to go . from my personal experience , i think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way if we would like to go to a new place or city . there are several reason for this , first and maybe the most important one is that we might choose a country or a city that the local language is not our mother tongue , so the tour guide would be a helpful resource in this case and of course s/he would help u doing the procedure such a booking a hotel , knowing the restaurant , etc , while entering the place . also , a we are new in the city and we do not know many thing about it social culture , by having a tour guide with u , we can easily be informed of the useful information about the habit and cultue of the people in that specific country , and we can be well prepared for the travel . the second reason , in my opinion , is the fact that we surely would like to visit many new place in our travel and of course get many new information about the history , art , social life , music , etc of the place . how can we obtain such an information if we travel without a group led by a professional tour guide having lot of interesting information about the city ? i think it might be possible to do all of these thing if we travel individualy , but really we will waste lot of time on it . third and last , to travel in a group is much more safer than the other way , since there might be some possible danger along out trip , the tour member can be helpful in these case . all in all , if i choose a new place to go , i prefer to travel in a group led by a skillful tour guide to have a great time and enjoy my trip .
