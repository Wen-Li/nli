everyone ha different opinion , it depends on different background . the one who agree that travel should let by a tour guide may think it will save more time , much cheaper , and effeicent . the others think travel by themselves maybe a better choice , they think they can travel by their own plan , do whatever they want . by comparing the pro and con , i think the former one is better and more instriument to led by a tour guide . i will explian it and give some concrete example . firstly , led by a tour guide will save much more time . let u image , we walk in a fablous city , we appreciate the amazing view , the lake is so beautiful , the weather is so nice , and we just walk and walk without stop , finally we can not even move a foot , after whole day walking , we just see the nature view of the city . the city is big , and we are small , it is impossible for u to reach every corner of the city , we do not know which place is famous , which way is a shortcut , which bus we should take . however if we have a tour guide , everything will become easy . the tour guide will lead u to the interesting place , some famous , but more importantly some others we will never have the chance to know or find them if we do not have a tour guide , the guide will aslo tell u how to get there , which bus should we take . is not great feeling that you do not need think anything , but just have fun . secondly , it will save more money . the tour guide always have some discount from the majority hotel and suite , they can easily book a room with a lower price . they can give u many coupon when we buy something . thirdly , it consider more efficient . we can visit much more place than we do not have a guide . when we arrive at the airport , there is a bus just outside waiting for u ; when we go to a resturant , the meal is ready for u ; when we need to leave , someone is telling u . last but not least , we can share our experience with other group member , we can easily find some to take a picture for you . in conclusion , to travel in a group led by a tour guide can save more time , save more money and help you arrange thing more efficently .
