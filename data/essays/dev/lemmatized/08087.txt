i totally agree with that statementa that young people recently do not have enough time to help their community . there are several reason why i think so : rack of time and busy life , and unfamiliarity with the community . first of all , i am also one of the young people who do not engage in helping their comunities . in my opinion , the big reason is that they are just too busy jsut to go to school . in my case , even i want to give my time to help my community , i do not have enough time t spend in it because of the school . recently , many student go private school far from the house not public school located close to the house . i also go to private school . the school is so far that it take me one and a half hour to get there . threfore , it is difficult to find and spare the time to contribute to my community because of lack of the time . second , most student even elementry school student go to juku school after school because amny parent and student are not satisfied with the education of the school or they think they need support school study . therefore , they do not have time even to have familty time or to hang out with friend . students of the age that are the time to take entrance examination to next school such a high school or university go juku almost whole week . consequently , they would rather to have time to spend with family or friend if they could find the time . third , they and i feel the community is not familiar with u . i am sure all people knew each face of their all neighbor and they communicateed each other a lot long time ago , to my disppointment , it doe not happen now . i just moved new city so i do not know about my community and my neighbor . as a result , even there is a festival , i always do not participate in it because there is no people who i know . i guess it occur to people nowadays a lot . in conclusion , i am in agreement that most young people do not spare enough time to support their community . even they want to help them , it is not easy because recent childrent are having busy day . i think we need to find the way to community to be more active at first .
