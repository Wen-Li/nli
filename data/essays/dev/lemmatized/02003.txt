i think we should improve our life right now , so i agree with this statement . i have sereval reason . first , i think successful pepole can improve the thing that is not good , so they should take risky . for example , if they know how to make the computer well , and they do n't take risky to change the computer more convenient and more useful . now we might not have notebook in our life . thefore , i think we need take risky to improve our life . on the other hand , some people only make computer only they already do well they ca n't make improve in that computer . there business might go down . in addition , this is a compitition world , so we need improve . second , we should make new thing that successful people need take risk from that new thing . for instance , many people have cd player they have improve to it lightness and useful , but other company make mp3 player is more useful and lightness . it mean this is risk if people do n't like mp3 player , their company might die out . it is a big risk . however , if it success , the business can get richer than before and more famous . in conclusion , i think successful people should try new thing not only do what they already knoe how to do well because if they take risk , they can get richer also good for people who live in this world . it mean they can improve thing also make useful new thing for people .
