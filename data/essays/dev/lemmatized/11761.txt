some people believe that young people enjoy life more than older people , but from the daily life point of view i think that also older people can enjoy life in many way . in this modern society , city , town , and also little country offer to all aged person right way to enjoy life . young peolple can meet eachothers in disco club , pub , cafe and spend their time toghether . the same thing can be done also by alder person , if the healt is good . maybe , in my opinion , young people can enjoy life with more sport than older person . young people have a youg body with many energy to spend . they have resistance and a young heart full of energie . but older people have , however , many others valid way to enjoy life . they can spend time in the park of the city , they can feed animal in the zoo , thay can play card toghether , they can play some instrument , like guitar or piano . all those opportunity however product smile and older people feel relax . another important thing to substain my opinion is that older people have the power of the experince of their past life . this is an important force for their soul . memories of the past bring them to fell strong emotion , maybe romantic emotion . at this point , is very hard for me to come a conclusion . i 'm a young boy with many wish , and those wish are also a strange way to enjoy life . i spend a little of my free time imaging , imaging and dreaming the future . this produce in me emotion . maybe i 'll use these emotion one day in the future .
