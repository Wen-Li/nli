do you want to live successful life ? if you want to make it possible , i think you 'd better try new thing than old thing that are too common and oldfashioned . in my opinion , most people who live successfully tried new thing and took risk . there are two reason to express my opinion . firstly , it is true that nomal people do nomal thing , live nomal life and love nomal thing . according to speaking of successful people , however , they were willing to take risk to succeed . people should not copy and repeat something because sometimes the something need to be changed . we should create new thing that will make u live new life and better life . secondly , maybe all of u know ` life is venture ' . it is so famouse sentence that we could hear before . but the case that it come true is very rare because people are afraid that they could make a mistake in trying new venture . but i think avoiding venture to keep them from failling is the worst thing in your whole life . you do n't have to be frustrated even though you fail to try something new . it will give you an experience . this envaluable experience will help you to succeed other thing . it is so envaluable that you may not want to change to other thing . in conclusion , there are a number of opportunity in the world . some people can see and cach these possiblities , but others ca n't see that they would miss these thing . you have to take these opportunity in your life . in this morden society , it is so important to be a creative person . society want that kind of people , so we should have courage and keep going to the new thinsd
