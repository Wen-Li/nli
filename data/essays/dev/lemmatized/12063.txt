a world with fewer car ! sounds preposterous now . but i think this is going to be a reality in twenty year from today . there are various reason why i hold this opinion . these include population growth , fuel crisis , and popular consciouness about environment . the population of the world is only growing by the day . naturally , we would expect more car to roll on the road . but , we do not realise that land is not growing in proportion to people . with limited land , there will come a time when we will not be able to find more space for our car . then the recourse is mass rapid transport system , which discourage car-use . this ha already been seen in delhi , india 's capital city where delhi metro rail system ha been created to deal with the stress that increasing vehicular population wa creating . now , we see that the number of car have indeed come down on the road because people find it more convenient to take a train to office , at a negligibel price , rather than maintain an own car . another reason why the number of car might go down is the shortage of fuel . oil crisis is here for real . it is becoming increasingly difficult to satisfy the energy need of the world . very soon , the price of oil are going to increase very highly . early sign can already be seen . in such a case , running a car can be very expensive . research on alternative fuel , like biofuels or solar power , is still in nascent stage . thus , it will be very difficult for the common man buy fuel for his car . in india , the price of petrol ha been increasing steadily and my family now go out in car , only when it is really necessary or when all the four of u have to go out together . otherwise , we use bike or , simply , the public transport system . the last reason why i think that car are going to be fewer is popular sentiment against environmental pollution . cars use fuel which increase environmental pollution . therefore , some country , like those in the nordic region , encourage their citizen to use bicycle which are more eco-friendly . they are also a healthier option in comparison to car a they keep the rider fit . thus , concious citizen support such idea . this trend seems to be catching up , which make me believe that it will in future become very popular . in that case , the prospect for car look bleak . to conclude , i believe that car are going to become rarer in the year to come because of a variety of factor . these include shortage of two resource : land and oil . these are going to be scarce because of growing population , in which case car will not be viable . finally , when people become more eco-friendly , they would look for option other than car , which will affect the prospect of these automobile .
