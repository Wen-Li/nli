according to many people , there will be fewer car in use in the future than today . environmental problem are linked with the huge number of car in the world . pollution ha become a central problem in our society . in order to respond to this problem , governements focus on many possible solution such a limitation of car in the city . as an example , the mayor of london ha introduced a congestion charge in the center of london in order to limit the number of car . as far a i am concerned , i think that this solution is very convicing a it ha been proved that the number of car ha been reduced in the city . moreover , public transport are supported by many governements . the cost of undergroud is very cheap in some country such a france . i would rather take the bus or the tube instead of driving my car . on the other hand , the cost of driving licence ha considerely increased during the last year . as a result people are more likely to take the bus , or to use the underground than before . however , emergent country such a india or china are not ready to reduce there production of car . most of the economy is based on this production . therefore , environmental issue are not the priority of governements . although these country are aware of car ' pollution they do n't take preventive measure in order to solve this problem . but many measure have been taken in order to face with this problem . the kyoto 's protocol illustrates the capacity to deal with the huge problem of pollution in the world . the problem is that many industrial country did n't sign this protocol . to conclude , i think that we can hope that there will be fewer car in use than there are today , because governements make u aware that car represents a huge scourge for our society . as a consequence , many measure have been taken and will be taken in order to reduce car 's activity . however , even though many thing have been done , the number of car will increase because many poor country need of this economy in order to survive .
