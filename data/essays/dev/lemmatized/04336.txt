i am disagree with the statement because i think that the older people enjoy life more than young people . in fact i think that today a young people have every thing that he or she want and therefore doe n't fight to conquest his dream or his desire . therefore after a bit time the young people is tired , because he know that he can have everything . in opposite , an older people know how to fight for conquest his dream because in the last time there are le thing . in addition today there are more and more problem in opposite the last time , because the society is become more industrialized and the people are always quickly . this trouble cause a generally unhappy and the young people doens't enjoy his life . therefore i think that today when a young people say that he is happy , it is n't true , but there is a way to hide a generally unhappy .
