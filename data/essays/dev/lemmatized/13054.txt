i disagree with this statement . it is true that enviromental problem around oil are risen nowadays and lot of car company , for example toyota motors in japan , hasten the speed to develop the new system of transportation which can be replaced from the transportation using car . some people , especially one who live in the metropolitan area , may use such way of transportation . as a result , the number of car may decrease in those area . but there is a condition to be such an area . those area should be developed well in it inflastructures and economics . in other word , the area which is developing now can not afford to buy or develop that kind of system . on the other hand , the demand for car is thoght to be increasing a it economy grows bigger . and car are available for le amount of money than that cost to adopt the new kind of the transportation system . globally thinking , the population in the developing country is higher than that of the developed . if so , the speed of increasing the number of car in the developing country exceeds the speed of decreasing the number of car in the developed country . this is the first reason for my opinion . the second reason is that the demand of the car would not be disappeared . car mania exist
