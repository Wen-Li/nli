there are many way one can travel . people can travel alone or in group led by a tour guide or travel in group without a tour guide . i do prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide . because with the help of a tour guide we can save time , save money and get the effective use of their rich knowledge about the place . i prefer to travel in a tour led by a tour guide . because they will have experience in planning and arranging tour . by this way we do n't need to scratch our head to plan the tour . for example , one our family planned to visit singopore . in singapore , we missed many important place to visit . this is because we had le knowledge about the place and language . we would not have faced this problem if we had hired a tour guide . with the help of a tour guide , we can complete our tour with le cost . because they will have a complete data base of hotel , travel , lodge and other important thing around the world . they can find effective tour plan that will fit into our budget . for example , one of my friend who also visited the singapore with his family with a tour guide completed the tour with inly 10000 dollar . but in our trip i spent more that 15000 dollar . so i think a good tour guide will help u in saving money . by hiring a tour guide we can save time during the tour . because they can plan u some good schedule so that we will visit maxium place in the limited time . also , by choosing a good and experienced guide we can get to know the historical fact behind the place or city . though we will get a overhead of paying to the guide , i think it more worth than the amount we pay them . so i think considering all the important fact mentioned above , it better to hire a tour guide when we are going to travel in group .
