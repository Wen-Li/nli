very hard to understand many fact , if it is not related by idea & concept & example . .. i think both attach to each other cose with out the the fact their is no idea . for example in the war , why the war doe not stop . it is been since the old centary we have war , and everyone know the bad result of thw war : hungyness , pauverety , too much people go away , fritness , people with psychology problem , kid who lost there parent , family who lost there own home . .. but for my opinion the student understand all the idea and concept , in the history about all the war , during all the history , but if they can learn from the fact this will not happen again . another example more closer . when the teacher explain about a psychologie problem at class if he say the fact like : people still they have psychologie problem , every student will wonder why ? when he explain that many people who have emotional hungreness ( their mother didnt really offer to much let say love to there kid ) and didnt teach her kid the right and wrong . this people love to still not because they need it , but sometimes to satisfate there emotionel . in a busniss class when the proffessour said `` the costmers always right '' .when he conyinue explaining his idae we understand what he mean : the busniss with out customer doe n't work . it doe n't matter the company what she think , but the customer who consumes this product . for example when the constummer is been treating good he will be your door to another custommers , ( friend , neighbour , cousin , family . .. ) . but if he is not satisfate he will tell everyone and it will be a very bad reputation . everywhere not only at class even at home with our kid , family i think it hard to learn fact if their no idea and concept to understand .
