as we now that in this world every one want freedom , no one want to be a slave . because they think that they had born individual . according to this statement i am not agree with the following statement . because it not a need to go in a group or led by tour guide . the main purpose of tour guide is to lead the team , and show the direction . in the group or with tour guide there are lot of boundation , like we have to move with group only . we cant move a we like to move any where . we have to follow all the instruction which is given by group leader . even we like that place or not we have to be stay with them . lots of problem we can face at the time of trevel . if we are going in a group we cant leave that place without permission . so now a day in our society no body wht restriction , they want to move free and enjoy any where . like i am taking a example of college student , if they are going picnic for five day for the permission of college principal . there college principal suggest them better you people go with tour guide , so that in future you need not to be faced any problem . but student were not agree because they want to go without guide or any faculity member . they want only freedom , because then only they can enjoy any where and use there time in a better way . some time we need a tour guide but not every time , and also we keep in mind that up to a certain limit freedom must be there , if it will ecess it will not good for individual . in my opinion the best . finally i would like to conclude the best way to travel without any tour guide , but we have to manage all the thing , in a right manner and in a systematic way .
