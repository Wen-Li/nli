i agree with the statement which is given to me . because tavelling with the group make me to share more thing with different peoplewho wre in the group . travelling in a group with guide will make me to know the new placs which ihd never visited before . guide will explain the entire information about the place . travelling in group make more advantage becuse if the information about a place is not known to the guide i will try to know the information with my colleague who are in the group . tour guide will probably have a clear idea of which place is mare important than those of others . if we are having a little time to explore new place in the country it is suitable to take an idea from the tour guide . travelling in a group make me more enthusiatic to know the new thing . if i had visited the place early i will try to explain the place i had visited . if iwill travell in a group it will keep me away from the lazyness . i will try to know the different culture that exist in a country and the idea of different people how they are thinking . whether they are thinking in a positive manner or in a negative manner . travelling in agroup make me more attention and concentration that i had . people with inthe group make me more enjoyable while travelling . it will release my tension and problem . the travelling with the group maske me easy to travell because it will not let me know how much time i travelled . i can travellmore long distance with the group .
