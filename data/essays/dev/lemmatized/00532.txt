have you ever try to figure out the hard and complicating math question ? some people suggest that it is important for student to learn the fact . on the other hand , i think that understanding the concept is much more important than just learn the fact . i suggest my opinion with two reason , people will remember longer when they understands the idea and they will also figure out all the question even though it 's hard and complicating . first of all , people tend to remember longer when they understands the concept or the idea . however , when they just learn and memorize the fact . they will forget about it quickly . for instance , in biology , i learned about the ` feedback system ' in human 's body and i wa able to understand how this system work because my mother knew about the biology very well . however , my friend , who did n't get halep from anyone , just memorized and learned the whole process of the ` feedback system ' and a week ago , we had a pop quiz in the biology class . i wa managed to figure out all the question about the ` feedback system ' but my friend could n't solve non of the question . in this case , i wa able to answer all these question because i understood how the ` feedback system ' worked then my friend could n't answer them because he forgot what he memorized and learned before . secondly , student can figure out any hard question if they fully understand the fact or the idea . this happens a lot in math class . math teacher do n't just ask student easy and simple question , they make the question complicated and hard for student to solve it . students who understands the idea would be able to solve these question . however , student who just memorized or learned the fact will be confused or hesitated to figure out the question because they have the basic knownledge about the concept and idea . since , student do n't forget or mis-use the knownledge when they understand the consepts and student , who understand the idea and the concept , will manage to figure out all the hard and high-leveled question . above all , i state understanding the fact and the idea are much important than just learning the fact .
