the pesipicuous phrase , `` on the move '' ha probably been termed after much thought . research show that since the dawn of civilisation , man ha been a tourist in a crude sense . this is evident in the study of nomad , shifting agriculture and the like . however , my purpose to highlight this fact is not to discus history but to merely initiate the debate whether there 'll be fewer car in the coming twenty year or not . in my opinion , the number of car produced in the future will be on the rise rather than passing a declination . i would like to support my stand with the following reason . the automative industry ha witnessed a manifold increase since man ha invented the wheel . so , to believe that this rise will ever decline , is highly unlikely and improbable . firstly , economic review show that living condition will improve in the future which mean people have greater leisure time . that go out to suggest that people will have more time to spend with their family and go out on vacation and using car people can drive to farther destination . even if the thought is inclinated to the rich , there is another reason to believe why car production will increase . there ha always been a focus on science and technology improving the nature of thing and car are not an exception . infact , lot of investment is going into making solar car and better fuel efficient car . certainly , the expenditure being done on the research is not to never make use of it in the future . this suggests that people want to have more car in the future . lastly , necessity is being combined with luxury in the economic arena a of today . when people have a proportionate rise in income , they use le of public utility service . taking the middle income group a an example , i would like to illustrate that an increase in income always shift people 's preference to personalise commodity . one would definitely want to own something when one ha the money to do so and with the economic development throughout the world , people would like to switch to owning their own car than using the public transport system . therefore , i believe that indeed there will be more car in the year to come .
