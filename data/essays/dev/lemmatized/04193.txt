knowledge `` its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . '' i agree on this statment because knoeledge save alot of people from a lot of dangerous thing . `` a little knowledge is dangerous . '' i have faith in this saying let take the medicine such a pain killer a an example . people with a little knowledge mite think that taking more pain killer will help killing the pain faster , in the other hand well educated people will rialize that taking over dose of pill will have a lot of side affect on the person who take these pill , thats why a person must have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . this doe n't mean that the person must be well educated in every thing because the saying say : `` a man of all trade is master of none . '' it 's hard to know each detail of every thing in life because this will rouin your focus at the important thing in each subject in life . my advice to every one is to try to educate your self in every thing and this doe n't mean to go through detail in every thing . but each person must have a specipic subject to know every thing about , and try to gain information from different people you meet in your life with different education because : `` christmas come but once a year .
