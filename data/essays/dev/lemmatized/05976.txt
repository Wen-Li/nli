in my opinion , young and older people enjoy life equally but in different way . being young or older have advantage but also disadvantage . first of all , when you are young , you do not have the same pleasure a you are old . on one hand , when you are young , you enjoy your life at the current moment . indeed , during your study , you prefer to go out with friend , to do sport , to discover new thing by travelling . .. however , on the other hand , when you are older you enjoy different thing of the life . indeed , you want to get married , to have child , to buy a nice house , to go on hollidays with all your family , to succeed at work . .. secondly , responsabilities of a student are totally different comparing to an older person . indeed , a a student , you do not have many reponsabilities because most of case , you do not have a child to take care of and you depend a little bit of your parent who help you financially . the main responsability of a student is to have good mark and to succeed in his study . when you are older , you have much more responsabilities . if you have a family you have to take care of by working , buying food , paying bill . .. having responsabilities a an adult enable them maybe to enjoy le life . however , having reponsabilities can be a good thing for some adult because thus they think they are usefull . finally , young people can enjoy le life than older people do because they generally have le money . if you are a student , it is more difficult for you to go on hollidays or to go regularly to the cinema . in most of case , student have to work and go to the university at the same time in order to pay their distraction and their university . contrary , older people doe not have to work and study at the same time and generally they have a better salary . to conclude , when you are a student or when you are an adult , you enjoy life differently because their situation of the life is different
