i agree with this idea . there is four reason . at first , it is more appropriate to play sport because some of the hard sport such kind of succer , basketball and baseball , it is difficult to play for older people . in fact , there are only young star player in professional league of above sport . in addition , it is not only the number of sport they can do but also the risk of injuly when they play the sport . the possility to get injuly is higher in older people case . secondly , young people can travel easilly than older people especially foreign country case . when we trip to somewhere , we sometimes face culture difference with other people who live in that place and should have flexible mind to accept such kind of culture difference to have good relationship with them . moreover , sometimes it is necessary to communicate with them by their own language . in that case , we have to learn another language to communicate . it is easier for young people to learn because of the flexible and fresh thinking way . thirdly , young people have enough time to do what they would like to realize . basically older people have more social responsibility especially they have son or daughter . it is quite difficult to make timing to do in quite tight situation of older people . forthly , there are a lot of chance for young people to change situation according to their preferance . for example , it is easy to get new job for young people rather than older people because they have a lot of potential to learn more about new job . main reason is they can work more time due to law . currently it is difficult to have job for over 60 . some of the people who would like to work can not get job because of there reason . in young people case , it fully depends on themselves .
