it is a hot topic that successful people are love to try new thing and take risk rather than keep to do what they already know how to do well . manu different people hold the different opinion in the respective angle . in this topic , i need to say i agree that the success is belong to the people who like the new thing and not afraid the risk . there are teo reason to support my idea . first , i think the most important quality is finding . the people who like to contact new way can always find the solution when they met the problem . in contrast , if you just rely on the tradition way to solve the problem , you are limiting your situation and may not overcome it . in other word , if you are not afraid the proble and face it , you can find it is not a proble for you easily . for example , when i wa a child , i need to wait my mon to pick me up and back home after school . one day , my mon ca n't pick me because my grandmother wa sick and she need to go to hosiptal . in that time , there is no mobile phone to be the conatct access . my mon wa very nevous that she can not find me . in the mean time , i tried to find something to do and went to the library . in there , i met my brother who wa studying and he take me back home finally . second , another quality is brave . people will sucess because not afraid to try any way to complish their goal . in gernery , many way mean many chance . that is also measn you are increasing your chance when you are trying the new t in conclusion , because of the above reason , i strongly believed that people who like new thing and advantures will be successful easier .
