like war and foreign policy also a big part of our future depends on oil and fossil-resources . there are two possibility in my opinion . the first one is that there will definitelty be fewer car in use than today . because there might not be enough oil to provide fuel for the million of car . but one ha to considers that the consequence is that not only car are affected . one could easily say that a car is not that important . but if there is no fuel left for the car , there is either non for the bus , for a taxi , for the loanmower and for airplane . nobody will go nowhere . i personally could take my bike and go to the grocery store , but what for ? there will be no possibility to do my grocery because the shelf will be empty . if there is no fuel for car , then there is no fuel for truck that take the grocery to the supermarket . and this is only the peak of the iceberg . there will be no production , no traffic and even today hightech might break down . i do not want to paint this vision of the future too black . there is another possibility . since we know that the whole traffic and one could even say the world is too dependant on fossil resouces such a oil , we could change that . there so many sophisticated scientist who work on solution on how to gain energy . and they have result , like wind and sun al renewable enery resouces . we could already reduce the need for oil , if we for examlpe buz our vegetable from a farmer in our town . then le truck would be needed . whatever we do we need to start changing our energy-wasting habit now . then in twenty year there might be a many car a today but they will run with non-fossil energy . but i do definitely think that there will be le car that run by fuel in twenty year .
