while there may be some people who disagree , i totally agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the reason why i take this position are elaborated on in the next paragraph . firstly , for example , when i wa looking for a used car about 6 year ago , what i did first wa to read thoroughly the car magazine . these were full of advertisement actually . there were so much car information in the magazine that i wa next to impossible to sellect 3 or 4 candidate . one day , after i managed to do so , went to the car dealer in person to see on of the car itself . at the sight of the car itself , i wa a little confused because the car did n't look a good a in the magazine . secondly , when i made uniform for the baseball team in my company , i again checked the catalogue in depth . in the catalogue , almost every uniform desigh looked cool , but when we ordered one type in the catalogue and finally saw the real uniform , iwe were a little dissapointed to see the difference between one in the catalogue and the real one . furthermore , i have made a company recruiting website for college/university student . this wa like a advertisement of our company , our workplace . we tried hard so that our company would seem excellent . of course , we did n't made false statement or image using picture and cgs . but what we tried to do wa to collect best picture of our company and workplace . so , in this sense , our company 's website should have been the very best image of our company . in conclusion , for the reason stated above , i totally agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . on the other hand , i seem to have to learn that product in the advertisement are not a good a they really are when i do the shopping .
