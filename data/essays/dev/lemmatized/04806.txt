the society we live in is based on consumption . i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in the contrary , nobody would buy these product . i think that nowadays , people really need to be sure of what they buy . they want to make sure that they buy the best product . so , the only way to ensure them is to create the advertisement they want to see , even if it is not true . it is the case , for example , for the solution which make you lose weight in only two week . most of the woman know it is not true but a the advertisement show faked benefit of the solution , woman want to try it , and so , they buy the product . women finally notice that the product doe not work . it is also the case for the child . they often see toy they have ever dreamed of on television . the advertisement make them believe that with this toy they will be the strongest , or they will be the best . as child still ignoring the principle of this consumption society , they believe what they see and they want to buy the toy . but once they have got it , they become aware of the truth and see that their toy will never give them what they were told . so i think that , indeed , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . it is one of the most impostant rule of the consumption society . produces have to always seem better than what they really are . people only buy what they think to be the best for them . all advertisement have to lie because if they do not , the advertisement for another product would and so , the true advertisement will not have success . it seems that there is a tendancy nowadays , people prefer to be told lie to feel more confidant than being aware of the truth . that is why i think that only the advertisement whicg make product looking better than they really are are more succesfull .
