it is difficult to say whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject or to specialize in one specific subject . first i will say that it is important to have a broad knowledge . but then i will show that it is not easy or even possible to do . having a broad knowledge is very good . this is why , at school i have learn about a lot of different topic . to know a good about history a about biology or astronomy is fantastic . if i had this broad knowledge i would be able to speak with a biologist or an historian . but it is possible to have a broad knowledge of many academis subject without being specialized in one particular topic ? in fact , my knowledge in biology would not be a accurate a this of a biologist . that is to say that , somebody who ha a broad knowledge of many academic subject , is specialized in nothing . so , in that case it is hard or even imposs to find a job . i think it is important to specialize in one specific subject in order to find a job , or to be able to provide accurate information about a precise topic . in conclusion , in my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject . but in that case it is important too , not to forget that other subjet exist . so , it is necessary to read book about other topic . for example a biologist must know about history even if he will never be a good in history a in biology because the may need historical information to explain several phenomenon that he is already studying .
