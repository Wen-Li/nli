i disagree with the given statement becuase i strongly believe that society ha managed to reach the hieghts that it ha today through specialization and division of labour . specialization is a theory that emphasizes the importance of concentration in one particular field . when this theory wa employed by factory and manufacturing plant , it resulted in a dramatic increase in production . ofcourse specialization ha it drawback and fault which are caused due to lack of knowledge in other field , but the benefit of knowing one thing really well , greatly outweighs the fault of specialization . a reason why specialization is so successful is because eventually ( usually after 12 year or so of schooling ) , people realize that they are better at somethings than other thing , or they realize that they have a passion for a certain field and that that 's what they want to do for the rest of their life . at this point in time it becomes apparent to them that other knowledge , that doe n't further their understanding of their subject choice , is a waste of time . after all , if some one wish to be a mechanical engineer , why doe he need to know the literary feature that shakespeare had used to capture his audience attention . i 've already decided what i want to do in life , and to tell the truth studying thing like spanish and business seem to divert time away from my goal of becoming a research scientist . i love reading about the latest medical breakthrough and discovery , but all i get by learning spanish is frustration and low mark . i sincerely doubt the importance of spanish in the long run , i mean sure it might help me communicate with people who only know spanish , but how many people will i meet like that . through my personal experience i 've learned the importance of knowledge in all area , but i 've also seen the importance of specialization , and in my opinion , to know one thing very well is a lot better than knowing relatively nothing in everything ,
