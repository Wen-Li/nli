we live in an age where information is exchanged between continent on the click of a mouse , where geography ha ceased to define distance . what i try to mean is that with globalisation come competition . according to me , to stay ahead in this highly competitive race one ha to excel or master in whatever academic field one may be . this mastery of an academic subject can only be attained by specializing in that particular subject rather than having only a broad knowledge about various related subject . the old cliche `` jack of all trade but master of none '' doe not appeal much to me . i would like to elucidate my theory of specializing in a particular subject is better than having knowledge of various academic subject by citing a practical example . obviously a company would prefer a man with a master degree in chemical engineering to another man applying for the same job but with a diploma in chemical engineering and a diploma in biological engineering . even if the company would employ the latter for his skill in both chemistry a well a biology he would definitly be given a post subordinate to that of the former & a pay package which would be lesser than the former . however if the man with the diploma would hold a degree in say a managment course and if the company would also require the managerial skill at the same time then it would be a different question all together . to sum it up i would say that a specialized course in today world is given a higher priority in the competitive market .
