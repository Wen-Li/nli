i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is with a tour guide . most of the people would not agree with this statement , a they will argue that you can become an explorer if you travel without a tour guide . well , this can be true if you are travelling alone , travelling with a lot of time on your hand and travelling within your own country . but imagine if you were to visit a foriegn land , where you do not know any one . you do not know the people , the custom and the tradition . you do not know the historic place and you do not know the direction . how can you enjoy a tour in which you spend most of your time figuring out where to go and how to get there ? travelling in a group led by a tour guide ha many other benifits , such a meeting the people in your group who share the same interest a yours . you can communicate with them and exchange a lot of valuable information . you can know where they come from and perhaps they can become your tour guide in their country and you can do the same for them . tour guide know the exact history of a particular place . they can take you to place which you might not have an access to if you were travelling on your own . tour guide can also give you hint and tip when it come to dealing with the local . they can advice you of the place that you should and should not go . most of all , the tour guide give you the best return on your investment . you can go to a foriegn country and make the best use of your time by not missing any of the famous and important place that you could 've missed if you were to travel alone .
