when it come to traveling in a group some people may say that the best way to do so is led by a tour guide ; i personally disagree with that oppinion . it 's true that having a tour guide ha it advantage such a being taken to all the typical local turist attraction , you will be almost sertain that you wo n't be missing out on any must see place . yet , in the other had , having a tour guide limit your freetime . when traveling in a group you want to spend time with your friend , and spending it a you wish ; not having to be tied to a schedule a it is when using a tour guide . it could also be said that when traveling in big group , people always want to see different thing , and argument may occur . although having a tour guide could prevent this disagreement by simply following the itinerary set for that day , there a better way to solve the problem . the group could just simply seperate , each person go to where they want , and at the end of the day meet again . the advantage of this solution is that when a big number of people are together for a period of time , usually argument happen ; by sending each person on their different way it give them time to refresh from the enviroment of the group . most important of all , of why is better to travel without a tour guide , it that having a tour guide babysitting you around the city take away a great part of the social and cultural interaction . the experience that you earn when you explore an unknown city on your own is something that can not be showed by a tour guide . in conclusion , for all the reason named above , my suggestion when it come to travaling in a group is to not hire a tour guide and explore the city on your own along with your friend .
