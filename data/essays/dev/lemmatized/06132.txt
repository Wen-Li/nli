it is more important for the student to understand the idea and concept rather than to learn fact which were once stated by the people itself . facts are nothing but inference drawn after experiencing and researching on those issue by the people who were once student . once the concept and idea based on a particular issue are known by the student than the fact can obviously be drawn in the end . it is a fact that sun only rise in the east and set in the west . this fact if wa just agreed by the people blindly than the world today would have been different . it is also a fact that an apple when thrown upwards always fall down . if this fact wa also accepted blindly than isaac newton would have not known to the world . there are enough fact that ha been known by the present world . to draw more fact the student first need to study a particular topic , do research in that area and understand the basic idea and concept behind that area . it is only than that new fact could be stated . facts are just a single line statement that can be learned by anyone . in order to reach a postion it is for a student to learn the concept .
