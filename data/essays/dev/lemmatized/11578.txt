i disagree with this opinion that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i will raise the reason in following passage . first , a one of the japanese , and one citizen of the developed country , i think there are possibility that the number of the car in use will be reduced , because particulary in city , the person can transport easily without a car thanks to the sophistication of the network among train , subway , and bus . and i think in the part of suburban also develop the similary method to transport like city . but what i want to say here is that the opinion i mentioned now is too micro to think globally . second , i think we must think more worldwide . in the earth , there are many country want to be more developed . in these country , i think that the number of car in use is increasing . the reason why the developing country will use more car in future is that , to develop the country economic capacitiy , the need of car will increase to transporate many good to commerese . i think the transporation abilitiy ha a significant meanig to these country . in conclusion , to think world development , i think disagree with the opinion .
