the best way to train and improve our intelligence is to make the brain work by understanding and analyzing different concept . therefore i definitely agree with this statement : brain 's exercise are more usefull and important than memoy 's exercise . the first step in the education of any human brain is to learn how to study and understand a new idea . learning by memorizing new fact is only a mechanical exercise that can not increase our intelligence . therefore if we can understand a concept , we will be able to remember it and it will be part of our knowledge for ever . sometimes student try to learn fact because they think that it is an easyer way to learn ; but this idea is completely wrong . only understanding the real and essential meaning of a new concept , the student will be confident and able to use it in his future . in addition , it 's important to underline that the rule of teacher is to encourage student to analyze and study new idea . for example , i remember in my high school the support of my favourite teacher who wa trying to teach me how important is to study deeper any subject instead of learn fact . in conclusion , i want to emphatize again the importance to understand idea and concept because is the best way to increase our knowledge and our intelligence : that is the real exercise for the human brain . .
