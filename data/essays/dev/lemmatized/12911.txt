humanity never found out the response of this question : ` is it more important to see the idea and concept or to learn fact for new brain ? ' . both of these two pole have their proper advantage but is one of them more essential than the other one ? for student which one is more efficient ? ideas are always needed and a a result they are important because they are the starting point of all developpements , of all achievement . students have to understand these idea and concept because they are in a great thirst to knowledge which is leaded by these abstract form . more precisely , a student must see the meaning of the idea and concept to go forward , to have new vision , to develop his creativity . thus , understanding idea and concept are really important for student which are this world 's future . on the other hand , student can not do without fact because these show the result of idea , these clear the reality for u . students can not continue just by using idea and concept , without knowing fact they wo n't be able to corporate their abstract view . moreover , fact are the light of the past , of the present and with them of the future because a in history we can not go on without knowledge of the reality in this world and for student ' education reality pass by fact . also student will encounter fact to test their idea and concept , ifnot thay ca n't know if they are correct or not . in conclusion , with these advatages showen , it 's impossible to say either learning fact or understanding idea and concept is more important for student . in my opinian , we do n't have to compare these two side because they are going always together by completing each other and both of them is really essantial for student .
