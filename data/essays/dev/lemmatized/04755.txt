human have created these sense of going out of home called travelling . travelling is a very fun option for you to take . however it is not always the way you want it to be . on the one hand you have the opportuniy to travel in a group with a tour guide or in a group but without a tour guide . with these in mind i personally prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide because you have the opportunity to learn more and also because you have your schedule done . the first reason i prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide is because i can learn better the other culture . you have a guide giving you and telling you lot of information about the new place you are visting . for instance if you decide to travel to south africa you would not only understand even a word but also would not learn anything about these new country completely different from yours . the other reason i prefer travelling with a tour guide is because the schedule is already program by my tour guide . i would not have any minute to waist time . i would take advantage of it in every single opportunity . in fact if you travelled without a tour guide you may not be able to wake up at seven in the morning . a few year ago i went to cuzco in peru and i did not contacted a tour guide . i did not learn anything about that incredible monument , you can not imagine how i regret it now . it wa a waste of time traveling there without a tour guide . therefore whether you chose to travel in a group or by yourself try to be led by a tour guide and try always to prepared your trip very carefully in order for you to enjoy it .
