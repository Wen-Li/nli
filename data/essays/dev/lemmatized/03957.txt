i completely aggree with the statement . success is attained by forcing yourself to the limit , out of your confort zone , and conquering the challenge , whatever it may be . through preparation and acumen , and utilizing what you have learned in your past experience , stepping out of the confort zone and facing a challege directly , is the best way to increase stamen and tolerance that will help make you become stronger . for example , being a martial art student and observing the successful move of my mentor and chief instructor , i can confidently state that he practice for success . i met my instructor when he wa merely a senior student , once he became the chief instructor and owner of the school , he revolutionized the curriculum to do thing that had not been done before-this is getting out of your confort zone , knowing that you are doing well , but that you know you are capable of further success . the chief instructor decided to expand the curriculum and incorporate social activity that will benefit the people in the community . in order to do this he wa forced to expand his staff on contract - this mean that he committed to employ this staff for at least a year - , regardless of the outcome from the change in the curriculum . to make the story short , the exposure to community activity increased the popularity of our school , and the respect , reputation , and profit that came along with . it would have been financially challenging for the school to have staff that would have not been needed , had the social activity addtion to the curriculom not succeeded-he would have thought of something though . the chief instructor wa looking to be more successful through innovation and thinking out of the box , and in my opinion , he attained his goal . another example , and a more common one , is the introduction of microsoft windows a an operating system in 1990 's . before , windows came all about , most operating system were based on prompt and response and peole were used to it . systems like dos and lunix that were monotonous , but worked well . mr. gates took a tremendous risk in creating a whole new interface to use in the computer , an interface that wa more expensive and complex , but turned out to be more effective and entertaining for most user . nowadays , windows is the most popular operating system . taking risk mean thinking out of the box , moreover , it take courage and confidence , to materialize the idea . mr. gates , thought windows would work , took step to attain his goal , and succeeded . in conclusion , trying new thing , while risky , can improve the individual and the outcome through challenging out endurance and tolerance . no one say it will be easy , but if you are persistent enough , you will eventually succeed .
