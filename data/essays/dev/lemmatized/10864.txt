i absolutely agree with the statement . moreover , i think that good advertisement should enhance the appearance of efficiency to maximize the influence on the consumer . advertisements for skin care product are especially good at twisting reality . they usually employ model that have immaculate skin regardless of the product . then they follow the usual recipe by showing the model using the product and telling the audience how big of a change it made on her . it doe n't take long for the audience to react to this display of cause and effect . the problem is that the product probably did n't have any impact on the model whatsoever : she had perfect skin beforehand . and that 's not even mentioning the computer enhancement . .. however , i think one thing must be realized : the advertisement that i described previously did it job . it implanted a seed in the consumer 's mind and the sale will happen . that 's exactly the purpose of marketing : generating sale . i think it 's largely the consumer 's responsibility to train itself to mostly ignore advertisement . we know that they are fake , so why do we believe them anyway ? do n't get me wrong : advertising is a regulated business and a such should limit itself to what ha been ruled acceptable by society . laws exist that forbid telling lie or deceiving the customer in an advertisement . building on my previous example , if the skin care product ha a real potential for reasonably improving the appearance of skin , then it is the consumer 's task to discern what is real and what is embellishment . as long a the advertisement doe n't guarantee the same exact result on everyone , the marketing firm is on pretty safe ground . i 'll conclude by attacking the other point of view : how could anyone disagree with the original statement that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ? that 's the way it is . to anyone who belief advertisement display the whole truth unmodified , i have a bridge i 'd like to sell to you . ..
