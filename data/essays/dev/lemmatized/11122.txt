as a young person myself , i often feel guilty for spending so little time with the community . i had often noticed that the social bond between neighbor have diminished in recent year , and people are becoming le caring than before . that 's why i think we should definitely spend more time helping our community . but how ? the main reason nowadays that young people doe n't spend much time with their community is that they are crammed with homework , extracurricular activity , entertainment , ... etc . they are simply not spending a lot of time strolling about the neighborhood . without any interaction with their neighbor , young people will easily neglect their role a a member of their community . although they read about community service in their textbook , few actually participate in it . and when you ask them why , they simply reply : ` i do n't have time . ' so if we wish to solve this problem , the first thing to do is to decrease the amount of burden on young people . schools should end earlier so that young people can spend more time inside the community . teachers should give their student le work on weekend so they could have adequate time to conduct effective community service . parents should relieve their child of to much activity and they should not force them to go to cramschools . without these correction to our education system , school would end up to actually teach young people not to spend time with the community . of course , one might contend that young people will end up spending the extra time playing computer and not doing community service at all . that might be the case for some kid , but in my opinion , if people felt they are involved in their community , they would try their best to make it better . this sentiment can be further enhanced by government propaganda and social education . it is everyone 's responsibillity to bring young people back to community service . they should not simply put their blame on laziness manifested by the younger generation . i pray for a day when the old bond between neighbor can be re-established .
