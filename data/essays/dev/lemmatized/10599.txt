i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . for example , one of my classmate , anna bron is very successful in my advanced placement in art 12 class by trying new thing . anna bron is a well known to be a good painter in my school . she said she felt most comfortable with painting and she liked to challenge herself by doing hard thing . she ha been successful by challenge herself . however , what brought her to the most successful stage wa challenge herself by doing easy thing . there is a project called `` concentration '' that all of ap art12 student have to do . anna choose to use teabags to symbolize memory of our life . she believed that used teabags have a memory to each people depends on why that person drank that tea , when they drank it , where they drank it . her first idea wa to make a canvas out of those teabags and paint on it . as i mentioned before , she feel most comfortable with paiting . her subject matter wa very interesting , but her idea of paint on it bothered my art teacher . my teacher suggested her not to paint on it but find a way to make it interesting by using teabag itself . anna said , `` but . . that is going to be too easy . '' she thought making some art project in easy way will result low quality work . no drawing or paining wa a big challge for anna . however , she decided to take my teacher 's advise . anna tried new thing by make it simple and by using teabag itself . once she told me that it is so hard to do something so simple and she is not used to it . later , she found her way to make those teabags seem interesting . she laid out those teabags and made a mobile ; quilted with different kind of teagbags ; and other different experimentation . anna is now making dress out of her teabags that she collected from people and she is acheiving very high stage a an artist . she is not only recieving a high mark in ap art 12 class but also having the opportunity to try new thing . she is successful by experimenting new thing .
