most company allot a huge amount to advertisment . why do they do that ? is is still beneficial after using thousand of dollar just on the advertisement ? as the matter in fact , it is . i actually read an artical about a drink advertisement using a korean top star . the sale of the product ha increase dramatically after advertisement . why ha this phenomenon happen ? first , most advertiser try to make a good image of the product through the advertisment to attract customer . there 's actually no one trying to complain their own product on tv . hence , the consumer unconciously accept that the product on the tv or the paper are actually better through the image that the advertisement . for example , creating an image of beauty or health by using jessica alba on the picture make people think that `` oh , if i use that product , i will be beautiful and healthy like jessica alba . '' furthermore , advertisement put unconcious trust in people 's mind . it is an human instinct that the product that we know is better than others unknown . and advertisement make product more widely known . people just simply ca n't trust thing that they do n't know about . hence , by using the phenomenon , advertising creates a kind of fake trust on the product . for example , what would you use between a pantene or a shampoo you never saw , even though you never used both . most of the people would choose pantene because they know it . advertising is a kind of magic or trick that attracts people to use it and it 's actually the purpose of the progress . by soaking a pleasant image of hollywood star , for example , and using the human instinct of preference to famous product , it paralyze people to buy them . however , we have to be aware that `` a picture mean more than thousand of word . '' we have to experience ourselves than just experiencing through a tv .
