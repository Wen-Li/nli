i think a basic knowledge is necessary , but in my oppinion our society need more people who are familliar with one specific subject . having broad knowlege doe not necessarily help you to solve a specific problem . in my home country for example , there are many people who can handle a computer , but there are only a few who have enough knowledge to deal with certain problem on their own . that 's one reason why many computerfirms hirer people from country like india . this situation is not so good for our inhabitant , because often they do not get a job . this is only one example for why specialization ha advantage for the economy of a country . there is no doubt on that employee need a broad knowledge to be flexible , if they for example lose their job , which is a great problem in our country . but i think , if there are expert for almost every area , a country 's economy ha many advantage , altough it is very risky for the inhabitant to specialize , because they may get no job in their specific academic subject . but a i said , there are many advantage which support the idea of specialize in one specific area . but it shoulb be regarded what size and capacity the firm ha . a big company ha many employee and so each employee can handle a problem on his own . if he need to know anything about an other subject he can ask an other expert for help . so with the help of teamwork they can nearly solve every problem . in smaller business this look a bit different , because small firm can not afford so many employee . so for smaller business it is better to have a broad knowledge , so that you can solve many different problem .
