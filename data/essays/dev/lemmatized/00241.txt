i completely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . enjoyment in itself is symbolic for freshness . age certainly is a big factor in determining the freshness at heart to enjoy life at the fullest . the most important factor that support this idea is that young people are away from responsibility and day-to-day life woe . they are either dependent on their parent or have some support for themselves . this kind of independence enthuses them to feel free thereby adding on to the fun in their life . older people are experienced and have family to look upon . their domain start and finish with their family . so their enjoyment is limited to family , colleague and near-ones . moreover with the passage of time , the feeling of being satisfied with life increase . the need shrink to bare minimum and emotional support dominates over feeling of enjoyment . especially those who enjoyed a lot at a younger age tend to get away from enjoyment in older age . take for instance , in country like india and sri lanka , older people find pleasure in spiritual activity and become more inclined towards leading an ascetic life refraining themselves from enjoyment altogether . other factor that help young people to enjoy life more is the state of their health , which certainly is better than older people . as age advance , the body doe not allow all activity to be done they could be done during young age . for example young people can have no limit on eating , say , chocolate , but older people ca n't do so . young people , being adventurous at heart , tend to take challenge , make new friend and thus expand their social circle and broaden their horizon . on the other hand , older one do not mix up so easily and rely on already built up relation . another argument that favour the statement is that since older people have already enjoyed at some point of time in their life , so they feel filled and complete in themselves and are left practically with no desire to enjoy . thus it is quite convincing to believe that young people enjoy more than older one .
