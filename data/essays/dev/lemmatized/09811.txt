first of all i would like to state that there can never be given ` enough ' time to helping the local community . yet , by drawing comparison between different community all over the world i would like to present my home community in order to illustrate the youth ' commitment to their community . for my working definition i see ` helping community ' a a willing and unpaid commitment in the local affair . there is a huge amount of youth group covering all age and interest which meet once a week in order to pursue their common interest and aim . there is a range from choir to play group to sport club . by coming together they foster the community , some arrange public event like summer party where everybody can take part and the profit is being donated to local institution . additionally , many youth willingly become member of e.g. fireman to be able to safe their family and neighbour when required . weekly meeting and training prepare them for this task . moreover there are many who decide to be a social worker at least part-time , some even full-time for a whole year . they can work wherever they desire . either they help in old people ' home by taking them for a walk , doing their shopping or simply spend time with them . others decide to work with disabled people . helping them to manage their daily life . some others prefer to work with young child who have problem at home or at school etc . there is a variety of possibility where they can and do spend their time in order to improve the condition . another possibility to get engaged in the community 's affair is to get engaged in the local politics . thus , young people 's idea and suggestion can improve the community . for example i have just run a youth ' campaign which informed the citizen about and collected signature against the bad condition in our local kindergarden . soon we achieved the necessary pressure to achieve our demand .
