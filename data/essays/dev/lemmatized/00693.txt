i completely agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are maily three reason for my opinion . first , the advertisement agency over-publicizes a product . this is particularly done in the case of a launch of a new product in a market . since , no one ha ever consumed the product , the company have an added advantage of referring to their product a best in the market , without the need of any fact to proove it . it is , after the product launch , that consumer read review about the new product and realize it exact worth . another reason is that , most advertisement includes creative idea , which entice various fantasy in consumer . the consumer start to believe that they might come true if they started consuming that product . sheer curousity of consumer for that product , force him to buy and consume it . it is shortly after that that the consumer realizes that he is not in any super natural state , which he thought to be in while consuming that product . this result in lost of trust of consumer in the brand . third , nowdays there is an increasing participation of renouned personality in advertisement for various product . for example , a new range of nike sport shoe is being endorsed by a leading soccer player or a complete range of clothes being supported by a famous celebrity . as these famous personality have a very large fan base over the world , it lead to incorporation of blind trust in these brand by their follower . who want to be like their on screen idol in their life . people doe not even search for review on these product or at least consider the use of these product in their life . advertisements should display appropriate content in them , so that consumer is not mis-guided by their curousity . products should consider this so that it may not result in loosing their brand name .
