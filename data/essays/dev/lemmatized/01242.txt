i believe that marketing and advertisement have started to play an interesting role in our life . the number of product available in the market today is increasing very fast , and therefore manufacturer are racing with each other to make their brand name and product known to people . the question is why doe a possible customer remember one product , on the other hand forgets the other ? the answer to this question is trivial , somehow the possible customer is convinced that ( this can also be on the subconscious level ) one of the product is better than the other , and therefore remembered only the better one . this give advertiser all around the world motivation to show the product better than they are , because they need to show that that particular product is the best . the first proof of this can be found in advertisement that present a setting that is not or can not be real . this could be a beach so amazing that it can only be a painting , or a photograph modified using software . i think that the setting is the key to making people believe that what you are offering is something better than they have , because it is being displayed in an environment that is better than yours . another example of this might be the people in the advertisement , most of the woman in it are very beautiful and most of the men in it are very handsome . what an advertiser is trying to achieve by using nearly flawless character is to convince u that we can be like them , all we need to do is to buy that new cellular phone . the worst case is of course when an advertiser claim that a product can do something that it can not in the average . most of the advertisement only give information about the best case , an extreme example could be that how a tooth paste made somone 's teeth a white a pearl from the ocean , in a clinical experiment . during the time interval , this information is being transmitted to our brain , a fast subtitle written in a tiny font size indicates that in this experiment some kind of chemical wa also used to amplify the effect of the mentioned tooth paste . this situation will continue to become a bigger problem a long a new product are introduced to the global and local market everyday , because this will increase the motivation for advertiser to do so .
