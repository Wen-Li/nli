the issue of whether one should have broad knowledge of many subject or one should specialize in one specific subject ha aroused heated debate in the modern era . advocates for the broad knowledge concept say that this approach will help in widening the outlook of the person . contary to this approcah , some people say that this is the world of specialization and it is very important to be a master in one subject to be successful in life . i personally feel that there should be a balance between the two approches . i would present the pro and con of each of the approach and then illustrate why i emphasize on the balanced approach . in today 's dynamic world , it is imperative for a person to have a broad knowledge of various academic subject . this will not only help to acquire a broader perspective but also increase the efficiency in decision making of a person . say for example a marketing manager of a fast moving consumer goods company deicdes to launch a promotional campaign for a product . the knowledge about the financial issue related to the campaign can be really helpful in the decision making . if he doe not have knowlege about finance then he can make an expensive plan which can be finally rejected due to the financial constraint of the company . knowledge about other subject such a finance , strategy and human behaviour can help the manager in making better informed decision . this example clearly show the importance of having broad knowledge of many academic subject . on the other hand , there is no denial to the fact that this is a highly competitive world . the most prominent successful people today are the one who are specialist in their respective field . a very obvious example are the successful doctor . not only these doctor have to specialize in field such a dentistry , pathology etc. but also they have to acquire higher post graduate degree in the specialist field . very few people today would prefer going to a general doctor for their medical problem . i would support a balanced approach a i feel this can make a person a balanced individual who ha enough broad perspective to make effective decision and is specialist in his own field . if the marketing manager in the above example is a person with broad knowledge about many academic subject then he might find it difficult to devise a marketing strategy , which need core and in depth study about marketing related policy . similarly if he is just a typical marketing specialist , he may ignore other vital information related to different subject and end up giving a poor solution . if he take a balanced approach where he is a specialist in his area but also know about other subject , he will make better decision and will succeed in life .
