`` jack of all trade , master of none '' this is a saying a lot of u grew up listening to . the question is whether you want to be a jack of all trade or the `` king '' of one . personally , i believe , that it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to have broad , abstract knowledge about many . when you specialize in one subject , you gain a lot of knowledge and authority on that subject . this can lead to a lot of advantage . firstly , mastery in one subject can help you with your career . if you have complete command over your subject , you can effectively utilize it to further your career goal . for example , in a competitive industry like the information technology industry , if you have a good grip on your domain , it will benefit you much more than having incomplete knowledge about a lot of other domain . if you are knowledgable about a subject , not only can you do your own work better , but you can also help your colleague or peer with problem they may be facing . specialization in a subject make you an authority on it . this can lead to other people looking at you for direction or help if they are stuck . so not only do you become more popular , you also gain a lot of respect by helping others out . lastly , i would say that if everyone just wanted to have broad knowledge on a variety of different subject , then no scientific or other development would ever have been possible . take leonardo da vinci for example . had he not developed his skill in painting to such a high degree , we would not today have been able to exclaim at the beauty of the mona lisa . or wolfgang amadeus mozart , who with his skill in music , gave u so many beautiful composition . or albest einstein , whose immense study of scientific phenomenon lead to so many invention . in conclusion , i firmly believe that it is much better to specialize in a subject you feel passionately about than to have a lot of unimportant data on subject you might be just mildly interested in .
