taking risk and trying new thing have in common one thing : they are scary or , at least , they are not a comfortable a doing always the same thing . yet , i am conviced that they are necessary in order to be successful . risking can be frightening - i will not deny it . however , if you do not risk , you miss important opportunity to improve your condition . every decision in life , from everyday to once-in-a-lifetime one , implies some risk . if you are not able to take risk , this mean that you are not able to take challenging decision , with the obvious result . furthermore , in certain situation , taking a risk can make the difference between someone who just accepts what he or she ha ( but might regret what he or she ha not ) and someone who is really satisfied . just think of a recently graduated student who receives a very interesting offer which requires moving to another country : should he stay home and try to find an average job or accept it ? i am convinced he should accept it and leave straight away , otherwise he might simply regret it for the rest of his life . on a le personal level , there are contest where trying new thing is almost mandatory . this is the case for example of researcher : questioning the status quo , trying out different possible solution is necessary in order to find out new thing - and where would the world be wihtout new invention ? i can not imagine a researcher who doe not want to try new thing . for all these reason , i am conviced that successful people are those who are not afraid of risking . people who just keep doing what they are good at just miss out opportunity - because that is what a change really is .
