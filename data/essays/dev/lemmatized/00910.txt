i agree with the statement that people who achieved success do try new approach , rather than sticking to the older thing which are familiar to them . for example ancient people were in the impression that earth is a flat surface . scientist who proved the theory of universe didnot stick to these preformed concept but rather thought innovatively and achieved success . so new way and idea are always essential for the success of a person . they allow u to increase the horizon of our knowledge and perception of fact . techonological advance are demanding people to acquire new skill and approach . only those people who adapt to these circumstance will flourish in present day compettitive world . to illustrate , suppose a person is well skilled to type on his type machine and is complacent with his skill with no interest in learning computer skill will not meet new expectation of the employer and might loose his job . moreover , a person who adapts to the new demand and learn computer skill will flourish in his career . a successful person ha the habbit of exploring newways and new thing and he try to put himself in a superior position through his hardwork which is also innovative . if a person stick to the method well known to him and refuge to acquire newer skill donot get increment and promotion in his job . some people do not dare to risk new change in their work . but we can never discover anything new without experimenting . so , people should try newthings to improve themselves but that move should be genuine . for example , a wealthy bussiness man who invests all of his wealth in share might experience a severe loss amd may become a pauper . so i feel that new approches should be definitely encouraged but the person should judge his move rather than hastily implementing his idea . if the person is reasonable in his approach , risk due to new approach get minimised and he enjoys the fruit of his innovation . so it is not always risky to take up a newthing . rather we can not acjieve any thing in our life without facing that minimum amount of risk .
