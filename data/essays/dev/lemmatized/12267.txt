some people said specialize in one specific subject is better than have knowledge or many acadamic subject . both opinion are good idea but i agree with it 's better to hav broad knowlege of many acadaic subject because thats helpful to meet varity of people in my life and every major is relative each other . first of all , broad knowledge is helful in society . i 've been in new york city for 3 year now and i met a lot of different people during my new york life . i met a lot of people from other country , i could try differents food , i saw different custom and i saw a lot of different religens . that wa the very first english class in new york i had 10 class mate in my classroom . everybody wa from different country and they introduce each other the first day of class . i thought i have enought knowledge about other country but some of my classmate , i hadnever heard there where their country is . that wa very big shame for me and felt sorry to them . our county also very small so some of our classmate did n't know where korea is also still some peolpe ask me which part of korea am i from . when they asked me i got shocked because north korean ca n't move to other country . korean who live in other country is all south korean . for me that 's very basic knowledge but other peolpe doe n't know . that time realized i should learn other culture because i wa feel bad when they do n't know about my country . also , every major is relative each other . my major is interior design . before i start to study interior design i thought i will learn only drawing and masearing . but when i start to study i should learn mathmatic , history , and art everything . i wa wonder why should i have to take all this class ? but after i start study , i realized why i have to study . i have to learn history how interior became and who start to design room and why . after learn history i could understand easily and faster . also i took mathmatic class that helped me to carculate all my masearment when i draw . in conclusion , i agree with it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because that 's helpful to meet people in my life and every major relative each other .
