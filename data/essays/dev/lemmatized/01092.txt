in seeing how the total consumption of gas is consequent nowadays and regarding the fact that it will increase with the rise of china 's consumption , the car issue must be debated . however more the disparition of the use of car , i think an evolution of them is going to happen . even if the gas issue may raise question about slowing the use of car for different reason - for instance because it entail environnemental problem such a the ozone layer depletion , and also because while ressources are decreasing the gas consumption is still rising - in my opinion it wo n't happen . indeed car are a fundamental part of civilian everyday life , it ha been one the most sold item since the 1950 's . today in most case it ha become very difficult to live without a car when you are not living in a very big city . although price are lowering , the other way of travelling are still much more expansive than car . for instance most of the population who can afford it is going to work driving a car . it is true that other way of travelling have been enhanced in city such a the underground or bus , however car remains the easier and more common way to travel . nevetheless , i think there will be some change but concerning how car work . today some people are already working on how make car pollute le through fostering research on other type of fuel made from plant for instance . to conclude we can say that change are obviously needed but a far a i am concerned i think it will not be a decrease of the use of car but an evolution of car themselves .
