do young people enjoy life more than older people do ? perhaps it is diffecult to answer because every one of them have their method to enjoy their own life . but in my opinion , old people enjoy life more than young one because of several reason so i disagree with this statement . first , old people have a long experience in life so they know exactly how they enjoy . in contrast , young people do't have enough experience . for an example , mybe an young person tried to enjoy by something which is harmful but he did n't know , and after some time he enjured him self . but an old one may have an experience with that thing so he will not try it again . second , even though that young person have a lot of choises to enjoy but in the sane time they have several thing to worry about . for example , their job , their business , their family , their healthy and other thing that the life now required to worry about . on the other hand , old person do n't have any thing to worry about except thei healthy . for example , young person go to the gym to enjoy and whil he excersices he remember something that make him go out from the gym and lose that enjoy time . but the old one will not care about any other thing than his enjoy and his health . finally , every one ha his own enjoyable .
