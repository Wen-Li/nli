i definitely agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . i will explain this opinion a follows . the world is in a great stage of transformation . if people still follow to the same old traditional way and idea of the past we will not move further in our life . if graham bell did not try out for new thing where would have been our communication system . if wright brothers did not take risk where would have been out transportation system . it all is about thinking differently , creatively to becone successful . according to experiment conducted our mind is very creative . it can think about wide variety of thing in wide variety of way . we must not suppress our thought to the traditional idea our ancestor followed and stick back to the rule and regulation . it may be necessary to follow some rule in some case . but in all case it is not . this trying out for new thing must be cultivated from the childhood itself . take for example of a math problem to be solved . a child must think of finding a new way of finding a solution rather than following the solution given by the teacher . this make the child to better understand the problem and will never forget about it . this make the child successful and the success is carried throughout the career . in the initial stage we may be criticized for our idea but one should not be given up by such critic . we must remember that great people are often criticized . `` even einstein wa questioned '' . to be successful we need to go on with our idea and creativity , we need to try out for new thing every time , we need to take risk , forget the old traditional way of doing thing but not to care about the criticism . we should challenge the critic . success involves a lot amount of risk when we are trying out for new thing . nothing can be easlily obtained . we should never be afraid of the amount of the risk invovled but should always head towards the success after the risk . the success involving a risk give u great pleasure than success without involving risk . '' the fruit gained from a great risk is more tasty '' . its proved in past and also it will be proved thereafter that trying new thing , thinking differently and creatively , taking risk brings a great success . in this way i support my statement .
