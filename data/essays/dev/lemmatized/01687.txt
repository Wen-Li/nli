i mainly agree with that statement . but it is important in which relationship this statement ha to bee seen . i think for example that it is correct if it is related to language . it is obvious better to speak a little bit of english , french , german and italian than only one of them perfectly . concerning the profession i have to disagree with the statement . in today 's economic situation it is better to be specified . the unemployment is so high that it is possible to be well educated but yet unemployed if you are not specialized enough . on the other hand a broad knowledge of many acadamic subject can be better , if you have to manage for example your own firm and can not rely on other specialist . it is important to notice that a broad knowledge is the base for further knowledge in these area . so if you do not have any variety of knowledge it is much harder to gain experience in those unrevealed area . especially in the actual situation it is important to be flexible and to be willing to keep on learning during your whole lifetime . if you were a specialist in one certain subject you probably would not be willing to listen to more actual information because of your status a specialist . it clearly depends on one 's character but my oppinion is , that specialization is minor in contrast to a broad knowledge of many subjets . as i stated above the base is the most important thing . afterwards there is still time to specialize certain subject in which you are interested in . if you do not know all the possibility you can not be sure having chosen the right way . i would prefer a broad knowledge because then i stil have all possibility . if i specialized and chose wrong , i would be dissapointed . you do not know how the future will be that is why specialization is such a dangerous thing . it is better to be eventually le qualified in a lot of subject than to be specialized in one which no one need . so in general i would agree with the statement . specialization come after the broad base of many academic subject .
