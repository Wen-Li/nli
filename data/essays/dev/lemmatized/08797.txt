i agree the statement that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' because generally people want to visit different place to relax themselves and want to know more about different place . if they wont keep tour guide they take much time to know about the place . at the same time if a person go alone to visit the place , he doesnt get interest to watch the palces and he cant express his idea , thought about the palce what he see . if it is the case , that he travel along the group and with tour guide , make the people tour successful and happy because the tour guide can explains about the place briefly and interestingly providing a well knowledged tour guide . if the person travel along the group he can have a advantage to express his view and get other view about thr place they see . generally tour are included with long time night and day journey . at this time tour guide can where to stop the vehicle for emergency and where should not . at the same time if anything happens to anyone , others can help out in solving the problem they face . by travelling in a group along with tour guide they can help out each other and they can make thier most successful . during journey , they face many problem like food , shelter for changing clothes etc . if the people go tour along group they can help out in providing shelter , food and other small and big problem . if suddenly vehicle break down and if it take few hour to repair then they can have nice time with thier mate . simply they pas the time happily and unforgettable . anyways thats all depends on the individual but going along with group make the individual to see the thing happily and great scope to have good knowledge on place what they see . if we take an example of industrial tour of engineering student like tata motor in india etc . there i definately prefer to go along with group because they have to recollect their subject when they see the industry . at the same time your professor act a tour guide . no one can recollect the information at that moment what they studied but if you go with a group they can share their own knowlege with other such that they can see the thing more interstingly and gain more knowledge . similarly if a office staff want to improve thier industry , there it is need to visit higher industry and should make point what should improve in their industry . this is possible only when he go along with teammate and guide . he can point out very good thing if he discus the thing with his mate . at the same he need not to spend much time to know the unknown thing a guide is provided for them . thus i can strongly agree that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide .
