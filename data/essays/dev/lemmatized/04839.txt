always is better to understand fact . as student , i really think it it easer for u to understand a topic by using example and learning fact . when student just see the concept in class or the definition about something it 's dificult to them to rebemeber it just a they saw it in class , but if they see an specifically case about the same concept it will be easier to keep it in mind , because they can relate it to the real life . for example , last semester in my human reasources class i had a teacher that always helped u to relate the theory with the practice , i remember one class where we saw what an interview wa and in what consisted , and she took a classmate to make him an interview explaning all the step we need it to do to make it right , and showing the most common mistake that we could commit . i remind it wa so enriched for everybody in class , and after that when i entered to my fist job , i could rememeber everything i had learned and i took it to the reality . when we learn fact it also help u to convey it with our own experience . on the other hand , i have had class where we get full of concept and definition of some subject but we really do n't know how to put it in practice and i do think all this information go away . in conclusion , to learn in a classroom or out of it will be always better to usderstand fact and to related with reality , and also it will be easier for u to explain and to teach somebody else , because we have already absorbed this infomation , and proffesors should do this with the student since they are kid to provide them an important tool to learn better .
