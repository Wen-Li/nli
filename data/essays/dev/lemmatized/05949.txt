i agree that most advertisements make product much better than they really are a i buy only the product that are seen ad in tv . when the product is new to market they have to advertise it . if the product is launch without the ad now one know what is it and they donot buy either . advertisements are given for product and relase into the market atleast people recognises it . it may buy some people and if it is good they will use regularly . all the popular brand in the world are investing the one quarter of their money in the add . this show how much important for a product the to be launch . advertisements are not the new idea it ha ha been practise since the ancient time . in ancient time the ad are in the form of curved in the stone . to know wheather the product is good one are not only can say after using it only . eventhough lot of campain done for the product if it is not so worthy the result will be no one afford to buy it . product itself ha stuff otherwise no ad can do it promote it sale . for example my father ha buyed daewoo motor matiz car by seeing the ad later it ha lot fault then my father told his colleague that donot buy that one . the feedback fot that company is not good . one buy it a aresult it got flopped in india . nowadays the advertisements is one of the good markests in the world . all the product hire the celebrity to be their brand . kids influence for it , if thier favourate star ad for it they will want to buy it . every field require ad to promote it product for example movie star campains before the prrmer to promote their movie , similarly the model are launch to popular brand of car , inauragation of mall ets . these create the hype of their product even such that some of them talk about their product . thus it show that their product reach the people . wheather the product is good one are not only can say after using it on . lall the above reason show that one can buy only when they know about the product this can be done by advertisements .
