i , being a student for 12 year now , feel able to juge and talk about the scholar system and in my opinion our scholar system concentrate too much on succes than on value . there are a lot of different subject and class you are participating a a student and in every class you are writing exam . but often you do not have enough time to study for such an exam and therefore you just learn the most important fact by heart to succeed in the exam . but you forget the fact you learned by heart very quickly and after a few month nothing is left anymore and you take only a minimum of what you have ever learned at school with you . this is not a very good preparation for life because at school you often only learn how to reproduce fact about a topic in a few day . by practicing idea in an enjoyable way like in group work or role play for example you keep the essence and the main contence of a concept in mind . that way you do not have to feel under pressure to learn fact very quickly by heart , you can enjoy learning ! and if you enjoy learning you will take more essence with you . teaching concept and idea may content ideal way of behavior you could never teach with the help of fact . students can learn about value and strategy that are important for their future life . if they understand the background or the concept of something they learn they will always be able to reproduce these strategy of behavior in daily situation . and in my opinion this is the task of school . school should prepare all of the student for their future . it is up to a school to teach value and virtue because very often parent fail . it is sure that value can not be taught by giving fact or by learning thing by heart . values can only be taught by practicing them and therefore i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
