young people are an intergral part of the communities/societies in which they live . they develop their skill and gain education from their people - their family , teacher , friend and other people in their society . i being a youngster myself believe that i have acquired the value and principle of my life from my community . we younger generation owe our life to our elder , so we can not neglect them . we have learnt to respect our elder and people in our society . therefore i would not like to agree with the statement that young people are not giving enough time to their community . young people attend college studying different discipline - science , commerce , humanity etc . but they participate in a lot of other activity outside their curriculum . there are numerous club and organization formed by youngster that invlove themselves various kind of community activity like protecting the environment by spreading awareness among the people , fighting for social evil like corruption etc . in my university itself there are several student society like these . for example , the nature club , whose member spend their time to make people conscious about issue like noise pollution , harm of plastic etc . they express themselves by various mean like banner , conducting quiz and so on . similarly there is another club which raise it voice against many social problem prevalent in my country , for example dowry , female foeticide etc . i myself is a member of this organization and we organize various activites like trip to local neighborhood , staging street play to spread our message . another aspect that show the commitment of young people to their community is their increasing interest in political issue . in my country , right from the college student compete for different position in the university politics and they have an important role in bringing important national issue to discussion forum where student can discus about possible solution to them . young people also contibute towards economic and technological development of their community by implementing new idea . for example , they can use their education to help create new type of job by being entrepreneur . in this context i wouls like to add that many alumnus of my college who have now gained imp postions in society contribute by giving donation to various social organization . i do agree that there are some youngster who forget their people in order to earn money , who leave their country for better life , but a large majority of them including me are determined to serve their community from where we started our life .
