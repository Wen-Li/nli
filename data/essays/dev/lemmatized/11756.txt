i think that it is a common opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do . in my opinion this is not so far from the real situation , but it can depends on what you mean with enjoy . there many different aspect in this statement so i think that it is difficult to give a unique and clear opinion . for instance , if you like play football you will not probably enjoy yourself if you are an old man . a young boy is more powerfull and he can play for a long period of time , while an old man will probably lose his energy in few minute , not so much time for a good and amusing match . on the opposite , if you like to play your guitar , your age will not be a real problem . even if you are ten year old or seventy year old you can enjoy yourself a you want . maybe we can say that a young boy may have le problematic thought than an older person , so his innocence can let him the possibility of enjoying much more his life . for example an adult man ha many more thing to do than his son . he may have no free time so the young child can do anything he want to enjoy himself , while his father ha a life full of problem , so he can not enjoy a his child . there is an another aspect in this discussion that is of relevant imporatance . older people are often more rich than young people are . so they can do anything they want , because they have much more money . for example if you are a twenty year old boy and you like yacthing you may have some problem to buy one yacht . maybe you will buy it in your adulthood . at the end i think that the foundamental aspect of the topic is the possibility to be sick when you became an old man . this is a big problem and make me think that if you are a young person you will enjoy much more your life .
