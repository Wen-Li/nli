i am not agree with this statmen . sucessful pople can not take risk . they prefear to do what they are doing best . like who become famust about their area for example starbucks coffe chine . they are very profesional about this and they have to do this job . first of oll pople have to do what dhey are doing well because they oll rady become profesional about their topic end they can be successfull on their area for sure . for instance a faumest ( medical doctor ) surgen he is doing best on his area but suddanly he deccided to stop doing this job and startted take a risk to do some thing alse . first of ol big wasted knowledge , second he can loss hie fame , secontly when you make your profesion on your area , you have chans to become more profesionel and creatif . if you become mor profesional about your topik no need to take risk . taking risk may cous lost everythink what you have . i prefear to do my job or what i am doing best . i am a nurse and i believe i am doing this job wery well . so why i have to take risk and do some think not my profeion . if i stop to do my job i cen forget my knowledge every body have to make what they are doing best , then they can be useful for their area and they have cahans to earn but if they take risk there is posability to lost what they have . i think successful pople
