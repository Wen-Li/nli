yes , i agree with the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . the homo sapiens can be broadly classifed into two category . the first category consist of those people who are happy to live a risk-free normal life . they like to get up in the morning , do the house chore and leave for the office , sit in a cubicle and spend 8 hour 5 day a week . they want to enjoy the weekend with the family and live happily ever after . the main charaterstic of this category is that they want to live their life exactly in the same manner a their neighbour is living . the only example that come to my mind for this category is the common man . this is what differentiates them from the other category of homo sapiens . they make a contribution to the society a a whole but their individual contribution is minimal . they will not be remembered because of the fact that they do what they are told to do . the second category of homo sapiens are those who actually make the world a better place to live in . people in this category have the name like albert einstein , thomas edison , mahatma gandhi , yuri gagarin , and many others . what make them special is the fact that they all were curious and excited to explore new area in their field . albert einstein and thomas edison made a breakthrough in science , gave u gravtiy and elctricity respectively . mahatma gandhi created ripple in the political world through his approach of non-violence movement . because yuri gagrin dared to enter into space , that we were able to think beyond the planet earth . these people had some characterstics similar at root level . they were ready to work in a monotonous environment . they were ready to risk anything to prove their point .
