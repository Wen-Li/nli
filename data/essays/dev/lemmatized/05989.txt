successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for many reason . first , trying new thing give you an opportunity to learn more , for example , learning to drive can make you focus more and see more . in addition , you can be more experianced when you take the risk and try new thing , the more you try the more feeling that you get that you have no limitation in what you can do , the more experinced you get . lets take the ceo 's of the big company for example , if they did not try new thing and if they did not take risk , they definatlly would not be where they are now . third , trying new thing and taking risk make you more ready to solve problem . on the other hand , not having the gut to try new thing and take risk could concequence in beeing in the same position for a long time if not for ever , . yuo will do your thing right , but you will do it for ever . in conclusion , dont limit your self , dont underestemait your self , go out there and try new thing and take the risk .
