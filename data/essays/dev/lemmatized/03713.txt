i disagree to the statement that successfil people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . firstly , in order to success , the analyzing the data and control the racio of wining is important . now i am working at bank a a foreign exchange trader , even professional , made the decision and scale the timing using the analyze of reading the chart , checking the order and researching the economic data . because foreign exchange market is unpredictable . i think it is the same thing apply to this theory . in general , unpredictable thing often occers , sometime , people who ha good luck might be survive from the happening but i strongly think those luck is not continue without their well background knowledge nor experience . just trying new thing without knowledge is just a risky . secondly , when i play tennis match . in those situation , i do not try new style of serve when i really want to win . because the racio of i miss is very high . thats why i strongly believe that people who are succeed in the world are based on their knowledge and their experience .
