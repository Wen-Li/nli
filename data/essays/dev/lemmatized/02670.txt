people are always tending to pursue the most that they may obtain . when it come to the aspect of knowledge obtaining , the situation is similar . however , sometimes they have to choose whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjets than to specialize in one specific subject . for myself , i will choose the latter , but will try to get some balance a well . nowdays , knowledge is exploding everyday , a a result , it is rather difficult for one to learn broadly and deeply at the same time . having broad knowledge seems attractive , but actually , it is not practical after the second thought . in the academic circle , there are expert and authority in almost every field , all of whom hold some specific research interest and accompishment of their own . if one just spend most of the time on learning knowledge of many subject , he or she may not have the time to do related research . besides , since it is quite easy to gain information currently , it is not necessary to know all , for if you want , you can look the needed information soon . however , if one specialize in one specific subject , thing will be quite different , especially when he or she choose a valuable but rarely-touched field . under this situation , he or she will become the expert in this field and it is possible to do some quite profound research on it , which will be more benifitable if one know about a lot but really know little on each subject . as long a the researcher are willing to share their result , communicat to each other , and do teamwork when it is necessary , it doe not matter whether all these researcher are able to have broad knowledge . at the same time , to keep some balance , it is also important for a researcher to know some basic knowledge on related subject , which could broaden the eyesight and inspire him or her fresh idea . besides , this will not waste too much time . to sum up , generally , i think it is better for one to specialize in cetain subject , but it will be good to know some concerning knowledge at the same time , which can make the work most effectively .
