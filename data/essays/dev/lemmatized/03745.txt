as an old saying go , `` one man 's meat is another man 's poison . '' people 's opinion diverge from each other , not to mention on such statement : `` travel by ourselves and travel in a group led by a tour guide , which one is better ? '' some people prefer the fomer , but , i disgree . i prefer to travel in a group led by a guide because it really ha a number of benifits that we can not deny . the first reason for my inclination is that traveling in a group led by a tour guide can give me a more pround knowledge of my travel . no one could detail the history of a new spot only by your touring guide book . no one could speak out where is a more valuable spot located only by your telphone . no one could know more senaries by only confine yourself on the map . however , the tour guide can ! the second for my pepensity is that travelling in a group led by a tour guide can make you a connection to different kind of people . i just took part in a travel in a group led by a tour guide , and i made friend which involved in it and what't more , until now i still keep in touch with one of them who is aslo a university student like me . and she is in the same major a me , so it is a luck for me to have this kind of tour and get so good a friend who ha the same personal experience and emotional concern a me ! last but not least , travelling in a group led by a tour guide can make you safer and happier . if you visit by your self , who will help you when you get hurt ? if you visit by yourself , who will help you to go on your tour when you lose your way ? if you visit by yourself , who will talk with you when you feel faint during your bus way ? nobody . and this is quiet different from travel in a group where you can ask your tour guide and talk with other traveler . all in all , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is an advisable choice with conspicuous benifits . i prefer to it fully . now , what i want to do is to make sure that every one around me who like travelling a much a me can reach all these benifits .
