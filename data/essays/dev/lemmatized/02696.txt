i do agree with following statement . i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . all the subject are important in my life and i 'm sure there can help my future plan , like to pas the test for university , to find the goodest job . i have two more reason for it . first , i think it is nice way to study many academic subject . i will write my experience a a example . now i am studying many subject in the high school , and i like studying all of them . it is very fun to study many subject and increase my knowledge . the english class express my speaking , history class express listening , and i am enjoying communicate with my friend during other class . all the subject have different advantage . therefore i want to study all the subject and i think it is boring to do only one subject . second , it is not vain to have knowledge of many academic subject . we can use our knowledge everywhere . when we take the test for university , and when we find the job after graduating . all of the subject are useful . recently , some people are thinkking that it is not important for childern to study extra subject like physical education , music , and art . however , it is all important , we can know how fun it is and enjoy doing these . i think it is important to enjoy the subject , not just study demanded subject like english , math , science . the extra subject also express our knowledge and it will be useful in our communication . for these reason which i mentioned above , i support the passage that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . it will expand our thought and it will surely useful in our life . to study many subject is very fun .
