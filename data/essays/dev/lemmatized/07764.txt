personally , i agree with the statement ` young people enjoy life more than older people do ' . there will be many people disagreeing with this , but there are three major reason to convince . those three are health , knowledge , and transportation . first reason i think this way is because younger people have better health than older people . i wa playing in the beach with my relative . my cousin and i were running , splashing , swimming , and surfing . it wa a lot fun for u , a everyone agree . suddenly , my aunt called u to come out . it wa big surprise for u . she called u because my grandfather ha fainted . as a result , old people ha bad health to enjoy their life . second one is that younger people ha different knowledge than that of older people . most of my age ( 14 ) people know a lot of entertaining place , and fun place . eventually , olders ca n't go out broadly , because they do n't know many place to go . this wa my friend 's grandparent story . it wa hot sunny day , and they were retired from their work so they ahve a lot of time to go out . so , they wanted to go out some where , but they could n't . they phoned my friend , and asked her where to go , i wa little bit surprised at first , but i understand that they had different lifestyle than u back where they were young like u . last reason that i agreed with the statement is because we have better transportation . altough , grandparent have lot of time , some of them can not drive , because they had totally different life compare to u . nowadays , most of the university student can drive because it 's widely used , but old people did n't have chance to learn the driving . also , younger one can ride bus , subway , and skytrains . unfortunantely , olders ca n't go by standing , they have to sit down some where , but sometimes public transportation doe n't have enough spot for them to sit down . in conclusion , young can enjoy life better than olders . it doe n't mean that every elder all like these , but a lot of proportion of them are like this . i think enjoy life when we are young , and enjoy more quieter and relaxing life is better for elder .
