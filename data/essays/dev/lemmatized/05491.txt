this is a very hard discussed question and i believe everybody you ask tell you a different answer about this aspect of the generation gap . but with the tendency that always the other group is accused to be more enjoying a the one you belong to . so everybodies opinion a a young or older person could be affected by such an influence . thus i am trying not to be affected by such group thinking . i would say in the overall majority of our society is enjoying their life , although the older people do it more . surely one could say the young are lazy and the only thing they have in mind is making party . but i think that relates to their younger and more active body and mind . and i am convinced the relatively short time young peolple party can not be compared to the long period the older people sit around watching tv , play poker , or spend their free time in female chatting club . of course there may be several older people that use their time efficiently by working , keeping the front yard nice or be active in a sport club . there are also people who are ill and can not do what they have in mind . but in summary i want to make a statement about the mean , the normal , older person . young peolple are simply doing much more , in both field enjoing and working , than older one . i do not know of any of my friend or studymates to think of life a only joy . they are all working hard and learning in school , university or learning a handworkers profession to provide the best possible opportunity to get a job and earn money to run a family . especially in today time of mass unemployment the younger must perform more not to be one of the workless . that wa different in the last decade , when getting work wa no problem and there existed shortage in factory worker . today worker must have a profession and be well preperated for their job . the older generation is now enjoying their dusk of life in a financially saved situation . when the young people will be the old the situation will certainly have changed to worse .
