i do agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the people who develope an advertisement usually try to communicate a certain message which is supposed to make the product attractive to the customer . everything that doe not comply with this message is simply left out . most of the time , the producer do n't care about being truthful in that matter . let 's take cigarette a an example . if the producer want to make cigarette attractive to the customer , they will not talk about all the negative side effect , but instead they will focus on the advantage . they simply keep important information to themselves even though it might hurt the person who is going to buy the cigarette . this way , the customer will be blinded by the positive attitude of the advertisement and will be led to believe that it would be good if he bought cigarette . this kind of commercial strategy is actually widely used in the promotion of food . many company want to make their product look healthy because nowadays many people try to stay slim . the advertisement producer answer to that need by developing the commercial in a way that will make the product seem healthy and good for fitness oriented customer . usually they exaggerate certain ingredient which actually only make up a minor part of the product . some commercial for example promote chocolate bar which include `` a great deal of milk '' even though there are merely trace of milk found in the product . another way to make customer buy a product is to appeal to certain image they have of themselves . commercials for beer for example usually try to convey a sense of manlyness to the watcher . men usually feel that this kind of beer will make them seem more rough and therefore more attractive to woman even though the brand is not special in any way and doe not differ much from other beer brand . all those mean are used by the company in order to make more profit regardless of the effect it might have on the customer .
