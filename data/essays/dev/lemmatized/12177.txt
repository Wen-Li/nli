succesful person i agree that succesful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because they have creative , not hesitate personality , adn they do n't afraid . people who try unique thing and take risk can be creative because they are openmind and old thing which are known are not enough for them , they are hungry new thing . for example , in my country which still ha been developing , a person started to sell a new kind mp3 player and he spent considerably huge money . while he wa doing this , he took a risk because while he wa doing it , there were many mp3 player and generally people do not want change their habbitant in my country . but he did not care it and he entered the almost evfery shop and people have started to buy this new kind of mp3 player and it ha been common . however people who take risk do not hesitate because they have challenging personality . do a person hesitate while make a decision , he can not be succesful . succesful person can make their decision in every cicumstance . for example , my friend ha a shop and it is almost 25 year old . there were a problem about economy in my country and many shop owner closed their shop because they could not stood agains it . even though my friend suffered from it , he did not closed because he made some important decision in this cicumstance , and he did not hesitate . now , he is working in same place . also succesful people do not afraid from anything such try to do new thing . some owner afraid from doing new thing , they think that if i can not sell it , i will lose my company . even they who are company owner think like this , if they did it , they would earn more money and they would be big . in conclusion one who take risk and do unexample thing , he or she will be succesful .
