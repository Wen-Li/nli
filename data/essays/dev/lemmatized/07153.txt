someone might say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i personally agree with this statement . i know that there are many example that seem to prove the contrary but i think that they are absolutely not the norm . a young person is far more athletic and healthy than an older one . and , thing not to undervaluate , it ha le responsibility . when you get rid of all the thing you have to worry about , life becomes instantaneously more enjoyable . so le responsibility , le thing to worry . another reason is obviously the atletic stae of the body . at a certain age there are just a lot of movement you have difficulty to do , so even a simple action like , for example , riding a bike or running becomes hard to do . and when you can not do such basic movement you can not accomplish more complicated task . health is another important factor . who enjoys going to the pharmacy or , worse , to the hospital ? older people have to take care of their body continously , maybe taking pill or other medical treatment of some sort . and when you are not at that point , you know that sooner or later you will . but the body is nothing without the mind . it 's scientifically proved that at a certain age the mental ability of an individuos start to decrease dramatically . this ha consequence on the whole body activity but let 's just concentrate on the mind aspect . even those activity which do n't involve physical activity are precluded . a chess match , crossword , and any other kind of that stuff . this problem listed here are all problem that a normal person would n't have if he or she is young . so the conclusion are that when you are in the middle of you youth ( and do n't have any serious problem of other sort ) , you have all the door open and that these door keep closing while the year pas by .
