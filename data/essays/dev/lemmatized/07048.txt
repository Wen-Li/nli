travelling is always an enjoyable , sometimes tedious , leisure acitivity . nowadays , with travelling being such a normal thing to do , one is confronted with the choice of choosing between travelling with a group and , or by yourself . so , can the one choice be better than the other ? first of all , most of the time , travelling with a group tends to be relatively cheap and with the tour guide usually being a local , allows the tourist to receive additional information during the trip . also , since the tour guide is doing this for his living , preferably a a professional career , it is ensured that the quality and quantity of the information given during the trip will be better than a tour organised by one 's self . secondly , a point that is often missed is the socialising factor . while travelling with a group , it is impossible for one not to get to know anyone . it is not a given though , that one 's fellow cohort is a gregarious a one 's self . lastly , efficiency is the key , meaning so much a : seeing a lot with little time . this allows the traveller to see a much a possible in a limited time . on the other hand , efficiency , such a many other thing , is a double-sided sword . being a efficient a possible prevents the tourist from savouring his moment during his travel , such a mt . rushmore for example . on the other hand , travelling without a group release the tourist from the shackle of time . one can enjoy every moment of the tour , go back to an exhilirating sight , or just relax for a day - freedom is the key element here . informing one 's self is of the essence when travelling without a tour guide though , since nothing can be worse than a tourist without an idea what he is doing . this doe n't mean that one may not opt for a private tour guide though . of course , all of this come with a price . with this one can conclude if one want a truly informative and economically feasible trip one should opt to travel with group . yet if one want to truly appreciate the true enjoyment of travelling , savouring every moment of one 's trip , then one should opt for the other .
