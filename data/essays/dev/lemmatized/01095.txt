i think that in order to be successful one ha to try new thing , and be bold , creative and innovative . if we do not do that to some degree , we are only repeating what many other people are already doing , and eventually we can become obsolete or irrelevant . as an example i can contrast the story of apple and ibm in the personal computer business . they started at about the same time , both with very innovative product , the apple macintosh and the ibm pc . during the year , though , apple kept innovating the design and the software of his product so that they have always been cutting-edge , unique , even cool and trendy . ibm on the other hand thought they could bank on their dominant position in the market for mainframe computer for large business . they assumed that their established customer for ibm mainframe would have bought also ibm personal computer , and so they did not make an effort to keep innvovating their design and their software because they thought business client did not require that . as a result ibm lost competitiveness and market share when other company started to make cheap `` clone '' or copy of the ibm personal computes that were more technologically advanced and better looking than their ibm counterpart . by keeping doing what they tought they were able to do well , ibm ended up selling the personal computer business entirely , after it became vastly unprofitable . on the other hand , apple ha acquired a large niche market for their mac computer thanks to thier continuous innovation . not only that : apple ha taken substatial risk to diversify it product offering by inventing new produtcs altogether , such a the ipod and the iphone , most of whom have been hugely successful . finally , apple ha even taken the ultimate risk to change their own name from `` apple computer '' to just `` apple '' , to signify their shift from just the computer manufacturing business to the entertainment business . today apple sell not just compuetrs , but also consumer electronics such a the ipod and iphone , and other product and service , such a music downloads . this show how being innovative and willing to take risk can lead to sustained success over time , and on the other hand how replicating our old way can
