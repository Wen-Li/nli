i disagree that the trip which is led by a tour guide in a group is a best way to travel . surely , if we travel with a tour gude , we can enjoy a trip even if we can not speal english well because if we have a problem , a tour guide will help u to solve the problem . in addition , we can go to famous place in a good way . it mean that we can go many place without waste time . at the same time , we will be able to get a lot of knowledge about the place which we go from a tour guide . if we travel with tour guide , we will enjoy and we will be safe . however , if we travel with a tour guide in a group , we have to mind time anytime . if we have free time , we have to come back on time which a tour giude say . if we want to look more , we can not do that if we travel with a tour guide . if we have a place which we want to go , we can not go there if the place is not the place of course even if the place is very near the way of course . if we travel by ourselves , we do n't need mind time . we can stay the place a we want . furthermore , we can make a plan the travel a we want . therefore , we do n't need got to the place which we are not interested in and we can go to the place only we are interested in . in my opinion , planning the trip is one of the enjoyment of trip . if we make a plan from first to finish , we may have some ploblem . however , if the trip is finish , we can get a lot of happiness . therefore , idisagree
