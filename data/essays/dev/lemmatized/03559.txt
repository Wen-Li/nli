i agree with the statement that say that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car than there today '' . in fact i have to admit , for my personal experience , that in the last ten year this wa the tendence we are achieving , even if it is not a good result . i think that in twenty year there are going to be fewer car because of several reason . first of all the city are getting bigger . i have read last week that most of the people now live in city . that mean that they are going to have to move inside the city , and a bigger the city becomes , a more people will need to have a car ( unless the state will offer the possibility to move with an alternative transport ) . secondly city are often overcrowded , and people who do not have much money are obliged to find another place where to live out of the city . this mean once again that they are going to need a car to get to the city for working , for example . also there are people that dislike the style of life that often a city offer . they would probably try to find a place where to live that is out of the city , but from where they are able to get to the city by car . morover i think it also depends on how the state , or the local community would act . there are several example that demonstrate that when a local community do not want to have too many car in the city , some solution can be found to resolve this problem . the first thing is to make a good city plan , that can really help . if a city is planned in a smart way that considers different thing , a where to put major road , or how to plan alternative transport , then to move in the city is definitely easier . secondly the state should try to sensibilize more and more people that live in the city , who often do not care about this topic because they are more comfortable by moving with their own car or because they think this problem doe not affect them . which is not true , because they do not feel comfortable at all while trying not to get stuck in line or when air pollution reach really dangerous limit ! finally i agree with the statement , even if i think that it will be a huge problem if this actually come true .
