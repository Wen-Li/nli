most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i disagree with this statement . when the first nokia portable phone that wa compatabile with a camera came out , advertisement all around showed that you could videotape scene and take snapshot of friend . when people actually bought the product , what they actually saw wa a reallity . another example is when the ipod wa released . everyone wa shocked about how a device smaller than a calculator could store more than a thousand song . when people went and bought it , they saw how it could do it . it is not that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are , it is about the person that buy the product . many people when they see advertisments of new electronic device , they get so happy to see something that new and something that function in a new way so when they buy the product and use it everyday , they get bored of it . so when the person remembers how the product looked on billboard and newspaper and compare it with him after owning it for two month , he will think that the advertisement made the product seem much better than it really is . the reallity is that the person ha been using the product effectivley that lead to him getting bored of it . my opinion is that most advertisments show what the real product is and that they do n't exaggerate on the product . another problem is that many people understand the advertisment wrong . when the person go to buy the product and the find out that it doe n't function the way he thought it is , the individual then get unsatisfied . i think that people should understand the advertisment and what they are trying to say and understanding the message that they are trying to send .
