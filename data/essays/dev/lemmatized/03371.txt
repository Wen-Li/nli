an anecient arabic say `` take whole thing from a particular thing , and take something from all thing . '' having a broad knowledge of many acadimic subject is better than stay on one speclizie subject for many reason that strict scinces , provied another scinctist and expand personal awareing . first , sinces are complacated and crossed . by way of example , there is a crossed between law and political , so any specilist who interest in law need to study a little about political . and there are many scinces which concrated from many scinecs , such a , piochimestry , economy law , furthermore , specilist need to know some information about board scinces to biuld bridge with another specilist , he and another people need each other to provide thier knowlodge , experinces , resaerches . for example , pofessor of physics will get a lot of benifit from professor of math , that will encourge thier idea and theoris , so moreover , a broad knowlodge expand awareing of mind , it give a lot of information that can not be in a similar lab which specilist stay in . as example , professor of law can not know any thing about period of arabic poet if he doe net deal with arabic letrituer professor . also he can enjoy in people invention , and he get more angle view to life . as a result , i agree to having broad knowledge because it ha a lot of advanteges , change realtionship between scinctist , and expand awaing .
