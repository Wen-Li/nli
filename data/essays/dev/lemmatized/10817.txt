i disagree the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . in my opinoin , enjoying the life is to be peaceful in the innerside and live everyday without regret , then make yourself happy . in this regard , i suppose that the real life for self usually start when a people ha his own work and financial independantly . first of all , it is different from the young people , who literally relys on their parent for their experditure , the older people are indepence and pay all of their experditure by themselves . therefore , they can spend whatever they like and wherever they like to go at their own mean . besides , after having earned the experience from the life , most of people have their stable goal for life and own interest . so , the process of presuing their goal and interest is the time of enjoying their life . at last , especially for the elder people , who are retired and free of the responsibility to raise their child work for daily expenditure , have more time to enjoy the life . to summary , although the older people have more responsibility in life , they can also enjoy life a the same a the young people do for their indepedance and maturally .
