today advertisement can convice consumer that every kind of product is the best one and that you ca n't live without it . there are a lot of tecniques that make a product irresistible for consumer . but is always true that all advertised product are so good like it seem to be ? i think is not : they seem much better than they really are . last week i bought an apple pie that i saw on a television spot . in the image reported on tv it seems realy testy and healthy , but when i eat it , it wa not so good and i got sick . i could n't sleep all night long . in my opinion it would be better for food or dress company to spend their budjet improving the quality of their product or decreasing the price instead of invest it on advertisement . the problem is that business rule are different from what is better for the people . but something ha to be done . i think that certification of qulity are a very good investment for the company to show the real value of their product end in the same time a good way for consumer to verify the quality of what they are buying and choice better between different brand .
