in a world filled with knowledge and a variety of educational line , one ha a great number of subject to choose from . it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one particular subject . a prospective student may want to pursue his career learning only the subject he requires . an architect , for example , would want to study physics and mathematics , a subject like these help him in his field . though english literature and environmental science are not required in his field , they pas on some principle that would help him through life 's race . a look into the environment may help him to select different type of material to be used in construction , so a to keep the environment safe . after his education , he would come out more knowledgable . during one 's schooling , one is exposed to a variety of subject like history and geography . did you ever come across this time when you wonder - `` why ? what use is this going to be to me in the future ? will the knowledge of what happened to my country a thousand year ago help me in the future ? 20 year later , will anyone ask me how high mt . everest is ? '' . though this information may seem useless at that age , after progressing through life 's obstacle , one realizes that the knowledge one had gained by studying such subject is very precious and valuable . we now remember that mt . everest is 8997 metres high and is going higher every year . it give u a sense of superiority and pleasure that we , after so many year , remember such tiny detail . specializing in one specific subject may give the student more time to understand the subject and achieve perfection . specializing may give one an edge over others . but when we emerge into society , ready to make a difference to our life , the life of others , or the world a a whole , we realize that a broader knowledge of subject is better than specializing in one subject . with knowledge come power , and with power come responsibility . it is our responsibility to make this world a better place .
