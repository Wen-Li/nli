i agree successful people will try new thing and take the risk . first of all , when we were young , we try lot of new thing because we have to , but sometime , we take risk to be successed . i believe successful people are different than normal people , they will not scared the risk so they try the new thing . therefore , we always enjoy new high technolgy product because they try . secondly , if people just do they same thing over and over , they willnot know what the good at and they will never improve themselve , they should try new thing when they were young , to tell yourself you can be do what another people did , even better than them . for example , you are vice president in company , because you did a good job in the company , but the president get fired , you want to keep your position or get the highest position if you take the risk which is get fire from the bos . you never know if you do n't try . thridly , since we already did well in something , why you do n't chanllage high level to widen your eye . if you know the mistake you have made , you just do n't take the mistake again , and then next time you will do better . so on you will be successed in your job . for example , you work in one store for a long time , you already tried lot of thing , learn a lot in the store , you knew how to run a company and do well , and now you want to open your own store , you just need to take risk and make yourself successed . in couclusion , it 's because lot of people try new thing and they were successful , so that oue live standand is getting mych more higher , we ca n't stop all the time , otherwise , our live never improve .
