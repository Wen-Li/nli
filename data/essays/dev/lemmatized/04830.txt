there are young people and older people who were enjoying their life . people who are young , they can go to school and learn subject and skill that is fun and importance to do . and they can make school friend ( classmate ) they can play or eating lunch together . so young people can go to school . they can do any you want . if they graduated university , they can have a job . but older people were difficult to find job , so they ca n't do job anything they want . for example if old person who want to work at slary , but this job have a limit of age . or if old person take sporty job , like deliver to thing . older people not have enough power than younger people . but older people can living peacefuly , and young people have to working hard and they have no enough to spent time to reading novel at home , or watching tv . but older people can do . my grandmother is doing house job . she often go to shopping and she like to cook at home . she living peacefuly and enjoying her life . but sometimes she think it 's boring because , it 's like she doing same thing every day . so , she saids that if she change to young people she can do job in actively . i thought it 's agree to her opinion . one day i ask to grandmother to go germanycome and enjoy with me. but she said she doe n't want to go , because maybe she going to be very tired and she doe n't have power to go german . so , i decide to go many overseas when i wa on young age .
