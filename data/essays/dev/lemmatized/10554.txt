in today world , nearly every product which is offered to consumer , is being marketed with advertisement . these advertisement introduce the product to it buyer and demand them to buy it . although these advertising is good in term of marketing and introducing new product , it is also clear that these advertisement could result in wrong , over-rated assumption about the product in question because of three major reason ; the the fact that the advertisement is a marketing technique , the varying expectation of the people and the influence of professional technique to our emotion . firstly , the definition of today 's advertising is `` making people want something '' , the introducing part of the advertising is being ignored . for instance ; advertisement are being prepared by marketing department to sell them more and more to make profit , not just to declare that the product is made . the increasing number of adverisement-officies and the money in this job also indicates that everything about advertisement is about making more money . because of these factor happiness of the consumer is usually being ignored . secondly , people often expect differrent thing from a product , one may want durability but the other may want more reasonable price , but an advertisement should be prepared for every potential buyer . plus , a negative feature which people may want to know would not be emphesized because of these thinking . this , again , would result in the disappointment of the buyer . the third thing that would make buyer uncomfortable is the fact that advertising is being used for a long time and there have been clear way to make you buy thing . for example , when i saw a person who drink or eats something i immediately feel a bit thirsty or hungry because my mind think of an oppurtunity to eat something . this fact will affect me to buy the stuff which is being advertised , but probably i would be disappointed becasue i would have bought the think without thinking . advertising ha becoming a great part of producing and marketing of new good , every company is using it for nearly every good it produce . it is clear that this thing make people to buy thing , otherwise profit centered company would n't use them , but making people buy something directly increase the expectation and therefore , a people expect more from the thing whic they buy , they become more disappointed .
