it ha been an argument regarding with the issue that , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . some people prefer to travel alone . because they do n't need to adjust their time for the other people and they can decide everything by themselves . however , on my perspective , i think it is better to travel by a group led by a tour guide rather than traveling alone . first , if we travel to the place that we are not familiare , everything is so srange . so in this case we need somewone who are well known about the place , like a tour guide . it is certain that tour guide is an expert of the travel place , he or she will make a great scedule and adjust the time . the only thing that we have to do is following the schedule . i think it is convinient and we do n't need to waste the time . second , we can have more great experience with the group of people . people can exchange theire own opinion and also they can take a remarkable picture together . they can also enjoy more pleasure time rather than feeling alon . as people are living the social sociaty , travelling by a group could help to develope theire relationship finally , because of two reason , i think better and efficient way to travel is tarvelling in a group of people together led by a tour guide .
