the year give u intelligence in most of the time . the statement , yong people enjoy life more than older people no it is alway true , it is depends of the style life , and personal habit . for exemple , yong people could be always , entusiastic , happy , frendly and also serius , and quiet by the way some yung people can not enjoyed their life , may be , because their life culd be no the best experience , in othe word may be they do noy have the oportunity to enjoyed their parent , school , or wherever , in contrast many old people enjoy their laves , most of them thougt that their old it the most beutiful form to accumulate experience , in this way they wa have alot of memory and experience . in my opinion , my grand father is an exemple that the old people can enjoyed life , same or more than the yong people . my grand father is 86 year old and he decided star to lived again , when he wa 75 year old , after my grand mather 's dead , some people thougt that he got sad but in contrast , he ha decided to write a book , and all weekend he ha dancing in a club , he already open his own cantina and recently he ha a girlfriend and may be he will married again in a few month . however he ha diabetic and hipertencion systemic , he decided enjoyed his life and start again like a second chance . i think that he is a great example for yung people that some time decide to quite their dream , hope , and some time their own life . he is also a good example and a model for me , and i hope enjoyed my life same or more than him . for this reazon , i am desagree whit the statement yong people enjoy life more than older people do .
