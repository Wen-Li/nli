the issue of whether nowadays people do not give enough time to helping their community is a controversial one . on the one hand , there are some people that spent most of their time thinking how they can help their community . on the other hand , there are some people that really do n't care in helping their society . they just think on their own problem and do n't have enough time for other people . however , in the final analysis i therefore agree with the statement that people do not gave enough time to help their society . one reason for my belief is that in current business world people do n't have time to help their community . current business world demand a lot of time and at the end of the day people are very tired . for example , five year ago i worked for an advertising company . advertising is a very difficult work and in that time of my life i usually spent more than 12 hour in my office . when i returned home at 9 o'clock i wa really tired . it wa impossible for me to help my community . the only thing i wanted to do wa to go and rest . it wa impossible for me to try to help society , i wa always tired when i wa n't at work . another reason for my belief is that people had become more selfish . people just focus on what it is important for them . they do not care about what happens to other people , they just think on their own problem . recent research show than le than 15 % of the people from my hometown had helped the community in the last two year . for the reason stated above i agree with the statement that nowadays people do not gave enough time to helping their community . i support my point of view by two main point . first , that current business world demand a lot of people time and second that people had become more selfish .
