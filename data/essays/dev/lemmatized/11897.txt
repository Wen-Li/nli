in twenty year from now there will be fewer car in use thanking to the technologycal progress . if in the past century technologycal progress wa often linked to negative consequence like deep industrialization and exploitation of the naural resource , in the more recent year the idea of a technologycal progress that can get along with nature or even help nature spread both in the scientific world and public opinion . that is why modern scientist are looking for a kind of car who doe not pollute the air , working on a project about a car engine that doe not use petrol but something alternative . this alternative power could be hydrogen , and rumour ha it that scientist already invented it but it can not be solt because of market reason . moreover , public transportation is getting cheaper and cheaper , so that in the future most of people will use it . people in the future will be much more interested in enviromental problem , just like we are more respectful towars nature than our ancestor . it said , in fact , that in the past city were more noisy and polluted than nowadays , and some ancient author wrote that when rome wa the capital of the roman empire it wa almost impossible to fall asleep in the city even at night , and that the noise wa unbearable . governments , especially in the western world , started to feel the problem connected to the uncontrolled use of car , and they will probably vote some politics to make the people prefer not polluting engine or other kind of transport . also , since they learnt the lesson from their own past , western government will teach the country which are now getting industrialized new way to produce and get richer with no deep exploiting of the land that may cause natural disaster like it happened in the recent year in some area of the world .
