i think the statement is to absolute . i remeber when i wa young , there where not that much possibility to help the community and they where also not attractive to young people . there is also a big difference where you live . in large city there are not that many community you can evolve like they are in smaller village or smaller town . another point is the fact that nowadays young people have a lot more to do and not that much time like it wa year ago . they have to go to school or learn a lot and most young people have to work besides their school to earn money to life . if they already have a job besides school they propably will not take a community job without getting paid . they do not have the time and the money to help the community . working in the community ha also advantage wich most young people do not know about . a community job integrates you in your environment if you are new . it can also help you to find friend , or the community help you if you got a problem . it also can give you social hold if you do not know what to do or have no other thing in you live . it is a good way for older people who do not have to work anymore to get a job for their live . and to get integrated in their social envionment . but in my oppinon it is true , young people do not give enough time to their community . even if it is not the same that it wa year ago . the most important point is the social contact they get in their community .
