some people believe that it is better for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . they think that student get benefit by studying others idea and concept and use it a a derictory in thier life and thier educational jaurny , they may use a an example for that the old concept about the shape of the earth and how it had been hold until it wa aproved . i totally disagree with this concept for many reasos , first of all this concept and idea might be wrong so it is rediculous to make student hold them . in contrast , we can let them develop thier won under our opservation . also , some of these concept are harmful , for example , it is untill recently in my cultural background , poeple inheret and believe the story about how sertain tribe member are able to come back after thier death . the third reason opposing this concept is that student are the futre . at the time they will be in charge , they need thier won idea and concept to deal with it because the every new day the world change . in conclosion , i disagree with the statement because of variation of the relibilty of the idea and conceps content , the posibility of it is harm , and to allow them develop their own .
