good and hard question . i think this question 's answer is not yes or no . because young people have got alot of enercy and movement , but they have not got a lot of money : ) so , they young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . young people 's mind is is heavy . they like play game , party and another thing . i think they dont know their responsible . for example a student is very work your lesson . but you dont it . why ? because he is lazy . is good than work . their know are swiming and playing and another activite and freedom . immm . i think very bad sentence .
