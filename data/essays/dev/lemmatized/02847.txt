it is a difficult question because i think that every aspectof study is important for student . i am not agree in total with the statment that say that is better for student to undestand idea and concept than to learn fact , because i think they have the same importans in a development of young people . in general i think that it is important for student to understand idea and concept because it is only with this passage that they can have theirs opinion and idea , but at the same time it is also important to learn fact because with the knoledge of process of the fact people can do what it wa be right in the past and do not what wa dangerous or wrong . for example i thaink that the concept of peace can be better undersand if you know history , in fact with that matter you understand that war give people only poverty , difficulty and not good thing . i think that it is easy to understand concept if you have a real invironment in some fact . the idea and concept , with the study and learning of fact give u a strong base of our education and it is important for a good future improuvment . finally i think that both of this aspect are important for a good development of young people , so student have to undestand idea and concept
