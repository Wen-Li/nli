for some reason we can think that young people enjoy more life than older people do . at first sight we can state this because it is clear that it is easier to be young , in good health with future perspective than to be old , to suffer and to count the year before dying . besides , parent often say to chidren that they are lucky . i ca n't deny that be old is not a very funny thing over all for the body , for the health but on the other side it implies that you have lived a lot of various thing , you have found your way , you have child and maybe little child . in few word at this age , people have done the more difficult and they can use their time for pleasure , for resting , for what they want . on the other hand , be young is not such an easy thing and it is often a difficult part of life , over all the teenage period . indeed teenage is the time of self construction , the time to discover love , problem , to take the first decision . .. and that is not an easy thing because teenager do n't have a lot of experience yet neither self confidence . in addition , the youth is a tricky period concerning relationship : young people are not nice between each other and a lot of them suffer a lot during this time . youth and more particularly teenage are transition and change time and for that they 're not always cool and easy . you lose some beautiful thing like innocence , purity , inconsciense and so on ; you enter in the real world and the deception can be high . at the contrary , older people have already made their life , they have more experience about life and thanks to that they meet le difficulty to resolve a problem . all in all , of course i ca n't say that i prefer to be young or old , it is not the question but i think that every age ha it advantage and it setback . but i do believe that the most difficult is to be young because it implies a lot of problem and question for whose we are not always ready .
