it depends on the situation , but there are a lot of situation that people should learn fact not just understand them . there are two example that support may opinion . one situation is when you play soccer . how well you study soccer rule or technique , you ca n't play it very well because you need experience of real game . many pro soccer player especially from brazil played soccer without reading text book in their childhood . they just played soccer for fun . many of them did n't study phycics around the boll . the other is when you drive a car . in my case , i studied about car engineering for one month and i thougt i had enough knowlegde of car . however , when i drove a car first time , i coud n't drive it well . i think that to understand idea is not enough . so the most important thing is to learn something by using their body not only using brain . indeed there are some case that you need to understand idea and concept , but you can get that kind of knowledge when you learn it .
