there are many reason why the number of car in use today will not stop increasing in the future . just judging from the way car have become more and more popular and common over the past tweny year it is unlikely to expect a sudden change in that area . another point supporting that theory certainly is that car have become more affordable for everyone and also very easy accessable for young people . most people in the united states of america pose their first own car bz the age of sixteen . another problem that in my opinion is directly linked to the number of car and that we are facing today is the problem of obesety in sociey . in most developped country peolpe are getting bigger and bigger , become more and more lazy and therefore more likely to drive a car . simplz because it is more convenient . then again , people are also starting to be aware of the direct link between car and the effect they have on environmental change . some strongly object to the idea of having a car because they simply can not live withe the thought of destroying the planet out of egoistic purpose . in a television transmission that i happened to watch a few day ago i also heard a discussion about tha earth running out of natural source such a oil . if there is no more oil we will have a huge problem supplying our car . although that is not expected to happen anytime soon scientist are trying to find alternative by developping more natural and environment friendly way to make an engine work . but i believe that this will take a huge amount of time and not be presented to the public in the next year . so , no , i do not believe that there will be le car in 20 year
