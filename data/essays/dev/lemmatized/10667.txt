i disagree with the opinion that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today even besides in all over the world now , we are considering about the enviroment , and oil is decreasing now . i know that there were some agreement about the gas producing by car . cars are very bad for enviroment because they run with gas which pollutes earth 's air . many country promise that they are going to reduce gas which is from car in present day . my country , japan also did and now we are trying to do this plan . however , i never see this successful and people who are using car do not care about it at all . i also hear that oil is not going to take anymore . now , most of car in this world run with oil . actually there are electrinic car , but it is unuseful to use because it take time to make car run so we still use a car running with oil . i think that there still will be some oil in twenty year . cars are absolutly usefull . we can go to anywhere in anytime by car . people living in metolopolis might not need car , but people living in rural area have to use car to live in . they live in far away from grocely store , mall , and place they work at . needless to say , we need indivisual car . we can not use public system such a bus , train because it may be faster to transport than we use public transportation . in addition , most of u will keep using indivisual car . i think that there are not thing which we can reduce car using because we do not care enviroment , we care only ourselves , electronic car are not useful , i do not think electronic car is becoming useful , and actually people really need car .
