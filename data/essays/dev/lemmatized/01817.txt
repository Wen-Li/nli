i think that in twenty year there will be flying car ! today the car is become a status symbol , there is n't a family without a car , but the problem is that there are a lot of people who prefere to have a beautiful car than a sweet home . the famous sentence `` home sweet home '' is in danger because is not more at the first place of the desire . a car wa the symbol of a generation , our parent remember their first car like a realized dream , today the guy want a car because the best friend ha one and not because they understand the real meaning that it can have . i think that in twenty year this object of desire will be more wanted , more desired and more dangerous . .. there are just now a lot of car that ride too fast , in the twenty 's it will be certainly worst . today young people die because they can drive car that run very fast , tomorrow they will can fly . i hope it will be different . at my grandfather 's time the car wa a luxury good because he cold n't have one . a car is a lot of money and when there wa the war money are ghost . in the sixty some people like corradino d'ascanio created a way to help these person to discover the world : vespa . this ha been a real status symbol thanks to the great meaning it had . `` with vespa you can fly '' and with this beginning , motor became the most important thing for people . in the sixty it wa possible to fly away , tomorrow it will be possible too ? it 's important to be free , with a car i can be free because i can go wherever i want . for this reason there is the fewer car . a fewer that will never pas .
