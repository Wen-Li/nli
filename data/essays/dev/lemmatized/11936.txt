the life is very beautiful if you know the way that you can enjoy for it . every one should enjoy in this life befor he/she die . i agree that young people enjoy the life more than older people do because they are healthy , they have a lot of time , and they like to go out always even they are busy . the young people are healthy than the older people . the people when they go out they only see young people play outside and they are enjoying when they play . for example , everyday i go outside with my friend to play football and other game if we do not have a lot of work to do for school . the older people are always busy with their work so they do not have a lot of time to enjoy in this life like a younger people . the older people they have to put time for enjoying . always i ask my father to put time for u to have fun and go out to enjoy but he always say yes but he did not do it until now . the older people when they busy they do not take a break for them to have a rest , but the younger people they give themself time when they feel angry or tired . for example , i give my self time when i am tired but my father not and i asked him why but he did not give me an answer . in short , everyone are younger will enjoy the life more than older people . in my opinion , everyon have to enjoy in their life every moment .
