why do young people not give enough time to helping their community nowadays ? i presume there are several reason for that . first of all , young people have increasing possibility and money to spend their leisure time , so they might rather spend their time enjoying themselves with friend than to be helping the community . another reason might be the changing living condition . people nowadays have to be and are more flexible . the number of young people leaving their hometown to study in a city far away ha increased . young people are changing job more frequently than before and thus have to move house . the time a young person spends in one site ha shortened and accordingly the feeling of being a part of a community . helping a community mean to be motivated a you feel responsible for it . without having spent a certain time in a community your are le motivated to help , a you do not know a lot of people personally . the personal knowledge of people though increase your motivation to help strongly . the strongest reason for the fact that young people nowadays help le in community is the changed behaviour towards community . people have become more individual , more focussed on themselves and their need . families a much a community do not mean a much to people a they used to in the past . people are economically more independent so that they do not need support and help of the community a much na in the past . taking all those factor into account i would agree that more and more young people tend not to give enough time to helping their community .
