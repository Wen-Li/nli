i strongly disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are several reason what i have . young people is a process to old . we should save money for our old life . there are a lot of young people who study in college or university or career institute . they are trying to improve themselves ' ability because they want to get higher career and pay . young people are healthier than old people and more flexible to get new information . so they can get more chance to get a job and earn money . imagine that if you should work and earn money although you are so old . it is very hard to old people . i know two people that would be good example for this topic . one man wa worked very hard and saved money during he is young . so several year later , he married and he bought a beautigul house and he could spend enough money to educate his child . however another man did n't save money and did n't work hard . he enjoyed his youth . he drank beer with his friend and bought expensive clothes and bought a expensive gift to give to his girlfriend . so several year later , although he married , he still ha lived rent house . of course , we can enjoy our life during we are young . i 'm not talking about that enjoying life during youth is bad . a lot of new experience , and traveling are important to young people . however , we need to more improve ourselves during we are young . there are some cartoon about two kind of insect . ant worked very hard for summer , so he could enjoy his life and rest for cold winter . in constrast , another insect just enjoyed and sang a song in the tree for summer . conwequently , he could n't eat anything during cold winter . think about it . is n't it easier that young people try to study and earn money ? young people are healthier and more enthusiastic than old people . when we get old , we should take a rest and enjoy our left life . to enjoy our old life , we should save money .
