it is debatable whether young people do not help their community not spending enough time . some people say that young people provide enough time to helping their community in that they are doing some voluntary work for community . however , i agrees with the statement in that young people tend to spend more time studying and they do n't have the sense of belonging to their community . to begin with , nowadays student do not help their community enough time . this is because they think that their grade are more important than helping community . therefore they are spending more time studying for their good grade than doing volunteer work . for example , my brother is a high school student . when he were asked to work for his community from his school , he got angry . that 's because he think helping his community is a waste of time and also doe n't help improve his grade . in addition , because young people do n't have the sense of beloning to their local community , they are not willing to help their community a lot of time . young people think they can move other place whenever they want to move . therefore they do not feel the necessarity to provide aid to their local community , sacrifying their own time . for instance , according to kbs , korea national broadcast station , 70 % of young people they do not have to help their local society . when they were asked reason , they answered that they did not have the sense of belonging to their community . in conclusion , enough time for young people to helping local community do not meet need of communites . this is because young people invest their time on studying for good grade . also they do not feel the sense of the belonging to their community . this phenomenon must not be underestimated in the aspect that young people will be a person who lead the local community .
