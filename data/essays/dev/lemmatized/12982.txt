the influnce of advertisement on the customer is worth commendable . the advertiser are projecting thier good to the customer in a ` larger than real ' manner . ' i would like to agree with the statement that advertisement make product much better than they really are . as an example consider the advertisement of washing powder , under which ever brand-name it may be . the advertisement claim that it can remove different kind of stain . make the clothes shiny , maintains the colour of the cloth for long etc . most of these statement are projected one . take another example of washing soap which help to make people beautiful , according to the advertisement . some washing soap claim that they can make people healthy also . as long a my knowledge is considered i never heard thing like this happened any where in real life . in the same manner a the case of washing powder and bathing soap mentioned above the advertisement of clothing , motor vehicle , food item etc are all claiming thing which are little bit exagerated . the manufacturer of motor vehicle claim that they are having the latest technology about which the consumer ha never heard before and the fodd product claim that tey are having all the vitamin and protein which are necessary for human being . in short the statement make it clear that that the advertisement are claiming thing that are not exagerated to a great extend . hence it seems reasonable for me to agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they re
