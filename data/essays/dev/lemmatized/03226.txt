it is really important to have a broad knowledge , but it ' s true that in this age we also need person who are specialise in one specific subject . this problem begin to appear when you finsh the hight school and , i think , t it never disappear . i sad that is important to have a broad knowledge because ony if you have taste a lot of different thinghs you can really chose one of this thinghs . you have to decide and fell wath is the subject that you prefer , that you like and only when you have really understand it you can go on and specialize in it . to specialize is the secon step . this is really important because in this period the word move quikly and we need that people organizeing themself in sector . we need that people do their work at the best level and , for this reason , people need to specialise themself . for example , an economist must kow mat and economy history ec . . very well , so he ha to study a lot this specific subject . at the same time he also have to know other knowledge , not because our sistem want it , but because i think that if we want to became a complet person we must have an open mind and to have broad knowledge is a way to open our mind . in my opinion this is an instrument whit wich we can change the future .
