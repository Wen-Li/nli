i quite agree with statement , that young people enjoy life more than older people do . being young mean lot of energy . young people have more energy than a compared to any older person . more energy help them to take part in more activies . though this could be only true if these energy are spend towards positive activies . when a person is young , he is always in learing stage . so many time they may come across new place and new thing , they will enjoy knowing about it , because it would be their first interaction with it . e.g. simple driving , young people may find it more joyfull than older one . because driving would be relatively a new activity for them a compared with older one , who could be frusted will daliy traffic and other issue related to it . if you ask this same question to a school child during their exam , it can be expected what theirs answer could be . but during their vaction time , it may be opposite . this let u know , how immature a humanbeing is when he is in his young age . immature humanbeing , mean do n't understand reponsibilites towards their life than a older person could understand . in short a young person could have le responsibilites in his life compared wiht a older person , which put a older person to in more stressed life . said all these , life is great . its better we understand our different stage of life and enjoy it each stage a it come . each stage of a life ha it own beauty , to lead a happy life , one should understand this and should enjoy his or her life to most no matter in what age he or she is
