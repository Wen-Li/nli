the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is a statement i can totally agree with and my opinion is based on several factor . first off , the main reason of traveling usually is to explore the place visited , and see the beautiful attraction in it . that 's why it is necessary to find a professional and experienced local to guide you to the place because he know his job and he know what he 's doing so he would with no doubt take you to the place often tourist admire like : beautiful scene and natural beauty . for an example , i remember when i went with my family to egypt . i remember we met this young woman who wa appointed to meet u a our tour guide . i ca n't find word to describe how excellent were her choice and how greatly were we satisfied with the place we have seen and the activity we 've taken part of , since we saw most of the breath-taking attraction in giza like : the pyramids , sphinx and the national museum in that area where we had this short lesson about hyroglyphs . also getting a tour guide who 's also local can make a splendid combination because you ca n't find someone who 'd try hard to show you place in his town to make you love the place like a local . second off all , by getting a touring guide you can avoid some great deal of trouble you may face if you were all alone . touring guide often accompanied with security guard who 're common and familiar with situation that can cause some tourist a kind of unhappiness , or make them uncomfortable or in worst case be in danger such a : getting caught in the overwhelming traffic , being lost , get a good deal of disturbance by beggar , or even in worst case being endagered by tourist-targeting criminal . so that 's why i do think that tour guide are a must , instead of going solo , getting unsatisfied with what you see and give the place you visit a bad name a a result of that choice you 've taken .
