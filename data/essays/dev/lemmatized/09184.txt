no one would be able to stay in a specific country fopr the rest of his life . lets assume that there some1 donst want to travel and leave his country , well i think he lifeless and he doesnt wanna enjoy the taste of traveling and life . its not neccessary to travel in a group led by a tour guide , traveling alone or with a couple of friend is much adventorous a long a u dont cross the limit of adventure . a trip would make a person learn more about other contries , different culture and experience hard time a normal person would gop through . travelling alone would provide a person with a chance to stand up n take responsibility of himself . travbeling alone would provide a person with a precious oppurtunity to plan , manage , and learn more about the obsticles he going to face during life time . life is not all about joy and pleasure it is mainly to experience the rough time a person would go through .
