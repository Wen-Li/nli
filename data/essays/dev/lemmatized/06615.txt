today , to move , the people , in general , use theirs car . the number of car increase always but in an other side , the prize of car and oil increase too . on one hand , some people think in twenty year they will use than there are today . indeed , having a car is more and more expensive . on the earth , there le and le oil so the prize increase a lot and all people can not pay it . moreover , in the biggest city , the common transport will be very developed like in paris where the government make news bus ' route . they want that paris will becomea citie with no car . indeed , some people think we need to stop use the car because that due to the increase of polution . one the other hand , the car is the best to move . indeed , with car you can go everywhere and when you want . you do not wait like with bus and subway . maybe the prize of oil increase , however , all government try to find a solution . for example , in france , the government want to introduce a new oil product with cereal . this oil is ever use in some country like brazil where a lot car use this oil and where the oil is le expensive than in france . moverover , this vegetal oil can stop the polution in the biggest city . and finaly , with a car , the people do what they want like at home . they chose the radio station they want to listen , they can fume , they can phone . according to me , the common transport can developed a lot again . but with the new technology , all the people would like his own car and i think in twenty year there be more car in use than there are today .
