when a product is developed , there must be a way to introduce it to the public , and once it 's on the market , a way to increase it popularity and therefore it sale . this is where advertisement come in , to make the most sale and profit out of any kind of product , of any quality , and of any actual functionability , and i strongly emphasize `` of any quality , and of any actual functionability '' since most advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are . i believe it ha happened to all of u that we see a commercial on t.v. about a product that interest u , mainly because the function it will perform help u in some way , or make u more comfortable and happy , but when the product is purchased , it stand far from what we thought it would be or it would do . many people try to look at this a a scam ha been portrayed against them , but the truth is that advertisement wa mainly doing it job , which is attrack potential buyer . the advertisement 's purpose is to make you believe that this product is the best in quality , the best in price , and the best in it performance , in other word , it the best of the best in it kind . in order for marketing professional to reach this goal they must study the behavior of the public this product is being intended for , it interest , it like and dislike , and even it dream and routine , so that the product can be addressed in the most proper way and in the most proper time , presenting it a something that the potential buyer could never live without . the truth is , that some product do live up to it advertisement and to the buyer expectation , but those are surely not the majority ; and in the rest of the case i believe we just have to look out , and pay very close attention to the real message that it being sent when this advertisement are played and displayed anywhere thay are , because even if the marketing proffesional understands what my desire are and whay my behavior might be in front of a certain situation , he or she can not dictate what i will actually do , only i am in control of myself .
