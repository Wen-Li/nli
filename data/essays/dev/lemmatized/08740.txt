i disagree with the statement ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' . i would like to putforth example and situation i personally have experience to support my opinion . a person who travel alone i believe will have a lot more independency in making his own decision rather travelling along with a tour guide . with a tour guide we see our desicion being influenced by the guide and we get to see place the guide want u to see rather than what we want to see . it wa in my school trip that my classmate and myself had a pretty bad exerience with the guide appointed to u . the guide would take u to place we did n't want to see and he being a localite got u into a hotel that wa quite expensive , because by doing so he would get a commission from the hotel authority for getting them customer . other than that we had some other bad exeriences only because of the reason that the guide wa a localite and wa looking for grabbing commission wherever we went . the best advantage in travelling alone would be that we could find out about a place by interacting with the localites or getting a copy of the local travel guide to guide u to the best place of visit . in today 's advanced world we get to have the information of a place on our fingertip through the internet . we also have amazing travel guide book that come in various language and help u in getting a feel of the local culture . i would like to end the topic on the point that i took this decision based on my personal experience and the other travel experience that where great just because of the fact that we did n't take guide along .
