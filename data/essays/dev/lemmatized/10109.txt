i agree that in twenty year , advancement in convenience of public transport and/or concern for the environment will decrease the number of car in use than there are today . public transportation will prove to be more efficient than owning a private car . not only doe is save money , but it also save time . using public trasportation will save money in two way . firstly , the expense on fuel would be cut to zero . secondly , one no longer ha to spend money in car maintenance . adding to that , using public transportation will also save time because there will be le traffic . this is proved especially true in subway . because of these increase of benefit in using public transportation a technology advance , the population who would prefer owning a car would dwindle . another reason that the number of car are going to decrease is that there are growing concern for the environment . environmentalists have been active in promoting the conservation of nature through medium . they have successfully managed to alert the world about the seriousness of global warming and have also educated society on way to prevent a serious disaster . these same environamentalists have convinced many that preservation of nature is highly urgent . also , they have stated that the earth will run dry on fuel in a few year . thus , increasing amount of people who abide to such belief will result in the decrease of car usage . in conclusion , because of the effectiveness of public transportation and concern for perserving nature , le and le poeple would be willing to own car . when public transportation save money and time compared to owning a personal car and when the earth can be subject to serious catastrophe because of your use of car , could you possibly purchase a car ?
