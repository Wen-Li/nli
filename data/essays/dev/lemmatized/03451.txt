the school provides a good environment for the student to be educated . some people emphasizes the great importance for the student to understand idea and concept in their school setting , while others argue that the significancy of learning fact should not be neglected . as far a i see it , it would be more reasonable for the school to teach their student more about how to understand the idea and concept . some of my reason are given below . the main reason for my propensity is that the school provides the best environment for the student to understand idea and concept , while the fact can be learned by the student themselves through other way , example are internet and documentary film . in the classroom , the student can be guided by the teacher , and they can discus matter with their classmate , which are both of utmost importance for them to understand idea and concept . if the teacher just keep tellling the student the fact , the advantage aspect of the school would be wasted . furthermore , other method enable the student to learn fact that are far more valuable and more up-to-date . the internet contains much more information than the text book used in the classroom , and the information are likely to be the latest . besides , understanding idea and concept help the student to solve more complex problem . as we noticed , the exam nowadays are more flexible , which not only requires the student to list fact printed in the book , but also require the student to make use of their learned idea and concept to achieve a higher score . if a high school student can grasp the idea and concept in class , he or she will probably get a higher score in the college entrance examination , which can exercise a extremely important impact on this student 's future career . additionally , were student eager to understand the idea and concept , they are more likely to discus or share their opinion with their classmate and the teach . that would undoubtedly help the student ' interpersonal communication ability . moreover , communication can result in friendship . when the student are discussing with each other , they may find something in common between them , or even can become friend owning to it . as the time for them to discus problem go by , their friendship is likely to solidified . though learning fact is also very important in education , judging from what ha been mentioned above , i believe it is understanding idea and concept that far outweighs the opposite aspect .
