in my opinion , older people enjoy life more than young people . `` enjoy oursleves and have all the fun we could have . '' is what most young people thinking of . they spend time to do sport , to date with people , tend to club and pub to find their fun ; drink and smoke to make themselves feel more high , more excited . it 's not a healthy life , and not a responesble life also . when people are young , mostly they spending money given by their parent , instead of spending money earned by themselves . and , secondly , young people always tend to be selfish and takeing le care about others . they do n't actually know how important other people rolling in their life . in that case , they will do le contribution to the either farmily or community . so , in my view , young people do not know `` how '' to enjoy life . in contrast , old people , on the other hand , think otherwise . '' enjoy ourselves with other people , have fun while we can . '' is what they think . they are more matural and know what they are supposed to do . old people usually go travel when they have free time and extra financial ability . they go to club too for different purpose , have a drink with friend or old classmate . most of them know how to lead a life which is healthy and full of happiness . also , old people know how to make themsleves helpful and valuble to others . they know hwo to share happiness with other people . especially when they had their child . they enjoy a real `` life '' . in all , old people know how to enjoy the life and they are enjoying more than young
