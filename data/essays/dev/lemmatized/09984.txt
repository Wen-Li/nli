spending time on a holiday tour is the best way to relax oneself from the stress and pressure of work in such a competitive world . people with lot of time in hand for planning and scheduling tour prefer to travel on their own , but i personally prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide . a complete tour pakage reduces my tension of flight confirmation , booking of hotel in city not known to me and also the head ache of researching about the place that i am going to visit . also , i get a chance to meet many interesting people and make new friend from different walk of life which also make the tour even more exciting and interesting . it take care of my spending a i can budget my trip well allocating appropriately to shopping and other need and it also save me from getting cheated in foreign land . i can visit all the important place of the city and the guide would help a in knowing about the importance and significance of the place better . in addition , i could be more involved in the group while travelling which would help me in communicating to a variety of people and enhance my knowlegde horizon socially a well a give me a chance to learn about different mind . the guide would also personally help in finding happening and other interesting place of the city which are not the part of the schedule . it would also help in time management a we have to adhere to the timing scheduled by the tour guide . moreover , touring in a group would take take of my personal safety from local resident and their misbehaviour , if any . in conclusion , i would certainly like to travel in a group captained by a tour guide a i dont have to bother about booking ticket for travelling , staying a well a personal safety .
