i would have to agree by the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . as more and more car are rapidly produced today , the government especially ha been doing all it best to provide necessary public transportation throughout a nation . the space allocated for the vehicle will soon be not enough . population growth directly contributes to the increase in the number of driver on the road . highways of hundred of metre tall will anyway be fully congested with driver . with limited space or land throughout a country , any single government would surely take the step into reducing the number of car on road , which also could cause pollution . as do the government here in malaysia , they are trying their best to reduce the number of car on the road . one move that wa made to the malaysian government on to reduce the number of car is by imposing tax . by imposing heavy percentage of tax on imported a welllas the local car , it wa believed to be an incentive for driver to find an alternative mode of transport . but this ha obviously been proved le effective . this automatically brought them about to reducing the number of driver instead . for example of an action that ha taken by the government is by setting an older age line for wannabe driver to be competant on the road . this delay of upcoming driver is also supported by another wise move which like any other country , which is by improving the country 's public transportation . public transportation is the one and only solution that can help curb future congestion on the road . take for example , the train . easy accessibility , low and flat priced ticket and large-sized public transportation is the perfect charactheristic of a highly effective mode of vehicle which many government are vying to achieve . the most obvious example of a highly effective public transport is none other than the bullet train located in japan . another example is the country , australia that i have visited . the sight of seeing only small number of car in the road of australia ha clearly shown to me , a a malaysian what my country should ought to be like . if in austrialia , every now and then you can only hear a honk or the screech of the tyre , i 'm sure in twenty year down the road the roadway will be an empty one ! thx , sign
