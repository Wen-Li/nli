i am agree with the thing than successful people try new thing and take risk rather but there are not only doing what they already know how to do well because if they already know how to do well there do n't take any risk . to be successful mean you will success on every thing you try but that mean you can try every thing and still success . some one successful will want to try any thing for see if he still successful , if that person try only some thing he know how to do well he is not a really successful person . for example , i am good to play pianno so that pretty successful in a fist time but now i never play gitar and i try so i 'm not really good at the beginning but i take some lesson and really fater i get really good to play gitar , that mean i am a successul person . now , i am a good dancer , i know how dance but i do not try any thing eals exepted dance so i am a good dancer but i am not a successful peron because the only thing where i success is the thing i already know . some one successful is so some one who try new thing but he doe not know if he will be good or bad and finally because he is successful he is going to be good to those new thing . for be really successfull you of course have to try lot of thing than you can know how successful you are because to be successfull only for a couple thing do not mean you are really successfull . for exemple , after try to play gitar , i can now try a other instrument ant a other one . .. if i still success for every one , i am a really successful person . so , if you really want to be a successful person you need try new thing and take risk rather . if you do not you just some one who look like successful but finally you are some one who is not successful .
