it is often said that young people 's interest in their community ha been decreased recently . some people might agree with this opinion because of the society getting more and more individualistic . however , i disagree with the idea that the young spend much time for community because of what school and society require for them . to begin with , school encourage student to more actively participate in the community service . many school , nowadays , offer volunteering program for additional credit or elective course . to support this point , study done by the ministry of education of korea have shown that the number of official community service provided by educational organization such a high school and university ha been 67 % increased compared to that of 10 year ago . also student ' participation for these program ha been 87 % increased . it seems clear that school have a positive influence on young people 's assistance for their community . moreover , society put more stress on helping community . communities display a lot of advertisement to get help from young people and their participation is highly praised by the society . the young peoplebeing considered a virtuous are rewarded by the government making their name on the local periodical . for example , i happened to see the poster for rebuilding of my community damaged ny huricane earlier . i immediately made my mind to be part of it a the team leader and awarded by the represent of my village . this volunteer experience written on my resume greatly affected the employer of my current work . they said virtue of helping others is the very criterion they esteem . in short , i disagree with the opinion that young people spend not enough time for community to make them better . this is because of encouragement of school and society .
