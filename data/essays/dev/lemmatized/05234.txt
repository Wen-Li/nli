one thing history teach manking is that extreme are never the best solution . they might serve one purpose for a short term , but on the longer run they usually reveal their shortcoming . the very same rule can be applied in this case . at a first glance , the advantage of a specified knowledge seem to be overwhelming . nearly every modern companie or even scientist in university serve a good example . to be successful in your part of busines , you have to know everything about it , and additional knowledge only serf a distraction . since the time of big breaktrough-inventions are all gone , everybody specializes on a very narrow field . on a small subject , we now have an absolute expert , knowing nearly everything about it . to a certain extend this is absolutely necessary . who else can deal with nano-composites , for example , exept someone who ha studied this subject for many year ? but a soon a an wider overview is needed , this type of scientist very often fails how can he know about new method in medicine , that might well be adopted within the field of nano composite , if all they ever studied are nano-composites ? it is therefore possible , that lacking interdisciplinary skill often result in disadvantage . furthermore , a person with a tremendous amount of knowledge on only one field most definitely lack interest in other thing , and therefore miss so many thing in life . the other extreme would be people who know something about everything , but nothing of importance about any specific field . while these scientist might have the interdisciplinary skill , they would certainly lack the knowledge they need to combine anything of real use and importance . there is simply no need for these person in academia , since a certain understanding of specific problem is always needed . i therefore strongly support the idea of a combination of these two type . of course i am aware of the fact , that we can never gain specific knowledge on all academic subject . this will remain an illusion . i favor the humanistic approach . specialize on one or two subject , but never loose your abilitie to overview a wider field . if you are a mechanical engineer , do n't loose your interest for theatre .
