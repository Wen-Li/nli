i completely agree with the topic that in the next twenty year there will be fewer car in use than they are today . today the technology is more advanced than yesteryear and there can be more advancement in the near future . with the advancement of technology car may be replaced by some newer invention . firstly , if we consider the time before fifty or sixty year back , there were more number of bicycle . and after that , with the invention of bike people mostly travelled on them . further with the invention of car the number of bike and their usage ha decreased . after twenty year there may be any other advanced invention which may replace the car . for instance if a flying machine is invented for benefit of a common man then there will be more flying machine and le number of car . secondly it can be said that the need of the people keep changing with time . after twenty year if some thing more cheaper or more advanced than car is made available then there can be fewer car than they are today . with the increase in need of people any other advanced invention can replace car . and the number of car can decrease . lastly i conclude that in the next twenty year there will be le number of car than they are today .
