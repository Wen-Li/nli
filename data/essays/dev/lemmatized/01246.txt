i agree with the passage that state that successful people try new thing and take risk . it is good for people to do what they know how to do well , and probably they will succeed on that topic but if they only focus on that , they wo n't be a succesful a they would have been by trying different thing and taking risk . i believe that the more new thing we try , the more we learn , and therefore , the more chance we have to feel that we made it to our goal , which i think is what defines sucess in life . but of course the risk should not be any type of risk , for example , opening a new business like the restaurant , would be a risk for people that do not have the expertise on that type of business but if they ask for advice from expert on that area and make a sound judgement of the possibility of that particular business , it is good to take the risk . another example of a type of risk that people can take in order to reach sucess , is taking the chance to apply to a university to get a degree . some people think that they will be rejected and because of that they just keep in the same possition that they are at that moment , maybe because they have a fear of failure . if they do not work hard to get what they want and do not risk the possibility of feeling rejected , it is something that , i believe , will affect them in the future when they think about the thing they have done in their pastw and did not do it . that wo n't make the person feel sucesssful . for all these reason , i believe that sucessful people should take risk and learn to do new thing in life .
