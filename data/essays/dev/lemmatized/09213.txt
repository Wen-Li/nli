i agree with this speech young people nowadays do not give time to helping their community . the life is changed from the past i mean every thing became faster and faster in this life . everyone busy with his own life . first of all , the young people are busy wirh their study and their own life . the young people in the past , they do not warried about their study . however , now they worry alot for they study and they want to be something in their sociuty . next , young people have alot of thing want to do . for example , they want to enjoy in their free time with their friend . they want to go to the mall or visit some best friend . on other hand , in the past they have alot of time to help their community . finally , the year after the year the young people will be more busy than now because of the technology which develope year after year and the life will be more difficult . i think the young people should orginize their time in this cause they can do want they want . also , they can help their communties .
