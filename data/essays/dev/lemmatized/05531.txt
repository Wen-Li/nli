everybody is confronted with advertisement in his daily life . about 5000 different kind of advertisement are influencing u day by day . but are the advertisement reflecting the reality , or are they just making the product seembetter than they are ? i think that advert definitly show the product in a better light , because it doe n't mention the danger of product . furhtermore , the real price is often not viewed . firstly , advertisment should change our consumer habit . thus , the producted are displayed better than they really are . for instance , mc donald 's try to attract people by showing the consumer photo of their burger . the burger in the photo are made of plastic because they look fresher than the real burger . what 's more the advertisement do n't show the danger of these product . let 's take mc donald 's again a an example . it is commonly known that the product of the fast food restaurant lead to overweight . nevertheless the advertisement do n't mention any of these disadvantage , because mc donald 's want , of course , the people to buy their product . another example are toy for little child . as they are often produced in china , they contain material of low quality . in some case , the toy are even toxic for the child . these are danger , which are definitely not mentioned in the advertisement , an unacceptable way to distract from danger in my opinion . thirdly , the real price is always hided in the advertisement . for instance , the big air line try to attract people with cheap offer , e.g. one flight form munich to berlin for only 30 euro . in fact , this offer doe n't represent the real price , because it doe n't contain the additonal fee of airport or the extra cost of the fuel . actually , the flight cost about 55 , euro almost the double price of the advertisement . all in all , advertisement screw up the reality . mc donald 's try to offer it burger with fotos which do n't view the real burger . additionally , the hazard of the product are n't mentioned . hence , mc donald 's and co. distract from the problem of overweight by showing salad which seem to be good for the health . it is a fact that these salad even have more energy than normal burger . moreover , toy selling company want to make their toxic product attractive to the consumer . finally , false price annoy the consumer . as far a i 'm concerned , i think the development of the advert should be stopped . products should be bought by people because they have a good quality , instead of consumed only because the advert make it seem much better than they really are .
