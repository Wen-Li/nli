i agree with the atatement that there will be fewer car in the next twenty year . there will be three point to support my idea . then , i will list these three point a follows : first of all , the government of today put more investment to improve the public traffic mass , and there will be le need to purchase a private car . most of the people in our city buy car because there are so few public bus and subway , and it always make them be late to work or school . so if the government give it buget more to build the public traffic system , fewer citizen will buy car . and since the traffic mass action began progress in our city , the number of the car ha already declined . another thing that will due to the reduction of the car 's number is that the le amount and the large expense of the crude oil resource . nowadays , fewer oil field can be entract enough crude oil for people to use . in order to explore new oil resource , we put our eye to the sea floor . you know , to drill an oil well on the sea floor need much more expences and more modern technique . in addition to the war began in the middle east , the expense of the oil raised far more repaid than we could expected . if we want to run a car , we should spend more money on the expense of fuel then ever before . and i think this situation will not be change in the next twenty year . as a result , it will make u reduce to use car than nowadays . last but not the least is that the people 's conception to protect the environment and reduce the pollution . by using car , it will cause a lot of environment problem such a air pollution , noise pollution . all these will be harm to human 's body . however , people now concerntrate more on the health problem than ever before . so they will reduce the use of car to decline the pollution it caused . for this reason , the number of car will of course be delined in next 20 year . all in all , the government ' action , the limited natural resource , and the mind of people to decline the pollution all put function in the reducted number of car . and i also think fewer car will make our life better and will also do good to the whole society .
