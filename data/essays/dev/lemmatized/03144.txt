the author say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . yes i will agree to these statement because older people came from younger generation only , hence it is possible to agree the statement . firstly , young people will enjoy more than older people because from the early age of the born baby he dont know about life after some year child will go to school which is institution and from there he know some thing and after when he will become to a certain position h e will be enjoying with his friend and a well a they will be close to each other aswell a they help each other and it is important for every person . hence it is must because when he will be in problem friend will only help some time parent will not do that time and hence it happens when it is true friend ship . when there will be any occasion all the friend will meet they will enjoy with party and all will celebrate and enjoy and that is the age to enjoy the life and do whatever he want because the past never come and such a way that all should enjoy . whenever there is a holiday people will go to cinema that it will be full entertainment a well a game like cricket all will play if they have holiday it is nice and interesting game and going to picture with friend is a nice enjoyment , all will be happy at that movement , and they will dance in theatre and it is a nice enjoyment and hence in every festival all the friend will meet and they will spend there day at that place . while in a college there will be a competition , sport , entertainment and we can participate and enjoy and we can go to tour with college or with our own way for a week there fore we can enjoy the climate in the same while enjoying we should also study . while exam date will come near we should preapare for exam and also we should prepare well for the exam if we dont know any thing our friend will be helpful in such a way that we can write exam succesfully . whereas older people can not do this which mean while come to an older age they should not eat every item and they should take medicine daily it is a problem and also for them there will be tension and they will be in hurry in each field . hence atlast i say that older people also come from younger age and they also enjoyed , but it is fact every person should enjoy his life in a successful way .
