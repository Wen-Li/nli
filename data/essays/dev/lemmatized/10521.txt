in my view , while one may say that people in general do not give enought time to help their community , i do not think that young people do not help enought . the first reason for my view is simply that i know many young people who care a lot . some of them would help directly their community , by spending time with olders , or taking care of adult ' child . some others would even make bigger thing to help people in the world . for example , i have a friend who left france last year , to work a a benevol to build a school in a certain country in africa . the second reason for my view is that we had never seen young people caring and participating this much before . in the last presidential election in france in 2002 , when jean-marie le pen , who is known to have racist and seggregated opinion , reached the second phase of the election , the first group who demonstrated in the street to show it reluctance of seeing such a man becoming the president wa a group of student and some teenager from highschool . i believe this would have never happened before . finally , i think it is important to say that young people do not have always the possibility to show that they care . indeed , young people do not win much money , if any at all . they are at an age where they have to give priority to theirs study , or have just started a job which can be a very difficult period . because of all this reason , i think that even if some people think it is too low , the young people are helping community largely enought . to sum up , i believe that while it is sometimes difficult for young people to find the time and the money to help community , they are caring enought , specially compared with the past . according to me , young people more and more understand that they are crucial actor of the community .
