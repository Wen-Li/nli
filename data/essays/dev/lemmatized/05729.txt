i personally think that if someone ha a broad knowledge on many subject , he will be able to find a solution on a larger amount of problem in life/work . if a person ha to solve problem on his own and ca n't cooperate with other people , he would certainly be advantaged with this type of knowledge . on the contrary , if a society is well organized and all the part that cooperate are well prepared just on a specific subject ( obviously each part ha a different subject ) , efficiency can be increased a lot making the society very competitive . taking the statement from a more personal point of view make me think about those people considered a `` genius '' , that improoved a lot in a specific field but consequently had a lack of knowledge in other field , for example social relationship . this make them suffer and escape different situation just because they ca n't stand them . the genius creates something with his ability that will always be remembered and appreciated , but he ha to suffer for it . actually i wish i wa a genius on something , but at the same time i like the way i wa educated so i find myself in agreement with the statement .
