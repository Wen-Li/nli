i completely agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . every economist today know that it is so important to know to sell the product , than the cuality of it . it is well known the huge amount of money that many enterprise invest in advertisement . there are many stadistical study about publicity and it effect . for example , they discovered that the effect of advertisement need some month to produce effect . that is the reason why we can see advertisement about a film that wo n't be in cinema until 3 month after . one important thing to consider is that we do n't buy the product , we buy the concept of the product . sometimes we have proved many product , and we know the cuality of each one , therefore we can chose the better one . but many time we have a lot of product where choose , and we do n't know which is better . then , if we remmember the advertisement of that product which explain their advantage we probably will choose it , although it really were worse than other . some year ago one child ask for a pirate ship toy in christmas . when he opened the box , and found his present , he started to cry under the surprised looking of their parent . then the child ask his father where wa the sea on which the ship sailed in the advertisement . the child had never seen the sea , and he really wanted it from the toy . this is only an example of the effect of advertisement . in fact many time we are not buying the product only . we can be buying the image of the product . for example , several mark of clothes are a social distinction . in conclusion , advertisement are a key factor for sell product , not related
