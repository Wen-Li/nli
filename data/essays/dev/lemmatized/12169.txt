successful people tend to try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . why i used `` tend '' above is that that is a possiblility , not an absolute solution for the successful people , otherwise the answer should depends on how to define `` successful people '' and how do successful people success ? if success mean money , and someone who are called successful people comparatively , but not a real money bag like bill gates , there is no absolute answer for success . however , even in that case , the possibility for the success is consistently changing up to definition of success or how much are they successful . apparently , the possibility for success are given to the people who are willing to try something new . because in the field that have been well-known benefit maker . many people have already taken their benefit from that , not much thing other people can gain and it could be called a monopoly . it 's like fossil fuel depletion . small part of the world are still taking big gain from the fossil fuel , there is no chance to get entered in that industry , because that fileds are already full with prior property . in a given situation like their dna , such a their looking or how they are smart , like how much money do they get from their parent , the possi ble way to improve their possibility for success is to challenge to uncovered world . even though they are having the risky business which is originated from itself ( becuase it 's new ! ) the people who only doing what they already know how to do well can not easily catch up with those people who try to do something new and their great-great success rather than great or just success . i am aiming great-great success like i wrote above , what i require to get the goal is to improve my credativity , to be enough creative to find something new and explore it . there is a word in my country `` if the water is stuck in one place , those will be decayed .
