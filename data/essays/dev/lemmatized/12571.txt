i disagree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i think the best way to travel is alone or with a freind . there are two reason . first , it 's more free . second , bagpack is more exciting . the first reason is that i have much more free time than in a group . th be specific , i can go wherever i want and spend a lot of time in some place without any resistant . if i want to go shopping , i do not care other people . so i can go small shop and see aroud where i intersting . that mean i have freedom in a trip . second ting , it is more exciting . for example , when i vistied italy last year , i stayed youth-hostel . in there , i made friend who came other country . so , we went popular space , restaurant , park and river together . until now , i contect her by email . even if i had not plan go concert in italy , i saw the pamplet and went there . i can not forget that concert . that 's why i think best way to trevel is alone or just with a friend .
