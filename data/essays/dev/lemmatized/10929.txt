i agree with this idea that charenging new thing and do n't care about fault . there are two reason : trying are profitable and newtings have usually fault and it need to growth . firstly , charenging can proceed tecnology and deveropment . for example , the history of devepropping supace tecnology were faced to many fault . in order to bing out human to the speace , many fault roket lunching were happend . the space deveropping are typical of try new thing and overecome risk . secondary , if you do the same thing ordinary , it is impossible to growth . for example , although you learned something in the school , you do n't take for the imformation , the imformation became an invain . people have desire to know new thing by nature and they use the fommer imformation . if they do n't try newthings , the life area would be narrow by now . threfore , i believe worth activity that people chanenge new thing and do n't worry fault .
