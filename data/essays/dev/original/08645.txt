Korean parents, who has traditionally shown huge intersts on childern's education, seem to be competing to send their chidren to most munber of private academies. I should admit that childern should accumulate a lot of knowlege to understand the world, or the lead a successful life in the futer. However, I believe that more emphasis should be put on understanding the ideas and concepts.

 First of all, compulsion of acquiring lots of knowledge will make the student lose the interests on the subject they're studying. When a student is force to go to several privite academies by his mom's wish like one of my students, she won't have chance to consider what I want to know the most. As a matter of a fact, the student spents lots of time studying English, math and science but all she wishes about the academies is to quit them.

  Moreover, just gaining more knowlede beyond the student's understanding is not efficient at all. For example, another student of the academy where I teach, should take 3 coursed every day. Of course, it is not by his will but by his mom's wish. In spite of the amount of time he spends at the academy, he fails to show decent understanding for any of the classes. Because he takes too much, he is having a hard time understanding the lessons.

  Undoubtedly, having a lot of knowledge is very useful and important. However, I believe the study process should follow the steps neede to be efficient. Students should have chance to learn about what it is like. For that they should understand the field.
