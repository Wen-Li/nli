There are many advanges in any field of knowledge.  They have some connection with each other.  If students only learn one specific area that will be misunderstood some parts of academic subjects.  In my opinion, I agree with people are better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.
	
	Some academic subjects need students know the others subjects first.  Otherwise, they could not totally understnad its meaning or how to figure out the answer.  For example,  students have to know mathemtic class first and then they can use it on the accounting class.  On the other hand, If People have broad knowledge, they can understnad the newspaper what they talk.  They also can join any kind of topic to share their opinion.  If people only concentre on their area that will be lost many chance to know new friends.  

	People specialize in one area that's good for their careers in the future because they can deeply understnad their professionl knowledge.  As the matter fact, after graduation, people can gain more specific knowledge when they work.  It would be better than learn specific knowlege in school so they don't need to focus on it.  If students learn specific subject in university, they will lost oppontunity to gain more than others areas.
