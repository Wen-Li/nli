I fully agree with this statement. Young people donot give enough time to helping their communities. They mostly indulge in  activities that they want to do or having things they desire, instead of looking at the problems affecting their homes and localities. 

I myself, being a young person and living alongwith numerous other fellows in a hostel, has lots of experiences of such neglect shown by young individuals towards social and community needs. Most of the time being spent by young people goes mainly in fun activities like partying, gaming, chatting etc. or either in studying, preparing for the exams. There seems to be no thought processes in the mind that deals with the immediate difficulties, shortages or problems that is going aroung the place which need to be solved. 

For example, in our institution there is a major problem of standing water bodies in and around campus which provides a typical breeding ground for mosquitoes that can cause dangerous infections to the ocals living in and around the area. But inspite of this, there seems to be no concern shown by the students who themselves might be affected by it. The situation can grow worse if not taken seriously. Effective measures can be applied with the help of young students if they are willing.

Similarly, there are issues like education of poor workers and their children, who work in the campus for construcion of new buildings. Young students can really help such poor people by organizing free weekly or monthly classes within the area and it could be of great help to the children who can think of having a much better life in future. But till now, nothing has been done by the young people living here. 

Young people mostly dont listen to the advices given by seniors or the elderly people. They always do what they feel is right. Spending time to help communities is not the popular choice in their minds. Going by what I have seen in my campus hostels, most of young people, including me, like having fun, go to bars and restaurants, have nice unending chats or just study the curricular courses and interest related subjects. Spending time for social and community services is not there nowadays among the young people.
