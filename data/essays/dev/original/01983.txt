I dont think all of the young people nowadays are helping their communities but i believe some of them do helping. Sometimes this kind of topics appears in the NEWS or the newspaper. Adults thinks young people dont help and playing around but i dont think it is true.
  Now in the world, many people are working for theirselves, for family, and for the world but adults say they are not helping but is this true? i dont think so. there are a hundred of the young people working for the communities. But why adults say that? maybe because they have not seen it.
  How can they show the adults that they are doing for their communities? do they have to come in front of them and show what they have done? No. young people nowdays are working and helping their communities in their original styles. Forexample the club DJ. From the adults point of view, they can only see is the young people playing arount untill the morning. but they are working hard in their own style and helping their communities. 
  if you look around really carefully, then you can see young people nowadays are giving their time to helping their communities in their original style.
