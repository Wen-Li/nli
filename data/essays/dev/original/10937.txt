Many people in this modern world wonder if successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . In my opinion , i think successful people are the people who try new things , but in the end it has its advantages and  its disadvantages .
         I think that successful people are the people who try new things because these people work hard , research and try there best to find new things as well as  getting things better and more efficent so i guess these people deserve to get more than the people who are just sitting in their places , repeating the same procedure again and again through out the years . Successful people in my opinion never stop the hard work , never stop researching as well as never stop or speed down the pace from looking for the better and the best as this modern world is modernizing, and improving day after day so you have to be on the pace and never stop from working hard to find new things . Always a person, who stops or slow down his pace in researching and working hard ,will be thrown out of the competion .
       There are few disadvantages of trying new things and one of them is that by trying new things you may risk yourself , as for example if the new thing did not work or benifit it will cause failure and sometimes may cause great lose to a specific person or even company . In my opinion , some times trying new things is worth the risk as the percentage of success is much higher than the percentage of failure in most times . 
         Some advantages of doing what you already know , which are few is that you do not risk your self in danger , it keeps you out of the red zone and into the green zone . In my opinion , people who dont like competition , facing , and people who do not have strong hearts stay doing what they already know how to do well in .
        Finally , successful people always try to find new things while people who want to stay in their places and not change keep doing what they already know how to do well in and i am a person who think successful people are who try new things and bare the risk .
