I personally believe that experience and practice is what makes a person perfect, according to the proverb "Practice makes perfect." One needs to have some sort of experience in an area to be successful; for example a previous mistake or a wrong decision that has been made. 
	To begin with, I would like to give an example of my personal experience. In the summer of the year 2007, I had dislocated my knee during a physical education class at school. We were playing kickball and it was my turn to kick the ball and run. Due to the slippery floor of the court, I had slipped and almost broke my left leg. It took me a large amount of time to start walking, running and even sitting again, and the doctor had forbidden me from playing any sorts of sport again, as there was a big risk that the same accident would happen again. However, I did not listen to the words of the doctor and started playing basketball, my favorite sport, as soon as I was able to run again. I even joined the Varsity Girls Basketball Team of my school. Now the season is over, and I am glad that I took the risk. However, if I hurt myself again, I would never regret what I did, because I would take a lesson out of it: not to disobey my parents and my doctor again. 
	Another example of taking risks and trying new things would be joining the chess club of my school. I had never played chess in my entire life, but as soon as I joined the club, my knowledge of logical thinking has flourished. I enjoy playing the game, even outside of the club, and I am proud that I took the risk and joined the club, even though I was nervous and shy at the beginning.
	Some people tend to hate seafood, while others cannot live without it. I believe this is a matter of choice and sometimes a matter of experience. Disregarding people who have allergies, an ordinary human being would enjoy eating something if they were raised eating it. I am a seafood fanatic, and therefore adore eating Japanese food. Sushi, the most common type, is something I eat every week. Some of my friends, however, highly dislike Sushi. My best friend at school had never tried eating Sushi in her life, but she told me about her hunger for seafood several times. Therefore, I took her to a Japanese restaurant once, trying to convince her to eat Sushi. She did not want to eat it at first, however when she tried it, she absolutely loved it. Now, every week me and her go to our favorite destination, the Japanese Restaurant.
	Experience is something that happens once in a life time, and can be used numerous times for different things. I believe that trying new things and taking risks, such as visiting different countries and riding the fast train in an amusement park, will expand a person's overall knowledge and turn them to an open-minded person.
