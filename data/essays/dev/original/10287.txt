I agree with the opinion ; young people enjoy life more than older people do . Younger people have many relationship with other people from community such as school , company , or internet society . I believe that to keep being related with somebody makes life more enjoyable , because I can communicate and share the happiness or pleasure with others if I am related with somebody . Of course older people have the relationship with people , but it is much smaller than younder people has. Old people do not go to school , probably retired their job too , therefore younger people has larger relationship with others . 
   Younger people are more aggressive , active , and powerful . They can act and do as well as what they want to do . They can go other place whenever they want to go , they can play sports or other activities whatever they cant do . It is hard to move their body for older people . 
   I think many old people enjoys their hobbies inside their house or around their house by theirselves , but I do not think that those are real enjoyable things .  My grandfather lives by himself since my drandmother was died , and he says he enjoy watering his bonsais and walking around his subdivision with his dog , but he does not look happy for real . If I do not have much relationship with people , it would not be so much fun at all . I think people can feel that " I really enjoy doing this! " from their deeper part of their heart if they are connected with other people.
   Therefore, I agree with the statement " young people enjoy life more than older people do. "
