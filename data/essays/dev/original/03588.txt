	Will there be fewer cars in twenty years from now? My instant reply is no, and mainly because I realize how our technology are rapidly advancing, and cars will change, changing only to make people love them more, satisfying urges for beautiful car models, creating more desires to own one. Looking back into the past since cars were first invented, there's a huge big differences of how much cars are own. Compared to before when only the rich owns cars, cars nowadays are getting cheaper in price, considering the amount of second-hand cars being sold and how cheap it is to buy one. As time pass, the rich will continue to buy more cars and selling their old ones, and at the same time, the lower class will buy these used cars for a cheaper price. With this cycle going on, more and more people will be owning cars rather than selling them. 
	And why are the rich buying more and more cars? Generally it's because of the constant change in the car technology; the desire of speed and unique designs. A stereotype view of rich people are people who buy cars just because of its looks. Car companies looking at this, will exploit this point by coming up with more and more uniquely designed cars. There's a rare chance rich people will disappear and their interest in buying these cars decrease. On the other hand, there'll always be the lower class people who are ready to buy these used cars at a lower price. 
	Most of the people wants to own a car, and in my opinion, this is a psychological desire; jealousy. When a person sees another person with something they do not have, that person will also want a car. When a rich guy sees his friend with a really groovy car, he will also want a unique car of his own. There're always more generations joining us and with this cycle of jealousy and how the car price falls, it'll be easier for people to own cars. Conclusionally, I'd say that in twenty years, or even fifty years, the amount of car usage will only increase but not decrease. Unless something better than cars join this market and successfully grab car buyers' attentions.
