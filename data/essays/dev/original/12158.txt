I agree that young people do not invest much time in helping their communities. There are many influences on all people, so also on the young ones, that are different nowadays and in the past. These influences change people's behaviour.

In the past the personal contacts someone had was within a relatively small area and the dependency on each other was greater than today. Therefore there was more social community and also young people did their part for the community. Nowadays the range of people someone knows is spread over a much bigger area so that there is not longer the close relationship to people in your nearby community. 

There are other factors that encourage young people to focus more on themsleves than on others. In the whole society there is the pressure of being successful with everything that someone is doing. Because these people need the time for being successful there is none or only little time left to spend it for the community. also, The interest moved from caring about the community to caring about oneself. Mainly people follow just their own business and do not care about others, wether they belong to the same community or not.

Another reason may be that life is more anonymous than it was in the past. People do not know each other, even if they live in one house, they might not have been met. If the people do not know their community, why and how should they care about them?

Finally I would like to consider the point of responsibility for relatives and the money included. In the past families lived together much closer than nowadays. People have another opinion of being responsible. Today they do not care that much anymore about their relatives themselves, they rather care by spending money that someone takes care about the family member.

There are many influences today that are different in comparison to the past, that changed the willingness of young people to help their communities.
