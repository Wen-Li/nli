Although most advertisement companies states insistantly that they are deeply considering the ethical issues in advertisements, I think most of the advertisements produced by these companies are exaggrated. Firstly, these companies are taking high amounts of money from customers and as a result they want to appreciate these customers. Rather than using creativity in preparation process, they just exaggrate the properties of the products. After all these deceptions, the products can be perceived much more valuable by the public. In order to avoid these type of misleading advertisements, there should be an effective control mechanism like a properly working group which investigates the advertisements before they are published. A second solution might be strict regulations like fining the misleading companies etc.
Secondly, these advertisements only emphasizes the positive attributes of the product but gives no information about its drawbacks. In this way, people who buy the product, do not the weak points of the products. For instance, a product which can clean only smooth surfaces might be used by the owner on rough surface which will probably cause deformation to the product. Here, it can be stated that this problem is caused by the advertisement which did not include the constraints of the product. 
Finally, there is a great competition between the products of different companies which causes the omittion of some ethical values. Rather than stating the drawbacks, praising is a common style in the advertisements.
To conclude, the advertisements are misleading in most ways and these faults must be corrected by means of proper control mechanism. Furthermore we should know that frankness is the most important virtue on the earth.
