I do agree with the statement of successful people has to try new things and take new risks. 
  Since the beggining of  human life, the human had always to explore new things in order to survive to addapt the different changes and the different enviroments that surround us, the world and everything around us is in constant change.
   Think how it will be the world today if we continue to be only doing what we already know how to do well, we will probably be  pre-historic, if  no writting, no paper, no wheel, no medicine has ever existed,  we will probably be  extinguish by now.
  The pre-historic man didn't  talk or have clothes but in order to live he started wearing the fur of the animals he haunted, the human now can survive the cold. 
  All that we are and have today is possible because of the foundation that we had before, if we haven't take the risk that our ancestors took every day we would't be here.
 
  And the world it's going to keep changing and we need to keep changing too, trying new things, taking risks. It's your option to change or not but if you decided not too take a risk or not to try a new thing; my friend you will be left behind and with time cease.
  
In the times we live now adays everybody has to try new things and new risks, learn new things, it is really easy to become obsolete in this world.
 Even choosing your carrer, let's say Doctor in surgery.  You just finished the university and after a couple of years they discovered a new anesthesia that it's better for the human body, but you don't know how to use it and you don't want to take tha chance of knowing something new, an improvement to your carrer, with time this anesthesia is the only anesthesia available. In what have you become?; you have become obsolete because you refused the change. Now it's not a change anymore is what people are doing and they already know how to do it well, but not you.

Change and taking new risks it's inherit in our nature, the human will always try new thing and find new risks that's our nature and that's why we are on top of the food chain.
