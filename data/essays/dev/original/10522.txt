in my university experience i always appreciated what i learnt when i was at the high school.
during my high school time in italy i used to study latin and ancient greek.
our professor was always explaining us how to study these two classical languages  was giving us the capacity to use in a really better way our mind, learning something that was improving our way "to think".
ancient greek and overall latin can help you to understand better a specific topic because they are based on a logic structure.
latin is really similar to math and it can permit you to elaborate more sophisticated concept when you know how to use words or sentences in a logic way.
my high school was called "classic high school" in opposition with scentific high school.
i didnt learn specific and practic arguments as math, phisic or geometry but i learnt to think.
during my university time, at the architectural school in Milan,  i found out how much was true my professor's statement because i didnt get any problems to study really difficult arguments as math, structure, calculation, etc. because my mind was able to process every kind of data, even if they were different from what i studied at the high school.
for this reason i think it's really important for every student, with every kind of personal background and goal, to understand and to learn how to understand ideas and concepts instead of just merely learning facts.
when you are able to understand an ideas or a concepts you can approach these things with a critic view, elaborate them and creating a personal view about them, and not just learning facts without understanding why they happend, wich reason generated them.
for students' future is the most important thing and understanding ideas and concepts will give them specific skills to approach every kind of problems in life.
