I disagree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more important than facts for students. Actually from my point of view, facts are the same important just as ideas and concepts.

First, without facts, how come the ideas and concepts?  Ideas and concepts can not be separated from facts. For example, when we learn the concept of force in physics, students need to do experiments to be aware of the fact that there are different kinds of force everywhere in the world. The teacher will confuse the students if he or she just draw a simbol and point it to them, then say" Look, it is what we call force". By doing this, the teacher is at the rick of being fired.

Second, students should not just get the ideas and the concepts but also know the detail facts in order to pass the exams. For example, in a exam of a biological course, students should remember the exact examples of animals in order to describe the progress of reproduction. I can not image a person can write down all the materials the teacher want without any facts. Although there may some exams which allowed students to take books with them, remembering the exact facts benifits the students pretty much, because ttey can save the time spent on referring to the books.

Third, students should learn facts in order to find a good job in some cases. For example, I major in computer science and it involves a lot of programming. The mathematical concepts and ideas do help me learn theories of computer. However, It is the time when I tried to find a job that I realized that facts such as the parameters of the computers do me a big favor to find a job as a programmer.

In conclution, while ideas and concepts are important in learning, facts are of the same weight to students.
