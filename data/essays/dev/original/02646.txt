It is often said that tour guide with many people is the best way to travel because it is cheap and safe. However I strongly disagree with this opinion. This is because that feeling satisfaction through the trip and spending time well. 
   First of all, people have to be satisfied with their trip. People usaully want to see, hear, eat, and feel what they want and have wanted when they are travelling. However, in a group tour, people cannot experience whatever they want because they have to follow their guide. For example, when I went to Paris for trip alone I unwillingly took part in a guide tour one time to go to museam. Because museam entrance fee is cheaper for group. Unfortunately, I did not have satisfaction with the guide tour for museam, because there were so many people, so I couldn't see all of them what I want to see and couldn't get much information what I expected.
   In addition, traveling individaully is better at spending valuable time. Time cannot return or use again, so it is very important how to use time. However, in a group tour, it is easy to waste people's valuable time. To demostrate, according to the research at Harvard, individual trip spend time two times more effectively than grop tour. Moreover according to this studying, people who travel individually is also more satisfied with their time consuming and whole traveling. 
   In brief, the best way to travel is in a individaul, not in a group because making feel good during trip and well time consuming.
