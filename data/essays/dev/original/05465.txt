Last week I read an article in our daily newspaper about who enjoys life more, female or male. I considered about these piece of paper a very long time and came to the conclusion that it is more worth to distinguish between young and old people, than between female and male. But neverthelesse I am of mixed opionion concerning this question.

One the one hand, you might get the expression that young people enjoy life more than older ones if you observe from outside. But the onliest reason for that is, that young people live their life more active than older ones. They try new things, have fun whenever there is the chance to have and make their own experiences in order to develope a personality. Students for instance like to go to partys or hang around at the beach playing soccer because they know, that in later professional life they will not have the chance to act like that.

On the other hand older people have gathered a vast amount of experience during their life. Consequently they do no longer feel any pressure to act like younger ones. I believe that they also did have an active, excited life in their youth. But with a certain decrease in age, other things like family, health or financial sercurity become more and more important for them. So in my state of view, they simple have a distict way of enjoying their lifes. They get their satisfaction by going for a healthy walk in the park or having a cup of tea with their husband or wife in the nice restaurant next to the beach. Unfortunatelly these facts are invisble to people you observe from outside, so the wrong impression might come up that older people do not enjoy their life. 

All things recommended, I would state that neither the young nor the 
older people enjoy their life more.  Both group has its own way to enjoy their life. The youth often expresses more active while older people are satisfied by a calm and especially healthy life.
