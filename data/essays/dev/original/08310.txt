It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts. I agree with the statement for the following reasons, the importance of the capability to think logically, solve problems and to create future visions. The stated reasons are described in more detail in the following paragraphs. 

First a students needs to learn how to think logically in order to understand a problem that needs to be solved. Especially for study assignments as well as work assignments it is important to determine what is the unknown factor, that needs to be found. If the students is not able to do that, the result might not be the factor that was initially asked for. 


Second, if a student just learns facts instead of strategies to solve a proble the student  will not be able to apply the already learned knowledge to a similar problem. For instance the student knows how to calculate the revenue based on price per product times units sold but as soon as the units sold is unknown and the given numbers are the price for each product and the total revenue , the student will not be able to solve for the units sold. In order to solve the outlined problem it is important that the student learns the strategy to solve a equation for different unknowns. 


Third, only if a students understands the concept  and idea of for instance a certain product like a car only then will the student be able to create further developments of the already existing features. If the student only focuses on learning facts the student will always limit his knowledge and learing to already existing ideas. Thus, the student will not be able to come up with future visions which are vital in somone's accademical and professional carreer.  

In conclusion, the ability of a student to think logically, solve problems and to create future visions or developments of existing knowledge or facts is more important to me than learning the facts. It will enable the student to be sucessful in his or her study as well as professional career.
