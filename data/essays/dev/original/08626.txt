In my opinon, most advertisements are deceiving people by making products seem better. There are two specific cases of examples of tricks to present products much better: changing the look of the product by changing its color of its cover and changing its name to make it look like high quality.
	First of all, advertisements change the color of the products cover to attract the customers. Generally faded colors will make the customer think that product is made with an old technology, whereas bright colors deceive the consumer that it is made by high technology. For example, brighter pencils are generally preferred to faded-colored-pencils in Turkey. That`s why many advertisers force manufacturers to produce bright looking pencils to increase selling.
	Secondly, advertisers force the manufacturers to change product names of a specific product to increase the amount of products sold. In Turkey, that is usually done by giving a foreign name to that product instead of a Turkish name to trick the consumer. In this way, consumer may think that the product is a high quality product because some of the goods manufactured by Turkish industry lacks quality. There is a real case for this in Turkey. A-spagetti-producing-company changed its product name a couple of years ago and gave an Italian name to its product to deceive the consumer that it is an Italian product. Hence, they have increased selling their products. This is the way to present their products much better although it is same quality as before.
	To sum up, most advertisers make products seem much better according to some techniques listed above. Unfortunately,  
this techniques are becoming so widespread that consumer will unlikely encounter a product revealing its real quality.
