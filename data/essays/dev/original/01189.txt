"Half knowledge is always more harmfull then not getting it at all."
It is always important to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning from the facts. however one can always support ideas with the facts and figures of day today life. For a student the more knowledge one gets, the more beneficial it is.
If everyone will start practicing learning through facts then there won't be any room for the reserch to take place and people will stop showing interest towards the innovation and new things. for example the fact is that a school bus fetch kids from school to home whereas the idea and concept behind is to make their journey more comfortable,safe and enjoyable.
Understanding a subject in the depth is the basis of getting knowledge about it. its always good to support your idea with a fact but if the knowledge is totally based on the fact, then one has to make sure that it is complete and accurate
when my mother inlaw got admitted to the hospital every one knew that he has gone through a massive heart attack and the underline fact that everyone was stating was that she is old enough to survive. Me and my husband were more interested in knowing that how to take better care of her so that she should not have much complications afterwards, so the doctor took time out to explain us that how heart works in a human body.The impact of fat rich diet on blood vessels and heart and which may lead to the process of atherosclerosis, how heart has to do more work. after getting the concept cleared on the same, i think both of us are in a better position to take care of her and to discuss this topic with her and our family  .
I strongly feel that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts and its always advantageous to learn facts about the same so a combination of both is important
