I both agree and disagree this statement.
   On one hand, a broad knowledge of academic subjects is often, dare I say always, good to have. It is important for man to have a knowledge of many field as possible.  You as human being always want to learn more and, in University for instance,  one subject is not enough all. 
 I am currently a student. I study at la Sorbonne Nouvelle University which is the top university for foreign languages. I am majoring in both English and German but there are many other languages you can learn such as Spanish, Italian but also Arabic, Chinese or Hindi. After graduating from this university and this major, students often applied for jobs in commercial trade or International Business. In this context, the knowledge of many academic subjects is much more than useful. In the case of two graduate students applying for the same job in International Business, somehow I know that the one who has the knowledge of different foreign languages will get the post. My university is also famous for cinema, dramatic art, and communication and it is absolutely possible to major for example both in Foreign languages and in Cinema or follow theater classes.
   But on the other hand, I think that there is a time when students have to focus on what they really want to do and what the really want to be and then, according to it, try to get more chances as possible in order to sucess. For example, the knowledge of many academic subjects could lead students into confusion. they try to learn as many subjects often because they are interested in all sorts of fields and if you ask these students what they prefer for most or what  they would rather study if they would only have to chose one academic subject, they do not know. This fact can explain why a lot of students fail their first years of college. Most of university failures in France are cause of a mistake in the choice of majors which are cause of a bad information after the twelvth grade.
 I would say as a conclusion that it is always interesting to have a knowledge in as many field as possible but students have to focus on the main point which is success.
