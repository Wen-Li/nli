Nowadays, it is important in times of applying at a university to consider rather study generalistically or specify in a certain subject. Before applying students should take following aspects in consideration.

Firstly, it is often mentioned that being a specialist of a certain area makes it easier once you finished university to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organisation. However, having a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects gives you the possibility to apply for a wider range of job-ads. Being generalistically offers you a way to enter a company more easily. Once you are received the job you still can and you even have to, no matter being a specialist or a generalist, adopt to tyhe needs of the company you are working for.

Secondely, it is argued that specifying in a certain field does not take the same time as studying the basics of many different areas. To some limited extend there is some truth in it, but, undoubtely, experience shows that no metter what way of studying you have chosen the time until achieving a degree is the same. Nevertheless, doing a generalistical degree is in my point of view better than completing a specific degree that takes the same time. In other words your possibilities are much broader after the study time finding a job then they would only being specified. And the time you have spend remains the same.

To summarize, students first of all should be aware of the consequences when considering applying after they obtained a degree in a specific subject. Furthermore they should mistrust the rumour that studying with the objective to get a broad knowledge of many academic subjects takes the same time then it would achieving a specific degree.
