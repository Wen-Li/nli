I completely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are maily three reasons for my opinion. First, the advertisement agencies over-publicizes a product. This is particularly done in the case of a launch of a new product in a market. Since, no one has ever consumed the product, the companies have an added advantage of referring to their product as best in the market, without the need of any facts to proove it. It is, after the product launch, that consumers read reviews about the new product and realize its exact worth.

Another reason is that, most advertisements includes creative ideas,which entice various fantasies in consumers. The consumers start to believe that they might come true if they started consuming that product. Sheer curousity of consumer for that product, forces him to buy and consume it. It is shortly after that that the consumer realizes that he is not in any super natural state, which he thought to be in while consuming that product. This results in lost of trust of consumers in the brand.

Third,nowdays there is an increasing participation of renouned personalities in advertisements for various products. For example, a new range of nike sport shoes is being endorsed by a leading soccer player or a complete range of clothes being supported by a famous celebrity. As these famous personalities have a very large fan base over the world, it leads to incorporation of blind trust in these brands by their followers. Who want to be like their on screen idols in their lives. People does not even search for reviews on these products or at least consider the use of these products in their lives.

Advertisements should display appropriate contents in them,so that consumer is not mis-guided by their curousity. Products should consider this so that it may not result in loosing their brand name.
