After World War II, one of the bloody battles of history, a more pacifist communities appeared by the important and helpful assistance of international organizations. Since then, societies were naturally wanted to live in peace without any conflicts therein. Moreover, this perception was supported by economics and particularly 1980s was a significant corner for young people who were educated by their parents closely lived the damages of wars around the world. Hence young people started to feel themselves isolated from the society and their major purpose was the ocuupation and money making as much as they can. Nowadays, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. I complety agree with this statement because of several reasons. Young people want to enjoy their time before computer screen and video games and they wish to realize their career goals without paying attention to society.

No matter how the percentage is, it is obvious that young people love video games. An increasing number of video games are experienced and young people avoid from being with their family members, friends and even the members of community. Yet community handles various problems which are to be resolved without losing time. For instance, unemployment is a major event for today's societies. Young people appreciate  playing video games instead of searching for solutions to unemployment. Since young people are more energic and active, they can be involved in projects looking for solutions to unemployment.

Besides, young people are much focused on money making istead of fundemental social problems of community. It is doubtless that career golas are important for young people but major community problems would eventually effect the large numbers of individuals soon. In the last decade of 20th centuty, foundations played a great role in society because of their supportive function and weel organized structure as weel. Be that as it may, regard is to be had on the fact that a widely participation of young people led to this success at that time.

In a nutshell, I strongly believe that young people nowadays do not give enoung time to helping their communities. Probably it originates from  misleading of youngers both in school or family but whatever the reason is governments should definetely bring a detailed insight to this situation and product solutions otherwise whole of the society will encounter different problems. This is because younger people are those on whom the society is being built.
