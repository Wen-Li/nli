In my opinion i disagree with the topic about most advertisements make products seem much better than really they are.In this new global world and  era the companies try to reach so many people around world by the use of technology.But it can be sometimes harmful for the consumers who do not pay attention.

	Firsty of all there are too many ways to attract consumers about the product.We can use internet, tv, radios, by giving advertisements.All of them are effective.by using a famous footballer or model you can increase  the popularity of the product.On the other hand, the companies use cameras and light illusions to show the product more attractive. Also this method can be used for showing the big one as a little and the slow one as a huge one.An addition to this mechanisms the advertisment given on tvs or internet are repeated so many times in order to persuade and convice the consumers.this made pressure on the consumers to try the product.the last factor for me to attract the consumers about the product is its price.As we know if a product is cheap we always think that it is the best suitable one for us.It i a quite wrong stetement in fact.Thus the companies know this situation and use it as a most well known weapon.

	In spite of the stated facts below, there are also some advertisement reclects the obvious and fair appearance and usage of a product.In such kind of situation we can try to companies mark on it.For example some marks like bmw, general electrics, lcw are most well known producers so we can trust their product also advirtisements.


	Consequently, in our global and technologic world all companies try to take a role in world trade and make much more money.Furthermore we can say thet worlds management is related with some big companies. So the smaller ones try to be in this huge budget.And also they can do everything to get this even they force the countries to begin a war.Attractive  products to convince people are an easy piece of cake for them.
