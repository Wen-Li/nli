Successful people tend to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
      why I used "tend" above is that that is a possiblility, not an absolute solution for the successful people, otherwise the answer should depends on how to define "successful people" and how do successful people success?  If success means money, and someone who are called successful people comparatively, but not a real money bag like BIll Gates, there is no absolute answer for success. However, even in that case, the possibility for the success is consistently changing up to definition of success or how much are they successful.
      Apparently, the possibility for success are given to the people who are willing to try something new. Because in the fields that have been well-known benefit makers. many people have already taken their benefits from that, not much things other people can gain and it could be called as monopoly. It's like fossil fuel depletion. Small part of the world are still taking big gain from the fossil fuel, there is no chance to get entered in that industry, because that fileds are already full with prior property. In a given situation like their DNA, such as their looking or how they are smart,  like how much money do they get from their parents, the possi ble way to improve their possibility for success is to challenge to uncovered world.  Even though they are having the risky business which is originated from itself (becuase it's new!) the people who only doing what they already know how to do well cannot easily catch up with those people who try to do something new and their great-great success rather than great or just success.
      I am aiming great-great success like I wrote above, what i require to get the goal is to improve my credativity, to be enough creative to find something new and explore it. There is a word in my country "If the water is stuck in one place, those will be decayed."
