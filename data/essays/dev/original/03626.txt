It is true that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. If we look at the youth around us, we find them to be self occupied. They are busy with their own life.
The youngsters are living a life that is all about their own dreams, their own happiness and their own whims. Gadgets, friends , movies, discotheques, pubs and other such things are taking them away from their families and the community.
If they are not having fun, then, it is the increasing pressure of studies that keep them inside their homes after the school hours. Their studies and the stlye of the present school curriculum makes sure the the students are studying continuously. 
The curriculum of most of the educational institutions is designed to give theoretical knowledge to the students. Lack of practicals takes away the chance of any external exposure from the student.
Apart from studies, the lack of interest in extending a helping hand for the matters related to the communities can also be observed amongst the youngsters. They are becoming a bit self-centred. For them its- ME FIRST. Everything else becomes secondary for them.
Another reason for their non participation can be traced to the fact that they do not understand the importance of joint familes and thus the concept of loving and sharing is a little alien to them. Earlier, the joint familes kept the people together. They were more tolerant, more caring and had better understanding of the importance of community. But, the concept of nuclear family has taken away the element of 'together we stand' away from the youth.
Last month, the Mumbai blast rocked the whole nation and questioned our unity and security both. The terrorirsts involved were young boys. And if we look at the people who had come to help the victims then we find out that they were not the youth but the middle aged or old people.
It is not that all the youngsters are unhelpful but yes the majority is far too self centred to come out and give time to their community, to think of its well being. Apart from this, their modern values, their distance from religion, their shyness, etc are also playing a role in their behaviour.
At times, the thought that what can a single man do keeps them away from helping others. They need to understand that they have the power to dream and change the world. They just have to take a step forward.
It is high time that they realise that the community needs them as much as they need the community. Their survival and development is dependent on the community of which they are a part. Their involvement will do lots of good to them and to their community as well.
