Advertisements penetrate into every aspects of our lives conveying messages that a particular product is superior than the other or try to forge a need to buy a particular item.  In order to realize this goal, they represent the product far superior than it really is.   Hence, today the image of the product exceeds the practicle use of it in terms of importance and its practicle use.

What advertisements offer is therefore a status remark and a definition for a person's identity.  The item describes the its owner in the particular way that the advertisements load them with.  For example, a diet coke is never just a simple drink that would cut back your thirst or accompany some food.  Rather, it is an item that turns its consumer into someone attractive, lean and one that know how to live well.  Even the label that your pencil bears on it would transmit a message about who you are just just because the advertisements' way of representing it.  You can be a hardworking and determinant indiviudual or even someone rebellious.

In this sense, I agree that advertisements render products much better than they really are.  They shift their practicle meaning into a sign for your personal idnetity and status.  Thus, they sell not just the item item itself but also the message it entails.  In this context, you do not pay a considerable price for a basic item but for something that respresent.
