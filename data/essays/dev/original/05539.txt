It is often believed that young people enjoy life more than old people, due to several reasons, which, in my opinion, are related to the availability of time and other physical and mental resources, such as enthusiasm. I believe that this view is, in some way, incomplete, although not entirely wrong. 
The incompleteness of the view, is given by the fact that old people are people with experience. This means that they can assess values to certain actions on the basis of their past experience. They know what to do in order to enjoy certain positive feelings, as well as they know what to avoid. This means that people, once they become old, have all the necessary resources in order to exploit their knowledge on themselves, and hence collect the fruits of their lives as young people. In addition, although some people believe that money does not make happiness, old people are more likely to have money to spend for themselves, making them enjoy life in more ways. This would imply that you start to enjoy life only at a certain age.
However, there is the opposite pont of view, which is the one of the statement. Young people, or at least most of them, do not have many things to worry about. It is up to their parents to control and administer the so called `dirty work`, whilst they are free to grow up. This shows that people, during the early stages of life, have plenty of time to dedicate to themselves, to the discovery of new things. If it is true that old people know what things they like and what they don`t, with the advantage of not having to experiment anymore, it is also true that youngsters have the possibility of going through the process of discovering, which is probably the most interesting and fulfilling of all, as it gives you the opportunity of knowing new things and experiencing new feelings, which were previously unknown. For example, people usually remember their first kiss, rather than their last.
In conclusion, I would say that life can be enjoyed at every stage, when you are young and when you are old, although in different ways. The first period of life should be dedicated to discover what you like and enjoy, whilst the last should be dedicated to the exploitation of such discoveries.
