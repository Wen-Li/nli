  In the last century a large number of people get education to have a good situation on their own lives. I am inclined to believe that students must understand the reasons and abilities of their educated lives. Students who get lesson form a professor want to get lots of information that the professor has and it is depend on the understanding of the ideas and concepts of the professor. Regardless to say that students during the education lives should understand the ideas and concepts of their information that they get from their professors.
    First of all students who get the lesson from a famous professor should get information of him and they can get their surveys and experiments. After that they understand what he did in his own experimental lives and his ideas and expectations of their work. So in the lesson they can get losts of information from him.
     Secondly students who want to work in a survey must think about the concept of the survey. Survey depends on a long time and it is very hard for some people because of their character. Although people who want to create a experiment must be able to wait for a long time. When the students wants to work in a survey they must learn about the system that they use and after that they can be an experimental people from these kind of surveys.
      Taking everything into account in the light of the above started reasons understanding of the ideas and concepts of an information is for the students very significant and when they get the ideas and concepts they can earn lots of benefits which can be used for their own lives.
