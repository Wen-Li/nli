Always is better to understand facts.

As student, I really think it it easer for us to understand a topic by using examples and learning facts.
When students just see the concept in class or the definition about something it's dificult to them to rebemeber it just as they saw it in class, but if they see an specifically case about the same concept it will be easier to keep it in mind, because they can relate it to the real life.

For example, last semester  in my human reasources class I had a teacher that always helped us to relate the theory with the practice, I remember one class where we saw what an interview was and in what consisted, and she took a classmate to make him an interview explaning all the steps we need it to do to make it right, and showing the most common mistakes that we could commit.

I remind it was so enriched for everybody in class, and after that when I entered to my fist job, I could rememeber everything I had learned and I took it to the reality.
When we learn facts it also helps us to convey it with our own  experiences. 

On the other hand, I have had classes where we get full of concepts and definitions of some subjects but we really don't know how to put it in practice and I do think all this information goes away.

In conclusion, to learn in a classroom or out of it will be always better to usderstand facts and to related with reality, and also it will be easier for us to explain and to teach somebody else, because we have already absorbed this infomation, and proffesors should do this with the students since they are kids to provide them an important tool to learn better.
