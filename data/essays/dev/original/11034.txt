Young people now a days do not spend enough time to help their community. 

I agree with the statement that most of the young people of the present generation do not show any kind of intrest to spend atleast little time of their valuable time. Its only because people now a days are enagaged with many thing about themselves that they dont have time to think about the community.

Young people , considering from shcool age to a person who is working or into a bussiness has got his own tensions.Once when he is back from his daily routine work he is tired and wants to spend some time in front of the TV or relax for some time.But he hardly thinks about his communtity or rather about himself.
Comparing to past, our  ancesstors and grand parents  were always concerned about their family as well as their community. Though they had very less facilties available  they made best out of it .With thier communication and interaction with people in the society where as a person of today dosent have time to go and meet his old friends or his relatives atleast. 

I think people should be tought to learn about their society and other peple who are living with them in the society so that he can directly look at the people who are no having any facilities and sleeping on the roads so that they make out little of their time and money to protect them and care for them.

I would like to share one of my experience, when i was in my college i saw a man who met with an accident lying on the road with blood flowing, none of them showed any concern to take him to the hospital....as they were busy tied up with their own works and that they cannot spend liitle time for that old man bcause of which we all had to see him  dead on the road. I think such things should not be repeated.Every person should involve in the community help the community in one way or the other as much as he can . this shows his concern for the people and helpiing nature.

Right from the scratch they should be tought about morals and about society, patriotic people, one who learns morals  never tries to neglect his society. And every person should take their time in helping the communities. 

I have seen many old age people who do a lot for the community, the place where i live we dont have medical services for us for which our area people who were all 55 yrs old grouped together and made a request to that area HEAD that we are  in need of a hospital which can help us in odd times for children and people living in this area. They have taken the risk for the community but people who are young were least bothered about this issue as they were much worried about their careers and settlement rather others they were selfish with thier behavior.

I think every individual should take part in doing something for the society this gives him nothing but self satisfaction which is more than anything for a human.
