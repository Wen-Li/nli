In my point of view, I am diagree with the statement, and these are my reasons.
	First of all, because of different ages, people enjoy their life in different ways, but it doesn't mean older people donnot enjoy life. For example,Compare with younger couples, instead of drunk and dance like mad. older couples are like to go to travel together and to recall their honeymoons. Even thoungh it looks pretty boring for younger people, but those moments are  significant in the older people's life. So older people actually know how to enjoy their time more healthy and more meaningfully.
	Second, there are lot of things that older people can also enjoy, such as younger's favor things-- parties, clubs, and gem. Older people like to go to somewhere that more quiet than the party rooms but they do enjoy dance with their lovers and share their special beauties to the one who is  important for them. And also they love to go to club to know more people and friends. For example, my grandmother luses to go to parties and have fun with her friends.
	Third, here is one thing that younger people cannot undertand and enjoy but older people loved-- garden works. younger people assum that garden works are only for grandparents for their extra times.But actually it is not true, garden works is another way that show how much the older people enjoy lifes, because of time goes by very fast, so the older people enjoy the moment that when their flowers grew up, or their apple tree has little apples and so on. Because they undertand the joy to creative life and in order to enjoy life.
	Therefore, in my opinion. older people know how to enjoy their life and even better than younger people. They won't do anything damage for their heath, they won't do any childish things that bad for the communities. They have their living styles that provide for better living standards and qualities. So these are the reasons why I am disagree about the statement.
