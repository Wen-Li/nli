I strongly disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do.  There are several reason what I have.
Young people is a process to old.  We should save money for our old lives.  There are a lot of young people who study in college or university or career institute.  They are trying to improve themselves' ability because they want to get higher career and pay.  Young people are healthier than old people and more flexible to get new information.  So they can get more chance to get a job and earn money.  Imagine that if you should work and earn money although you are so old.  It is very hard to old people.  I know two people that would be good example for this topic.  One man was worked very hard and saved money during he is young.  So several years later, he married and he bought a beautigul house and he could spend enough money to educate his children.  However another man didn't save money and didn't work hard.  He enjoyed his youth.  He drank beer with his friends and bought expensive clothes and bought a expensive gift to give to his girlfriend.  So several years later, although he married, he still has lived rent house.  Of course, we can enjoy our life during we are young.  I'm not talking about that enjoying life during youth is bad.  A lot of new experience, and traveling are important to young people.  However, we need to more improve ourselves during we are young.  There are some cartoon about two kind of insect.  Ant worked very hard for summer, so he could enjoy his life and rest for cold winter.  In constrast, another insect just enjoyed and sang a song in the tree for summer.  Conwequently, he couldn't eat anything during cold winter.   Think about it.  Isn't it easier that young people try to study and earn money?  Young people are healthier and more enthusiastic than old people.  
When we get old, we should take a rest and enjoy our left life.  To enjoy our old life, we should save money.
