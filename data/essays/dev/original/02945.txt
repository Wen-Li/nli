In general, young generations enjoy their life more than older generations do. This is because young people have knowledge or skills to adopt now. Older people are difficult to do that. But, the older people had the time to adjust world, and they must have enjoyed at that time. So, I agree that young people enjoy life than older people do.
    In fact, I am in yong generation right now. I, of course, enjoy my life. Going to school, exrcising body and exploring new world are all enjoyable for me and other young people. For doing them, pioneer spirits, health bodies and motivation for getting new things are required. However, it is heavy tasks for olders. Among them, some people are still have those powers, but most people tend to be less motivated. For example, my grandmother does not want to do anything except for her rutines which are to take care of household or talking to only similar people in days. One time, I asked her to travel with my family. But, she refused even if she was very healthy. She just did not want to leave her house and nomal enviroment she spent with. 
    On the other hands, we young people do not be afraid of new life or enviroment because we have a lot of dreams for new world. It makes us more enjoyable than the olders. I think that the olders ought to have interests to enjoy their life. It might help them to suit society and public. If they do not do that, only thing they have is that they spend rest of their life unhappy or boring. To avoid this situation, they should try to have interests.
