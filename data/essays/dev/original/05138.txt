	I don't think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. I would say that they might convey that kind of illusion because they can take more benefit from the life than older people do but it doesn't mean that they enjoy life more.  

	First of all, I would say that young people want to discover the world before all. Indeed, the older people are aware of the world which is surrounding them. They have already experienced most of the feelings a person can undergo or simply feel. The young people want absolutely to try new things, to experience other feeling. 
	On the other hand, they are actually younger, that's true. So they can take profit of everything, do some very physical sports that an older person couldn't do, they also are faster. Everything has to be quick, it's because we want to discover other things.
	I take part to that phenomenon, I'm young but nevertheless I don't think that I enjoy life more than my parents. They take profit of the life in a different way. As an example, they travel, that I can't do on my own because I'm financially dependant to my parents. So I do other things, I do outings with my friends, I do as every adolescent  does. 
	However, this speed with which we execute our activities may lead to a missunderstanding of the situation. Except the old people who can't do almost anything because they are too old, and the depressive persons who aren't feeling in doing activities, all the people enjoy life the same way. The reason is that we've got only one life and it would be without interest to spend that life in doing anything.

	As a conclusion, I would say that I disagree with the statement of the issue and I think t everybody enjoys the life
