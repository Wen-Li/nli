There are some people young people how do not give much important in helping their communities,they preoccupied in their own world .They get enough time in doing all the other work and for helping for their communities they will run away,and these are the people after sometimes are the ones who will be living in the same community.They should be remembering only onething that if today they dont help their community,there will be a day where you need some help from them and on that day nobody will be their to help you.If we are not ready to help ourself no one will help as .
  

When we are leaving in a common place and we have to learn to help eachother,by this we can leave without any troubles .If we leave like onday day will come were their wouldnt  be any problems in the world.By this we could leave as aonecoplete family,this what we all need to do ateleast try to help eachother,and i think this happening  for ex if we take globalisation is the medium through which we are comming to one place and all rich countries are helping the poor countries  in a way they could this an example for their are people who are will to hep.

We cannot also say that young people are not helping their community their some young people who are creating awareness among different sectors of people of the importants of helping one another.They are forming groups and forming communities for those who are in need of help.

So this suggest that their are a section of young people who are willing to help other people and communities,but the percentage of these people are less  and we need to increase this habbit and make sure that everybody inculcates this practice.
