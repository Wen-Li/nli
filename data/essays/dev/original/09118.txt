It is important to know both the ideas and concepts as well as the facts. Of cource the ideas of a topic or a problem makes it easier to understand and to remember it but it takes much longer to be taught this concepts. So sometimes it is easier to learn only facts even if they are dry and boring. It depends on what you have to do with the information, wether if you have to write an assey about that or if it  is just for your own general knowledge. To know facts is sometimes important when you are talking to or discussing with other people. To show them in a short time that you have a big knowledge about different subjects, you will need facts. 
To come back to the ideas and concepts I can say that if you have a big interest in something it is not enough just to know about the facts. Also for yourself you want to know more and understand the whole thing. If you have exams in this topic, it is much easier to answer the asked questions because you have the background. 
For myself I prefer to learn ideas and concepts. I am studying and at the university it is very important to understand the problem. The exams are very difficult and hard. So if you are not prepared and only know the facts, you are lost. But sometimes if I read the newspaper or watch TV, I try to remember short facts. Usually I do not have the time to read about every topic too long so I just remember the most important things. After that I know what other people are talking about, not at all but I can understand the problem or topic because of the learned facts. To sumerize I would say that ideas and concepts are important to know when it is your cource or work. But facts are good to know for social relations.
