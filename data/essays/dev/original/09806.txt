Currently, the issue "Young people enjoy life more than older people do" is  debated by numerous educationalisties and scientist. In my personal points of view, I prefer yong people enjoy life more than older people do. In this essay, I will explain personal points which base on previous examples as well as specific reasons.

Firstly, Yong people spend much more time than old peole in entertainment aspect, such as TV, computer games and sports. 
In one hand, yong peole is the major resouces of world entertainment industry. Old peole trend to stay in theri world, doing theri personal hobby which not prefer to communcate with each other. In the other hand, old people don't have enough energy for enjoying lives due to theri age. However, the situation of young people is totally different, the have enough energy for playing outside and enjoy theri lives. They trend to play each other and communications.

Secondly,  Yong people are much easier to accept fashion things than old peopele which are the base of enjoying lives. For example, Young people like playing outdoor with skateboards which are the newest fashion sports in the world. Old people cannot accept this kind of sport due to security. Therefore, old people would not access this area of sporting for enjoying theri lives. The attitudes on new things are the majoy problems. So, old people trend to take simple and easy traditonal games in theri lives.

In addition, most of old people prefer staying at home rather than playing outdoors. However, yong peole choose outdoor activities 
as theri favourite. In current tome, outdoor activities are the main 
entertainment in the world. Thus, numerous old pelople who trend to staying at home with out outdoor activites will lose theri chances for enjoying theri lives significantly.

In conclusion, yong people like different types of entertainment and also accept more fashion things than old people. As a result of these situations, yong peole enjoying more life than old peole.
