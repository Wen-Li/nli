Advertisements , many factories and companey make advertisements to let the people know about their new products and sometimes they say true thing about it's products and sometimes wrong , so how we can know the ture ?
 
       first of all , we can know if this product is good or now by asking people who try it . For examply , if you cousin see on the TV an advertisement about a machine that is useful , let we say that it is a sport machine , as we know in the TV they will say a lot of thing about it that will let the people like it and buy it without wondering how much does it cost , so your cousin bought it . Then you hear about this machine and you are wondering if it is good , because if it is good you will buy it , so you make up your mind to ask your cousin about it , but unfortunatly he/she told you that it is not good , and it broke from the first day . So when you heard this , surly you will decide not to buy it , so it's a way to know if the product that you hear about it in and advertisement is worth to buy it or no.


        Second , if you really like a product that you saw in an advertisement , why don't you buy it ? .. you won't lose anything , try it , perhaps it will be better than you thought , everthing is possible , but be sure of what you are doing , and try not to lose so much money in things that you don't need , just but the things that you really need .

      to sum up , advertisements will be useful in many times , because it will let you know new products that you have been searching for it for a long time then you will find it in an easy way . so you should be up to date with new advestisement because sometimes it's good.
