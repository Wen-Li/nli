For as long as this sophisticated society has existed, people have debated which advertisements effectively work to attract consumers. Although this issue may never resolved to everyone's satisfaction, the matter is very clear in my mind: I disagree with this statement. Many advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are.

     That not all advertisements success to attract consumers is evident for several reasons. To begin with, some advertisements discourage people to purchase the products. To illustrate, in many countries, the advertisements of tobbacos have warming sentences on them. When I traveled in Australia, I detected that even the photos of lung cancers were used in the advertisements. In this case, the advertisements warn us the possibility of danger that is caused by using the products. Indeed, the advertisements of tobbacos do not makes products better. 

     Furthermore, some advertisements utilize an unique strategy to attract consumers. For example, Yukiguni-maitake, Japanese  food products company, uses the conspicuous strategy: Its advertisement says that do not buy its products. This advertisement is unusual, therefore, many consumers are attracted and finally buy the products. In view of this, the advertisements sometimes apply unique strategy which does not appeal merits of the products. 

     Nevertheless, some critics claims that the advertisements' role is to appeal the products. However, the fact, as detailed above, reveals that some advertisements try to prevent customers from buying their products.

     In conclusion, I believe that the advertisements usually use different strategies to attract customers. It is clear from my examples.
