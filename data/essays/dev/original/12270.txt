Getting success is not an easy job in any field. You need to work hard and struggle for what to wish to achieve. People who have succeded in their work try to to make new things and take risks as success gives them a boost to excel in thier field. 
  Once a person is successful in achieving his target he will try out new things and would like to explore more and more in the same filed and to apply in various other fields. Consider an example of Sir Issac Newton. If Sir Issac Newton would have just stopped his theory of gravity after its discovery then many things would have been undiscovered till now. He applied his theory in the field of mathematics, physics, science to name a few. Just think if Sir Issac Newton would have stopped taking risks and searching for new principles and theories then advancement would not have been possible. The laws would have been at the receiving end. One more great scientist to name will be Einstein. He proposed the theory E=mc2, the theory of relativity. He started using the concepts in his surroundings which stunned the entire world. These great mens did not stop after achieving their targets but used their success as the tool to find out various new things.
   If the person who is success and does not wish to explore the field of his interest then the success will be of not much importance. Doing what which is known can be done by others too but implementing it can be done only by few, who assume their success as the strength to discover what is not known. Being wise is good by applying your theory in a different manner but to get success you need to implement  your theory in various fields.  
   Successful people will always make an attempt to make new things and take risks. They will never make their success as the ending point of research or work. Success is not the end.  Keep on trying and taking risks will surely benefit even though you might not get success on each and every step you choose to take.
