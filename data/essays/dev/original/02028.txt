This assey is going to accomplish and reply to the question.
Do I agree or disagree to the statement, The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid.
From my point of view i disagree. I am supporting to travel in a small group, alone or just accompany by my girlfriend.

Their are several reasons to confirm my opinion.
At first your are not depending on a timetable the guide offered. 
I`d like to plan my traveling on my own. If you stay at a beautiful place, you can keep staying and not to move forward with the group.
Within a group there are alway different point of views, some would move faster and some like to stay. You are not flexible.
Further a guided tour is always more expensive then a own organized tour. And anyway, with the new internet time and the research possibility, you can find all relevant informations in the internet or guid books like lonely planet gives also all necessary information about sight, cities and historical backround.
As per own experiences you meet a lot of different people from all over the world during the journey. This experience is sometimes more important than the sight itself.  You can also get lots of information from other travelers. 
Guides are usually visit most famous places and this places are most likely very crowded. 

In a nut shell, i`d like to be more flexible and save money. You never know wheter you like a particular place or not and to spend money to stay at a place I don`t like to only because of a groups decission, this sounds not realy like holiday.
To plan the journey is also a very beautiful experience I
