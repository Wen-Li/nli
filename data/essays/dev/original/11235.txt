The real cliche advertisement is the one in which a beautiful young woman is eating a great yogourt in a terrific place such as a nice desert island. Indeed very often the advertisement makes the product seem much better than it is actually.

This is really true when we talk about advertisement for goods such as food, cars, clothe... Hoever it is not really the product that is shown as much better than it is but rather what is around the product. Apparently you always need a cute girl, a handsome guy or a vaste shiny house to make sell a sausage or o Tshirt. So it is more the stuff inconsciously linked to the product than the product itself that is shown as better than it really is.

Nevertheless in some cases the product is not shown as better than it is. In particular when it is an advertising not on goods but on services. For example the advertisments sensibilising on the security on the road, or the ad concerning lending money in a bank or concerning insurances. In those cases the advertisement is more serious and there are less lies.

All things considered I agree that very often the y, butit is not the least surprising and ;ost people are aware of it. The goal is to create a need and to increase the sells.

In a nutshell i would say that aadvertisment is trying to make products seem much better than in the reality but it is oftently true for goods and less for services. But so;eti;
