Who enjoys life more, young people or older people? In my opinion, I tend to say that older people enjoy life more. 
First of all, older people have much more leisure time than young people.  As older people have already worked for a long time, they need not work so hard as young people. They need not struggle so hard for survival as young people do. As a result, older people have more leisure than yound people. With more leisure time, older people can travel, can have holidays with their families, and can do other activies. Imagine what young people are doing when older people are enjoying their life. Students at universites may be busy with writing their assigments, cramming for exams. Those who have jobs may be doing extra work in the office. How miserable they are!
Secondly, older people have more money compared with young people, making them lead more comfortable life. As older people have worked longer time than young people, they earn more money and have more savings, which can make them afford long distance travel to Paris, to Rome, or even to space, depending their financial ability. However, young people can only enjoy the short trip and some hikings. Though no one can deny the interest that short trip and hikings can bring,  they can not be comparable to those brought by the the romantic travel abroad. 
Thirdly, older people can manage their life better than those young people due to their longer living and social experiences. Older people know what is most important to them. They know that enjoyment of life, instead of making money or working  is more important to them. They know the value of being together with their family members, so they try their best to accompany their wife or husband. On the contrary, according to my knowledge, most young people do not realize what is important to them. They make every possible effort to make money and grasp every chance to get promoted in their working place, neglecting the happiness of being accompanied and accompanying their family members. 
In conclusion, I think that older people enjoy life more because they have more time, more money, and they can manage their life more efi.
