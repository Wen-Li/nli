Depending on personal experience, personality type and emotion concern, different people have different ideas about  which people enjoy  life most.Some people   think  that  young people enjoy life more than older people do. While others  do not agree. In my opinion I think young people do enjoy life more than older people do.Yes, older people may have more money, more experiences, but can not make the time back. But for the young, everything in the world is new and fresh, so they can have plenty time the expercience and enjoy the life more than the older people.
First of all, the young people have plenty time and passion the study the new konwledge and every  thing  that just happen in the world.By this way, they can stay in fashion and enjoy the life more,You see,according the suvey maded by the China Daily, few of the people older than 50 using computer to work and communicate with others, which is a more money-saving and interesting way to do things.So we must say that it is the young can enjoy the life more
Second lly , I think the young people have more time and energy to have funs. They are young and strong, they can have a lot of great activities that the older people can have.In this ways, we can see that theyoun people can have more entertamians. I am a young  girl now,and I think I can do every thing if like, I am planing to travel around  the world someday in the future.See I think few older can have such a dream. and in this way, I would to say, yound people do enjoy life more than older people.
Addtionally, young people usually healther than older people. There is famous old saying in China,Health in the basic of everything you want to do. and because young  people  have strong body, they can enjoy the life more than older people.
