          First of all, you can find very good tourism places. For example, if you go to any city and you don't about it any thing if you have a tour guide, he will show every thing. In addition, he has more experience than you because his city. There is no tourism can know your city more than you.
          Second, you will never get lost that mean you will not lose more time. As an example, I and my friends went to Los Angles, and we don't know anything about this; however, we lost 3 hours looking for our hotel. On the other hand, if we had a tour guide, we wouldn't lost all that time. 
          Third, get yourself away from dengerous places. every huge city has dengerous places, if you don't where are they, you will but yourself in denger. For instance, there are many crimes these days, you have to be becarful if you to city is not your city, but if you with a group and you have a tour guide maybe is better for you.
