Well its a kind of statement that can be made just to encourage kids to learn more and new things in their life. But as the saying goes that "All that glitters is not gold" the same can be applied to successful people as well. The fundamental cause of this problem is not in the people we talk about, but its within us. It is because we always measure a successful person only when his/ her work achieves more recognition / fame and or money and that he/she is really worth something which most of us are not. Thus its very hard to judge and measure success in terms of money or fame or recognition, as for him its just a task he wanted to accomplish for himself.
Lets consider a sport say soccer. We know that some of the players do play very well compared to rest of the players of that game, but in reality they only play those games which they practiced for years without having to gain success in other games. The very same way we cannot just say the founder of microsoft has been a very successful person as he did not do any thing apart from being in the business of providing software for computers. I wonder how much of knowledge or expertise he would have in the area of mining, the same would be the case in the designer ware and clothing segment of business.   Interestingly there was an argument that walmart or the other chain stores should be considered successful people. I would opine against the people as well in terms of success as what they had been doing is that of selling.
I definitely would have said some peron successful if he would have achieved a good name and money in the area of selling, also gaining the same momentum in other areas such as manufacturing and in research. Thus I would rather say that some people remain successful even when they try new things.
