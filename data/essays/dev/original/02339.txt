we can always listen some old person that is not delight with the behaviour of young people. often old person says that young people are change, are very different to people of their time. these changes can be find in all aspect of our life. 
nowdays young people have always a lot of things to do, so i agree with the statement. nowdays young people have often  a very busy life. almost all people of 19-25 years go to university and sometimes they work too. infact work during the week is often a possible solution to resolve economic problems but at the same time it allow them to attent at school. then they play different kinds of sports, they want to go out with their friends they also want to have  time to relax at home. so  they do not have any time to helping their comunity or to do some social and useful activities. if i look for between all my friends i think that only a small part of them reserve part of their time to help comunities. i do not think that it's a right behaviour but i think it depends on our society also. the most important values of our society seem to be our carrer, to enjoy , to have a relaxed life.  most people do not consider to importance of helping people who live worse.
even if i recognized the importance of these aspects i can also say that it is very difficult, also for me, manage to concetrate on these kinds of people.  i do not have enough free time: i have to study, i have to go to university, i have to go to work in the weekend or i have to clear my house (i has been living alone for 3 years) and so if i have free time i prefer going to shopping, or to the cinema . i do not think this is a good reason but
