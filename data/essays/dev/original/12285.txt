I certainly disagree with the statement that "young people enjoy life more than older people do". I will explain my point of view along with some examples.

First of all this statement can not be generalized. There might be some young people that do enjoy their life more than some people that are older. Although I do not think this is connected with their age but more with a general attitude towards life. For example an older person could be more pessimistic than a younger person. But this person might have been more pessimistic througout his hole life, even when he or she still used to be young. 

I do believe that there is different ways of enjoyment and different areas that old and young people do get enjoment from. In my opinion this is connected to the differentent life spans people are in at different ages. Each life span, like the toddler `s, the teenager`s or the adult one, brings along different tasks. Let`s say a teenager does live more on the riskier side of life and does take drugs from time to time or have more liberal sex habits than an adult would practize, this might be due to his wish to experience independence or to define his own personality by testing his own and the society`s limits. That is a normal behavoiur for his age and role in our western society. In todays society a more liberal way of life and expression is often taken as a symbol for a happier life. This does not neccessary hold true. Some of these teens, asked about their amount of joy in life, might not be happy with what they have at all. On the other hand an older adult, living more quietly with his family and having a satisfiying job, might not look as happy at first but if asked migth show a quiet high level of life satisfaction. This so called joy in life could maybe better be described by the word happiness or life satisfaction.

Also another point is that there is a confusion between seeing the older people`s life style, that indeed might look a little boring an less enjoable to a younger person, as connected to their age. Even when the really old people of todaz were young their values were different to ours. Thez just continued living them until today. This is not boring for them, but to us it looks b
