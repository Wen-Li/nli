i think this is a general statement, and it is too difficul discussing about this without following in born tinks.
however, i disagree with this sentence. firs of all because i know many boys and girls that do not enjoy in their eveerydays life. they seem to need ever something else, they are not able to be happy for what they do. everything becomes a problems: the wedding, the childrens, the job. i recognize the we live in a difficult time, the politic affairs and the economic once are not very good, and also there is the war... but i ask to myself: what are the differences between the actual  and last times? my father tolk to me about the second world war, and also about the problems the he had had for finding something to eat end than the problems he had had to take a job. 
my father dead three years ago, but i think he enjoyned his life more than many young people.
i want to talk about another point: the wedding. i see that many people now prefer the divorce to the possibility to solve the problems. i do not understood very well this position. for me having a family is a way to get better our life, but probably i wrong because many people i know do not think in the same way. i want to enjoy living alon or goin out untill 5 or 6 a.m. so they refuse the idea to build a family untill they are 35 or 37 years old.
probably i am the firs person that does not enjoy enaught her life. i try every day to put passion and love in what i do, specially from the time  i live alone, now i have no fathter and no mother, but i see that if i am correct with other persons i am not alone.
