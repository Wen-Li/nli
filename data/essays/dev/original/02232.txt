some one has ver rightly said,
"it is not the destination that matters ,but it is the journey thats the real adventure"
it is not only the destination that you should enjoy you should also enjoy the fun of reaching there,which can only be done in a group.travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best possible way to travel.when you travel in a group you have more fun and you end up doing a lot of activities that you would not do if your travelling alone.

Man is a social animal and we always like it if we have some one to talk to and some one with whom we can we can share our emotions.when travelling in a group,you have this chance.for instance is you go to an old church  and you are in awe at its beauty and archetecural design having some one there with whom you can share these feelings always feels nice .

Secondly,having a tour guide is major advantage when it comes to travelling around in a new city.as the guide is famaliar with the city and the tourist spots in that city.he is the right person who can show you around the city and take you to the right places.if you were to do it alone it would take you hours just to figure out how to go from one place to the other.

Thirdly,travelling in a group is a lot of fun,as you are never alone and are always with some one ,playing chatting or doing something fun.also travelling with people makes you try new things which you would never do on your own.for example if someone in your group likes adventure sports,seeing him the other peole in the group would also get motivated to try their hand at it .you might never know
someone might actually turnout to be very good at it.

Thus we see that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is much more fun and adventurous.eventhough the tour guide might charge you some extra money,but he covers it up with the fact that he saves a lot of your time and helps you relax on your holiday as he is taking care of everything.travelling in a group helps you have a holiday in the true sense of the word and lets you enjoy to the fullest.
