Nowadys, there is a interesting thing that a lot new products are" young people". It  seems like young peopel may enjoy their lives more than the older generation. Every one has his own value about life and different values lead to a compeletely different way of life, so we can not say who enjoys himself better.
	Being full of experience, old people have a different thinking about the lives from the young people. some old people who survive from the second world war can understand how important the food or the money is, so in stead of wasting wealth on enjoying lives, they choose to lead a quite simple life. But they never feel their lives are borin.
	Second,young people have a strong willing to show their themself to attract a boyfriend or a girlfriend. In order to be popular, young people may like to stay in pubs and bars, they drink, dance and joke with each other. However amost all the older people  have already found an acompany, and fashion, cars are less important for them, even they do not want to live as the younger people. If it is not necessary, it doesn't make sense to the judgement that young people enjoy life better.
	In addtion, age may be very important in some culture. for example, older people can control the younger one in China or Kera.
In these country, age can influence many things especially when people is having fun. in these cultures, the society will provide more benefits to the old people. If Chinese people have a lot of food, the old one can obtain more. so it is not ture that young people can ejoy their life better within a less supply.
	In concusion, old people are equal with the young people, that is why nobody augre about that at all.
