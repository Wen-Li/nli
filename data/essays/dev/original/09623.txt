I definitely agree with the statement at hand. In fact, in my opinion, this is the main goal of education itself. Education should give to the students main ideas and concepts, things that the students can absorbe, make their own, and use as a basis for further education or even for their choices in life.
Facts are like evidence in a trial, things that support the main ideas and concepts. The students have to read the facts, understand them and, even more important, understand how the facts give an example or an explanation of the main idea. They are very important for the understanding process, but at the end they are notions, they are something specific that we learn at eventually we forget. On the contrary, what really lasts in our memory is the main idea, the concept and this is the very important thing.
The first example that I can cite is history. When we study history we study a large number of facts, dates, events, meaning that we learn a large amount of notions, that we are most likely going to forget in the future. But all these facts are necessary to understand what happened in a specific period and to analyze the causes and effects that took place in those years. The facts are the instruments at our disposal to build a broader vision of the period at hand and to have a general idea of the economical or sociological or religious forces that interacted in that historical moment. Even if we eventually forget the specific dates or facts, we still keep a concept, an idea of what was happening in the past.
Moreover I think that it is sometimes even impossible for our mind to store and remember all the notions and information we read. Computer databases are in fact very good instruments to store and retain information. Our mind, on the contrary, has the wonderful ability of elaborating information, putting them together and drawing conclusions, in form of main ideas and concepts. Again, we see what is really important: ideas and concepts.
In conclusion I definitely agree with the statement at hand as I demonstrated with the examples I gave.
