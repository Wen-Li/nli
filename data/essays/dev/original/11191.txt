Nowadays, people however their age, are selfish because of the values convey by the modern society and the capitalism values.

Indeed, everybody think about itself so young people have grown in this atmosphere of ''me and myself''.
The life goes fast and we want to pursuit and achieve our plans because today everything is planning per advance and their is no time for a civic behaviour. 
In addition, the globalisation and internationalisation make the population mix as their is more mixed communities people and there is an identication problem: which communities for which people?
Regarding to the recent events, communities are rivals and fight between them. So, their is no unity in this world why young people would change this by help who and with which means?

The modern life make young people very nacisic and selfish but some want to implicate themselves in a cause , in something they can progress and be usefull.
Some will help the oldest and desabled people in their neighborhood by making the shopping for them. Others will comme in an association to create a better life place for their community.
Indeed some association and organisation have social aim in which young want to be involve.

In my case, I really want to represent the Black in France because their is a lack of representativeness even on media, fashion, intellectual and scientist work.
So I went to Boucle d'Ebene association which promote African and Caribean entrepreuneurs even if I have my studies and different thing to manage before to help them.

To conclude, I agree with the fact that they is a lack of motivation by young people to involve themselve in social and civic activities to help their communities. In fact, they seem to be over booked by they stuff as school, work, friends, early child....
Indeed, nowadays young people have much more responsabilities than fifty years ago!
But the reality is that they is a lot of young which want to change some things in this world by giving time to helping their community.
However, sometimes they don't have the means to achieve their project as to create an association or a company and sometimes, they are dissuaded by the loss ricognition and credit they are given.
