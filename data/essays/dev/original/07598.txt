Advertisement is the product of highly sophisticated marketing techniques combined with the knowledge of the human psychology. Knowing how to advertise under these references makes it easy for companies to sell products that look very appealing but in actual fact are not their money's worth. Throughout the history of industries, stores and products there have been unthinkable numbers of faltey and bad products that have consumed the markets and their customers in a raid. 
For the famous company Apple who have produced and advertised an array of incredible products, there have been some along the way that were purely insignificant in contrast to their price. The first release of their Ipod was one of these products. When the Ipod was primarily released, the sales numbers hit a continuoes high that has not ended till today, but these "first year" Ipods were full of technicall errors. The Ipod batteries (that were concealed in the inside of the Ipod) broke after two weeks and lasted for an hour when they were maximum charged. Since the Ipod is one of the highest produced gadgets in the world, this problem occured with every Ipod within a few weeks of it's purchase. Second, the Ipod headphones that came with it, blew out after listening to music the music with the maximum volume on your own Ipod. This was a big issue, since this showed that the headphones were not designed accordingly.
Although all of these faults were known, the Ipod sales did not decrease because it was the most prestigious gadget to own at the time. The design and marketing strategies led by Steve Jobs (Apple's CEO) have influenced such emense groups of customers, from all ages to all places that the sales did not decrease. The fantastic and slik design contributed to this. The Ipod was three to four hundred dollers at the time and compared to other Mp3 players that were less expensive, it was not of higher standards and therefor not worth the money. 
The marketing strategies that evolve around the advertisments of new products exceeds the basic knowledge we have about a product and makes it look of higher standards than it is. The products therefor are sold at prices that they are not worthy of and therefor corrupt the average customers payments. It is unfair but at the same time the customers fault for not researching the products enough before they purchase them.
