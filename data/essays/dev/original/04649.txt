	The world is changed, also people are changed. Young people became more irresponsible, the world became more competitive and young people started not to care about things happening around themselves.
	First of all, young people are irresponsible to what they do. Young people are not helping the communities. We can't say, not at all. But it is reduced compare to long ago when it was 1900s, when the revolutions were occured. At that time the leading group was university students. But these days, those age people are harming and ruin the society. Since they don't have any difficulties such as coup de ta't, war, or revolution. They became addicted to drugs, crimes and other bad stuff. They are not responsible to what they did, especially for rich people when they make problem, they ask their parents to solve the problem. These irresposible acts by young people ruin the society more than pasts.
	Secondly, the world became more competitive. Since, the unemployment goes  high and competition rasies. Young people don't have time to help their own communities, besides community services which they have to do as a school works. Young people should spend their time more in the studying to get a job or to make their business bigger. Otherwise they will be buried from the society. For example, my country during the 1970s people who graduated universities could choose company where they want to work. But these days, even from the first rank universities can't get a job. The percentage they get a job was 77 percent. It means it will become harder and harder. Also, the competition will be more and more.
	Lastly, young people do not care about things happening around them. Young people became selfish because of the second reason. So that they became dull about other people's harshness and hardships. So when they see old people standing in the bus when they are sitting down. They rather ignore them or pretend sleeping. Young people don't want to involve other people's business, especially dangerous thing. When I was watching news program, I saw an interesting news that shows the survey. The surveyer asked people that when they see perverts in a crowded subway. Most of people answered they will ignore it. They think that that's not their business. 
	As time goes by, the world became harder to live. And lesser people are helping the difficulties in societies, even though the society becomes harder, I want to encourage young people to help their society. When they ask me why, I will answer that "you will see the different."
