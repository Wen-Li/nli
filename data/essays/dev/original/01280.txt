It needs people like Benjamin Franklin, who was risking his own life for the sake of science, when he used a parachute during a thunderstorm to study the characteristics of electricity, in order to enhance our technological but also philosophical understanding. There are countless examples of man in history who risked there own wealth or even there life to try out a 'new thing' in which they believed and put their faith. 
It is inherent to the human nature to strive for new knowledge and wisdom. But new knowlegde can only be gained by daring the step aside of the enlighted path and search in the darkness. Risk has to be accepted as a part of this search.
To become successful you need to distinguish yourself from the crowd and this also means to accept some risk. One possibilty to do so is by exploring new ways and, thereby, invent something new or develop new skills. Successful entrepreneurs, for example, are usually recognised as risk-taking people. Innovation is the result of their effort to become better and make things better. With their success the shape our economy and our society. It is people like Bill Gates who changed the world we are living in today; and he started in a small Garage, working on something people at that time might have called 'crazy' and 'useless'. He definetely tried a 'new thing' and that is wad made him very successful.
Another proof that success and risk-taking go together can be provided by the financial markets. It is taking the risk which pays off. But that does not necessarily mean that risk is uncontrollable. Information can be gained and used through personal effort to assess the quality of the risk. So to become successful it is also necessary to get informed, implying that one can not only do what he knows how to do well already but has to try 'new things'.
Acknowledging this, I have to agree with the given statement.
