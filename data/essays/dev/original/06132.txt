                            It is a fact that SUN only rises in the east and sets in the west.This fact if was just agreed by the people blindly than the world today would have been different.It is also a fact that an apple when thrown upwards always falls down.If this fact was also accepted blindly than Isaac Newton would have not known to the world.
                            There are enough facts that has been known by the present  world.To draw more facts the student first needs to study a particular topic,do research in that area and understand the basic ideas and concepts behind that area.It is only than that new facts could be stated.
                             Facts are just a single line statements that can be learned by anyone.In order to reach a postion it is for a student to learn the concepts.
