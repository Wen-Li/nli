I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
The people who develope an advertisement usually try to communicate a certain message which is supposed to make the product attractive to the customer. Everything that does not comply with this message is simply left out. Most of the time, the producers don't care about being truthful in that matter. Let's take cigarettes as an example. If the producers want to make cigarettes attractive to the customer, they will not talk about all the negative side effects, but instead they will focus on the advantages. They simply keep important information to themselves even though it might hurt the person who is going to buy the cigarettes. This way, the customer will be blinded by the positive attitude of the advertisement and will be led to believe that it would be good if he bought cigarettes.
This kind of commercial strategy is actually widely used in the promotion of food. Many companys want to make their products look healthy because nowadays many people try to stay slim. The advertisement producers answer to that need by developing the commercials in a way that will make the product seem healthy and good for fitness oriented customers. Usually they exaggerate certain ingredients which actually only make up a minor part of the product. Some commercials for example promote chocolate bars which include "a great deal of milk" even though there are merely traces of milk found in the product.
Another way to make customers buy a product is to appeal to certain images they have of themselves. Commercials for beer for example usually try to convey a sense of manlyness to the watcher. Men usually feel that this kind of beer will make them seem more rough and therefore more attractive to women even though the brand is not special in any way and does not differ much from other beer brands.
All those means are used by the companys in order to make more profit regardless of the effects it might have on the customers.
