In these days, people should consider a tour guide as a mark that guides lost people. I prefer to travel in a group that is led by a tour guide because i might find things easier and more comfortable.

While traveling to other country, the main thing that our family think about it is that how we will get to our appartment and who will take us to visit the places in the country. The tour guide is the one that will take us to our appartment or hotel, and he will gonna explain thing about the city ot the coutry because he is the son of his country.

Going with a tour guide made us learn many things, for example when we visited England we found many statues, parks,trees,trains and rivers. Each one of theses was explained clearly and accurately about its time and place and when did they found it and how long that it will exist, all that was known by the tour guide. we learned many things and we had more experience about this country.

Without going with a tour guide we may get lost. A tour guide is like a north star that guides lost people. Before few years, when we went to visit Australia we thought that we might not need to use a tour guide and because of that we had alot of problems and troubles. We were trying to find a park from evening until night and when we reached there everyone was lost.

In the conclusion, a tour guide is better to use because he guides lost pe
