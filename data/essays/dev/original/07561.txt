In my opinion, I agree that traveling with a group of people led by a tour guid is the best way to travel. There are several good reason why I agree with having a tour guid during the travel. First of all, when you will decide to go to a foreign country that you have not ever visit it, you will face some difficulties and a little bit of fear. All of these troubles that you will be faced because of the worryness and anxiety for this trip. Also, may be because you don't have enough required information about that country. So you need some one to help you about the places, shopping malls, good restuarant, lacation of some hotels and so on. According to these challenges, the bast way to keep away these trouble is to travel in a group led by a tour guide who have enough information about the counry more than what you have. Second reason why I personaly prefer that because I think it is safer for you and your family. I rememberd when I and my family traveled to Italy, we encountered some criminals and drug people who we don't know how to deal with them. However, although my father had solve this problem, I think if we had a guid with us that will be more easy for us. The third and last reason is we choose to travel to have some relax and have a rest away our works, duties and responsibilities. Actually, if you want to do that you should be away from all these troubles that, of course, you will be facing it such as ask some citizen people to have some information about as I said in the begining "where can I find this hotel?", "where are the recreation centers?", "what is the best restuarant do you have here?" and lots of these dum questions. You may also do not know how to speak their language since you are not a native speaker. 
In short, personally I prefer to travel with a tour guide to keep away all of these headach.
