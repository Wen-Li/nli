It is debatable whether traveling alone is the best way to travel that by a tour guide. Some people might recommend  to travel alone a least once in order to have alone time to sort out our think and relieve stress by having peace away from their heavy load of taks. However, I firmly believe that go on a trip alone is not the best way to travel because there are many dangerous vacation spots and it is time consuming.
 First of all, traveling in a group of people with tour guide is much safer. It is a tour guid who knows well about the vacation spots based on their previous experience by living the place for a long time. we not only obtain accurate information that the place we should not go but also be protected with a members of group by moving with a lot of people. Therefore, by traveling with a group of people led by tour guide allows people not to face unexpected situation including lose their money by lobberies, meet gangsters and lose their way. For example, when I traveled Hong Kong alon two years ago, I went to the opposit direction to the park that I had planned to go. I could not speak chinese so, I could not ask anything to the people around me. I felt scared and cried all they long. 
 In addition, traveling with tour guid in a group is much time saving. This is because poeple does not have to make a schedual researching the information about famous place by comb through all the books and call all the hotels to reserve. Poeple just follow guided direction withouth worring to check the time schedule of transportation, wherher the hotel reservation is available or not. Without worring those things, people can spend more enjoyable time with goup of people by talking about their feelings and sharing impressions each other. To demonstrate, according to the research conducted of Labor of Korea in 2007, 75% people felt more memorable and enjoyable trip when they traveled with a group of poeple  by tour guide. In addition, they answered that the reason why they felt happy with the trip is they does not have to worris about the information making trip.
 For these reasons, traveling with a group of people is more advantageous to make their trip more fun because of the time and feeling of sager. I belive that people should take into account those things before they go on the trip alone.
