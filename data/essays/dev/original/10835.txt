Personally, I think that this statement is a perfect reflect of what I think and do, I have always thought that you have to understand everything that you are taught. This is a very controversial topic, but I think I have a clear panorama of what I think.

The first reason for which I incline to this decision is for the fact that learning facts don't give you an internal satistaction of a certain topic. There is a famous quote stated by Ignatius of Loyola S.J. which is: "The knowing doesn't satisfies the soul, but the interpretation and likeness of the things internally does". This is a very reflexive quote, because when you learn a fact you don't adquire it's concept completely, you have like an empty space. For example in philosophy, you can know the point of view from every philosopher, but if you don't understand them, you could never know what they really meant.

The second reason is that human brain tends to forget easily things learned but not interpretated. For example, the things that you learned in 9th grade, sometimes you forget them when you are in 10th or 11th, because you don't really get the concept completely. On the other hand, if you learn something and you understand it well, you will remember it for ever, or if you forget it, with a little thinking you will remember it and could use it right for other aspects in your cotidian life.

Finally, I would like to say that people who always memorize facts and don't understand them completely, usually have less resources for having success in life, because of their lack of understanding and interpretation in essential manners. However, people who really understands all the things that they are taught, usually develop an ability to solve problems faster, or be more original in their thinking.
