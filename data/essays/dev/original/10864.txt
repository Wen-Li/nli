I absolutely agree with the statement. Moreover, I think that good advertisements should enhance the appearance of efficiency to maximize the influence on the consumer.

Advertisements for skin care products are especially good at twisting reality. They usually employ models that have immaculate skin regardless of the product. Then they follow the usual recipe by showing the model using the product and telling the audience how big of a change it made on her. It doesn't take long for the audience to react to this display of cause and effect. The problem is that the product probably didn't have any impact on the model whatsoever: she had perfect skin beforehand. And that's not even mentioning the computer enhancements...

However, I think one thing must be realized: the advertisement that I described previously did its job. It implanted a seed in the consumer's mind and the sales will happen. That's exactly the purpose of marketing: generating sales. I think it's largely the consumer's responsibility to train itself to mostly ignore advertisements. We know that they are fake, so why do we believe them anyway?

Don't get me wrong: advertising is a regulated business and as such should limit itself to what has been ruled acceptable by society. Laws exist that forbid telling lies or deceiving the customer in an advertisement. Building on my previous example, if the skin care product has a real potential for reasonably improving the appearance of skin, then it is the consumer's task to discern what is real and what is embellishment. As long as the advertisement doesn't guarantee the same exact results on everyone, the marketing firm is on pretty safe ground.

I'll conclude by attacking the other point of view: how could anyone disagree with the original statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are? That's the way it is. To anyone who believes advertisements display the whole truth unmodified, I have a bridge I'd like to sell to you...
