The big industries are famous, because generally their products are better than other products of small industries. I think that, the trayectory and the knowledge of the company permits to identify if any product is better than other. For example, I went to supermarket and I buy a unknow oil, because this was more cheap and I did not show big differences between my normal oil and this, but when I used this product I show that I loose my money, becuse this product had a less quality of my habitual oil.
	Therefore, I think to that there are famous companys, but this is not a garanteer for a good product. For example, currently a famous company of toys had problems with its toys, because the toys have a dangerous chemical; this toys industry is famous around in the world, but this is not complete garanteer for tha quality of the products.
	I agree with this idea: "Most advertisements me\ake products seem much better than really are" because the market is a war for the consummers. So, the quality of the products is determines for the people, I think that, the especialization in the production of the products helps to people know that product is better that other, because if the company only make a special product, the products will be more techniques and with less price than before.
	There are products better than others jus in appareance, but people should say which product is better when they obtain it, because it is better for their options in the market and in the habitual consummer, they have a social function too.
