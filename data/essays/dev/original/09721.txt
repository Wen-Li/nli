To try to give an answer to this important question i would say that i don't really agree.
In my mind we have to keep facts in mind to improve and to understand concepts.
For instance, when we made some mistakes we always could and should learn about it. That's why i think that some facts are really importants. Concerning Nasism, we can't ignore that it has existed and this because people made some great mistakes. They choose to put confidence in a leader which was a dictator and it ended in a war that we could have avoided.
Now that we know how that kind of ideology can be, we are aware that we better have to choose quietlier.
But learning about some other facts is not always as important as it is in this case. 
Some facts are useless if we consider courses as philosophy. Some acts influence our lives and our behaviours but some other are nothing interesting to developp conscience and awareness.
But when we study this other point it raises another issue which is directly linked to my first opinion : we have to learn facts to learn in general.
How ? Because everthing that seems to mean nothing to you is meaning more than you believe. 
Nevertherless we can understand lots of things without have learn everything about the subject. We can know world war two without being born and having lived during this war. You learn that there were millions people who died for your freedom but even if you didn't felt what is was to be affraid of bombs you can understand what it is like. 
So to conclude i would like to underline that it doesn't matter with the way we improve things. The most important is to be interesting when you try to learn something to someone and to be curious when it is you that is learning. We learn from everything but not only from facts.
