Things are changing every day.In pass 50 years , you could not believe that people can use the computers to do a lot of things . You could not believe somethings which is happend Today.So Young people is changing also, they enjoy their lives more than older people do.There are three points can prove this.

  First,young people will not think about when they become old what will happen.They just want to enjoy their lives now.Prepare to the Older people ,there is a big different .Older people will think about their family, their retire payment, their future lives.They will save money for that.They also will reduce their ativities for health.But young peope will not do that. They want to spend more time with friends .lovers and some modren things.They do not have saving account , they like use visa ,and use more money in their habits.In fact ,they do not have the plan for the future.

 Second,Young people is more easier to pay attetion on some new things. They will be mad on computer game, cars, clothes and so on.
At that time , they will spend more money and more time on it.Do not say i am young, i still have much time to do my future work.That is wrong, Because you do not have that money to enjoy your life.You only use older people's money to enjor your life.Prepare to older people , their situation is opposite.They will not pay attetion on new things , they just want themsleves to have good final lives.

 Third , Young people will not think about thier families, they think thier lives are more important . They will say i must enjoy my life without odler people.They do not want to stay with mother or father.
They only know friends.Althouht there have ages problems between oder people and young people and they will not enjoy life together, young people do not have any pionts about their family.

 Anyway, YOung people
