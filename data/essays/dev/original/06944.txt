 I  agree with the fact that it is important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts. Ideas  and concepts are two essential factors for learning. Ideas are the way by which one would learn about something by his past knowledge, by his past experience or by your imagination. Concepts are the one that provide you the with the fundamentals of learning things.

                   Take an example of car and an aircraft. Both are different objects for tranportation. The idea behind developing them was to develop different means of tranportation fulfilling the different needs of human. The basic concepts involved in developing them are the different laws of motion, pure sciences. The fact is that a car is used for transport on land whereas an aircraft is used as means of tranport in air.It is important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts first. The facts can be learnt once you are proficient with the ideas and concepts. If they only know the facts and not the concept , their learning would be limited. If they continue to learn things this way(by knowing facts), they would not be able to apply knowledge of their learning.Emphasing further, it would be important for the students to learn the ideas and concepts first which when combined would give rise to facts. Thus a student if learnt the basic idea and concept of laws of motion could automatically understand the facts involved with that.

                     Ideas and concepts, facts are different ways of learning things. But ideas and concepts are the foundation pillars of your knowledge. Your building(knowledge) strength lies in your foundation and not on our asthetic view (in this case the facts learning) which just gives a shallow knowledge about the strength of your building founadtion.
