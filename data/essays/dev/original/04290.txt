I disagree with the following statement. Because from now so many people buy the cars, and also so many people use a lot of cars. So even in twenty years there will be not fewer cars in use than there are today. Also another reason of this statement is now so many cars come out after a mouth of year or after 1 year. And some people buy one car, after that they buy new car. Because the new car is good design and good looking. So many in twenty years there will be so many cars in more use than there are today, and also there will be a lot of new cars are coming out.
