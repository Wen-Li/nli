I agree with the statement that says that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
First, if I go back in time and I start to do some memories of my time as an students at School and at the University, all those things that I learned it was because I understood the ideas and concepts that my teachers explained to me and my classmates. When I finally understood the process of the French Revolution I never forget it, because I didn't learned it as a fact. 
Second, is really great when you get the concepts of the different things and you can start to make some interesting relations between them and with the experience of your own life. I think that is nice when you can make questions about what you learned and give some conclutions  about it.  I also found that is nice when you meet with friends and you start a conversation with them, talking and exchanging ideas of all those things that in a moment you learned  and understand them. I really have a very good time when I have  those kind of opportunities to share with friends what I have learned and also to be sure that I can do my own statements.
Futhermore, I consider that Facts are too weak, you learn this facts for the test and then you erase them. Is like a foreing learning, from one moment to onother it flyes away, from your mind. Instead, when you really understand the ideas or concepts yo can be sure that this knowlege will never forget, never more. 
Finally I can say that, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
