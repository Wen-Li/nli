As the competiton increased belong the companies in almost every market, advertisiment become a very important way to improve the sales numbers. Companies use a lot of diffirent advertisement techniques. Accordingly It generally causes to make their products seem much better than they are actually. 

For example when you watch a girl eating a canddy or a chocolate you probably want to eat that product as soon as possible. When you go and buy one then you understand that it is not as much delicious as you desired, but unfortunetly you have almost bought that product and this has increased the companies sales once more.

On the other hand some companies are aware of that, this will happen only one time. When you use and see the product doesn't as good as seemed in the advertisement then you lost your trust to that company and never buy its products again. So they are triying to show the true qualities of the product for not making the customers dissappointed. When they aren't dissapointed,  they always prefer to buy their products. 

In conclusion, some advertisements may show the products better than what they exactly are, for improving the sales. But some firms can think different from that and plans long time process of its activities. I think the better way is always telling the truth. In that way people can trust your company, buy your products and in the future according to the high sales' your company will most probably be a permanent company.
