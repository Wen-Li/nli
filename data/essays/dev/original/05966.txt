Some people say that nowdays young people do not have enaugh time to help their communities, that because of the rithm of our lifes we, I am 19 years old, do not have time to help poor people, to talk or to be with old people who feel alone, to make thing to help to reach the peace in some countryes or even in some families...
  It is true that our lives have a very high rithm and that we do not have a lot of time to help our communities, but that does not mean that we do not want to do it. Some yeras ago young people did not do lot of thngs for their communities, but the implication of the new generations in the projects of help has increased a lot during the last years.
  We can see that there are more NPO's, no profit organizations, and whose members or the people that calaborate with them do it totally free, with no maney retribution. The objectives that these NPO's try to reach are really different. There are those who help poor people that do not have nothing to eat or those who help dependient drug people. There are also some corporations that help to preserve the environement, like Greenpeace, and those who help in general kids, like UNICEF. Others try to help woman and others try to figth against the illegal prostitution.
  There are lot of organizations that try to help our communitie and that are gowing in the number of activists
  To sum up, I will like to say that more an more young people are helping other people, even if we do not have all the time we would like to have to do this activitie. But young people are trying to find free time and spend it helping others, what make us more humans.
