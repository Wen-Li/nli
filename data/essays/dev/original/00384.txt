Although some people like to learn things that they want to use in their real life, i like to spend more time on the theories and i want others do the same thing as well. There are several reasons: to advance our world, to contribute for a better fututre and to satisfy our needs.
	Many people think that human beings improved their life a lot and they are the ruler of the planet, earth, i disagree. For example,a century ago, we even did not have electricity. What scholars did was to develop theories and to care about science. For instance, if we did not have Einstein or Edison or other scholars, there would not have been electricity or new discoveries. We may have been countinued our life with primary machines and in dark houses.
	Moreover, we have tremendous problems in our world. Even though we have computers, rockets and flying cars, the end of the world may too close. For example, the global warming contains a big threat and we need to save our world. How can we solve this problem? Most likely by thinking more about science( theories), we probabely will solve the problem. In fact, we need more scientists to pay attention to this area and we need to encourage new generations to take science courses and think more about theories. 
	We do not have plenty of foods and resources and we need to improve them more. Without spending energy on the theories behind the genetically modified foods, it would be imposible to grow healthier and numerous foods. For example, I used to pay two dollars for a pound of apples containing a lot of diseases, now i pay less for better apples. 
	Summing up, without spending more time on the theories, we could not improve our life standarts and i appriciate to the all scientists devoided their time on them.
