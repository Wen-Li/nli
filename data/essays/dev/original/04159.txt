Good and hard question. I think  this question`s answer is not yes or no. Because young people have got alot of enercy and movement, but they have not got  a lot of money :)  

        	So, they young people  nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. young people's mind is is heavy. they like  play game, party and another thing. I think they dont know their responsible. For example  A student is very work your lessons. but  you dont it. Why? Because he is lazy.  is good than work. 
	  Their know are swiming and playing and another activite and freedom. 
	Immm. I think very bad sentences.
