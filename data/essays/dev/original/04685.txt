I think that the following statement "It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject" because this is a very important functions. 
If you have broad knowledge of many academic subject you have the possibility to have a panoramic scenary to all over situations you have in your "hands".
With this conoscence you will be prepared to every situations. You will have a answer for every moment of your professional live.
I think that many academic subject permetted at all person to be able to take all over profession.
In stead  of one specific academic subject do not permetted to be able to take any professional job.
In end I think that this selections is prefered for me, but this is not equals for every other person.
