Today, to move, the people, in general, use theirs cars. The numbers of cars increase always but in an other side, the prize of cars and oil increase too.
On one hand, some people think in twenty years they will use than there are today. Indeed, having a car is more and more expensive. On the earth, there less and less oil so the prize increase a lot and all people can not pay it. Moreover, in the biggest cities, the common transports will be very developed like in Paris where the government make news bus' route.They want that Paris will becomea citie with no cars. Indeed, some people think we need to stop use the cars because that due to the increase of polution.
One the other hand, the cars is the best to move. Indeed, with cars you can go everywhere and when you want. You do not wait like with bus and subways. Maybe the prize of oil increase, however, all government try to find a solution. For example, in France, the government want to introduce a new oil product with cereal. This oil is ever use in some countries like Brazil where a lot cars use this oil and where the oil is less expensive than in France. Moverover, this vegetal oil can stop the polution in the biggest cities. And finaly, with a car, the people do what they want like at home. They chose the radio station they want to listen, they can fume, they can phone. 
According to me, the common transport can developed a lot again. But with the new technologies, all the people would like his own cars and I think in twenty years there be more cars in use than there are today.
