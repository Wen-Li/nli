I agree with the statement which is successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. It depends on what the value of the successful is, so I take successful as become famous and change better world.

	One of the example of successful company is McDonuld's, the famous fast food chain in the United States. I just read the book about McDonuld's. The founder of the McDonuld's is McDonuld's brother in the south of the United States. They were selling humbergers at the store which can buy foods getting on the car, drive-through. It was the major thinking of restrants at that time. But they changed the style. They changed all of the cycle to make humberger. It means that one person do only one job, like just bake the meat. Before that, there were one person did every steps to make humberger. This idea made more faster to serve food. Because of there effort, McDonuld's became the biggest humberger company in the world. 

	Trying to do new things is always with some risks. It would be good if the new things brought success.But if the new things failed, it would be a nightmere. I think charenging new things is a kind of lottary. We cannot know if the thing would be success. 

	Another good example of successful people is the person who maid the i-Pod. This product is the most hit products of Apple Company which used to produce Apple computer. The idea of making i-Pod as the lightest and having a big capacity of music is the fashionate idea. Apple Company is the first company to create products such as i-Pod. The attitude of challenging of new thing would make Apple to accomplish to be successful. 

	Because of these reasons, I agree with the idea of successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well.
