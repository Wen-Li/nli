In today's global environment, some people prefer to do routine tasks to be successful, others prefer to create new things to be successful. Personally, I believe that successful people try new things and take some risks instead of doing routine things.
	Firstly, people who try new things and take risks are generally succesful making profits in business environment. In these days, the most of the corporations prefer innovative employees. Innovation means creating new ideas such as new products and new services. The new products which are done by corporations especially, employees are successful. As a result, these companies can have higher profits. Generating new ideas and things can provide success for an employee. For example, I had an internship experience in my country two years ago in summer.  I observed that managers who are in high level positions always talk about innovation. Also, they suggested that I should be open to new ideas. 
	The second important point is the demand in the world. In today's world, in soceity people have higher demands with regards to the products and the services. When a buyer buys a new product, one can be bored with this new products in two or three months. To provide new products, the market needs people who can take risks to create new things can be successful. For example, Bill Gates who is the owner of the Microsoft Company is the best example of this situation. When Bill Gates first developed the Windows, he went to IBM to sell his product. However, IBM rejected his offer and he set up his own country. As a result, he has become the owner of the highest valuable company, and his products are used in most part of the world. He is successful, because he took some risks and created new things which is benefical to the soceity.
	The other important point is life satisfaction. People are born, because they want to survive and create new things. Every people have skills to create new things. So, they use their skills.  
	To sum up, the successful people always generate new ideas and takes risks for their trial. In most cases they are successful and happy. Routine tasks are boring things and people who do routine tasks have not enough life satisfaction.
