Some people agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.  It is because people travel easily if a tour guide takes them.  However, I strongly disagree with the idea.  I will support my opinion as follows.

First, I am not free to go any place if I travel with others.  When I was university student, I visited to the Guam Island with five friends as a graduation memorial travel.  After I reached a hotel in Guam Island, I wanted to swim as soon as possible.  However, five friends except me did not want to swim and they want to go shopping.  I could not reject them.  I felt that my wants were limited so much.  I was not free.

Second, I can not meet some troubles if others or a tour guide are around me.  I believe that some troubles which happens on the travel such as losting a way is interesting thing.   Three years ago, I traveled to New York in The United States of America.  I wanted to go the Central Par after I arrived there.  I tried to go there using a subway.  However, I lost my way to there near the times square. Though I could not speak English well,  I callenged to ask someone where the Central Park was. A kind man told me the way and I could reach there finaly.   I met a trouble and tried to find a solution during my trip.  This is my interesting experience.  If other people or tour guide were with me, I did not lost the way. And I did not talk to foreigner.   For instans, I did not meet the accident.  

To sum up, by taking these matters into account, I absolutely disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.  I do not want to travel with other people even they are my friends.  If I travel alone, I feel free and go anywhere anytime.
