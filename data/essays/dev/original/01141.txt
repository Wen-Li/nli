I disagree with stateman that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities becouse the young spend many of his or her time to help the person that have some disabilities and also help the older people, for this reasons the statement is wrong . An example is if a young have a grandparents such as grandfather or grandmother when he help them he make an help for the communities becouse they spend a time to help an older person to buy food, water, medicine and other and has also spend time to speack with them that in some cases is more important than when a person go to them only for take a list of what they necessity.
This is the same aspect that there is when a young help a person with disabilities becouse the true problems isn't his inability to do something but is the necessity to speack and play with  other persons same to him or her and this persons is the young.
I know a lot of young people that over the time that he spend for him also spend a little or a large of the time that remain to him to help this persons and this is very important for the communities and the people that do this.
