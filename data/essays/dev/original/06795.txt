Travelling tops the list of many people's choice to spend their leisure time for. But whether to follow a group led by a tour guide remains a controversial question for the travellers at their planning stage of the tour. In my opinion, the best way to travel has little to do with following a large group.

People tend to rely on a group and stick to it for security or consensus or whatever they needed, but when it comes to travelling, things might fall on the opposite side. The assertion of unity means the denial of freedom, it is especially ture when, with the guide of a tour guide, one cannot indulge himself in the freedom of choosing what travelling sites to visit or what time to start and there is a greater chance that the true meaning of travelling, relaxation being my defenition, might be raped by arguments and complaints.

Some people would contridict my point by saying that a tour guide offers valuable and well-informed suggestions that would make a better trip. But isn't there enough news of tourists being cheated or made use of for the sake of tour guides' benefits? By saying this, I am not saying that tourist are more skilled at escaping tricks when travelling by themselves, nor am I judging the moral standard of all tour guides, it's just that isn't it even sadder to be fooled when certain investment and trust and already been placed on the tour guide?

In addition, travelling fullfills different purposes for different people. Some want to escape the hustles and bustles of the city, some wish to explore the unknown world, some aspire to adventure through exciting places,and none of these seem attainable by following the lead of a tour guide whose job is to keep everyone in sight and control.

Good or bad, there is no absolute truth, however, we always have the right to chase what we want when travelling.
