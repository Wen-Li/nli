I agree that most advertisements make products seem better than they realy are.  Advertisements are there to attract customers to a certain product. The product is always displayed in a way where it seems appeling to the viewer. Sometimes the company advertising the product tend to exadurate in advertising. They make the product seem to good to be real. Each advertisement is there to target a certain age group. For example when advertising a toy on the television certain sound effects and bright colours are used to attract young children making them desire the product. Therefore the parents take action and buy the toy for their child. Advertising is the best way to minpulate with young children's minds.
Advertisements does not include  the disadvantages of the product advertised. The product is always praised and made flawless. The company advertising a certain good main aim is profit. Quality and customer service is the last thing considered. It is rare that you find an advertised product that is trustworthy and is exactly like it was described on the advertisement. 
In a conclusion i would like to say that the problem we are facing nowadays is that we are letting those false advertisements affect us, but there is nothing we can do about it as they are every where. They're displayed as bulletin boards in the streets , showed on the television as commercials and even played on the radio. In the end were just humans and the least things affect us !!!
