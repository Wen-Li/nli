	I agree with this statement. I think that young people enjoy life more than older people. There are two reasons. One reaso is that young people are more activity than older people. Also, the other one is that young people have new ideas for life.
	First of all, young people are more activity than older people. It's because young people can do dance more activity than older people. However older people can't do dance more activity than young people. It's becuse older people don't have enough power of dancing for a long time.
	Second of all, young people have some new ideas for enjoying in life. For example, there is festival in life. Young people can open up thier ideas for festival. It's because young people can think of interesting ideas.
	In conclusion, young people can enjoy in life.
