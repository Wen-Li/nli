One of the major problems of 'homo-urbanis', that is, the human being living in urban areas, is transportation. With each day, our roads are becoming crammed with an increased number of cars and our air being infused with higher density of vehicular pollution. Obviously there is a limit to how much our infrastructure can support. What happens when there are so many cars on the road that there is no more place to move?

That is a rather scary vision. However, it may well be that the number of cars on the roads twenty years from now will actually be less than what it is today.

Isn't that a rather exaggerated claim? After all, even if the world population stabilizes as the estimates have indicated, it will still be much larger than what it is today. And with increased economic prosperity, more and more people can be expected to own more and more cars. 

True. However, if the current trends are any clue, the number of cars should nevertheless reduce. 

First of all, many countries, especially developing nations with large populations, are rapidly developing their public transport systems to tackle the problem of urban transportation. Public transport systems are not only more cost effective, they also ensure a better quality of living by eliminating traffic jams and exposure to vehicular pollution. Therefore, it will not really be surprising if more and more people take to public transport as the primary means of moving about. 

Second, fuel prices are expected to rise heavily in next twenty years as world oil reserves get delpleted. In such a scenario, it will be much more economical for people to use public transportation systems. 

Such trends are already showing in countries like India. The Delhi Metro is a success story that well illustrates the point. With high quality service available at low prices, even the rich and affluent of Delhi prefer  to keep their cars at home and use the Metro when they need to travel to the crowded areas of the city. Rapid Bus Transit Systems introduced in cities like Indore and Bhopal are becoming increasingly popular amongst citizens.

Thus, the day may not be far when you might be the only person driving on the road! In fact, if one wants a better quality of living for one and all, one should actually hope that it happens.
