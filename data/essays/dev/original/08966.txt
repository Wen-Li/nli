Nowadays, due to the fact that life time is becoming longer for all human beings, everyone can enjoy life in each moment. However, I do think that young people are still more welling to afford life in a more enjoyable manner than older people do. So, I do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than younger people do. In my essay, I will provide some resons that make my agreeing with that statement.

The first reson why young people are able to enjoy life more that older peole are, is that, as they are young,  they have a lot of experinces to do, Young peolple may wish to experince emotions that they have never tried before because of their age. They might  like to have a family, and so they try al they can to find a good partner, enjoying any occasion they will have inorder to reach taht aim. Moreover, they wold like to experince works. They wold like to enjoy the jobs that they eventually find and they will try to apprecite all the aspects of them, as they rapresent their first experince in the labour market.

Younger people might enjoy life more than the ealderlies, because, as they are young, they have more energies to afford life itself. On the contrary of old people, young people enjoy sports, such as fotball, or basketball, which are an essentail part of life, and which request a lot of energies that older people, in general does not have. Furthermore, thanks to the energies that young people have because of thei age, they have more opportunity than older peole to make fanny and relaxing things, suchs as trips or partys, which are so helpful in order to enjoy life.

To coclude, I do think that young people enjoy life more than old people do, because of the experinces they wolu like to try in their future, and because of the energies they allowed them to exploit the most enjoiable aspects of life.
