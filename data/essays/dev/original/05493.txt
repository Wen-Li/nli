   I agree with the statement that in twenty years from now, there will be fewer cars in use that were today. More and more new cars are getting added to city traffic every day. Improving economic conditions are encouraging people to purchase a car on their own instead of using the public transport system. The city's infrastructure is not being able to grow proportionately to the traffic resulting increase of jamming of  traffic and accidents.A recent health survey has shown that people who get stuck up in traffic jams are more prone towards stress affecting both their pesonal and professional lives.  Also, not to forget the  pollution  of air and sound  these vehicles cause everyday.
        One more important factor that would discourage the car usage in coming times is the constant rise in fuel charges and lack of availability of immediate and reliable alternatives.The fuel production is not able to catch up with the alarming increase in the fuel consumption. 
       With the advent of metro rail and other advanced public transprt mechanisms  which carry huge of number of people with short span of time to their destination, people would be  inclined to use them than risking themselves getting stuck in  a bad traffic jam. With aggresive promotion of usage of public transport system by the government, the number of cars could significantly decrease.
 
    Also, with  people experimenting  with newer ideas of car-pooling where a car is shared by a group of people instead each one of them driving one on their own may significantly see in the reduction of number of vehicles on the road.

Owing to all these factors, people in coming years will be less inclined to use their cars.
