I always think to myself, what will my grand parents do when I am having fun or boredom in school. Everytime I go pass by old people, they sit on a bench holding the leesh of their dog and watch people walk pass by. But their truth of enjoyment was something else, something more impressive and tearful. Therefore, I believe that they may not be enjoying their life in my sight, but they are certainly enjoying more than us, younger kids. 
	When I was at my grand parents' place, I was investigating what they would do for the 24 hours. Their bed time was worth half of my bed time and their TV time was worth not even the half of my TV time. And even, when I was trying to entertain them by teaching them how to use the computer, they sleighed the mouse on to the computer screen which made me give up on them. Then, I realized that their enjoyment was something else, which young people can not possibily feel. When it was my bed time, my grand mother was staying up watching a series of drama. I interrupted her asking what is her entertainment in life and she answered me that her enjoyment of life is all about watching me and my mother's day go past by safely and our fulfiment of laughter is instantly her pleasant laughter.  And the next thing she said to me is that she is enjoying so much of her life that she would not regret for living, even if she dies the next day. 
	In conclusion, I do not know how their own enjoyment of life work, but all the tearful sayings that my grand mother had made for me touched my heart and therefore, I believe that older people enjoy their life more than us, younger kids who only knows how to play computer games.
