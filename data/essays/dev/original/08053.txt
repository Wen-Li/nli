In an advertisement, "Dior", everything looks like perfect and beautiful. However, the truth is, it's the same as you thought when you buy the product. Like this, many products look better shown in the advertisement than in reality. So, i agree that most advertisement make products looke better than they are in real. The effect of this phenomenon is negative. The products are not that good such as shown in the advertisement. And also it sometime leads to a waste of money.
 First, the product which you saw through TV or Internet and bought it because it seemed really good is not that good. For instance, one of my friend bought a mp-3 which was publicised on TV. On the advertisement the mp-3 looked cool and its sound system sounded very good. But when he got it, the product's shape was not that cool as shown on TV. And also the sound system wasn't really good at all. So, he really regreted the fact that he bought it.
 Secondly, since you buy the products which looked good on TV without checking the information of it, it's a waste of money. Often, when you turn the TV on, a lot of advertisement about movies are advertised. And it makes the movie really good. So, when you go to see that movie, you might be disappointed. One day, I saw 'National Treasure" advertised on TV which looked really exciting. So, I went to see that movie with my friends and watched it. It was really boring and I even slept for a moment. The advertisement looked exciting with action it got, but in the real movie, there were few actions and the story was inaceptable for me.
 I think not all advertisements make the products look better than it is in real, but most of them do. And I think that advertisements should make the products look as it is in reality.
