Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.This statement is very true as a person who tries to do things differently and takes a different approach towards certain things in life proves to be successful,but the success cannot be guaranteed.If a person goes about doing things as he usually does and is perfect at,he will not suffer any loss but will be stable,no growth and no loss,these are the people who like to play it safe in life and lead a life without stress ans tension where as taking risks in life is a stressful thing but you can increase your growth only by trying new things and innovating ideas and ways of doing things.A careful analysis is very important about the type of risk bieng taken and what is the appropriate method for going about the decision.Most business houses have been successful because of their ability to take risks and try innovative strategies and plans.Such people like to enjoy life to the fullest and are determined about what they want in life and work their way upto it.

 I believe that people should take risks in life but they also should be careful and know the pros and cons of taking the risk.They should take risk that they can bear.Without taking risks a person acnnot achieve what he wants,he will have to be satisfied with what he has.Only people who have the thirst in them to achieve what they want take risks,some succeed and some fail.Therefore it has to be well strategised and well planned inorder to reach the objective and move ahead in life.Risk has extreme consequences,you either suceed or you fail, so people should take risk knowing what they are getting into.Therefore its not everyone'scup of tea to take risks and those who do not have the heart to bear the loss should not go ahead with it.
