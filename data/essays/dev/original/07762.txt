Moreover, nowadays new challange is develop brand new ideas. Every human being always seek new ideas and new products to make them successful. Present world already has been developed too much for regular ideas or inventions. Moreover, people who succeeded always had hard times with them. In my opinion, because they faced with their problem and they overcome it, they can called successful people.

     First of all, the successful people's common stereotype is not satisfy to the present situation and always challange to the new one. Walt Disney did not satisfied with his current society's broadcast. He invented variety Disney characters such as "Mikky Mouse" or "Minni Mouse". This new characters contributed to obtain children's attention, and it becomed the fuel for Walt Disney's success. In addition he nevered stoped to create new characters, his unstoppable tring also make his success more shiny.

     Second of all, the people who reach their success took lots of rick than ordinary people. It is not true that person can make their forturn in one try except the lottary. Successful people always took higher risk to obtain more new and valuable result from their try. When the Bill Gates was young man, he was attended to Harberd University and he was respected by others to just attend in the Harberd. However, when he tried to make the Microsoft programs, there are some episodes about he failed at his classes in university. Bill Gates gave up his reputations of Harverd. Normal people usually not doing it. 

     Third of all, Successful people did not stop to develope themselves. They always try new things with risk but never give up about it. They try and try untill they get satisfied data or result about it. Then they start to new try based on their collected informations. Piccaso is the famouse artist of the modern ages and his one painting values like more than million dollars. His work at that time was not that noticable because his painting was too creative. However, he did not give up drawing. He just kept draw and draw by his way. After he died, until now, we thought his painting is very creative and we gave him a creadit for it.

     In short, Successful people try new things although they could take serious risks, and they never give up untill they reach their goal. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement that is given.
