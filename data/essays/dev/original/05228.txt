  There are heated disscussion about that young people enjoy life more than older people do.Some people support it,by claim that,young people have more friends than older people do.they are full of energy,and so on.However,some people against this ,saying that older people have more children to share happiness and sadness,and also older people have a lot of actities to take part in.As far as I am concerned,both young people and the old people energy life.
   As we know,young people in school have a lot of time.they can play with them.talk with them,and study with them.School offers a wonderful stage for young to enjoy their life.In addition,When young people have some problem,a lot of people could give them a hand,such as,their parrents,teachers,partners,bosses,and so on.By their help,the can solved the problems more productive.The young people can sure benefit from that,they also can energy better.Finily,young people have more energy to engoy their life.They can do whatever they want to do,they can experience a lot of new things that older people have never seen.Such as computers vidio games.MSN,ICQ and so on.
    On the other hands,older people also enjoy their life.With the developments of science and thenology,the condition of people living enviroment become better and better.The older people can liveing longer and longer than before.The older people become more and more energy and healthier than before .What's more,the older people can enjor the wonderfull time with their childen,their grandchildren who can bring a lot of interesting and funny things to their parents or grantpatents.Also,the community of people's living becomeing better and better,older people can take part in lots of activities.Older people can singing with other older people,they can dance,and whatever they want to do.
    Sweeping generationlize to this is impossiveble here.I n a world.I think both young and old are enjroy their life better and better.
