I think that trying new thing and taking risks is not necessarily of condition to be successfull but that it is a condition to get out of mass. I think people doing good work should be recognised for it and have success in  their carrer even if ther don't do anything new. I know a small shop where the man repair shows and bags. The man is doing very good work at a very reasonable price. It is nothing special but the quality of it<s wor is known in the town and he always have clients. However, the man is neither very rich or very famous. If this is the kind of success one target, then I think the person must absolutely try new things and take risks to distinguish from the other peoples. Among the peoples we remember the more are the inventors and discoverers. They often try a lot of things before doing the iinvention that made the famous.
