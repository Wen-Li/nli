I disagree with the idea that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way.  There are two reasons to support my opinion. First, in a group tour, you can't visit places freely. If the place you want to visit is not very popular, there are a few plans you can choose.  When I was a high school student, I visited Kyoto in a group of my school. Then, I wanted to go to Sanzyusangen temple. However, the plan of the tour doesn't include the temple. Therefore, I couldn't visit there. 
 Second, although  the time to look around the place is usually limited in a group tour, you can spend time to look around as much as possible.  You wouldn't be able to understand the history of the place if the time for sightseeing is limited. When I went to Todaiji temple in my school trip, I could't check carefully  the explanation of the temple or statues of god because I didn't have enough time. Furthermore, when you walk around the place or  the town, you may notice good things that you couldn't find in a group tour, for example, the kindness of people there or delicious foods. When I traveled to Tokyo alone, I got lost. Then people there helped me. This is very important exper
