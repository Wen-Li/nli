People who take risks are more likely to receive benefits from their actions rather than people that simply don't act.
This is not only a logical assumption but it is also supported by evidences which are true at global scale.
Some of the richest people in the world were ordinary people with very good ideas. An example for that is Bill Gates. Instead of improving existing tools, he decided to project and invent a new instrument, the personal computer, which will cause a revolution in work and entertainment activities. He risked to waste many years of work on something uncertain that could just be a failure. It is now clear that he had employed his time in a very fruitful manner and that he will be remembered as a genius.
On the other hand, some people succeeded in exporting good ideas to other countries with different cultural backgrounds. A good example is Starbucks coffee which is now sold all over the world and even in China. It must have been a very controversial decision to take for the managers. But, although the chinese society is traditionally used to tea instead of coffee, now many Chinese young people drink Starbucks coffee to identifiy with American models.
On smaller scale we all can experiment that if we take some risks we will have more chances to fulfill our desires and be more happy. For example, you can decide to go and study in the United States. At the beginning it will be difficult because of the language constraints and the distance from family and friends. But if you hold on and overcome difficulties you will get a valuable degree from an excellent university that will allow you to access to better job and income opportunities.
In conclusion, I think it is always worthy to try new things and take risks. We need to remember that we are given only one opportunity in this world and we should do our best to be happy and make other people happy.
