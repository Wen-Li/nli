    I agree with this statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Here are my reasons:
    More and more people concern about the polluted problem of environment, and not only government decides to pass bills that can protect our nature environment, but also people reduce the damage to our environment. And cars are one of vital damage to these pollution, because they release carbon dioxide.If people reduce to  drive cars by themselves, instead, use the mass transportation,the amount of  carbon dioxide, which is a vital reseason that cause pollutions can be eliminated. So I think cars will be fewer than today.
   Second, cities are developed grauatedly, more and more cities will have their mass transportation, such as MRT, trains, or buses.These useful development can provide a more ecnomical way to transport for citizens. In order to save money and priceless time, people will choose to use mass transportation rather than drive cars by themselves. For example, although many teachers of mine have their own cars, but they only drive cars by themselves in  rainy days. Because the MRT in our city provides a cheaper and comfortable journey for us. And they don't need to drive. 
   In addition, the expenditure to maintain a car is very big. For example, the expenditure of gasoline, the tax of cars, etc. This huge expenditure would effect the willing of people having a car.
   Finally, crowed traffic situation would also make people do not want drive car by themselves. And there is still a big problem to drivers: finding a parking space is extremely hard.
    To sum up, the idea of environmental protection, more conveinent mass transportation, the expenditure of having a car, to avoid stuck in a traffic jam,worry about how to find a parking space on time, all of these considerations would make fewer and fewer people to plan to have their own cars.
