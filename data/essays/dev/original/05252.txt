I agree to the statement .In my opinion there is famous saying that "TO GET SUCCESS YOU HAVE TO TAKE RISK", i agree to this statement because i feel that success dosent come without taking risk in life.Today is the world of competetion and to compete in this world you have to try new things to get success.

In order to get success ,sometimes you  try to find out new ways  .By going on those  ways you think you can achieve success and you often take risk in your life .i feel if people only do those things which they think  know how to do well they can get success upto a certain level but cannot reach heights of success.

In my opinion every one has its own defination of success and its depends on the person to person till what extent they can take risk in their own life ,for some people success means peace of mind or a happy life .But for some success means reaching the heights of the world,to conquer the world so that person tends to take more risk comparision to that that person who is happy in his own world ,or to that person  has different meaning for success.

For example ,if you take the example of CRICKET if a batsmen wants to score quick runs he hast to play slodgy shots in order to take quick runs so he has to take risk .sometimes he get success or sometimes he fails.so its just depend on the person is he ready to take the risk in terms of getting success ?But i dont think you can buy success without taking risk.

Sometimes i feel is "SUCCESS HAS ITS NEGATIVE SIDE ".This question always bothers me a lot. Is success dosent come without taking risk ?Till now i am not able to find out the answer till date ,may be i have not achieved success yet but the day when i will achieve succes i will come to know
