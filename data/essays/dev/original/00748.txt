I reckon this statement has to be regarded in a more dimensional way. On the one hand, I agree that learning facts is significant but on the other hand, only understanding ideas and concept allows students to really move something.

Learning facts, a deductive method, is according to my view an important basic to invent something, do research or work on new programmes for the governement or society in general.

To illustrate my thesis, I would like to explain how my father works. My father does research concerning synapes, the junctions between neurons. Together with his student research group at the university in Munic, he reflected all the known facts about neurons. That was the basic for the research and experiments.
After being aware of the way a signal is transfered from one cell to another, they started working on concepts how the information transfer can be blocked. Therefore, they employed poisons like atropin which is responsible for rejecting specific neurons to pass a cell membran.
With this illustration, I would like to emphasize the combination of knowing facts and discovering concepts.

Another example which conveys my opinion very well is the political system. Of course, a student can learn all the facts about the German democratic system, for example that it was established after World War II with the help of the Americans, Britains, French and (former) Soviets etc etc but this is not necessary when he should think of new opportunities of citizen participation.

Facts are sometimes an important, essential basic or background but to be innovative and creative it must be guaranteed to have understood the gist of an idea or concept.

Drawing a conclusion, I would advice the students to learn facts and regard them as a measure of understanding sophisticated ideas and concepts without any problems.
