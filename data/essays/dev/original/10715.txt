	In our life, all of us want to live in good, confortable conditions, want to have a big house and also a nice car and money till death. But for this suitable life can not be won easily. It wants successful. And for the success; open mind, risk and new trials are necessary.
	There are two kinds of people. One of what is successful and the other is unsuccessful in the life. 
	In my opinion, successfull people are open minded and always ready to try something new and try to develop a process or a project or a subject.  In addition to these they like to take risks for the success. But on the other hand, some people stay away from risk, new projects and also they are afraid of trials. They live according to their life rules.
	If we focus on the professors-scholars working, educating and researching in the universities, colleges and also in institudes, we could determine the success on their faces by investigating their reliable behaviours, talkings, smilings...etc we know that they dont get afraid of making mistakes becouse they believe that if they m make mistake it will turn to them as success
	On the other hand if the other people afraid of making mistakes, taking risk and stay dependent on their own rules, could not be successful. For example,  if an unsuccessfull student is investigated, according to the student behaviour and life, random study times that was set by her/hisself could be determined.
	In conclusion it could be said that successfull people are the people who are not afraid of making mistakes and in addition to these who are not to take risk. They are always ready to find out something and development. But  as comparised above, to do wahot is wanted does not bring any success and olso a comfortable life we imagine. If life is just like a stairs for people having beauties confort miney on the upside, in my opinion successfull people will go up easily but the others will not.
