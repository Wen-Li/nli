I agree that the people nowadays do not devote enough time towards helping their communities.The communities can prosper only when everyone gets along and make the community better in many ways.these may be due to various  reasons.

one reason is today people hav become so busy that they hardly have time to spend it with their communities they are so preoccupied with other matters that they dont give that much prefernece to whats going on in the community.They hardly are able to make enoungh time which can be spent with community let alone helping it.

Because of their complex lifestyles people generaly prefer to have time to spend in other intresting things than going to community and help others.even though it important to help communities one cant be forced into talking up the cause.the people cannot be forced into doing communitiy services without their willingness.The people who do not do coommunity service does not know what it is all about the imagine it as one of the borin things in life.

Another thing which takes people away from helping communities is theit hectic schedule.the people usually work in weekdays and want to relax during the weekends.The consider helping service as job which makes them think whether they should get involved or relax and get ready for the next week.

Due to their poor knowledge regarding what is meant by 'helping their community' also big factor which forces people away from the participating in community service.people should made aware of the effects the helping can make on the society it is for their betterment that this type of services are being conducted.The people are more concerened about themseleves and do not give much attention to the happenings in the society.For example lack of awareness people dont even now whats going on in their surroundings.

To conclude people are getting away from their duties.they tend to forget their responsibilities towards community which indeed is a larger family.Helping the community will only give satisfaction that he or she has contributed to the society in one way or another.thus people should try and make some time for helping others in community,which can only make the community better to leave in.
