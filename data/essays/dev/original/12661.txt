    Many people lose thier life, thier job, or maybe thier family. All of them were not learn from other's fault. Successful person who has many choses that help him in his life. So, what we lose if we learn one more thing in our life. Actually, by learning from the life we come more open minded.     
     
     We read every day about the most ritch people in the world and all of them are the example for successful person. They have a job beside some buisness. They know that the life is difficult, so they learn every day how to extand thier own. 
    
     I agree with this statement, because I have a personal experince in this field. Long time ago, after I graduted from Univesity, I was looking for the best career form me with a high salary. So, after while I found what exactly I want. It was was a good position in a commomn company in my country. I got a perfect salary every month, but I was asking myself is it really enogh to reach to my goal? Actually, no, because I have to save some money preparing to my weeding day. I have to buy house, car, and puy for the day. After a while I decided to join to the stock market. It was the risk step that I ever take it in my life. Also. it is really good to learn about new thing and how to successed. 
    
     I came to U. S. to get Master Degree, but not in my same major. My major is Mining Engineering and I will study here Environmental Engineering. I do that to have more than one chance. I can work in Mining field or Environmental as well.   
    
     In conclusion, the person could be successed in his life, but he will not lose anything if he try to learn a new thing. In addition, the life by itself teach us a lot of things every day just we have to open our mind.
