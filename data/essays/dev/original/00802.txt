In the next twenty yearas there will fewer cars than at present.I dont agree with this notionbecause the demand and the importance of the car is ever increasing day by  day.
           With the advancement in techonology and the statistics produced by the car manufacturers are anything to go by then in the next few years there will be a major incresase in the number of consumers for cars.I think that there could be a increase in the number of cars used depending on the policies issus.I say so becaus e with the ever increasing development in technology there is reduction in prices of the previous models and certain additional featurs are being added int he new cars which would only be a dream a few years earlier.Moreover the notion of a car being a necessity than a luxury thing is changing as even members of not so affluent families or well to do families also own cars.This change could be attributed due to various factors such as easy payment options given by the car manufacturers or the installments given by them.The other reasons could also be that the willingness of the bank authorities to give various loans for the purchase of cars or for the cganges to be made in car.Another reason could be that the company's exchange offers which say that you can exchange your old car for a new one for an additiona payment which keeps on increasing the sales of the cars.
              Plus there are additional benefits of using a car which make it hard to resist object or abandon it.The benefits of the car are you can go with your family whereever you want and at whatever time plus useful in cases of emergency.More than the benefits cars are usually associated with social status .That there is ever an increase for the demand for a new car with certain   added features that its precedent is not having.Then there are cars which hold special status as being the royal cars or having your own vintage collection.
                             Basically you can reach to different destinations according to your own schedule at your own speed.Now-a-days there is a whole lot of variety being offered wherein special additional features are buiklt in it like conference room setting or bedroom setting.With such offers it has lot of benefits for the people who are really busy and cant afford to waste times.
                         Well with so many benefits its really hard to think that there will be a decline in the number of cars in the near future.With the benefits there are also certain disadvantages like the gas emitted from the exhaust of the cars is polluting the environment and that the fuel used for the functioning of the car is depleting the natural resources.Well for the fact that cars are increasing the air pollution with the development in technology various models are being developed which donot emit any dangerous gases in the atmosphereand for the second disadvantage that they are using the energy resourses new cars are being developed and some have already being developed which use solar energy as fuel or run on electrical energy.
               Thus with so many advantages i think the demand for the increase in caras will outnumber its decrease or there wont be any drastic change in the numbe rof cars in the near future.  Thus i think that in the near future there will be an additional number of cars than there are today.
