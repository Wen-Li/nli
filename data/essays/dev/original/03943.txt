I disagree that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better than traveling on our own. From personal experieces, I've learned that touring on our own gives more oppurtunity to be more knowlegable about the place we're traveling,  more time to travel unknown places, and more chances to communicate with locals.

As a personal example when I went to Cambodia last winter, I went with a tour group led by a guide. Before I went I knew I had to study about the places I would go,but I postponed such duties because I was expecting the guide to explain everything. Just as I expected, when I went to ancient sites in Cambodia the tour guide explained every little detail,leaving no space for me to further find out. However, when I went to Europe by myself this winter, I felt obliged to study about the background information or about the European history because there was no guide to answer my questions. The fact that I was planning all the journey on my own gave me more resposibility to study about the place I would go to. 

Such cases are not merely limited to my personal examples.
Also when we travel with a group led by a guide,  we have to follow with the tuor company's tight schedule. Out itinery is often scheduled and we merely follow where the guide takes us. We don't have much free time to ramble around new places other than the famous tour cites. However, when we're on ourselves we don't have to move accordingly to a fit schedule. We are free to go anywhere we'd like. Other than famous tour cites, we could simply go to local markets or take a walk down the streets--places that are ordinary but also places where we can smell the local's custom and culture. 

Furthermore, when we're traveling with a guide we're too busy following the tight schedules to acutally communicate with the locals. Touring with a guide often ends with visiting famous cites and taking pictures. But when traveling on your own, we have more chances to actually be friends with the locals. Although there might be some language barrier, we can use body language and talk with locals about their life-style,custom, and culture. Traveling on a group led by a guide lacks the precious moment to learn about a country in a first-hand experience. 

Traveling in a group led by a tour guide surely does have some benefits. We don't have to plan all our schedules, and we don't need to worry about not knowing something because the guide is there for you to explain everything. However, so far from all my journeys, the most memorable and long lasting experiences were those  that I traveled by myself. Starting from scheduling my itinerary, studying about the country, exploring new places, and meeting people from walks of street is truly the valuable and the real journey  I never forget.
