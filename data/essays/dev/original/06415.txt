I agree with the comment that the yonger people now a days do not  give enough time for helping their communities. This could be a result of many reasons.Helping the community is a part of every persons duty. In improveing their community they would tend to improve their surroundings and their quality of living.
	For example, if there is a need for some good social workers for their communities they would not have much of their intrest in such a kind of aspects because they are busy with their work tensions. They would rather spend their time enjoying in some play groud or a film theater rather in doing some social work for their community.The younger generations now a days would prefer to stay out of halping their communities to develop because they are intrested in some other aspects.They would less concentrated on halping their community because some ego feelings which their fellow collegues would never do. They are very busy with their academic career that they do not have much time left for helping communities.
	It would not be the problem of the educational institutions for having such a tight schedule of academics. But it would be the sheer intrest of the younger people to have the community. It would be their personnel intrest for helping the community. Like wise there are very few younger people who would rather show some intrest in helping community.It would be the older people who would like to help more rather than the younger people because they have no work tensions. It would be rather correct to say they have much less work tensions rather than the younger people. So they would surely have some advantage over the younger people in helping their community.	
	In conclusion, i would like to say  that the younger people have very much less time for helping the community  when compared to the older people. It would help the community grow faster if the younger people show some intrest in their community because they are much more energetic and enthusiastic then the older people.
