Most advertisements today are aiming to capture the audience to purchase their products and compete with the other products in the market and so they tend to project their product as an essential purchase for one's happiness and well being. I personally feel that they make their producta appear much better and useful than they actually are.
         Some advertisements inflate the use of their product a little while some others make them appear to create outstanding results or even miracles in one's life. For example, take any of the aerated drinks' advertisement. They use prominent sportmen like David Becham or Michael Jordon to endorse their products to show the audience how their drink would enhance one's performance to become like their idols. Everyone knows that having a drink would'nt make them a star or play like one but just their idols being there in the advertisement maybe persuade them to purchase it. This may work for any purchase not costing much and people may make the small purchase either ways without the advertisement, just the matter of which brand to go for.
           Another way by which they make make their products look much better is by persuading people to purchase the product because it will make them look attractive and will influence their personal lives as well. Take the case of all the beaty products which promise to make you look better and attractive by spending a small amount on them. These advertisements may actually get the audiences' attention because everyone wants to look better by spending the minimal amount of money. These advertisements may particularly catch the attention of teenagers who always are ready to spend on any product that makes them look better in front of their peers.
            While some products may rope in big stars to get their point across, some may cash in on the small desires of the audience and ultimately market their product in the best possible way.By and large in most advertisements,overexaggeration of the product is what we witness. The competing products are shown in a light where we feel incomlete without using them.
