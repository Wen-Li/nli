It is a common statement that today young people do not give enought time to hepling their communities.
Although I think it is not always true, and each case should be considerated a part, I agree with this statement for several different reasons. Nowadays we are living in a world much more competitive than the past one was, furthermore, family is today normally composed only by parents and sons and this fact doesn't help youg people to develope their sense of comunity. 

Firts of all, the word where we are living in is getting more and more complex: for a young person is more diffucult today to achive his or her goals, to have a successful career ad a good job in order to give safety to his or her new family. This facts implies that today there's  generally not enought time to spend on taking care of someone else, like their communities.
 
The second problems is related to the normal structure of a family. Living in a such a small unit does't permit to develope, from chilhood, a sense of comunity and solidariety for other persons. 
If someone is used to live in a family with many brothers and sisters, and also grandparents, uncles and aunts, he would be maybe more sensitive to the problems of the others. 

In conclusion, I have to agree with the statement that sais that today yong people don't spend much time on hepling their communities for the reasons that I explained before. I've said " I HAVE to agree" because I think this is not a positive fact, and it gives a bad idea about young people, but, with sorry, I have to say that this is the truth.
