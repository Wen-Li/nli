	Will there be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today? What an important topic! Indeed, the reduction or increase of cars, and their effects on the environment, are mainly discussed in our every-day conversation and political programs. As far as I am concerned, I agree that there will be fewer cars in use in the near future than there are today. Let me explain why.

	On the first hand, the actual trend is that everybody (the government, households and corporations) has to take care of his or her environment, and it is going to be a real obligation in the next few years. Indeed, we all know that lots of things go wrong around us such like the global warming for example. Did you know that with this frightening global warming glaciers disappear and that can lead to the disappearance of the Maldives in less than twenty years for instance? So the point is that if we do nothing, we are certainly going to lose our planet and we will have to find somewhere else to live!  It is terrible, isn't it? The pollution contributes to the global warming and what is the primary source of pollution? These are obviously cars and their CO2. This gaz contributes too to many diseases... Therefore, cars have to be reduced.

	Moreover, the other transportation modes are developing in an impressiove manner. Let's take the example of Paris. We can notice that having a car is totally wrong with all this traffic in the streets! Why don't we take the bus instead? At least we definitely know what time exactly we are going to arrive. Driving in Paris can take four or five times more time than taking the bus, for exemple. 

	Finally, questions of security became so important in our society. We should reduce the number of cars because of the too many accidents it occurs. It is unacceptable.

	To conclude, I will just say that there is another solution: changing our actual polluting cars to ecological cars, which deeply consider and respect our environment. They can work with sun or non-polluting oils for example. I really think that this is the best solution since you can not order people to stop using their cars.
