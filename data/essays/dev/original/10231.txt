I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. 
	The phenomenon appears in a lot of different categories, but one of the most import ones is business. Success is often related with money, which means, that a well know company would take more risk than a small family business. That is not completly true since one has to remember that the opportunities of a big company are much higher becuase they have the financial resources. But if one compares a successful company with an unsuccesful company one will see that the the compay with a high profit is risking more than the other one. 
	For example, Coca Cola is nowadays one of the most successful companies in the world.  But it did not start form the beginning as a big company. It started with only one product called Cola. When Coca Cola was establish on the world market the Coca Cola company raised its porfit each year. After that the Coca Cola company took a huge leap of faith a invested in a new produced called Fanta and Sprite. That was very risky because the people might not like the new drinks and would not buy them so that the Cocal Cola company would not get back their production cost. But even if they would have lost all the money they invested into the new produvct the Coca Cola company had remaind as a successful company. 
	In general, successful business take more often risks to gain even more porfit rather than unsuccessful buisness because it does not matter to them if they loose.
