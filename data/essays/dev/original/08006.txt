I agree that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities. It is because that the technology now is much better than before, the young people now are too happy, and the effect of the media. 

     The technology today we have is way better than 10 or 15 years ago and young people have more entertainment in their life. The bad thing is that most of the young people spend most of their time to go along with these entertainment such as TV, Vadio games, MP3, and computer. Compare to the older days, people would be more helpful in their communities since they did not have much entertainment. They would spend a whole afternoon in a community centre to help and learn. Young people would spend most of their time in front of a computer or a TV instead of helping their communities is because there are too many better things waiting for them.

     Moreover, not caring other people is the point of view that the young people mostly having now. It is because they have not been in a hard time in their life since birth. They are too happy, and so they do not have an idea of helping others. The older people would spend time to help others because they know that even a little help would be a gift for some people. So, the young people would not spend a lot of time to help thier communities because they do not know that their help would be a great reward for some people. 

     Finally, the attudite of the young people is a problem as well. If the media encourage them, there would be a lot of helpers in the world. Media is the passway that the young people related the most, so if the media encourage the young people to spead time to help their communities and tell them that a lot of people would need help, they would spend more time to help . 

Therefore, the improvment of technology, the way and attudite that the society is having now and the effect of the media are the most important things that make young people do not give enough time to help their communities.
