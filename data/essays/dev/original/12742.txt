I partly  agree with the statement  that  young people now a days donot give enough time to helping their communities because of the lack of time  and do u lack of awareness. It also depends on the individual attitudes of the people .

Most of the young people have a busy schedule and they dont find time in helping their communities .Again it depends on their individual attitudes. I have seen many people who wantedly neglect .
They wantedly neglect and think helping communities is waste of time even though they have ample of time . 

Young people always try to find fun and act reluctantly when they asked to help .It is because they are  not aware of the benefits and the happiness they get out of it .Studies alone dont count you should also have helping nature.

On the other side  there  are many youth organisations who specifically aim at helping their communities and people in need  . We have many blood banks where many young people come and register everyday . They collect blood and send them to hospitals when needed for free.They organise events and give prizes for those who donated blood to inspire young people 
We also have organisations who go around  and collect money
and send them to people who get effected byenvironmental disasters . when the tsunami catastrophe left many people homeless these youth organisation collected huge amounts of money andhanded over to them and won their hearts.

So it is not that young people dont help, it is that they dont spend time due to lack of awareness. It is only possible by young people because they are energitic and dynamic in what ever they do all we need to do is motivate them and tell about importance of helping.  Elders should teach young people about helping people and spending some of their time for those activities.

So i conclude that young people dont give enough time for helping but they are not so cruel that they dont extend a helping hand when needed .
