Schools that teach k-12 students require students to study various subjects. These subjects that the students learn are not necessarly useful in their carrier. I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.
 If it is better to master in one specific subject, why do the schools teach numerous subjects to the students? A student might agree that the subjects that they are learning in school is useless and meaningless to learn. This is not true because as you grow more mature you will realize that the thing you learned in school really comes to help in the real life. So it is better to study and have knowledge on various types of subjects rather than having unlimited knowledge on one subject.
 It may seem better to specialize in one specific subject when you get a specific job that require those knowledges you learned. Well, this is just in your carrier. When you get out to the social world, the things you learned are too professional that no one, but you and people who work with it understand. If you want to get involved in a social life and understand life better, it is better to know many  things. For an example, when you go to a party where all kinds of different people gather. You want to talk to people, but you only know that specific topic and do not know other topics that people talk about. As a result, you will be secluded and feel alone.
 In conclusion, it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. With broad, but many knowledge you will enjoy better life where you are not left behind, and you will be able to appreciate other people's opinion more. On the other hand if you only know about a specific subject, you will be left alone and feel secluded. To lead a successful life, it is better to know alot of thing rather than a specific topic.
