Nowdays, advertisements are a key element of trade business. Indeed, advertisements are always used as a mean to improve sell of goods. Some persons think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I agree with this statement.
The reaon why advertisements were invented is to increase the level of sells. Therefore, advertisements promote products and must convince the buyer that he needs the promoted products. To this aim, the products are presented as the best product ever invented eventhough it is often false. Advertisements are created to attract customers, to make them buy the proposed products. 
For instance, it is common to see on television advertisements which explain that the presented product has been tested by a certain number of customers who expressed their satisfaction when they used the product. However, there is no proof of such study and those results cannot be ascertained. 
 The promoted product must appeal to the customer and therefore, lot's of technological means are used in order to improve the picture of products. Indeed, nowdays, lot's of software are invented in order to fix pictures , to erase some elemets of the pictures. To some extent advertisments are often diffused on television, the best way to attract customers is to show a beautiful product, with nice colours and nice shape. 
For example, advertisemts often concern food products. When a cake is promoted, the nice colour of the cake will obviously attract the customer. In the same vein, the nice shape of the cake will also appeal to the customer. Therefore, the customer will buy the product, thinking that he will get the same article as the one exposed in the advertisement and he will be desappointed because the cake cannot have, in real, the same colour as the one obtained thanks to informatic sofware used for pictures. 
As a conclusion, advertisments are always using false information and it is difficult to put boundaries between well conducted advertisemenst and false information.
