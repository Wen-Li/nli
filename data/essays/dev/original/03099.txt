It is absolutely true that most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they reallly are. But how this happens? That is not an easy is question to answer, but I think this is also the only question to make in order to understand why advertisements have this particular effect.
I believe that the main strategy used by market analysts is simply to influence people by touching their weaknesses.
Everyone of us for example, or at least most of us, wants to be accepted by society (our group of friends or our collegues). It is un unconscious process but it is like that, and we can do nothing against it. As a consequence of this process we tend to buy the products that we feel could change in a better way the conception that the other have of us; any object that could improve of our social image is certainly to be bought.
I will try to make an example. If I know that David Beckam shaves with a particular aftershave I might think that by using that specific product I will achieve the same social approval he has.
That is why most advertisements use famous people to sponsorize a product: because we unconsciously want to be like them.
Any way, the question is whether there is a solution to this kind of problem, it is in fact a problem the one we are talking about, because linked to a weakness of modern social communities.
I simply think that, considered that we cannot change the entire costumes of our society, the starting point is being aware of this fact. This way of reasoning  will make us more critics on advertisments, whose products will seem no more as attractive as we thought they were before.
