I am totally agree with this statement. No matter successful people or normal people, they all need to try new things and take risks. If they only do what they already know, they are learning nothing. Successful people try new things an take risks are the best thing that they need to do. For example, a animal professior who discover medicine for humans. If they only make the medicines that we all already know and already have, so this is not called discover and they are no longer needed. Of course they need to find out new medicines and it takes risks because they test animals. Another example is students who are successful in study. Why are they successful? The reason is they already try new things such as read a lot of different books and communicate with teachers. The risky thing is taking extra exams that are not required. If students do not read a lot of books and evaluate themselves, how can they be successful students? They will stay the same without study new things. They cannot only study what they know well. Otherwise, they cannot open-minded. For me, I have a personal story about this topic. I am trying new things an also taking risks. I came to America for study. I am trying to study new cultures and language. I am not successful yet, but I am trying to be successful. Also this is a risk for me because my parents cannot afford me to study university in America. The tuition is too high. My parents have to take care of me and my brother. International students cannot work off-campus. I could not find any job in-campus. This is a really big challenge for me to study abroad. Therefore, I agree with statement.
