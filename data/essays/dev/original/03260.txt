                                                  The New Things
	I agree if you try new things and take more risk you can achieve your goals and earn big moneys.I am talking abaout money because my major is a international trade in my university and i would like to do this business buying an d selling somethings.I know how to do this job but i think trying new things for instance you can buy another product and you can change it and sell.It has more risk, may be you cannot sell cahanged product.

	Successfull people in my country always trying new things for their goal.They are sometimes loosing but if they win, they would have more profit.For example,Its a biggest turkish company. First its a shoe company, they produce shoes and export it.They know how to do well shoes.One day the owner who has a company tried another things they sell all of his property (his factory, his business,his car, etc.) And he bought a land for produce onion.He doesnt know anything about how to produce onion, how to sell.?ts like a gambling.He found a farmer who is living in a rural place.He helped to produce onion and selling process.And they found small packages for onions.For example 1pound, 3 pounds packages and they sold directly markets.It makes more profitable and more usefull for consumers.And he has a onion brand name.Now the ex shoe producer has a big onion's farms and he earns 1 billion dollar a year, he is exporting onions all over the world its a big deal.

	In my opinion trying new things and take a risks are not good for everyone because you need a little bit good luck in your business life.
