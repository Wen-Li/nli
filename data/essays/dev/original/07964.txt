There are many ways to travel, such as travelling with our family, with our friends, as an individual or in a group led by a tour guide.
Also the way we choose to travel is highly dependent on a place we choose to go.
From my personal experiences, I think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way if we would like to go to a new place or city.
There are several reasons for this, first and maybe the most important one is that we might choose a country or a city that the local language is not our mother tongue, so the tour guide would be a helpful resource in this case and of course s/he would help us doing the procedures such as booking a hotel, knowing the restaurants,etc, while entering the place. 
Also, as we are new in the city and we do not know many things about its social culture,by having a tour guide with us, we can easily be informed of the useful information about the habits and cultue of the people in that specific country, and we can be well prepared for the travel.
The second reason, in my opinion, is the fact that we surely would like to visit many new places in our travel and of course get many new information about the history, art, social life, music, etc of the place. How can we obtain such an information if we travel without a group led by a professional tour guide having lots of interesting information about the city?
I think it might be possible to do all of these things if we travel individualy, but really we will waste lots of time on it.
Third and last, To travel in a group is much more safer than the other ways, since there might be some possible dangers along out trip, the tour members can be helpful in these cases.
All in all, If I choose a new place to go,I prefer to travel in a group led by a skillful tour guide to have a great time and enjoy my trip.
