I am completely positive about the statement. Here i would like to mention some reasons why a group travel is the best way to travel. I work for a travel company as a tour guide, so i guess i confirm advantages of group travelling.
  First of all, tourists feel secure when they are travelling with plenty of people and their guide, who is a local resident of the site. Group travelling people can defend themselves in time difficult times and it is more likely to acttract public attention for requesting for help. In some places, it is suggested to tourists not to go out alone because of high velocity rate. 
  Second reason why i prefer group travel is payment for the travel cost. Needless to say, it is noticably cheaper than single travel for certain countries. Even a number of tour companies offer special programmes for group tourists, not only discounts, but also free-of-charge trips for group leaders or certain amount of members.   The third reason serves our company's main goal, More people, more fun. It is much interesting to travel with many different people in order to have a real vacation. Group tourists can attend different competitions, matches and other attractive entertainment. 
  Travelling is not only the meaning of to travel, but to make friends and to get relationship with them. It offers people more chances to make friends in an easier way. I know of many occasions that tourists get marry after a long, exciting tour. 
  in conclusion, i have a strong point of view of travelling as a group. Tourists feel more secure, more respect and guides feel more responsibility when they are travelling as a group.
