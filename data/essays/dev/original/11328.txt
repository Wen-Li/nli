Cars are one of major means of transportation. In fact, when the opportunuties ,such as comfort and rapid access to locations, it provides is considered, it is the inevitable vehicle of people.Although some people may argue that cars cause certain problems such as crowdedness or air pollution, I do not foresee any change in the number of cars in use in the coming twenty years. 
It is debated that cities are so full of cars that in the near future people can not use cars due to the crowd. Besides, the traffic jam that cars create  is proposed a solution by decreasing the number of cars. But one should also take the vital importance of cars to human life into account. Cars are integrated to the life style of people. It is used ubiqutiously in public life. People go to work or urgent patients are delivered to hospital by cars. In fact, car is a symbol of civilization. 
A second point hat cars lead to problem is the air pollution . Exhaust gases are thougt to cause air pollution and greenhouse effect is triggered.It is true but this does not mean that number of cars in use should decrease. This problem can be solved by changing the energy source cars utilize. For example, solar energy of hydrogen energy can be considered as alternatives. 
In conclusion, in my opimion,number of cars in use is not expected to decrease. In stead, it becomes more wide spread, however the source of energy cars consume may change.
