In spite of the benefits of learning facts, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts. There are three main reasons why I have this opinion.
In the first hand, I support the idea that understand ideas and concepts in a field (for instance economy) gives a overall comprehension of this field and the process that can occur in that field. Thus, it allows graduate students that come into the labor market to meet the requirements of numerous jobs even if they did not study certain characteristics of some tasks.
Then, I have the belief that when a student has well understood ideas and concepts in a field, he is then able not only to understand the new events that can take place in this area,  but also to learn itself from this fact.
Finally, from my perspective, the facts are widely dependant from the time and the conditions in which they occur. Consequently,   an event that took place in a certain situation or a certain country, for example a major workers strike in France before a change in political majority, can not be interpreted than one in Bangladesh during a very harsch time. Futhermore, facts may be linked to a fashion in the way of thinking or the way of product goods. An illustration of this idea could be the the fact that an American citizen sold a lot of French foie gras because he likes that at a certain period, but still not do that because of a change in both the relationship between the American government and the French one, and the way to consider the treatment of the ducks. 
However, I admit that learning facts may help a understand concepts either not concrete at all or a little difficult. 
As a conclusion, I think that it is both more important and useful for the future life for students to understand ideas and concepts. Nevertheless, learning facts can sometimes be necessary.
