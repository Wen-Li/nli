I agree with the statement mentioned that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
If students learn only facts then they don't have conceptual knowledge or idea that where and how to use in practical.
For example,a maths teacher taught one problem and solved without giving the concept of that problem like formula,method or steps to perform to solve the problem.This will be difficult for the students ,if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination.They cannot solve the problem as they don't know the concept of the problem given.So a maths teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially and based on that idea a problem should be solved by the teacher and then the students keep the concept remembered ,so that they can easily solve the any problems based on that concept.

For every problem there will be a concept behind to solve it.
Another example as, if we see the physics book there will be lots of concepts for each and every chapter.In that there is a chapter calle "GRAVITATION".In this the idea is about the Earth's gravitation.Due to gravity whatever the things thrown in the air from earth's surface it will fall on the earth again because of gravitational pull of the earth.If we say to the students that the things which were thrown in the air from earth will fall back to the earth's surface,then they just learn the fact. They don't know the reason.Due to this type of learning none of the students will not become good engineers or any other professionals.Because lack of concepts and practical knowledge.

Even if we take a civil engineer student who don't know how to build the building and where to build then definitely the building will be collapse.

That is why, it is important for the students to learn concepts and understand the ideas rather than to learn facts.
