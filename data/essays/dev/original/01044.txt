Does most advertisements make products seem much better than they reallly are? Recently this issue has been brought into focus and aroused a fierce public debate. Many people hold the opinion that it is due to the corlorful advertisements the products looks much better than they really are, while the opinion is strongly opposed by numerous people who believe that all the advertisements show the reality to the costomers. However, as far as I am concerned, I agree with the former which is most advertisements in our daily life making products seem better than they really are. 

To begin with, from my point of view, damaging our health is among the drawbacks of advertisements making products look better than they really are. For instance, in order to get more profits, many medical merchants cheat the consumers by advertising their drugs extraggrately. By using this method, the merchants are likely to become rich, however, many costomers who have perchased the medicine may be facing with some healthy problems the bad medicine brings about. That is why I said some advertisements make products seem better than they really are.   

On the other hand, considerable though the benifits that advertisements results in are, they cannot compete with the drawbacks that the advertisements making products seem much better than they really are brings about, if economic issues have been taken into deliberation. For example, a number of merchants use advertisements to make their products look better in order to make more money, while the costomers do not realise the fact so they often spend large sums of money to buy a worthless product. After a period of time, they finally find out they are cheated. The example tell us that the impacts that ads has on our economicis life is huge.

In conclusion, there may be some elements of truth in the thoughts of some people that advertisements do not make the products seem much better than they really are. However, in my mind, most advertisements which make products seem better than they really are really affect many people's health and processions. In order to enjoy a healthier and happier life, some measures must be taken to manage the advertise industry to make advertisements tell the truth to the massive costomers.
