There are a lot of reasons and facts that agree with that statement but there are also facts that do not agree with it. In the following I will first talk about young peolpe like teenagers and then old people and after come to a reasonable conclusion.
       Young peolpe quite enjoy their life since they are very activ and energetic. They have the power to party and have fun for most of the time. The main factor I would say that they enjoy life more than old ones is because they do not have that many responsibilties and worries in life as old people. They are helped financiallz and mentally by their parents so they do not have to work or suffer in any kind of dispute like this. Another reason that they enjoy life more is that they probably have so many things to try out and so many places to visit, since everything is better when you try it for the first time, they have a big advantage there. 
       Old people though have also a lot of reasons to enjoy life at its maximum. If you have been a nice and fun person throughout your life which could mean that you could have more friends than younger people since you have more experience in friendships than them.
When you are an adult, you have a lot more freedom than younger people. So you can do things that they can not do, for example small incidents like going on vacation without anyones permission or making a decision that can affect your whole life style.
In my opinion I agree with that statement because even though youg people are more limited in doing things, it is much more fun and exciting. And you do not have to worry about that many things like your future, your job or your financial status.
