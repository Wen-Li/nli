It is said that fortune favours the brave. On the same lines, it can be said that success follows people who try new horizons, who extent their limit of vision and dare to take on new challenges in a world that is everchanging. I think that successful people keep trying new things and do not get stuck on any one thing.

The world has seen many industialists who tried different businesses. Though they succeeded on some and failed in others, on a whole they emerged as winners. One bright example that I would like to mention is that of an Indian businessman - Tata. Tata put his first foot in the world of business with an automobile manufacturing unit. He collaborated with foreign companies to provide best available technologies to customers. The business started with trucks but soon flourished to other class of vehicles. Recently, Tata introduced cheapest four wheeler on Indian roads for common man. This journey is amazing. But this is not the only thing that Tata did.

Tata started different businesses apart from automobile. Tea, salt, information technology, telecom - he seems to be ubiquitious. He is also successful in these businesses. Now he is planning to take over world famous brand 'Jaguar'. Certainly, Tata took great risk when he started every new industry. But great returns demand great risks. A man with vision can handle such risks and emerge out as a winner. These are all qualities of a successful person.

Had Tata been interested only with manufacturing of trucks, he never had had such a great impact on all other business areas. He tried out new things and his efforts paid off. His success surely belongs to the way he conquered new opportunities of business.

Thus, it can surely be said that one who does same thing that he already know how to do well will have less chance to succeed than the one who try different things and takes calculated risks for greater rewards.
