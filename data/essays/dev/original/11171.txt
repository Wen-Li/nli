I disagree with the idea that young people do not enough time to helping their communities for the following reasons,

First, young people have a lot of concerns about receiveing others respects through contibuting to their comumnities. For example, some Tokyo universtiy students who live near my city nowadays  began to clean the river-side.They ususlly come to rive-side to bring up trashes, cans desposed on it. As the result, the river became vey clean. Then the people in the area appreicated to them very much. And they are proud of the activity. This show that young people want to receive respect of others by helping community.

Second, the rise of concern for environment helps young people contribute to their commuities. They have had more chances to learn environmental issues. As the result, young peolpe have more concern to environment surronding them. For example, when I was a freshman in  Kyoto university in Japan, there was a lot of lecture about an environment. The universty students often join events conducted by the near-by cities for preserving the environment.
Thus, I strongly believe that  young people contribute to their commnity. 


Therefore, I am strongly against hte idea that young people do not give enough time to hepling their communities.
