The statement "It is better to have broad knowledge of many
academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject" is an important point, which plays a big role in society,especially in education.

On the one hand you can agree with this statement, because it is very important to have a basic background of education. You should know the basic facts in different academic subjects. This way of thinking we can find in schools. At school the pupils are eccept to be good in every subject. The souhld be good at maths, languages, biology, chemistry and sports. So a pupil has to concentrate for every subject to achieve good results after school.

On the other hand critical people would ask: "Why should a pupil, who is good and very interested in maths be also good and interestesd in sports?" This would be the other way of thinking. Some parents for example think that is enough when pupil are talented in certain subjects, because after school they go to a university, where they also concentrate just on a special subject, which they choose to study.

I am of the opinion that a mix of two ways is the best solution.I think, people and espaccially children, should have a basic education in ervery subject. It makes no sense to send a child very early to a school, which is based on a special subject, like a science school for example or a sports school. Pupils should learn the basic information in poltics or in geography and other important subjects.I think it is a good way to send children firstly on a normal school and after graduating pupils have to decide on their own, where they want to go and wich university mostly agrees with their own interests. So the pupils would have a basic knowledge which you need in society and after this they can concentrate on a special subject.
