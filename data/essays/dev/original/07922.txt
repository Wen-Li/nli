As our topic is about The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.i strongly agree with the note,as it has adavantages over the travelling with out a guide.first we discuss about the travel with out guide.
As everyone interested to go to new places as per their knowledge.they want to know the each and every thing present over there.before going everyone will do research about that ,and information we got is very little when compare when we encountered it.sometimes it misses out good places sourrounded to that,no one is ready to explain  the histroy of cultures and history of that place and also the how the importance came to that place,all these information is known to the people who staying overthere or people who visits often to the places.
Now come to the travel with guide,as they  have very best of information.now i will give my personal experince so that it elevates the advantages of travel with guide,during my college days we went to the nothern part of the india,it included few places.when went to Tajmahal there we found very beautifull monument ever built,the guide explained the when it was built ,who statrted this, and cultures followed that time,and some important things he told,after listening the lecture he made about Tajmahal,we came to know we had very little information about that.we very much excited about the information, we really felt like we are viewing that constuction and art.As we thought Tajmahal was the only place to visit,but the guide showed another beautiful monument just away from Tajmahal .we dont about that before,that was also a good piece too.After that we faced some problems regarding our trip,just lack of enough time,in that time our guide was so helpful,he planned accordingly out timings so that we not lost even single location.As the guide was a local guy he provided good food too.Throughout the journey we made with guide is very interesting and very helpful,after the tour we heard and learned good things like history information about the places etc.
Finally my conclusion was its not possible to know the things that really happened at the historical places,few things we can read or listen about those places but some we may not.so taking a guide is really helpful and informative.so that we can get more information than when we went to the travel without  guide.
