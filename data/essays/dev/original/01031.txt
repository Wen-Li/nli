Advertising has always been a interesting discussion topic for the people. some people think that advertising is not very effective and does not do any wonders. on the other hand, there are also some people who think that advertising really has alot to do. and I think, I would be counted in the second group.

Advertising may make anything better by the a good picturization of that product. the better the picturization, the better would be fascination towards the product. and looks matters alot.for example, we go to some coffee shop and there we see alot of coffees and all the coffees are totally unknown to you. which one would you like to have? certainly, that looks most appealing to you. isn't it? that is where advertising comes into the picture. Its magic of advertising. 

Advertising enables us to show the good sides of anything. as we all know, that anything in this world is not perfect. all the things have dark sides too.so with a little help of advertisment, we can highlight the positive points of some product and can hide the negative parts.
for an instance, lets take example of cold drinks like, cola, pepsi etc.  these drinks are so popular among the people.but the question is why are they? while we know that these drinks are not good for health. even then they do a great deal of bussiness all over the world. Credit of this should go to the advertising. advertising totally hid the negative effects of the drinks and made them popular.

Nowadays, even some schools are providing training for how to do the advertising. these schools considers advertising as an art. and we all know that what art is for. yeah, to increase the beauty of something. and thats what an advertisement does. advertisement increases the worth of the product. 

 A coin has two faces. now, it is upto us how we are going to show it to the others. Advertising not only tells us how should we present something , but also how to present it with even a better looks. In conclusion, advertisement enhances the worth and beauty of the products. and that make people buy them.
