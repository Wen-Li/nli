The contemporary youth is surrounded by very different challenges as well as distinctive opportunities to organize their lives. The competition at the job market, for instance, has become very hard and education is now considered to be of utmost importance for future prospects. This can lead to the fact that many youths have not the time to help their communities due to the time they spend studying for school or college.
Additionally, modern young people have many options to spend their leizure time. There are so many opportunities for youths to spend their free time, that they might forget to think about others. Media like the television, computer or the internet are just a few opportunities to spend free time. Due to this reason, the youths might be overstrained with the diversity of possibilites that surrounds them. Another factor which can keep young people from being concerned about their community can be that many of them are just to lazy to offer their help. The generation of so called "couch potatoes" illustrates this issue. Many young people are just hanging around either at home or anywhere else. The reason for this might be, on the one hand, that they lack the guidance of their parents which spend often the whole day working. On the other hand, the invention and improvement of computer games and other sources can be a reason why young people spend less time outside the four walls of their room.
In addition to this point, it seems also reasonable to me that life standard which has considerably been improved in the contemporary society has made students dull and even indifferent. Many young people just do not care if others need their help since they are satisfied with what they have and do not see any reason to think of others, especially their community.
With reference to these reasons I would agree with the statement that young people do not spend enough time helping their community in the contemporary society. The youth, in generall, has many interests that have nothing to do with their community, which can be the peer group, the media, the school and a huge amount of other issues. Additionally, they lack some guidance of their parents or other adults who could make the community more attractive to them.
