	It is often said that there will be no more traffic-jam in the future. Scientists have been developing a flying car and bigger and faster public transportation vehicle will be developed. Howevere, I formly disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in next twenty years. There will be more population than today and there will be many barriers to use those technologies actually.
	To begin with, growing the number of population will make the world more complicated and complex and each person will have own car. Compared with the past, it is true that we have a lot more cars nowadays than the past. For example, in Seoul, Korea, three of ten had a own car even ten yeas ago. How about now? The percentage of possesion is almost same with the past. However, the number of cars is five times more than 1990s'. 
	In addition, twenty years are not enough time to develop some new technology and actuallly use it.  The government  have tried to make new subway system and monorail system within ten years, but the thing was already twenty years ago. There is no any changes and they have still been planning. For example, one of the experts from the government said last week, they were planning to adapt new system for aircraft within five years. The essay for the next day, however, criticized that the government should finish the Airforce-military system changing plan which had not been finished for ages. Also, it said, "no more people in this country believe the government!" 
	In conclusion, we all hope that a fewer cars is in the world  in the future. It should be replaced by the great public transportation, such as subway and buses. Also, government should make the cost of flights much cheaper than now. However, I do not agree with that there will be a fewer cars in use than now in the next twenty years with all these reasons.
