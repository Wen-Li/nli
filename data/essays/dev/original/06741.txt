I agree with this statement. Advertising is an art, an art of making products seem attrative and perfect. It is also the art of convincing the consumers to buy the product. Consumers who are not wise enough or who are too influencable buy products because of the advertisements.

First of all I would say adverstiment companies tend to have a lot of money so they can make beautiful, attrative advertisements.They have a lot of means to attract to consumer. TV advertsiments are the easiest way to convince a consumer to buy your product whereas written advertisments in newspapers for example are less convincing because they are not interactive. On TV ads you can see people use, eat the product the company is selling. They reach more easily the consumer. 
Second of all, advertisments are made to make products seem better than they are in real life. It is an art. For example when you see an advertisment for a frozen pizza, the pizza always looks hot, savourous. Usually you can see the cheese melt whereas when you buy it and you heat it up it is nothing compared to that advertisment, it is a normal frozen pizza not a home made one.
Third of all advertisement is a lure for consumers. People do not buy a product for its consistency but for the way it looks in the ad. Sometimes ads tend to lie about the the qualities of the product for example toothpaste that make your teeth white as the snow, or a soap which eliminates all the imperfections of a teenage skin. 

To conclude I would say advertisement make products seem much better than they really are because it is one of the goal of advertsiment the first one being to sell a product. But to sell a product in huge quantities you have to make it special, better than the others, attractive or even emphazise the results of this product.
