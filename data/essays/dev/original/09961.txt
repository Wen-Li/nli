In these days, college have many programes to offer for students. Each student has different opinion about having broad knowledge of many academic subjects thand to specialize in one specific subject. Personally, I think to have specialize in one specific subject can much achievment for the goal.
	Fistly, if you learn many things academic subjects, you cannot learn deeply. For instance, when I was high school student, I learned lot of things during the three years. I could not concentrated one subject because there are too much topic so, I cannot find related each subject. Therefore, it does not help me to learn many subjects so, I prefer to learn just one subject. It can be more concentrate for me. 
	Secondly, in these days, we have specialize person for each division parts. When you know broad things and  does not know specific about their subject, you cannot do anything in our society. Many people do the best their own subject and they are become speciall person who knows really well about their own department. If you concentrated just one subject and learned lots of things, you can help people who wants to need to you. However, if you learned lots of subjects, you did not get specific lessons from that subjects.
	Lastly, we do not have lots of time to learn everything during the life. We have lots of subject aroud us and if you choose one subject you should concentrated that because we do not have much of times to learn just one subject too. For example, I am nusing students so, I always think about care for patient and learned lots of things for patient. I do not have much of time to learn lots of subject because, I am not perfectly to learn whole one subject. One subjects has lots of things so, I decided learn only one things. When I all in the nusing, I can improve my care skills. Therefore, I will be a better nurse when I will graduated. I think, to concentrated one subject, can be make more specialize their own position.
	To conclude, there are many subject in our life. Everyone wants to learn everthing but we cannot learn everything because each subject has lots of material. In my opinion, learn to specialize in one specific subject is the better than have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because, if you concentrated just one subject, you can be learn lots of things deeply.
