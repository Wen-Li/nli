There is one or two thing make a country more powerfull and more beatiful. On of them is young people in the country. If they can work for their communities  good they can make their country very beautiful too. However i think its so hard to set young people for this type actions. Because they grow up so stupidly and so lazy. They have been train from their parents to act like these.
	At this time young people start to think their self more than  otherthing when they are a little child. They force their family to do their wants with crying and other things to whichs are family dont see in their child. They act like this beause families dont give them to thinkings to understand what happened in the world and what should them do to survive in this wolrd. They grow up and enter a world which they dont know to live with. They are not ready to see real world how can they live in this world. They did more thing when they are growing but they dont give time to understand  their communities.So how can they help to their communities even if they dont know their communities requirements.Howevet i think this is not young adults faults. This is their parents fault, this is fault of who manage their country or their world.
	Because of all of these young people do not give time to helping their communities. Yes i accept this 's not all of their faults.They can easily trained to be good child,good citizen and so good people.We can solve this problem with some formules if we are really want to solve this. We can give our teens responsibility to their communities.We can give them good opportunities to think more and help their communities.
