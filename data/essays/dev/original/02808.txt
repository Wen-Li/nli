From the newest article, I heard about the successful person who tried new things and took risks. It talks to me about the one of good ways to succeed in our major is using our imagination for new things and trying risks. Also, I agree this opinion, and want to talk about more detail.
	First, I want to talk about new things. When I was grown up, I heard many successful people's stories such as Adison and Nobel. Those people are accomplish their dream to using their imagination to try new things. In addition, it is based on our civilization's development because people always want to have good, interesting and convenient things, so from the invention of new things, they will buy those and satisfy. In other words, invention of new things can get more money, and sometimes we can get a fame. As a result, it a good ways to be a successful people. 
	The second reason is based on the taking risks. Risks are dangerous in our lives. For example, if we fail to make some good new things, we will lost all of things such as house, family and the other things. However, if we prepare it before risks are started, we can reduce. In addition, there are no risks about new things, we cannot create new things because always new things are related some risks which is dangerous in our lives. Although, sometimes we can figure out risks for our successful, we try to make new things. Moreover, we have to take care of ourself, and always we have to prepare some bad situations. For preparing the bad situation, we can reduce on the damage, when some risks are happened. 
	In our lives, we always demand new things than before. Even if it can take risks to the person who try new things, it is a short way to be a successful person. Sometimes, from overcome the bad situation, we can be important people. For these reason, I would like to say that trying new things and taking risks help us to be a successful person. Moreover, those behaviors make us positive and considerable people.
