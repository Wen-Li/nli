I disagree with the saying that understanding ideas and concepts is important for a student than it is to learn facts.ideas gives the student a invoke for what and how a task has to be done.concepts are studied from the earlier editions of books and from some written or, generally saying,from an abstract on wat is already done.concept also means basic idea of what is to be done.concept is the general background of any subject considered.ofcourse ,without concept nothing is done properly,for example taking a major.A student does not catch up with the course if he has no idea about the concept or the basics of the course.
	Facts is a very lively word to listen.fact explains which is true,true and only true.facts are the things to be considered in every particular task.According to me, learning facts always puts us in the place where we have to be.Learning facts sounds to something like behaviour,personal experience,something done.for example, giving a test wchich is relly new to a student.he has to give many practice tests in order to face the experience when on the real test.if the student just goes to the test with all ideas and fully known concept,it woud not be that good resulting as it would be when he takes practise test before.
	Another example is putting up a new business.a man planning to start a new business,he has to learn the ideas, the concept of marketing,and as well the experiense.he has to observe some businessman ,how they work with the daily shares.having an idea an the basic knowledge about the business does not just click into the market.there would be less profit in the work done without learning facts.
	So,these observations conclude that half knowledge is always dangerous.thus,i disagree with the saying, more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
