often happen that we can hear elderlies complain about their conditions, such as " ohh my god, I am too much old, I don"t do anything, I am tired...".Instead  usually youg people enjoy to be  on youthhood, to be active, to go around. I think this fact is displayed in any family that has got a grandmother or an elderly in general and some child. If is true that maybe we are get used to hear this king of thing I think that the real situation is different. 
First I think that when old people talk about their healt conditions is only another way to tell "hello I am here". After probably they certain don"t fell so bad to involve that they fell sick. When you are old maybe can happen to be alone for long time, have got too much time to think. As a result you start to consider too much your feeling. Image if you start to think that your foot hurt you, probably after one day you will be really hurted from that. Why? And if is only  because the power of our mind sometime overcome our own sight. I don-t know if is true but often I thought to be sick and at the end it wasn-t anything. So can be. 
Second what can you talk to someone that come to meet you if you during the day was setting spending your time lookink the street, nothing I think.
But now talk about the young. In my opinion is really bad listen some young guy that complains about his or hers age, probably he do be really sick, in his or hers mind. It is rare but sometime happen to listen these gender of people that spend their time continuosly claiming to be sick. You are not! you have got the common problem that a guy can meet during his or hers age of growth. You are raising. 
By the end  I think that every age has got a good reasos to be live. When you are old because you childhood, when you are young because you are full of energy, the world seems under your feet, that wait only you. So probably the best thing that we can do is think by ourself, our result and what will happen tomorrow. The life is so a guess that we mustn-t be bored because sometime this don-t go where we want. Life is life and age as well.
