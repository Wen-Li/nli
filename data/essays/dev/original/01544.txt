HAVING A BROAD KNOWLEDGE OF MANY ACADEMIC SUBJECTS, OR SPECIALIZING IN ONE SPECIFIC SUBJECT?
	Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make the students know a little of every subject but it won't get focused on a specific subject. Specializing in one specific subject can make the students know everything in one subject but won't make them know almost anything about other subjects.
	People choose jobs and they only have to know all the information about that specific subject that they work on. They aren't responsible to know information about any other subject. These way the distrubition of jobs are formed.
	Although this way job distrubitions are formed, knowing everything about one subject can make people boring. Knowing a little about every subject makes people open minded and more interesting. They can look at the world at different angles and since humans are social livings, a little color into everyone's life is needed.
	If people only knew about one topic and had no idea about any other topic, everybody would be boring. People would only make friends with people of the same job type because they would have no common subject with people of other job types.
	If the people knew a little of everything and did not focus on one topic, then everybody would have to do all of its work itself and no job distribution would be made. Also subjects like science, history, geography, surgery, etc.. would not go alot of distance because nobody would be working on mainly one topic. This way new inventions and explorements would not be made.
	In the conclusion, I think only focusing on one subject and not knowing anything about other topics, also knowing a little of every topic and not focusing on one are both bad but if I had to choose one, I would say that specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects because this way the standards of life do not decrease, only people get more boring and have friends only of their own area of knowledge, but by having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects make the life standards decrease.
