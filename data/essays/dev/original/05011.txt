	In that essay I am going to tell if I agree to the question or not. I kind of idea states that it is important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, other idea states that learning facts is more beneficial. I support the idea of this question. It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Because, in order to find something new a student should learn the basic concepts and ideas. Learning facts is a part of the working. It is more important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts. In the academic world, in universities we are told that learning concepts and ideas are more important because by learning that you can learn the facts and you can make the facts more efficient for humanity.
	Suppose an electrical engineering student wants to make an innovation about the transistor concepts. Transistor is a kind of device that is used in all electronic devices. When that student wants to learn the facts, without knowing the ideas and concepts he can not be an engineer. An engineer should be innovative, should  think about something new. In order to invent something the concepts and the ideas should be understood. In order to learn the facts, a student should know the ideas and concepts, without knowing the concepts and ideas the student can not invent anything. He could be a electric technician. 
	 Think about communication area. 15 years ago mobile phones are not worldwide used. However, in that days everybody uses celular phones. Technology becomes more efficient by time. If the engineers and students just learn the facts, without knowing the ideas and concepts  it will be impossible for them to increase the technology level. By understanding the concepts they are sharing the information and technology can be used in a better way. 
	In conclusion I want to restate that it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts. If a student wants to introduce something new he should know the ideas and concepts. If he just learn the facts in my opinion he can not introduce something new. Thats the way that the academic learning is taught on universities. They tell by using ideas and concepts to way of learning. By these , we can learn facts but if just facts are taught there will be no way to increase the humanity level or technology there should be different opinions.
