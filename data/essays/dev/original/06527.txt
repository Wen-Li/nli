In my point of view, the mentinoed statement must get a lot of support and I personally agree with the statement saying that products are made to seem much better by advertising  than they really are.  I belive this speaking from a personal experience.  Once I bought a set of roller pens.  The specifacations were that those pens wrote in a 0.7 but when I used them, they were not even 0.3.  I think that the problem behind such an issue is the production company.  Those companies try to make their products as attractive as they can in order to attract the most consumers.  

Those companies forget that once someone buys anything that does much less than it says, it will be returned to the retail selling agent, and the retail selling agent will in return return it to the company where many other items have been returned.  The result of this is that the name of the company will not be mush in the market, and will have no future product under the same name.  It could be that what they were after is temporar profits.  If this is the case, they succeeded.  So, exaggerating the product's description and the exaggeration in claiming that a certain product does certain things, while in  reality does not leads the consumers to think about and try the product before they buy it.
