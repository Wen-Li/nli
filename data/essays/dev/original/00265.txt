Nowadays young people has change a lot, their education changes and they changes with it, is suposse to be a more liberal educacion with less rules and more freedom, but maybe we are giving freedom to people that is not ready to use it properly yet.
   
   What I wanted to say with that is that young people today spends more time looking at themselves than trying to be part of the society.
   
   Maybe is because they are living in a society that do not offers them what they are looking for and for that reason the are not in the mood to participate of their communities.

   We are living in the telecomunications era. You can live without human touch. Without going out of your own house. Most of young people thinks that his communiti is to small for them so they use internet to feel they are part of something really great, to feel importans. They do not mind if his neighbour needs salt or if his hometown is clean or not. They are upon all that.

   As an example I can use new kind of culture that I have red about in a magacine last week.It is a new way of life,it is very extended in Japan, and their philosophy of life is not to have any personal relation if it is not via internet. So they borke off whit their families and with their friends and they star living all by themselves. Using internet for everything, for working, make their shoping, make friends and all the natural things that we are use to do in our lives.

   Hearing thing like that I have got the hoppe that maybe in the future young people will help their communities, maybe they would be cybercommunities but the main idea is to be part of something.
