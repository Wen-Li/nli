I think that in order to be successful one has to try new things, and be bold, creative and innovative.

If we do not do that to some degree, we are only repeating what many other people are already doing, and eventually we can become obsolete or irrelevant.

As an example I can contrast the story of Apple and IBM in the personal computer business.

They started at about the same time, both with very innovative products, the Apple Macintosh and the IBM PC. 
During the years, though, Apple kept innovating the design and the software of his products so that they have always been cutting-edge, unique, even cool and trendy.
IBM on the other hand thought they could bank on their dominant position in the market for mainframe computers for large businesses. They assumed that their established customers for IBM mainframes would have bought also IBM personal computers, and so they did not make an effort to keep innvovating their design and their software because they thought business clients did not require that.

As a result IBM lost competitiveness and market share when other companies started to make cheap "clones" or copies of the IBM personal computes that were more technologically advanced and better looking than their IBM counterparts.

By keeping doing what they tought they were able to do well, IBM ended up selling the personal computer business entirely, after it became vastly unprofitable.

On the other hand, Apple has acquired a large niche market for their Mac computers thanks to thier continuous innovation. Not only that: Apple has taken substatial risks to diversify its product offering by inventing new produtcs altogether, such as the iPod and the iPhone, most of whom have been hugely successful.

Finally, Apple has even taken the ultimate risk to change their own name from "Apple Computer" to just "Apple", to signify their shift from just the computer manufacturing business to the entertainment business. Today Apple sells not just compuetrs, but also consumer electronics such as the iPod and iPhone, and other products and services, such as music downloads.

This shows how being innovative and willing to take risks can lead to sustained success over time, and on the other hand how replicating our old ways can
