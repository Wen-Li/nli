Many people like to take the shortcut to complete their goals. It is true that it is easier to work on tasks with numerous strategies that are already discover. However, I strongly believe that the real successful people try new things and take as much risks as they need.
To begin with, although money is not always the best material to measure one's success, most of the billionaires started something on their own for the first time. Bill Gates created Microsoft program for people's efficiency in using computer at affordable costs before anybody else thought of it. To pursue that business, he had to drop out of Harvard University and concentrated only on his new business. It must have been a hard choice to do so, since Harvard is an extremely competitive school to get into. Now Bill Gates is one of the richest man in the world.
My own father is another good example for the same situation. Born to a poor family, he entered a hardest medical school in my hometown in South Korea with his own efforts. However, he changed his major to engineering, giving up his easy way to success by staying in the medical school. After studying in the engineering school, he pioneered biomedical engineering and became the first doctor of biomedical engineering in Korea by founding the subject in his college. If he had not done this, he was sure to be a medical person, but not the first biomedical engineer in nation.
I myself already took one big risk in order to be successful- coming to America. I could continue my education in the insstitutions of high level in my native country, as a selected student in science in previous years. Yet, I had a strong desire to try new things with the cost of risking what might seem to be important in certain moment, and still do. Of course there are many obstacles I need to overcome, but I believe it will be paid of if I try hard enough just like Bill Gates and my dad did in their youth.
