"  Variety is the spice of life "
                       The word 'success' is not only associated with the work that you do but at the same time being successful in the new dimension that you have adopted in your life.I completely agree with the statement that 'successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'.This can be well explained by citing some examples of a few legends in  different fields like the ones that have been mentioned below.
                             Firstly I would like to start with the richest person in Indian market Dhirubhai Ambani was once working as a vegetable vendor,he was a master of selling those vegetables no doubt,but drew interest in the communication field and started researching in that field.Its a completely different field that he opted for but the determination he had in his work and the confidence he had in his ability made him a successful person and finally he became the master in that field.
                              Secondly the all time legend in the field of cricket 'Sachin Tendulkar' was pursuing his enginnerg because he wanted to become a successful engineer but had a lot of interest in cricket.So he opted for cricket after he got to enggineering,though it was a big risky decision that he had taken up ,he was ready to work hard for that.And now he s a renown cricketer.The risk that he had taken was a huge one but it really paid him off.
                                   Thus i certainly feel that a person who is versatile in his work and at the same time diversified in his thinking morals can become a successful person.Thus a succesful person is not the one who take risks but at the same time strives hard for that and makes his risky decision count at the end of the day.
