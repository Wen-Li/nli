Nowerdays every family seems to have at least one car.And we can't live in everywhere not to see cars running on streetsm,whereas we can use some alternative transportations such as trains , tubes and motorbikes.Many people have started working to work aor schools caring their hearlth.Using cars reguraly or using another way to transport,both of them have their advantages.It's difficlut to guess in twenty years which will be more likely that there will be fewer cars or not.But if I had to predict our life in twenty years,I wouldn't say ther would be fewer cars than now.I disagree the idea the test had given me.There are some reason underneath.

Firstly,having cars is one of the popular havits amoung men.After working hard to earn enough money to buy cool car,they shows how cool cars they have bought driving through cities.It might be like thier dream to buy a good car.

Secondly,Toyota ,which is known for the leading company in Japan have been making a big profit,and provide Japan a lot of profits.Now we can say it's nessesary for our economy in Japan.In short we can see the fact that there will still be lots of demand in twenty years.

Thirdly,for family I'll recomend to go trip by cars because it helps them feel being clother more than staying at home.on holiday even if they get stuck in traffic jam they can have a good conversation.Using cars is a good enjoyment.

In concludion, for those reason above,I disagree with the idea the question gave me.Of corse on the othe rhand we have to think about our environment more cafefully.
