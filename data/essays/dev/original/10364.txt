Some people think that nowadays young people do not help their communities as much as they should. I think this statement may be true for some people, but not for many other young people who actually make a great effort to help the communities where they live in. 

It is true that modern society is becoming more and more individualistic, and this means that more and more people only care about themselves, disregarding the lives and potential problems of other people living in their community. This phenomenon is specially affecting young people, as they are growing in a society in which the most important values are realted with the personal achievements. The post a person occupies, the salary he or she recieves, the commodities of his or her house, the car, the clothes, and other material things that a person may own are nowadays far more important than the ethics of a person and his or her behaviour towards other human beings and the place he or she inhabits.

However, it is not fair to afirm that all young people act in that way. There are many young people that really help their communities in many different ways. Some of them apply for taking part as  volunteers in programs designed to help people with different kind of problems that range from disabled people,  inmigrants, children who suffer from cancer, old people who live alone, and so on. Some of them even travel to remote areas in Asia, Africa and South America to enrole in international aid organizations that deal with very serious problems affecting millions of people in those continents, such as natural disasters, wars and epidemies among others.                                
Summing up, because ot today's society, there are some young people who are forgetting to take care about the others and their communities, but there are many other young people who dedicate an important part of their lives to help people that are in a difficult situation. In my opinion, everybody should follow their example.
