           We live in an age where information is exchanged between continents on the click of a mouse, where geography has ceased to define distance. What i try to mean is that with globalisation comes competition. According to me, to stay ahead in this highly competitive race one has to excel or master in whatever academic field one may be. This mastery of an academic subject can only be attained by specializing in that particular subject rather than having  only a broad knowledge about various related subjects. The old cliche "Jack of all trades but master of none" does not appeal much  to me.

I would like to elucidate my theory of specializing in a particular subject is better than having knowledge of various academic subjects by citing  a practical example. Obviously a company would prefer a man with a masters degree in Chemical engineering to another man applying for the same job but with a diploma in chemical engineering and a diploma in biological engineering. Even if the company would employ the latter for his skills in both chemistry as well as biology he would definitly be given a post subordinate to that of the former & a pay package which would be lesser than the former. However if the man with the diploma would hold a degree in say a managment course and if the company would also require the managerial skills at the same time then it would be a different question all together.

To sum it up i would say that a specialized course in todays world is given a higher priority in the competitive market.
