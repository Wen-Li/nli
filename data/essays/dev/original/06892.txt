I think success can be achieved in different ways, not only by taking risks and chances. In the coming paragraphs, different points will be stated and discussed in order to properly analyze the statement given.

	First of all, success can be a relative term, because for some it may mean owning a private jet and having millions of dollars, but for others success could simply be having a good, small business that maintains their family and gives them a decent life. Not everybody wants the same things, some just want to live a quiet, normal life and nothing more. Taking a risk is a possibility, but never a sure thing.

	Also, it's difficult to achieve succes in life, since it requires many abilities from a person. There are many key ingredients involved in the process of MAYBE achieving success. It takes hard work,  dedication, being fully prepared and intelligence. Usually people don't acheive success by accident. It takes years and years, and sometimes that is not enough. Just because a person has all those ingredients doesn't guarantee them a bright future full of riches. Most people have worked hard all their life but haven't gotten anywhere they want to go.

	Another important point is the fact that succes can be achieved by doing what a person already knows how to do well. Sometimes it's as simple as that. To work hard at you're craft and make smart moves can equally take you towards success. For example, if a person studies economics and ends up working at the NYCSE, he can achieve a fortune by just putting to work all those years of studying he did in college or university. By just applying his knowledge to the stock market and making smart choices, he can become rich, but he can also lose it all. It's not so much about risk but about making smart choices.

	In conclusion, I would like to be clear that while many people have taken risks and tried new things in order to achieve succes, where some have won many more have failed. Success is never a sure thing, and even if a person achieves it, the possibility still exists that it won't last for long. Once you get to the top, the only other way to go is down, sicne it's not only difficult to reach the top but to be able to stay there. So in the end I don't agree with the statement given. Nothing in life is certain, only death and taxes.
