As peoples' ages change, they begin to enjoy different pleasures in life. Young people have fun and feel very pysched at times when they believe they are being praised by others. I remember, for a while in my life, anytime I would walk into someplace with a slick and snazzy new haircut, I would believe people looked up to me, and it would be for the rest of the night that I'd enjoy myself, due to my newly installed confidence. However, no matter how illogical it is, that would be my almost only way of having fun.
	Today, I have fun when I am with close people such as my good friends or family. I also enjoy locking myself up in my room and programming websites. Three years ago, I would mock someone who would tell me such a thing. I wouldn't consider fun, and on the contrary I would consider it ridiculously boring.
	For my parents, they have fun playing the slowest card game ever (which I think is called Bezik). At this age, I don't understand how they consider that to be fun. They also enjoy going on boat trips. To me, nothing could be more monotonous than the empty sounds of the lonely sea.
	However you never know, maybe in around 30 years, those may be my pleasures in life. Maybe, I will begin jogging every morning by six a.m. at the age of sixty. What my pleasures will be, is certainly not certain. The same applies to everyone.
	Therefore, I don't believe that the question posed can be answered. I believe all age groups have their own way of having fun. You cannot compare one's actions to another one's actions, if the actions have their own definition for each individual.
