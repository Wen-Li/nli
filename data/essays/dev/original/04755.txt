Human have created these sense of going out of home called travelling. Travelling is a very fun option for you to take. However it is not always the way you want it to be. On the one hand you have the opportuniy to travel in a group with a tour guide or in a group but without a tour guide. With these in mind I personally prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide because you have the opportunity to learn more and also because you have your schedule done. 

The first reason I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide is because I can learn better the other culture. You have a guide giving you and telling you lots of information about the new place you are visting. For instance if you decide to travel to South Africa you would not only understand even a word but also would not learn anything about these new country completely different from yours.

The other reason I prefer travelling with a tour guide is because the schedule is already program by my tour guide. I would not have any minute to waist time. I would take advantage of it in every single opportunity. In fact If you travelled without a tour guide you may not be able to wake up at seven in the morning. A few years ago I went to Cuzco in Peru and I did not contacted a tour guide. I did not learn anything about that incredible monument, you can not imagine how I regret it now. It was a waste of time traveling there without a tour guide. 

Therefore whether you chose to travel in a group or by yourself try to be led by a tour guide and try always to prepared your trip very carefully in order for you to enjoy it.
