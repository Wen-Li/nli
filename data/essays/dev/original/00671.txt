I strongly believe the statement of ,it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.Understanding the idea is more important for every student in the class room.the understanding the idea and concepts give the overall picture of that particular lecture.
for example in my college days i had more concentrated on my lesson,at that time i know the central idea of the topic.This type of  skills will improve the ability of study    and ability of remembering .This skills are also reducing the study time.the students can learn more in formaton quickly.
learn facts is good but every time we dont want to study .We dont want to sparemuch time on learn facts.At that time these skills are very helpful.It is very time consuming process. understand ides and concepts will helpful any time.for example i want to go to exam ,first i will go to through the topic then understand the main idea of that topic and concept of that one .I regularly follow this rule of studying .So in this way i get more information with in time ,i save my time also.In this way os studying igot good marks in my exams.
For example we will go one reading passage first of all we skim the passage then get the main idea of the passage.this time the reading is easy otherwise it will tough.In this way of getting ideas studens get lot of exposure ,the thinking ability will also increase.In this way  learning facts is difficult to rembering with idea of the topic.So i strongly believe this statement ,it will helpful alot in education and futere aspects.
