The number of cars is a problem nowadays. It's a problem because reserves of petrole are going to be smaller and smaller and because of thism the price of petrole is growing and growing. 
Nowadays, the environmental question is very popular in european countries and cars are considered as a very bad element for the environment's health. So, in my opinion, in twenty years, the number of cars in Europe, Japan and United States will be lower. But, in my opinion, cars will be fewer in twenty years than today in developping countries (in poorer countries) like africans countries or south americans countries because for them, cars still a very important element fort the economy growth. People of those countries use a lot their cars in order to go to their jobs whereas, in countries which are already developped and rich, people used to take the subway, buses and the tramway. But, because the poorer polution represent a big part of the worldwide population, if all those people are going to have a car, the wodldwide nu;ner of cars will dra;atically grow. There is also the problem of the lobbying. The car lobbying is very i;portant in the Unites States of America so, they will not allow the American government to make a law about the number of car per family. So if some people would like to make the nu;ber of cars smaller, they will be in conflict with  politicians and the lobbying. In ;y opinion, in twenty years, there will be a terrible struggle between the environmental proctectors and cars constructors (General Motors, Ford, VW...). I'm very sure that Green Peace will be a more and more important organisation because who doesn't want to take care of our environment? In my opinion, the number of cars can be also smaller in twenty years because circulation's problems are terrible in big cities such as Paris or NYC. That's why nowadays, cars are forbidden in the center of London. Because of this interdiction, I'm very sure that a big part of londonian sell their cars and didn't buy a new one. Cars become useless in London. I heard also that Paris would like to make the same. Isn't that an evidence of the fact that the number of cars in Europe is going to be smaller.
As a conclusion, we cam say that in some parts of the world, in twenty years, cars will be fewers but in an other part, their number is going to be less important.
