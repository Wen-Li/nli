I agree with this statement. I think successful people take risk and try new things rather than just doing the same thing. Trying new things make people to realize about their new sides.
	When I was in South Korea, I was a successful student. I studied really hard to get good grades in middle school. I was always making A from Korean classes. I loved to study Korean literature and I was successful writing creative stories and poems. 
	One day, my dad suggested me to study in America. He thought I could experience new culture and learn new language. I was really concerned when I heard about my father's suggestion. I thought I was only capable to learn Korean. Moving to America seemed really difficult for me. For a long time, I thought about advantages that I can get from America. I had an opportunity to learn a new language and I could experience western culture.
	After 3 months, I decided to leave South Korea. I took a risk to go to America and I was ready to challange myself. When I first arrived at Dallas, I was amazed by the size of my high school. There were so many great students and teachers. It was difficult for me to follow the classes but I didn't give up. I always studied after school and I tried to speak with students from different countires. This made me to develop my English skills.
	I studied really hard and now I am very satisfied with myself. I am making good grades at school and I made a lot of friends. Also I am learning Spanish in my school. The things that seemed impossible are happening now. The risks and changes developed me as a more skilled and better person. I think I made a good decision. Coming to America gave me opportunities for my future. 
	I am not going to stop from here. I am planing to learn about journalism and photography. These are the things that I have never studied before. I think taking risks and trying new things made me to develop. I learned a lot from new experiences and I am pleased with it. I will keep learning and I am confident that this will make me as a successful person in future.
