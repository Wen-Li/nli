	I totally agree with that statementa that young people recently do not have enough time to help their communities. There are several reasons why I think so: rack of time and busy life, and unfamiliarity with the community.
	First of all, I am also one of the young people who do not engage in helping their comunities. In my opinion, the big reason is that they are just too busy jsut to go to school. In my case, even I want to give my time to help my communities, I do not have enough time t spend in it because of the school. Recently, many students go private school far from the house not public school located close to the house. I also go to private school. The school is so far that it takes me one and a half hours to get there. Threfore, it is difficult to find and spare the time to contribute to my community because of lack of the time.  
	Second, most students even elementry school students go to juku school after school because amny parents and students are not satisfied with the education of the school or they think they need support school study. Therefore, they do not have time even to have familty time or to hang out with friends. Students of the age that are the time to take entrance examination to next school such as high school or university go juku almost whole week. Consequently, they would rather to have time to spend with family or friends if they could find the time.
	Third, they and I feel the community is not familiar with us. I am sure all people knew each faces of their all neighbors and they communicateed each other a lot long time ago, To my disppointment, it does not happen now. I just moved new city so I do not know about my community and my neighbor. As a result, even there is a festival, I always do not participate in it because there is no people who I know. I guess it occur to people nowadays a lot.  
	In conclusion, I am in agreement that most young people do not spare enough time to support their communities. Even they want to help them,  it is not easy because recent childrent are having busy day. I think we need to find the way to community to be more active at first.
