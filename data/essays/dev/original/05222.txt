	In many situations, as human beings, people are often caged or trapped in a knowledge-cage and only some exceptions will occour once in a while. Not saying that knowing alot is a bad idea but, specializing in a perticular area is the step of leaving your name in a history book. The depth of which a perticular area of knowledge is explored is far more beneifitual than having a broad knowledge of every academic subjects. Therefore, i strongly disagree with the statement, since that only guides you more into a --- normal person. 
	From not only historical evidences but also personal experiences, specialized in a certain area of knowledge would surely make you speical from all the rest, not only so, it is the best way of leading to sucess in future life. 
	To begin with, a famous biologist english plant scientists has made the most remarkable achievement to the area of biology. But, when you ask what he differs from the rest of the biologist scientists? is becuase of his consistancy and specialized work in the observation of pea plants; he studied the same plants for over 20 years and thus, finally he got a Nobel prize for he achieverments.

This, made her work still popular and is now what many modern poets are looking to achieve and trying to copy her style. 
	Lastly, Not only people that are in the academic area are famous but also, one of the most famous person which most people would know is, " The Great Michael Jordan" he is known for his basketball skills. howeevr, many do not know that even though he may seem to be the best basketball player in that time, it was once said by his college professor and his college coach that, " It seem like basketball and Michael has a strong bond, he seem to only know how to play good basketball" and sure, the world has prove him right, he had won himself billions and billions of dollors and fame, just simply by doing playing good basketball.
	In conclusion, from these examples, we can clearly see that be spcializing in a specic area would not only make one famous but also, it would sure leave ones name in the history book. By this, i strongly disagree with the p
