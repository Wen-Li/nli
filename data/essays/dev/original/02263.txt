i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.
it has lot of advantages like u don't need to be panicked in a foreign country, the tour guide will direct you to all worth sight seeign places and provide you the background information about the same.
the comfort and security offered while travelling with a group is better than travelling on your own.. u build new friendships and see different facets of life. 
moreover the cost of the trips are realtively less since most of the guides/operators have tie ups with diffrent resorts,transportation companies etc...
it gives  a better deal for the consumers.
your trip is organized and any problems arising can be dealt by the guide since he is a seasoned and experienced in the trip .


However, there are few disadvantages even. we may/may not get individual attentions during the trip by the guide .if he has many tourists under him.
sometimes a consumer may also feel that he is not gettign a raw deal i.e. not a good deal and its expensive because the tour operators margin (commision)will be added to the package costs.

Immaterial of the disadvantages, i feel that the best way to travel is ina group led by a guide since you tend to enjoy more and any hassles realting to foreign exchange visas etc are dealt with effectivey etc..
Anyways, as the saying goes,

"The More the Merrier"
