Yes, I agree with the statement that "Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

The Homo sapiens can be broadly classifed into two categories.

The first category consist of those people who are happy to live a risk-free normal life. They like to get up in the morning, do the house chores and leave for the office, sit in a cubicle and spend 8 hours 5 days a week. They want to enjoy the weekend with the family and LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER. The main charaterstic of this category is that they want to live their life exactly in the same manner as their neighbour is living. The only example that comes to my mind for this category is the COMMON MAN. This is what differentiates them from the other category of Homo sapiens. They make a contribution to the society as a WHOLE but their individual contribution is minimal. They will not be remembered because of the fact  that they do what they are told to do.

The second category of Homo sapiens are those who actually make the world a better place to live in. People in this category have the names like Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, Mahatma Gandhi, Yuri Gagarin, and many others. What makes them special is the fact that they all were curious and excited to explore new areas in their field. Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison made a breakthrough in science, gave us gravtiy and elctricity respectively. Mahatma Gandhi created ripples in the political world through his approach of non-violence movements. Because Yuri Gagrin dared to enter into space, that we were able to think beyond the planet Earth. These people had some characterstics similar at root levels. They were ready to work in a monotonous environment. They were ready to risk anything to prove their point.
