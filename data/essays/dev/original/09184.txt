No one would be able to stay in a specific country fopr the rest of his life. Lets assume that theres some1 donst want to travel and leave his country , well i think hes lifeless and he doesnt wanna enjoy the taste of traveling and life. Its not neccessary to travel in a group led by a tour guide , traveling alone or with a couple of friends is much adventorous as long as u dont cross the limits of adventure. A trip would make a person learn more about other contries, different cultures and experience hard times a normal person would gop through. Travelling alone would provide a person with a chance to stand up n take responsibility of himself. Travbeling alone would provide a person with a precious oppurtunity to plan, manage, and learn more about the obsticles hes going to face during life time. Life is not all about joy and pleasure it is mainly to experience the rough times a person would go through.
