I agree with this statement that "Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well". 
Successful people are those who keep on doing experiments to make existing things less complicated and they are the ones who develop new things. For example in earlyman's time people used to do travelling by carts. But nowadays we are able to travel overseas. We use cars, aeroplanes, helicopters. If man hadn't tried new things or man hadn't used his innovative mind , he wouldn't been able to design new and fastest ways of transportation.
Moreover for success taking risk and doing new things is necessary .  For example in my family my mother is a house wife , my grandmother was also a housewife. But I want to be a scientist , so I am going against our conventional rules and regulations . I am trying new things which in our family nobody has tried like I am planning to go abroad to get a doctoral degree as my country is a develoding one.So, I personally believe in the above statement.
We should always try new things and should give innovative things to this world. Making new technologies by taking risk is they key to success. For example If nobody had tried going to moon , we wont be able to explore and know how does moon looks and what are the properties of moon. 
But sometimes trying new things can be dangerous too. For example "Kalpana chawla" famous astronaut of NASA, died when her spacecraft was coming back to the earth after doing some valuable discoveries.
But in the long run "Success goes to those people who keep on trying new things instead of sticking to old things ".
