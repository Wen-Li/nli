I totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

In my observation from the successful businessmen or professors, they often do things or sucjects what other people do not understand at all.  For example, ten years ago, while most people do not know values and benefits of the computer, but Bill Gates knew it.  Because he went ahead and tried the new things(computer), he made a real big fortune from doing latest technology.

On contrary to those persons who only do what they known, successful persons are always trying new things.  They usually have a open mind to absorb all the latest concept, and they often take risks.  For instance, if a businessman adopt the idea that he never heard before, it must be very risky to use it if the idea is not pratical to operate.

There will be two different ways for using the new thoughts: success or fail.  Most people will not dare to adopt new things because they are afraid that they may lose everything.  In this way, they gradually developed the idea that  they do not want to learn the new things and take advantage of them.   

In contast, this idea seldom be formed in the heart of successful people.  They, of course, know the risks might be, but they are not afraid.  Successful people usually have a positive mind to keep them go ahead.

In conclusion, I think that I truly agree the opinion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
