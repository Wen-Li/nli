I agree with the statement, it is a need to take risks in life to be successful, if you stay in your confort zone you will never improve and grow to become a successful person.
	We are all born with no  knolege, we don't event know how to walk, that is one of thefirst chalenges we face in life, to lear a new thing. If we were to start life staying safe and not exploring we would not even know how to walk. 
	Later in life we have to push our selfs to go to school and become part of a class, and keep trying new things like reading writing, improving and getting smarter.
	By the time we take that first job we have already done alot of things out of that confort zone, new things, and there is people that in that  point of there life are confortable with were they are. 
	In my oppinion you have to keep going. Trying to inovate, change and grow, learning new skills that can make you successfull in what you really want to do.
	Becoming seccessful means something different for every body, to me a successful person is one that knows what is looking to get from life, and is not afraid to try new thing in order to do what make Them happy. I thing everybody shoul take the risk of doing new thing in order to become Succesful and happy people.
	The last time a took risks  doing something a did not know how to do well was learning to surf. Now is one of the things I like the best in my life and i can not picture my self living in California not doing surf.  Taking risk pays off.
