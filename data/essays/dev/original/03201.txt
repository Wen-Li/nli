I believe everybody can not know everything and its not so good to be 'Jack of all trades and master of none'.Specific knowledge is very much desired in  both professional and academic fields. 

Specialized knowledge of the subject is many times indispensible.
One good example would be from field of medicines, where general Physicians are valued but specialist like Cardiologists or Neurologists are indispensible and are the final option for particular  kind of treatments. 

Too much generalized knowledge may become  very superficial and will not be of much help in solving complex problems in specific subjects. For instance, if we look at the field of science, say Biology, a generalized understanding of all its branches is required but a Taxonomist and a Biophysicists have very less to do with each others and can not help each other in solving their specific problems.

However all this discussion is not meant to diminish the value of general knowledge, as for application of knowledge from one subject in to other requires understanding of both. For example if principles of Mathematics are to be applied to Biology then general knowledge of both subjects is required. However it will be done more appropriately if two specialists i.e. A Biologist and a Mathematician interact with each other.

Also i believe that human memory has its limitations and one should use it judiciously. We should confine and focus our brains towards solving problems related to specific subject. Too much unnecessary knowldge will occupy space in one's memory and will not be put to use very often.

Therefore having General knowledge in moderation is good, but having only general knowledge is of no use. To apply knowledge for usefull purpose one has to specialize in particular subject.
