I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN this_DT statement_NN ._.
There_EX are_VBP three_CD reasons_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, anybody_NN can_MD enjoy_VB its_PRP$ life_NN whether_IN he/she_NN is_VBZ young_JJ or_CC old_JJ ._.
That_DT 's_VBZ the_DT matter_NN of_IN feeling_NN or_CC thinking_NN of_IN individuals_NNS ,_, not_RB age_NN ._.
You_PRP can_MD see_VB it_PRP from_IN the_DT statistics_NNS about_IN the_DT age_NN of_IN suicide_NN people_NNS ._.
The_DT number_NN of_IN older_JJR is_VBZ n't_RB different_JJ much_RB as_IN younger_JJR people_NNS 's_POS ._.
They_PRP die_VBP because_IN of_IN dissapointment_NN to_TO their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN may_MD be_VB one_CD of_IN the_DT proof_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS does_VBZ n't_RB enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
Second_RB ,_, that_IN olders_NNS who_WP usually_RB move_VBP and_CC speak_VBP slowly_RB may_MD give_VB an_DT impression_NN to_TO people_NNS to_TO think_VB they_PRP are_VBP boring_JJ or_CC have_VBP nothing_NN to_TO do_VB ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ not_RB true_JJ ._.
Thanks_NNS to_TO their_PRP$ experiences_NNS and_CC knowldges_NNS come_VBP from_IN their_PRP$ long_JJ life_NN ,_, they_PRP know_VBP how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB and_CC have_VB fun_NN in_IN their_PRP$ way_NN in_IN any_DT situation_NN ._.
Older_JJR
Third_NNP ,_, the_DT number_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS who_WP goes_VBZ to_TO educational_JJ facility_NN ,_, like_IN city_NN college_NN ,_, is_VBZ still_RB increasing_VBG ._.
That_DT means_VBZ they_PRP have_VBP passion_NN to_TO get_VB higher_JJR education_NN and_CC enthusiasm_NN to_TO earn_VB new_JJ knowledge_NN ._.
Compared_VBN to_TO older_JJR people_NNS ,_, younger_JJR seems_VBZ spend_VB much_RB
