Why_WRB do_VBP young_JJ people_NNS not_RB give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS nowadays_RB ?_.
I_PRP presume_VBP there_EX are_VBP several_JJ reasons_NNS for_IN that_DT ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP increasing_VBG possibilities_NNS and_CC money_NN to_TO spend_VB their_PRP$ leisure_NN time_NN ,_, so_IN they_PRP might_MD rather_RB spend_VB their_PRP$ time_NN enjoying_VBG themselves_PRP with_IN friends_NNS than_IN to_TO be_VB helping_VBG the_DT community_NN ._.
Another_DT reason_NN might_MD be_VB the_DT changing_VBG living_NN conditions_NNS ._.
People_NNS nowadays_RB have_VBP to_TO be_VB and_CC are_VBP more_RBR flexible_JJ ._.
The_DT number_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS leaving_VBG their_PRP$ hometown_NN to_TO study_VB in_IN a_DT city_NN far_RB away_RB has_VBZ increased_VBN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP changing_VBG jobs_NNS more_RBR frequently_RB than_IN before_RB and_CC thus_RB have_VBP to_TO move_VB houses_NNS ._.
The_DT time_NN a_DT young_JJ person_NN spends_VBZ in_IN one_CD site_NN has_VBZ shortened_VBN and_CC accordingly_RB the_DT feeling_NN of_IN being_VBG a_DT part_NN of_IN a_DT community_NN ._.
Helping_VBG a_DT community_NN means_VBZ to_TO be_VB motivated_VBN as_IN you_PRP feel_VBP responsible_JJ for_IN it_PRP ._.
Without_IN having_VBG spent_VBN a_DT certain_JJ time_NN in_IN a_DT community_NN your_PRP$ are_VBP less_RBR motivated_VBN to_TO help_VB ,_, as_IN you_PRP do_VBP not_RB know_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN people_NNS personally_RB ._.
The_DT personal_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN people_NNS though_IN increases_NNS your_PRP$ motivation_NN to_TO help_VB strongly_RB ._.
The_DT strongest_JJS reason_NN for_IN the_DT fact_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB help_VBP less_RBR in_IN communities_NNS is_VBZ the_DT changed_JJ behaviour_NN towards_IN communities_NNS ._.
People_NNS have_VBP become_VBN more_RBR individual_JJ ,_, more_RBR focussed_VBN on_IN themselves_PRP and_CC their_PRP$ needs_NNS ._.
Families_NNS as_RB much_RB as_IN communities_NNS do_VBP not_RB mean_VB as_RB much_JJ to_TO people_NNS as_IN they_PRP used_VBD to_TO in_IN the_DT past_NN ._.
People_NNS are_VBP economically_RB more_RBR independent_JJ so_IN that_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB need_VB support_NN and_CC help_NN of_IN the_DT communities_NNS as_RB much_JJ nas_NNS in_IN the_DT past_NN ._.
Taking_VBG all_PDT those_DT factors_NNS into_IN account_NN I_PRP would_MD agree_VB that_IN more_JJR and_CC more_RBR young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP not_RB to_TO give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
