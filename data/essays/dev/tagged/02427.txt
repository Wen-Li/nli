Although_IN young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO have_VB more_JJR phisical_JJ advantaged_VBN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT idea_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS because_IN of_IN the_DT following_VBG reasons_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR free_JJ time_NN because_IN they_PRP are_VBP retired_VBN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP busy_JJ in_IN going_VBG to_TO schools_NNS ,_, doing_VBG assignments_NNS ,_, and_CC working_VBG to_TO support_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, now_RB I_PRP am_VBP attending_VBG at_IN a_DT law_NN school_NN and_CC I_PRP spend_VBP most_JJS of_IN my_PRP$ timer_NN for_IN preparing_VBG claases_NNS ._.
Also_RB ,_, I_PRP do_VBP some_DT part_NN time_NN job_NN because_IN I_PRP need_VBP money_NN to_TO socialize_VB ._.
However_RB ,_, my_PRP$ parents_NNS are_VBP retired_VBN and_CC they_PRP spend_VBP most_JJS of_IN their_PRP$ time_NN to_TO go_VB to_TO travel_VB ,_, plan_NN for_IN trip_NN ,_, and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
Second_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO have_VB enough_JJ budget_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, my_PRP$ parents_NNS love_VBP traveling_VBG and_CC they_PRP went_VBD to_TO Peru_NNP and_CC West_NNP Europe_NNP last_JJ year_NN ._.
I_PRP also_RB like_VBP traveling_VBG abrod_NN ,_, but_CC I_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB enough_JJ money_NN ,_, so_IN I_PRP ended_VBD up_RP traveling_VBG domesticly_RB by_IN renting_VBG a_DT car_NN and_CC staying_VBG motels_NNS ._.
Third_NNP ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR likely_JJ to_TO have_VB concrete_JJ object_NN regarding_VBG what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB in_IN free_JJ time_NN because_IN there_EX were_VBD many_JJ things_NNS they_PRP could_MD not_RB do_VB when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD working_VBG as_IN a_DT result_NN of_IN insufficient_JJ time_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, my_PRP$ father_NN 's_POS dream_NN was_VBD to_TO visit_VB Peru_NNP which_WDT he_PRP could_MD achieve_VB because_IN he_PRP was_VBD unable_JJ to_TO get_VB enough_RB long_JJ vacation_NN to_TO go_VB to_TO abroad_RB ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ true_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR healty_JJ and_CC some_DT older_JJR people_NNS can_MD not_RB do_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP because_IN they_PRP can_MD not_RB move_VB ._.
There_EX are_VBP ,_, however_RB ,_, many_JJ oder_JJR people_NNS who_WP are_VBP organizing_VBG poem_NN clubs_NNS or_CC reading_VBG clubs_NNS and_CC enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ life_NN regardless_RB of_IN their_PRP$ immovability_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ life_NN much_RB more_RBR than_IN youg_JJ people_NNS because_IN they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR free_JJ time_NN ,_, more_JJR financial_JJ resources_NNS ,_, and_CC have_VBP stroger_JJR desire_NN to_TO do_VB something_NN they_PRP could_MD not_RB do_VB when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ ._.
