Apparently_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP much_RB more_JJR time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB themselves_PRP ._.
However_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ difficult_JJ that_IN to_TO say_VB that_IN young_JJ peole_NN enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
There_EX is_VBZ a_DT problem_NN somewhat_RB too_RB colplicated_VBN to_TO speak_VB easy_JJ way_NN ._.
Everyone_NN enjoys_VBZ their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Indeed_RB they_PRP enjoys_VBZ their_PRP$ life_NN in_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ way_NN ._.
So_RB young_JJ people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS both_CC enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN ,_, but_CC in_IN their_PRP$ specific_JJ ways_NNS ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS ,_, of_IN course_NN ,_, have_VBP more_JJR time_NN to_TO work_VB in_IN their_PRP$ field_NN to_TO make_VB money_NN for_IN their_PRP$ family_NN ._.
Sometimes_RB they_PRP can_MD not_RB have_VB a_DT break_NN all_DT day_NN long_RB ._.
Even_RB ,_, in_IN Asian_JJ countries_NNS ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD not_RB have_VB a_DT vacation_NN all_DT around_IN year_NN ._.
They_PRP have_VBP great_JJ royalty_NN to_TO their_PRP$ family_NN ._.
Although_IN they_PRP may_MD complain_VB about_IN their_PRP$ life_NN like_IN this_DT ,_, they_PRP will_MD not_RB leave_VB it_PRP ._.
Sometimes_RB they_PRP enjoy_VBP this_DT situation_NN ,_, to_TO have_VB chance_NN to_TO support_VB their_PRP$ family_NN by_IN themselves_PRP and_CC to_TO grow_VB their_PRP$ children_NNS in_IN better_JJR circumstance_NN ._.
This_DT is_VBZ the_DT life_NN actually_RB they_PRP enjoy_VBP everyday_JJ ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB help_VB enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ time_NN everyday_JJ ._.
They_PRP have_VBP no_DT responsibility_NN to_TO work_VB for_IN someone_NN except_IN simple_JJ homework_NN ._.
So_RB young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP much_RB more_JJR time_NN to_TO spend_VB for_IN themselves_PRP ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ experience_NN ,_, more_JJR time_NN does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB more_JJR joyful_JJ ._.
In_IN fact_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS spend_VBP time_NN useless_JJ more_RBR often_RB than_IN older_JJR peole_NN do_VBP ._.
But_CC it_PRP is_VBZ obvious_JJ that_IN if_IN young_JJ people_NNS can_MD manage_VB their_PRP$ life_NN valuable_JJ ,_, they_PRP have_VBP much_RB more_JJR chane_NN to_TO (_CD really_RB )_CD enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, the_DT critical_JJ point_NN of_IN about_IN this_DT question_NN is_VBZ not_RB the_DT quantity_NN but_CC the_DT quality_NN of_IN life_NN managing_NN ._.
Although_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR time_NN for_IN themselves_PRP to_TO enjoy_VB than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD manage_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_RBR valuable_JJ ,_, so_IN they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB about_IN the_DT result_NN ._.
