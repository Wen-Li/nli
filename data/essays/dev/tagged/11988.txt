I_PRP agree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Unfortunatly_NNP ,_, I_PRP sometimes_RB hear_VBP that_IN elder_JJR people_NNS are_VBP bored_VBN in_IN their_PRP$ daily_JJ life_NN ._.
There_EX are_VBP some_DT reasons_NNS why_WRB I_PRP think_VBP young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR tahn_JJ older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
First_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN energy_NN to_TO move_VB their_PRP$ bodies_NNS ._.
Some_DT of_IN them_PRP enjoyed_VBD suports_NNS ,_, travering_NN ,_, and_CC working_VBG ._.
They_PRP can_MD do_VB many_JJ activities_NNS ._.
Even_RB though_IN they_PRP are_VBP tired_JJ ,_, they_PRP sometimes_RB continue_VBP moving_VBG without_IN enough_JJ rest_NN ._.
If_IN they_PRP sleep_VBP well_RB ,_, they_PRP will_MD be_VB fine_JJ the_DT next_JJ day_NN ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, many_JJ of_IN them_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB serious_JJ health_NN problems_NNS ._.
Many_JJ elder_JJR people_NNS have_VBP something_NN health_NN problem_NN ,_, even_RB though_IN they_PRP are_VBP healthy_JJ life_NN ._.
Because_IN they_PRP have_VBP been_VBN older_JJR ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ natural_JJ thing_NN ._.
Many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB health_NN problems_NNS which_WDT elder_JJR people_NNS has_VBZ ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, the_DT life_NN styles_NNS between_IN young_JJ people_NNS and_CC elder_JJR people_NNS are_VBP different_JJ ._.
When_WRB I_PRP visited_VBD a_DT retirement_NN home_NN ,_, an_DT activety_NN director_NN said_VBD ,_, if_IN I_PRP could_MD come_VB there_RB as_RB much_JJ as_IN I_PRP could_MD ,_, it_PRP would_MD be_VB helpful_JJ for_IN them_PRP to_TO escape_VB from_IN boring_JJ time_NN ._.
They_PRP usually_RB stay_VBP in_IN the_DT home_NN because_IN it_PRP is_VBZ hard_JJ for_IN them_PRP to_TO go_VB out_RP by_IN themselves_PRP ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, if_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB any_DT outside_JJ activities_NNS ,_, they_PRP spend_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN on_IN a_DT sofa_NN to_TO watch_VB TV_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD go_VB anywhere_RB and_CC anytime_RB by_IN themselves_PRP ._.
They_PRP can_MD choose_VB how_WRB they_PRP act_VBP on_IN their_PRP$ daily_JJ life_NN ,_, but_CC for_IN elder_JJR people_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD not_RB have_VB the_DT kind_NN of_IN choice_NN ._.
These_DT reasons_NNS show_VBP young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN elder_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Young_NNP peple_NNS have_VBP some_DT benefits_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN elder_JJR people_NNS ,_, so_IN they_PRP should_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
If_IN young_JJ people_NNS provide_VBP enjoyable_JJ life_NN for_IN elder_JJR people_NNS ,_, the_DT elder_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR enjoyable_JJ life_NN than_IN they_PRP used_VBD to_TO have_VB ._.
