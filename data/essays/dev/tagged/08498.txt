While_IN life_NN can_MD be_VB enjoyed_VBN by_IN people_NNS in_IN all_DT phases_NNS of_IN life_NN ,_, I_PRP personally_RB believe_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR ._.
Main_NNP factor_NN in_IN favor_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS is_VBZ their_PRP$ high_JJ energy_NN levels_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP full_JJ of_IN life_NN and_CC like_IN to_TO experiment_NN different_JJ options_NNS ._.
Such_JJ experimentation_NN builds_VBZ their_PRP$ life_NN experiences_NNS ._.
Exercising_VBG different_JJ options_NNS provides_VBZ multiple_JJ opportunities_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
Younger_JJR people_NNS have_VBP higher_JJR physical_JJ strength_NN to_TO endure_VB outdoor_JJ activities_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, while_IN a_DT senior_JJ citizen_NN may_MD require_VB a_DT detailed_JJ planning_NN and_CC preparation_NN before_IN they_PRP could_MD take_VB an_DT adventure_NN camping_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS could_MD combine_VB their_PRP$ youth_NN with_IN sense_NN of_IN adventure_NN to_TO take_VB up_RP such_PDT a_DT trip_NN with_IN little_JJ or_CC no_DT planning_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS also_RB have_VBP time_NN on_IN their_PRP$ side_NN to_TO take_VB risks_NNS ._.
Unlike_IN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS who_WP are_VBP risk_NN averse_JJ ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD take_VB higher_JJR risks_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS realize_VBP that_IN in_IN case_NN of_IN any_DT negative_JJ consequence_NN ,_, they_PRP will_MD have_VB time_NN to_TO repair_VB the_DT damage_NN ._.
This_DT risk_NN friendliness_NN allows_VBZ young_JJ people_NNS to_TO stretch_VB their_PRP$ limits_NNS and_CC enjoy_VB life_NN to_TO the_DT fullest_JJS ._.
While_IN it_PRP is_VBZ true_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB enough_JJ time_NN in_IN their_PRP$ schedules_NNS as_IN compared_VBN to_TO older_JJR people_NNS ._.
However_RB to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ,_, time_NN is_VBZ not_RB the_DT sole_JJ requirement_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP multiple_JJ outlets_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN -_: at_IN work_NN ,_, home_NN or_CC socializing_VBG ._.
Hence_RB a_DT person_NN need_MD not_RB wait_VB till_IN retirement_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
Most_JJS of_IN life_NN 's_POS enjoyments_NNS will_MD require_VB commitment_NN of_IN financial_JJ resources_NNS also_RB ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ likely_JJ that_IN smart_JJ older_JJR people_NNS would_MD have_VB achieved_VBN financial_JJ success_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ,_, however_RB it_PRP is_VBZ more_RBR probable_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS will_MD have_VB more_RBR expendable_JJ income_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, while_IN life_NN can_MD and_CC should_MD be_VB enjoyed_VBN in_IN every_DT phase_NN of_IN life_NN ,_, young_JJ ones_NNS should_MD capitalize_VB on_IN this_DT opportunity_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP all_DT supporting_VBG factors_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ favor_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN to_TO the_DT fullest_JJS ._.
