Have_VBP you_PRP ever_RB seen_VBN a_DT boy_NN playing_NN with_IN his_PRP$ toys_NNS ?_.
Do_VBP n't_RB you_PRP think_VBP that_IN they_PRP are_VBP in_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ happy_JJ world_NN ?_.
I_PRP believe_VBP that_DT children_NNS are_VBP extremely_RB more_RBR happy_JJ than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
When_WRB we_PRP analize_VBP old_JJ people_NNS 's_POS life_NN ,_, there_EX are_VBP to_TO many_JJ things_NNS involve_VBP that_IN make_VBP them_PRP worried_VBN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, the_DT bills_NNS that_IN they_PRP have_VBP to_TO pay_VB every_DT month_NN ,_, or_CC that_IN boss_NN at_IN work_NN that_WDT ask_VBP them_PRP for_IN more_JJR every_DT day_NN ._.
It_PRP does_VBZ n't_RB mean_VB that_IN they_PRP do_VBP n't_RB enyoy_JJ life_NN ,_, because_IN that_DT is_VBZ life_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ too_RB much_JJ going_VBG on_IN ._.
As_RB much_RB as_IN you_PRP know_VBP ,_, as_RB much_RB as_IN you_PRP are_VBP worried_VBN ._.
Children_NNS keep_VBP their_PRP$ lifes_NNS simple_JJ ,_, and_CC there_EX is_VBZ the_DT secret_NN of_IN their_PRP$ success_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD watch_VB the_DT cartoons_NNS for_IN hours_NNS without_IN worried_JJ about_IN what_WP are_VBP they_PRP going_VBG to_TO eat_VB tonight_NN because_IN mom_NN is_VBZ there_RB to_TO take_VB care_NN of_IN that_DT ._.
Or_CC ,_, they_PRP can_MD play_VB with_IN their_PRP$ neighbors_NNS all_DT afternoon_NN until_IN they_PRP are_VBP so_RB tired_JJ that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ time_NN to_TO take_VB a_DT nap_NN ._.
In_IN the_DT adult_JJ world_NN ,_, the_DT situation_NN is_VBZ so_RB much_RB different_JJ ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS still_RB have_VBP fun_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD have_VB nice_JJ conversations_NNS with_IN friends_NNS ,_, go_VB to_TO the_DT movies_NNS ,_, or_CC have_VBP dinner_NN with_IN their_PRP$ family_NN ,_, But_CC there_EX is_VBZ not_RB the_DT same_JJ energy_NN and_CC entusiastic_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP ._.
Yougn_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR optimistic_JJ ,_, positive_JJ ,_, because_IN they_PRP have_VBP a_DT whole_JJ life_NN in_IN front_NN of_IN them_PRP ,_, so_RB that_IN motivate_VB them_PRP to_TO experience_VB new_JJ things_NNS ._.
So_RB ,_, in_IN conclusion_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR ,_, otherwise_RB It_PRP would_MD n't_RB be_VB to_TO common_JJ listen_VBP people_NNS saying_VBG how_WRB much_JJ they_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO be_VB a_DT child_NN again_RB ._.
