In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, young_JJ and_CC older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN equally_RB but_CC in_IN different_JJ ways_NNS ._.
Being_VBG young_JJ or_CC older_JJR have_VBP advantages_NNS but_CC also_RB disadvantages_VBZ ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ,_, you_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB the_DT same_JJ pleasures_NNS as_IN you_PRP are_VBP old_JJ ._.
On_IN one_CD hand_NN ,_, when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ,_, you_PRP enjoy_VBP your_PRP$ life_NN at_IN the_DT current_JJ moment_NN ._.
Indeed_RB ,_, during_IN your_PRP$ studies_NNS ,_, you_PRP prefer_VBP to_TO go_VB out_RP with_IN friends_NNS ,_, to_TO do_VB sport_NN ,_, to_TO discover_VB new_JJ things_NNS by_IN travelling_VBG ._. .._SYM
However_RB ,_, on_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP older_JJR you_PRP enjoy_VBP different_JJ things_NNS of_IN the_DT life_NN ._.
Indeed_RB ,_, you_PRP want_VBP to_TO get_VB married_VBN ,_, to_TO have_VB children_NNS ,_, to_TO buy_VB a_DT nice_JJ house_NN ,_, to_TO go_VB on_IN hollidays_NNS with_IN all_DT your_PRP$ family_NN ,_, to_TO succeed_VB at_IN work_NN ._. .._SYM
Secondly_RB ,_, responsabilities_NNS of_IN a_DT student_NN are_VBP totally_RB different_JJ comparing_VBG to_TO an_DT older_JJR person_NN ._.
Indeed_RB ,_, as_IN a_DT student_NN ,_, you_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB many_JJ reponsabilities_NNS because_IN most_JJS of_IN cases_NNS ,_, you_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB a_DT child_NN to_TO take_VB care_NN of_IN and_CC you_PRP depend_VBP a_DT little_JJ bit_NN of_IN your_PRP$ parents_NNS who_WP help_VBP you_PRP financially_RB ._.
The_DT main_JJ responsability_NN of_IN a_DT student_NN is_VBZ to_TO have_VB good_JJ marks_NNS and_CC to_TO succeed_VB in_IN his_PRP$ studies_NNS ._.
When_WRB you_PRP are_VBP older_JJR ,_, you_PRP have_VBP much_RB more_RBR responsabilities_NNS ._.
If_IN you_PRP have_VBP a_DT family_NN you_PRP have_VBP to_TO take_VB care_NN of_IN by_IN working_VBG ,_, buying_VBG food_NN ,_, paying_VBG bills_NNS ._. .._SYM
Having_VBG responsabilities_NNS as_IN an_DT adult_JJ enable_VBP them_PRP maybe_RB to_TO enjoy_VB less_JJR life_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, having_VBG reponsabilities_NNS can_MD be_VB a_DT good_JJ thing_NN for_IN some_DT adults_NNS because_IN thus_RB they_PRP think_VBP they_PRP are_VBP usefull_NN ._.
Finally_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB less_JJR life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_IN they_PRP generally_RB have_VBP less_JJR money_NN ._.
If_IN you_PRP are_VBP a_DT student_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ more_RBR difficult_JJ for_IN you_PRP to_TO go_VB on_IN hollidays_NNS or_CC to_TO go_VB regularly_RB to_TO the_DT cinema_NN ._.
In_IN most_JJS of_IN cases_NNS ,_, students_NNS have_VBP to_TO work_VB and_CC go_VB to_TO the_DT university_NN at_IN the_DT same_JJ time_NN in_IN order_NN to_TO pay_VB their_PRP$ distractions_NNS and_CC their_PRP$ university_NN ._.
Contrary_JJ ,_, older_JJR people_NNS does_VBZ not_RB have_VB to_TO work_VB and_CC study_VB at_IN the_DT same_JJ time_NN and_CC generally_RB they_PRP have_VBP a_DT better_JJR salary_NN ._.
To_TO conclude_VB ,_, when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP a_DT student_NN or_CC when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP an_DT adult_JJ ,_, you_PRP enjoy_VBP life_NN differently_RB because_IN their_PRP$ situation_NN of_IN the_DT life_NN is_VBZ different_JJ
