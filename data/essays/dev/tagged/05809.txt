I_PRP beleive_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, the_DT young_JJ have_VBP much_RB more_RBR free_JJ time_NN than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ._.
A_DT typical_JJ older_JJR person_NN would_MD spend_VB their_PRP$ time_NN at_IN work_NN ._.
Most_JJS of_IN the_DT time_NN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP not_RB enjoy_VB going_VBG to_TO work_VB ,_, but_CC have_VBP to_TO go_VB anyways_RB to_TO make_VB a_DT living_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, the_DT youngs_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB work_NN and_CC often_RB enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ free_JJ time_NN with_IN friends_NNS or_CC their_PRP$ interests_NNS ._.
Also_RB ,_, the_DT physical_JJ make_VB up_IN of_IN the_DT young_JJ and_CC the_DT older_JJR people_NNS make_VBP a_DT difference_NN in_IN the_DT enjoyment_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
Many_JJ of_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN playing_VBG active_JJ sports_NNS and/or_CC games_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, the_DT older_JJR people_NNS can_MD not_RB physically_RB able_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB these_DT active_JJ sports_NNS or_CC games_NNS ._.
The_DT human_JJ body_NN is_VBZ constructed_VBN to_TO become_VB weaker_JJR and_CC feable_JJ as_IN they_PRP become_VBP older_JJR at_IN a_DT certain_JJ age_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, there_EX was_VBD a_DT young_JJ man_NN that_WDT loved_VBD football_NN and_CC became_VBD a_DT star_NN high_JJ school_NN football_NN player_NN ,_, but_CC thirty_CD years_NNS later_RB ,_, he_PRP can_MD not_RB play_VB his_PRP$ favorite_JJ sport_NN anymore_RB because_IN of_IN his_PRP$ physical_JJ fitness_NN ._.
Even_RB if_IN the_DT old_JJ man_NN kept_VBD his_PRP$ physical_JJ fitness_NN and_CC played_VBD football_NN ,_, he_PRP would_MD not_RB fully_RB enjoy_VB the_DT sport_NN as_RB much_RB as_IN he_PRP did_VBD when_WRB he_PRP was_VBD in_IN high_JJ school_NN ,_, since_IN he_PRP does_VBZ not_RB have_VB his_PRP$ old_JJ friends_NNS to_TO play_VB with_IN ._.
Another_DT reason_NN is_VBZ that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP school_NN which_WDT he/she_VBP can_MD go_VB to_TO find_VB many_JJ friends_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB her/his_JJ time_NN with_IN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR chance_NN to_TO meet_VB new_JJ friends_NNS that_WDT can_MD give_VB them_PRP enjoyment_NN ._.
