It_PRP is_VBZ often_RB believed_VBN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ,_, due_JJ to_TO several_JJ reasons_NNS ,_, which_WDT ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, are_VBP related_JJ to_TO the_DT availability_NN of_IN time_NN and_CC other_JJ physical_JJ and_CC mental_JJ resources_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN enthusiasm_NN ._.
I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN this_DT view_NN is_VBZ ,_, in_IN some_DT way_NN ,_, incomplete_JJ ,_, although_IN not_RB entirely_RB wrong_JJ ._.
The_DT incompleteness_NN of_IN the_DT view_NN ,_, is_VBZ given_VBN by_IN the_DT fact_NN that_IN old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP people_NNS with_IN experience_NN ._.
This_DT means_VBZ that_IN they_PRP can_MD assess_VB values_NNS to_TO certain_JJ actions_NNS on_IN the_DT basis_NN of_IN their_PRP$ past_JJ experience_NN ._.
They_PRP know_VBP what_WP to_TO do_VB in_IN order_NN to_TO enjoy_VB certain_JJ positive_JJ feelings_NNS ,_, as_RB well_RB as_IN they_PRP know_VBP what_WP to_TO avoid_VB ._.
This_DT means_VBZ that_IN people_NNS ,_, once_RB they_PRP become_VBP old_JJ ,_, have_VBP all_PDT the_DT necessary_JJ resources_NNS in_IN order_NN to_TO exploit_VB their_PRP$ knowledge_NN on_IN themselves_PRP ,_, and_CC hence_RB collect_VB the_DT fruits_NNS of_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS as_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, although_IN some_DT people_NNS believe_VBP that_IN money_NN does_VBZ not_RB make_VB happiness_NN ,_, old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR likely_JJ to_TO have_VB money_NN to_TO spend_VB for_IN themselves_PRP ,_, making_VBG them_PRP enjoy_VB life_NN in_IN more_JJR ways_NNS ._.
This_DT would_MD imply_VB that_IN you_PRP start_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN only_RB at_IN a_DT certain_JJ age_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, there_EX is_VBZ the_DT opposite_JJ pont_NN of_IN view_NN ,_, which_WDT is_VBZ the_DT one_CD of_IN the_DT statement_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS ,_, or_CC at_IN least_JJS most_JJS of_IN them_PRP ,_, do_VBP not_RB have_VB many_JJ things_NNS to_TO worry_VB about_RB ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ up_RB to_TO their_PRP$ parents_NNS to_TO control_VB and_CC administer_VB the_DT so_RB called_VBN `_`` dirty_JJ work`_NN ,_, whilst_IN they_PRP are_VBP free_JJ to_TO grow_VB up_RP ._.
This_DT shows_VBZ that_IN people_NNS ,_, during_IN the_DT early_JJ stages_NNS of_IN life_NN ,_, have_VBP plenty_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO dedicate_VB to_TO themselves_PRP ,_, to_TO the_DT discovery_NN of_IN new_JJ things_NNS ._.
If_IN it_PRP is_VBZ true_JJ that_IN old_JJ people_NNS know_VBP what_WP things_NNS they_PRP like_VBP and_CC what_WP they_PRP do_VBP n't_RB ,_, with_IN the_DT advantage_NN of_IN not_RB having_VBG to_TO experiment_NN anymore_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ also_RB true_JJ that_IN youngsters_NNS have_VBP the_DT possibility_NN of_IN going_VBG through_IN the_DT process_NN of_IN discovering_VBG ,_, which_WDT is_VBZ probably_RB the_DT most_RBS interesting_JJ and_CC fulfilling_VBG of_IN all_DT ,_, as_IN it_PRP gives_VBZ you_PRP the_DT opportunity_NN of_IN knowing_VBG new_JJ things_NNS and_CC experiencing_VBG new_JJ feelings_NNS ,_, which_WDT were_VBD previously_RB unknown_JJ ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, people_NNS usually_RB remember_VBP their_PRP$ first_JJ kiss_NN ,_, rather_RB than_IN their_PRP$ last_JJ ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP would_MD say_VB that_IN life_NN can_MD be_VB enjoyed_VBN at_IN every_DT stage_NN ,_, when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ and_CC when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP old_JJ ,_, although_IN in_IN different_JJ ways_NNS ._.
The_DT first_JJ period_NN of_IN life_NN should_MD be_VB dedicated_VBN to_TO discover_VB what_WP you_PRP like_VBP and_CC enjoy_VBP ,_, whilst_IN the_DT last_JJ should_MD be_VB dedicated_VBN to_TO the_DT exploitation_NN of_IN such_JJ discoveries_NNS ._.
