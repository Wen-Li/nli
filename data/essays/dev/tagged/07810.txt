It_PRP is_VBZ often_RB thought_VBN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, but_CC is_VBZ it_PRP really_RB true_JJ ?_.
A_DT young_JJ person_NN and_CC an_DT old_JJ person_NN differ_VBP completely_RB in_IN terms_NNS of_IN social_JJ status_NN ,_, experiences_NNS ,_, physical_JJ abilities_NNS and_CC other_JJ factors_NNS which_WDT can_MD explain_VB that_IN statement_NN ._.
Let_VB 's_PRP analyze_VB them_PRP ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, old_JJ people_NNS can_MD sometimes_RB be_VB limited_VBN physically_RB because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ age_NN and_CC it_PRP can_MD prevent_VB them_PRP from_IN doing_VBG all_DT they_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO do_VB ._.
Simple_JJ things_NNS of_IN life_NN can_MD be_VB difficult_JJ such_JJ as_IN going_VBG shopping_NN ,_, driving_VBG ,_, or_CC maybe_RB going_VBG out_RP with_IN friends_NNS ._.
All_PDT this_DT difficulties_NNS added_VBN together_RB can_MD make_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_RBR difficult_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS often_RB have_VBP more_RBR responsibilities_NNS in_IN terms_NNS of_IN family_NN or_CC professional_JJ goals_NNS ._.
This_DT can_MD create_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN stress_NN ,_, psychological_JJ tensions_NNS which_WDT prevent_VBP people_NNS from_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN at_IN its_PRP$ maximum_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP have_VBP to_TO say_VB that_IN having_VBG a_DT family_NN (_NN children_NNS ._. .._FW )_FW
is_VBZ not_RB only_RB a_DT source_NN of_IN stress_NN ._. .._SYM
and_CC can_MD therefore_RB be_VB a_DT great_JJ cause_NN of_IN happiness_NN !_.
On_IN the_DT contrary_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP often_RB more_RBR `_`` free_JJ '_'' psychologically_RB as_IN they_PRP are_VBP more_RBR unconscious_JJ than_IN older_JJR people_NNS and_CC want_VBP to_TO experience_VB life_NN in_IN a_DT fun_NN way_NN and_CC to_TO enjoy_VB it_PRP ._.
They_PRP often_RB do_VBP not_RB have_VB the_DT preoccupations_NNS linked_VBN to_TO a_DT family_NN or_CC a_DT professional_JJ situation_NN ._.
Consequently_RB ,_, they_PRP can_MD be_VB more_RBR selfish_JJ and_CC have_VBP fun_NN in_IN life_NN ._.
We_PRP also_RB have_VBP to_TO notice_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS often_RB do_VBP not_RB have_VB the_DT same_JJ problem_NN of_IN money_NN than_IN when_WRB they_PRP get_VBP older_JJR ._.
Most_JJS of_IN the_DT time_NN ,_, the_DT parents_NNS supply_VBP their_PRP$ chidren_NNS with_IN money_NN and_CC all_DT their_PRP$ material_NN requirements_NNS ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ thus_RB an_DT important_JJ worry_NN which_WDT dissapears_NNS and_CC allows_VBZ in_IN one_CD sense_NN young_JJ people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
Finally_RB ,_, we_PRP arrive_VBP to_TO the_DT conclusion_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_RB in_IN a_DT way_NN ,_, they_PRP are_VBP sometimes_RB unconscious_JJ about_IN some_DT worries_NNS or_CC problems_NNS which_WDT can_MD exist_VB in_IN an_DT older_JJR person_NN 's_POS life_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, some_DT people_NNS prefer_VBP to_TO make_VB sacrifices_NNS during_IN their_PRP$ youth_NN and_CC then_RB enjoy_VB life_NN when_WRB they_PRP are_VBP older_JJR whereas_IN other_JJ people_NNS make_VBP the_DT opposite_JJ ._. .._SYM
But_CC which_WDT is_VBZ the_DT best_JJS solution_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN as_RB much_RB as_IN you_PRP can_MD ?_.
