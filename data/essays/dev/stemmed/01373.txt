i do not agre with the statement becaus of the follow three reason . the student will not have chanc to confirm that what they know is true , and it might caus the decreas of the student ' interest toward the subject . also , they will not have abil to adjust their own knowledg to perform in the actual world which is the main reason whi student learn . therefor , it is not more import for studnet to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . understand idea and concept are reciev inform from other who have alreadi experienc , and by not be abl to actual see how the idea and concept work , the student might not be abl to have enough interest about the subject as they should be . if the student are not activ experienc the fact on their own , they can easili doubt that if those idea and concept are true in real world . lack the abil to see how they actual work can caus the decreas of their interest , which bring neg affect on learn habit . student without skill to perform correct action in the real world often do not have enough experi which come from learn fact of their own experi . as they grow up and prepar to play a import role in the societi , it is requir to have a lot of knowledg as well as enough experi to know how to adjust the knowledg for each specif situat . student with onli idea and concept which other peopl have introduc will lack the abil to gather specif inform of their own and place them into a correct consequ . it is more import for student to learn fact becaus it increas the willing for student to learn as well as the abil to perform better in variou situat in the real world .
