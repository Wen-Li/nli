alway is better to understand fact . as student , i realli think it it easer for us to understand a topic by use exampl and learn fact . when student just see the concept in class or the definit about someth it 's dificult to them to rebemeb it just as they saw it in class , but if they see an specif case about the same concept it will be easier to keep it in mind , becaus they can relat it to the real life . for exampl , last semest in my human reasourc class i had a teacher that alway help us to relat the theori with the practic , i rememb one class where we saw what an interview wa and in what consist , and she took a classmat to make him an interview explan all the step we need it to do to make it right , and show the most common mistak that we could commit . i remind it wa so enrich for everybodi in class , and after that when i enter to my fist job , i could rememeb everyth i had learn and i took it to the realiti . when we learn fact it also help us to convey it with our own experi . on the other hand , i have had class where we get full of concept and definit of some subject but we realli do n't know how to put it in practic and i do think all thi inform goe away . in conclus , to learn in a classroom or out of it will be alway better to usderstand fact and to relat with realiti , and also it will be easier for us to explain and to teach somebodi els , becaus we have alreadi absorb thi infom , and proffesor should do thi with the student sinc they are kid to provid them an import tool to learn better .
