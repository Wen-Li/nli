the older gener sometim say that the younger gener doe not play an activ role in help their commun anymor . they think that the younger gener is selfish and onli want to earn a lot of money . there are a few point support thi opinion but there are also a few against it . the first thing to say is that the tradit bond between the younger and older gener have dissolv nearli complet . e.g. it is not common anymor that both gener live togeth in one hous . therefor the younger gener can not feel thi strong sens of commun that onc exist . from thi on i think that the younger gener is involv in sever other activitit to help their commun . first , there are a lot of teenag who help the church or the local administr , e.g. dure elect . i have some friend do that and i can say that the work they do there is realli admir . second , there are mani teenag who are involv fight against environment problem . these activ are realli benefici to the local commun becaus they help to achiv a sustain lifestyl . the last point is that mani student are work hard for school or univers . that doe not onli mean that they want to achiv profession success but they also want to improv life at school or univers for theirselv and for all other student . now let me talk about a point i 've just mention : the hard work for school or univers . of cours thi mean that they have to spend a lot of time learn and not directli help their commun . but i think that learn is the best way to achiv a good life for the whole commun . the young gener know that without work hard they wo n't be abl to achiv a good life for their commun , e.g. if there are no skill worker in town economi and final the whole commun will suffer a lot . final you could say that it 's not true that young peopl today do not spend enough time to help their commun . as we 've seen , young peopl engag in a lot of activ in order to help their commun but they do thi differ than the gener befor .
