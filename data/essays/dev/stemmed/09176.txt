i 'm agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . the young are happier , have more energi , and do n't think to much in the consecuens of an action . young peopl like to enjoy life , go to the movi , beach , parti , go to ride bike , travel , listen to the music , danc and a lot of more activ . they want to be happi . old peopl usual have less energi to do a lot of thing than the young peolpl can do . when you are old may be your healt is not the same and you ha to expend time go to the doctor , therapi , go to the farmaci for medicin and be at home for more time whith respons to do , work , grandchildren to take care . you think more is you want to go to a place . young peopl and old peopl have a differ way to think about live , respos and have fun . old peopl are more conserv . most of young peopl just think in have fun whith their friend and most of the old peopl just think about work or rest .
