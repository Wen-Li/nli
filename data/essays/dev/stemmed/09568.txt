i am happi . i am young , and i am happi . i never been old in my life so i can not know if i agre or disagre whit the statement , base myself on my own life experi . but i do can answer base on what i live sinc thi time and on what i seen around me dure thi time . and i will say that i agre . their is a lot of avantag in get older . older peopl have more freedom ( they can do whatev they want to and do not have to ask anyon ) , they earn their life in their own so they are abl to plan it better than a young peopl becaus they do not have to reli onto their parent . .. but i am still think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . their is just much more thing to do , thing to enjoy , for young peopl . they do not have as much respons than older peopl , so they do not have as much thing to worri about . for exampl , i said that older peopl have more freedom , earn their own life . it is thrue . but what i did not say then , it is that their is more fun , to me , in enjoy life basicli , without ani troubl in mind , or much less import one . furthemor , young peopl have often much more possibl to meet new peopl and make new friend than older one . older peopl have to have a job to earn their life . and most of time , after the fisrt week im their compagni , they will see the same peopl , collegu , mayb for the rest of their life . a young peopl , do hi studi , meet a lot of new peopl each year when he come to a new class . he could even meet more new peopl if he chang of univers . so young peopl meet more peopl , make more friend , have more fun , and have less problem to worri about . .. well , i am also excit to get older and have more freedom and respons everi day , but i think that i may regret these year one day ,
