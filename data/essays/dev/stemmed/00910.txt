i agre with the statement that peopl who achiev success do tri new approach , rather than stick to the older thing which are familiar to them . for exampl ancient peopl were in the impress that earth is a flat surfac . scientist who prove the theori of univers didnot stick to these preform concept but rather thought innov and achiev success . so new way and idea are alway essenti for the success of a person . they allow us to increas the horizon of our knowledg and percept of fact . techonolog advanc are demand peopl to acquir new skill and approach . onli those peopl who adapt to these circumst will flourish in present day compettit world . to illustr , suppos a person is well skill to type on hi type machin and is complac with hi skill with no interest in learn comput skill will not meet new expect of the employ and might loos hi job . moreov , a person who adapt to the new demand and learn comput skill will flourish in hi career . a success person ha the habbit of explor newway and new thing and he tri to put himself in a superior posit through hi hardwork which is also innov . if a person stick to the method well known to him and refug to acquir newer skill donot get increment and promot in hi job . some peopl do not dare to risk new chang in their work . but we can never discov anyth new without experi . so , peopl should tri newth to improv themselv but that move should be genuin . for exampl , a wealthi bussi man who invest all of hi wealth in share might experi a sever loss amd may becom a pauper . so i feel that new approch should be definit encourag but the person should judg hi move rather than hastili implement hi idea . if the person is reason in hi approach , risk due to new approach get minimis and he enjoy the fruit of hi innov . so it is not alway riski to take up a newth . rather we can not acjiev ani thing in our life without face that minimum amount of risk .
