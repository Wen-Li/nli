i agre with thi statement becaus it is a fact and even i am a youngster who is enjoy life . but if we consid the posit of the old they might not have much strength in their bodi and even in their mind to enjoy their life by visit other place , friend , rel and mani entertain place to spend their life . an youngster can enjoy his/her life by with his/her friend , go out , go to school , colleg , job but the old may not get thi oppurtun . old peopl may not have patienc , interest in particular thing so mani old peopl prefer spend their life in their home or in their guest hous play with their grandchildren . though go to school , colleg might not be interest to few youngster but in my point of view it is still an interest part of our life which if we miss we can not get it back ever . studi new thing is veri interest rather than sit at home chat with the neighbour and watch tv . and i guess most old peopl spend their time in chat with anothewr old person and even watch tv . old peopl might not enjoy the new technolog and new invent which an youth might be enjoy . i guess that even old peopl in those day might not have good educ than thi gener and might have miss mani fact and detail which th gener know about it . i hope that the advantag i have list abov are also a part of enjoy in eveyon 's life . i hope that youth in today gener are in a better work condit than the peopl at the past . even that is too a enjoy which the old peopl miss out becus peopl in those day must have work hard and toil a lot but now we have machin for everyth which make our job lot more easier . thu i conclud that young peopl enjoy lifr more than older peopl do .
