a common idea is if you do n't take risk , you wo n't succeed . of cours in our modern societi the high number of peopl who want to succeed make the success more difficult to get . and as a result you have to take some risk . nevertheless you have to be careful becaus of the societi you have to take risk but if you miss your objectif even with a fall short , the societi wo n't forget it . and you wo n't be a success person ( for a long time at least ) . at the contrari if you do n't take risk you wo n't be success . the societi is alway move forward and if you want to follow and to succeed you can not remain and wait , without chang . so if you are chang someth you are take a risk even if it 's a veri small risk . if you do n't adapt your busi , your life or your job could get wors . from my opinion a sucess person took some risk , it 's compulsori . there 's too mani peopl and too mani busi on earth so if you want to suce you have to take risk . but the border between success and noth or even someth wors is veri thin . so you have to take risk but you have to be veri careful . it mean the more risk you take the more chanc you have to succeed but as well higher will be the fall if you do n't succeed . in conclus i think in our societi the onli way to succeed is to take some risk but to be veri careful . becaus i think as well a veri good way to loos everyth is to take too mani risk . it mean if you want to be success you have to stay in the border between not enough risk and too mani . and i think the most successful peopl keep thi border veri thin .
