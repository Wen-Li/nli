in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subejct by number of reason . first , to know about mani kind of thing be great influenc for the futur . when you get job , you will not do same kind of work for whole life . my father is priest and keep a kindergarden . he knoew about children becaus hi major wa teach in hi colleg . after he left grduat the colleg , he went to anoth colleg and studi about religion . he talk to so mani peopl and ha good activ and hobbi . second , you will be abl to make good relationship with other peopl . there are so mani peopl around you and everyon is differ and have deffer interest . if you have onli limit knowledg and if a convers is not about the subject you know , the convers may be bore for each other . final , if you special in one specif subject , you will know about the subject veri well . but so mani thing will be limit such as job , relationship . i think it is not interest to live .
