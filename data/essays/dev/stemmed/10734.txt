thi is a realli common theme for these period . young peopl most of the time are not interest to help and to develop the commun in which they live . just a small part of them is realli interest at the topic . often thi new gener is selfish and it is worri to satisfi their need instead to open their mind to the commun . i can say that mani thing are chang dure these year , in the past the peopl s commit wa much more develop and fell compar to these day . my parent , my grandpar realli believ in the possibl to creat a better place to live , moreov they tri with a lot of effort to improv activ that could let the commun be a better place . there were the trust that someth could chang if you are realli interest in what is around you . nowaday i think that the repons to take care of the commun is disappear at all - young peopl think that is not their problem be worri about the commun enhac , thu the common believ is that just the governa ha to promot and support it . furthermor the young peopl are not interest in thi aim becaus there is not for them a clear return in term of money or materialist benefit . thi gener ha lost the beuti in believ on the power of the idea . they do not fight anymor for an idea but just for themselv . an exampl of the differ between the past and the current day could be provid by a short stori told me by my granfath in the 1940 my grandfath wa veri interest to the problem of our town . he wa a person that ha tri to improv the econom condit of our citi and to develop the spirit for the commun . in that period in my small citi thre were not a cinema . the citizen of that time complain most of the time for thi kind of lack , even becaus in that period the cinema wa someth new and it appeal most of the peopl . my grandfath wa the one who invest money and final bought the first cinema odf my town . everbodi can rememb him firstli as a good person a then as someon who did at least some effort to take care of the commun .
