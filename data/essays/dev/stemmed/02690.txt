i agre with the statement . it is more import to understand the idea and concept . learn the fact without understand the bottom line of it doe n't make sens . it doe n't help peopl to improv themselv and deriv the point from the fact . for exampl learnin about scienc , if we do n't know the basic idea behind the fact we never get the connect between the releat fact . besid if we dont teach our student the concept behind the fact we would just develop a banch of encylopedia for futur not an effici and smart gener . they have to know reason , factor , consequ and develop about the fact . onli know the fact doe n't stand for much . there is some befor the fact and there is some after the fact . if they know both part , it make sens and draw a pictur in their mind . it will fli and never stabl in mind without it . also it is realli necessari for student to know concept behind the fact to make it easier them to understand easili . think about it . when they are learn graviti , if you dont explain the factor , reason and just tell them the ground pull us through what they would understand . probabl noth . in conclus , human alway look for reason , result and factor . they want to know whi ? so for student it s import to know idea and concept .
