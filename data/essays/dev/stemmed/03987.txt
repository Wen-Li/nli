that is a veri difficult question ! but me person , i disagre . i think as older you get as more you will enjoy the life . it ha someth to do with the life experi , the money or the incom , the knowledg . .. that should n't mean , that young peopl do not enjoy their life . but i think , they enjoy it in a differ way ! and that 's the fun part in your younger age . when you are young , you normal do n't know that much about life , so you have to adventur it . normal with no or with much less money as you will earn when you 're gete older . and that mean , that you can concentr more on the real thing you are interest in in life . as an exampl : when you are young and you want to go on vacat you 're look for a cheap way of do it . .. mayb a veri cheap flight to mallorca/spain , a youth hostel for 10 buck per day . no breakfast , coz you still have enough alcohol in your stomach , from the night befor . .. i am 30 now . and thi kind of vacat would be way to hard for me know . but when i think back . .. 5-10 year ago i would have love it . now i would rather flz somewher veri nice , with a nice hotel , mayb a rental car . some sightse . and in the even i would go out for dinner . to a nice restaur , with some delici food and a nice wine !!!! so for me . .. i enjoy my life more when i 'm get older !
