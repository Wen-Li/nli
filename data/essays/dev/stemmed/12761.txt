i don ' t think young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl . i tnink that they prefer to live their life in differ way . infact youn peopl love leisur time , love play toghet , they have to know the word and make new experi . for exampl the summer holiday are the week of the year more attend in which they don ' t have to think to school and where the onli think that they can do is to play everi day or to go to the sea . in my case , i am 22 year old , i enjoy life not onli becaus i can stay with my friend an go to danc or to the pub , i also love life becaus i have a lot of opportun , i need to know more think that i can , i need to realis myselv . i want a good work and a good career , i want to marri and a famili . old peopl enjoy life not less than young peopl , but i think that they have alreadi left thi import moment of their life and they prefer to stay toghet in quit and not busi place . an exampl is my grandmoth . she is 78 year old . she like to stay home to watch tv or to read lot of book . she like to cook and to fill her leisur time with her friend to speak . on holiday she like to stay everi day on the sun , she prefer to go out for a walk to look the landscap or to eat the ice cream . i think that youngh peopl and old peopl enjoy life , but they have differ interest and differ way experi of the life . if young peopl need to realis themselv , old peopl need to live the rest of their life to know more that they know . i can defin them the expert of life .
