have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject seem more interest than special in onli one subject , howev , we ought to determin all the advantag and inconveni to make our mind , i am convinc about the great import of master at least sever subject in order to increas our gener knowledg , it seem nowaday indispens to be awar of a lot of subject that belong to vari for exampl , we are to be abl to talk about polit , ecolog , commun and busi , and thi would not be possibl if we did not get broad knowledg in histori , biolog or mathemat , if not , we will not feel concern about veri import subject that are part of our life , that the reason whi we need to accumul a lot of knowledg while we are still in colleg , after be part of thi learn process , and onli after that , you will be abl to choos one specif subject that correspond truli to your person , your skill and your motiv . then , you might be further in the subject you have chosen to express yourself in the best way , whether if you were previous not interest in other gener subject , i am afraid that it would be difficult to envis thing in a veri matur and complet way , to conclud , you should have a look around you to be open6mind whatev your special may be in order to be abl to use a wide rang of skill ,
