advertis in the art of convinc custom to buy specif product . it is obviou that advertis do not provid a complet inform to the custom . that is not the origin purpos , even if it provid sometim use inform , and other way exist for custom to get inform about the product they want to buy . for exampl , a lot of independ websit compar all the model of the same product avail in the market . but even if advertis are not suppos to provid a complet inform , they often describ some featur of the product . do that , they can not lie about object characterist becaus it is not legal and the advertis would be forbidden by the compet author . then , how advertis can lie to the custom ? the way to describ a product can be veri subject and it is obvious the case for advertis . for exampl , if you present a car with veri beauti girl or boy drive it , you do n't lie but you give the illus that the car is better than it would be with a normal driver . that is seduct . a advertis is seduct . when you are interest in someon and you have a date you do not wear everi day 's cloth . you take more time to appear `` much better than [ you ] realli are '' . that is seduct too and nobodi seem to be against thi kind of `` subject lie '' . in my opinion , the statement `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' is true but that is not a problem becaus everybodi know that advertis are subject . there is a game of seduct between compani and custom . we have to know the rule and take part of the game . i think that the life would be less interest without thi kind of subject commun , beyond technic descript .
