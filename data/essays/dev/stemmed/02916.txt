in spite of the benefit of learn fact , i believ that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept . there are three main reason whi i have thi opinion . in the first hand , i support the idea that understand idea and concept in a field ( for instanc economi ) give a overal comprehens of thi field and the process that can occur in that field . thu , it allow graduat student that come into the labor market to meet the requir of numer job even if they did not studi certain characterist of some task . then , i have the belief that when a student ha well understood idea and concept in a field , he is then abl not onli to understand the new event that can take place in thi area , but also to learn itself from thi fact . final , from my perspect , the fact are wide depend from the time and the condit in which they occur . consequ , an event that took place in a certain situat or a certain countri , for exampl a major worker strike in franc befor a chang in polit major , can not be interpret than one in bangladesh dure a veri harsch time . futhermor , fact may be link to a fashion in the way of think or the way of product good . an illustr of thi idea could be the the fact that an american citizen sold a lot of french foie gra becaus he like that at a certain period , but still not do that becaus of a chang in both the relationship between the american govern and the french one , and the way to consid the treatment of the duck . howev , i admit that learn fact may help a understand concept either not concret at all or a littl difficult . as a conclus , i think that it is both more import and use for the futur life for student to understand idea and concept . nevertheless , learn fact can sometim be necessari .
