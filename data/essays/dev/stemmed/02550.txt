do success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well ? i do n't agre with that . i think experi , time , and the higher possibl of success are the main point to support my opinion . firstli , experi help peopl to be success in do one job . if a person ha a lot of experi on do one job , he can usual make the best decis when a problem come out . compar to a person who make a decis when he doe a new job , he is unexperienc and ha no idea which way ha more benefit for him . so he can easili make a wrong or wors decis . so success peopl would do what they alreadi know how to do well becaus they have experi . secondli , we need enough time to make our job success . work a job to be success is a long process . a person who doe a job which he alreadi know how to do well , save a lot of time on understand basic knowledg of the job . then he can spend more time to make the job perfect and and make himself to be success . final , a person doe a job which he alreadi know how to to do well , he ha a higher possibl of success than those who tri new thing and take risk . as we know , if we tri a new job , we have no experi about that and have to spend plenti of time to understand the job . it is riski to do that becaus we might find out we are not abl to make it success after spend a long period time . on the contrari , if we alreadi know a job well , of cours we know what to do to make it success directli effici . i disagre that success peopl tri new thing and take rick rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well , becaus they do n't have experi , enough time and a higher possibl of success in do the new job .
