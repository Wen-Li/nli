understand idea and concept is veri import for student , becaus it help to rememb process easili , for exempl . in the subject biolog , it is veri hard to learn fact without know for what the fact are necessari in a biolog system or process . in histori class it is also import to know about the date of event . but if you understand the idea and the develop of an event , you can easier put the event in an chronolog order . learn fact is veri import for student who educ a languag for exempl . they have to learn vocabulari to improv their new languag . jura student have to learn fact , too , and they have no chanc to let that out . student who studi medicin also have to learn a lot of vocabulari for anatomi . learn fact about a theme cost a lot of time and is not realli help in your later work for an enterpris . understand idea and concept is more like . it is easier to learn and to understand than fact . fact are just ficion and you often do not know how to use fact properli in an import situat . for exempl : if there is a machin which doe not work ani more , it is veri difficult to check everi singl fact of the machin . it is easier to think about the whole concept of the machin : how doe it work and what doe it produc ? in thi way it is more easier to find the problem of the defect machin . so , i think , student who want to take a job in an enterpris which is in the trade buis or in buis with process , have to know more about idea and concept . it is veri import to know about the whole work of a process than to know about fact you can easili look up in a book . understand idea and concept support the abil of think about a problem . and the skill to be abl of find a solut for a problem is a skill that make you desir for a lot of employe . in my opinion , it is support to declar that understand idea and concept is the most import skill for buis . and that is what student should learn at their univers .
