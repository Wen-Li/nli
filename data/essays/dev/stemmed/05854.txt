in one hand , i 'm not agre with thi follow statement . as we can see , there is more and more peopl who live on thi earth . progress of medecin , which make us our life be longer , the multipl of the popul let me think that we will be more human in 2026 than in 2006 . and due to thi multipl , the number of car sold out each year make me feel that car will develop in the same way like the popul . moreov , no govern have for the moment took postion in order to discov a new mean of transport . they are elabor compos fuel ( with ethanol ) or other kind of fuel , in order to reduc ga emiss in the atmospher but not in the way to reduc number of car . but on the other hand , mani thing make me think it to the contrari . fisrtli , i have talk about progress made by the medecin , in the first section , but it 's also all progress made in scienc in gener . someth let me think that some utopist had the right key . i 'm attend to wait for a replac of car by plane . it 's in my logic . and whi do the teletransport can not be creat in the nearest futur . teletransport can replac car . secondli , i 'm sur that the lack of petroleum which must happen in further year , will be the key of the substitut . even if we find solut . .. but today , it is not go in that way . we can also tri to limit the number of car by instaur mass mean of transport , like buse or train . final , the lack of petroleum is not the onli reason of a whisper declin in the number of car . even if we are still to discov new materi , ad to the number of car made by year , we can suggest a lack in metal , plastic , as far as the consumptiom of all habit of thi earth is so fast . to me , it is difficult to forecast such a statement , even if i hope there will be less and less car , and what i hope the most , is that a geniu must creat the teletransport , it will be veri effici for all peopl in all the world . but who know what our futur is made of . ..
