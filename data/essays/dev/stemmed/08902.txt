veri few peopl in franc think that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ than to specialis in one specific subject . indead , they think that you need to go through all the detail of a specif field if you want to be effici . is that true or not ? i do n't agre with such a prejudic . on the contrari , i think the more you know , the more effici you are . for exampl , if someon want to work in a librari , will he be more effici if he know everyth about book , publish and print ? i do n't think so . i think he will be more effici if he know about differ thing such as histori , anthropolog , philosophi , litteratur or scienc . practic can give you all technic knowledg but it will never replac broad knowledg provid by school and univers . the second reason whi i think a broad knowledg is import in our societi is that peopl who have broad knowledg are more flexibl . they are abl to switch from one field to anoth . in other word , they are what i would call ` complet person ' . the can adapt themselv to everi chang . for exampl , you can be a banker today and becom a manag tomorrow . my last point is about my polit vision of a modern societi : i think that a good citizen need to have a broad knowledg of all academ subject in order to make good choic . realiti is complex : if you want to understand what is happen in your contri and in the whole world you need to have a solid knowledg in differ field such as geographi , economi or technolog . to conclud about thi subject , i would say that the british ideal of the ` gentleman ' who know about all aspect of human thing continu to be import in our modern world .
