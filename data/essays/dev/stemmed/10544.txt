the issu of whether nowaday peopl do not give enough time to help their commun is a controversi one . on the one hand , there are some peopl that spent most of their time think how they can help their commun . on the other hand , there are some peopl that realli do n't care in help their societi . they just think on their own problem and do n't have enough time for other peopl . howev , in the final analysi i therefor agre with the statement that peopl do not gave enough time to help their societi . one reason for my belief is that in current busi world peopl do n't have time to help their commun . current busi world demand a lot of time and at the end of the day peopl are veri tire . for exampl , five year ago i work for an advertis compani . advertis is a veri difficult work and in that time of my life i usual spent more than 12 hour in my offic . when i return home at 9 o'clock i wa realli tire . it wa imposs for me to help my commun . the onli thing i want to do wa to go and rest . it wa imposs for me to tri to help societi , i wa alway tire when i wa n't at work . anoth reason for my belief is that peopl had becom more selfish . peopl just focu on what it is import for them . they do not care about what happen to other peopl , they just think on their own problem . recent research show than less than 15 % of the peopl from my hometown had help the commun in the last two year . for the reason state abov i agre with the statement that nowaday peopl do not gave enough time to help their commun . i support my point of view by two main point . first , that current busi world demand a lot of peopl time and second that peopl had becom more selfish .
