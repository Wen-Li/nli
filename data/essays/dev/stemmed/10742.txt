ye , i agre with the statement `` it more import to understand idea and concept than for them to learn fact . '' i feel it veri import for us to understand an idea than simpli know it . if you are good at understand idea and concept then you can make yourself think of the fact pertain to it . an idea when brought into implement , then it can be known about the good and bad associ with it , there bymak us to think about the fact relat to it . i feel the sequenc relat to thi idea concept is , firstli gener of an idea is import and is folow by it analysi , thi is made in our brain think about it result . nextli , it implement and there by deriv the fact out of it . so , the fact can be deriv from the concept itself . in my opinion , simpli learn fact without know ani inform regard will be like `` eat food without know what it is ? '' the food that you are eat may be tasti and you are enjoy it but withou know what are you eat seem foolish . in thi contemporari world understand idea and concept is in exist . so , when the world is run if you still continu to be letharg it not good on your part and you cant do justic to your profees . understand an idea make a person think about it there by make him develop or innov new idea regard the topic . it enabl man to be thought-provok alway . know the fact will be a part of the thi process if a person adopt a habit of understand the concept and there by fill the essenc of the studi . thu , i feel it more import for a student to understand concept and work upon them mind that he is also fill with the fact along with the idea .
