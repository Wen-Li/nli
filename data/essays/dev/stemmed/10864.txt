i absolut agre with the statement . moreov , i think that good advertis should enhanc the appear of effici to maxim the influenc on the consum . advertis for skin care product are especi good at twist realiti . they usual employ model that have immacul skin regardless of the product . then they follow the usual recip by show the model use the product and tell the audienc how big of a chang it made on her . it doe n't take long for the audienc to react to thi display of caus and effect . the problem is that the product probabl did n't have ani impact on the model whatsoev : she had perfect skin beforehand . and that 's not even mention the comput enhanc . .. howev , i think one thing must be realiz : the advertis that i describ previous did it job . it implant a seed in the consum 's mind and the sale will happen . that 's exactli the purpos of market : gener sale . i think it 's larg the consum 's respons to train itself to mostli ignor advertis . we know that they are fake , so whi do we believ them anyway ? do n't get me wrong : advertis is a regul busi and as such should limit itself to what ha been rule accept by societi . law exist that forbid tell lie or deceiv the custom in an advertis . build on my previou exampl , if the skin care product ha a real potenti for reason improv the appear of skin , then it is the consum 's task to discern what is real and what is embellish . as long as the advertis doe n't guarante the same exact result on everyon , the market firm is on pretti safe ground . i 'll conclud by attack the other point of view : how could anyon disagre with the origin statement that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are ? that 's the way it is . to anyon who believ advertis display the whole truth unmodifi , i have a bridg i 'd like to sell to you . ..
