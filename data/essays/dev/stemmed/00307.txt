i disagre the statement said about how advertis are . there are sever reason . firstli , an exces advertis confus the consum . usual , the consum buy the good base on the inform that the compani advertis . when the good are not what they tought about , they must be confus . for me , i want to lose my weight , so i buy the execesis machin . the advertis said i could lose my weight without suffer , and thet wa veri attract for me . i immedi decid to buy the machin . onc use of that , i found that it is veri difficult to use and demand . i gave up the use the machin . secondli , i think that the compani by which the exces advertis prevail lose their repetit . as i suffer that probrem mention abov , i do not have ani confid toward the compani . the compani have still sold the same machin and the progress method of the lose the weight , i perfectli doubt for the advertis , if they were acutu good for me . thirdli , that is not good at my countri 's societi . although exces advertis is need for gain more money , it doe not permit by the nation . that is tell a lie to the custom . onc permit that advertis , it would be wide spread all over my countri . that situat is not good at my countri 's societi . for exampl , food are to be sold with the deadlin of comsumpt , becaus that food is safe to eat . but rcentli , date deadlin of comsumpt date is intent chang by the compani . thi is veri discorag toward my countri 's nation . so that reason , i disagre with the statement .
