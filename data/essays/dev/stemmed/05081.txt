i do not believ that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . what make a young person happi may not make an older preson happi . to `` enjoy life '' is a veri subject concept that vari accord to the age , cultur background , religi belief , social environ and mani other factor . form my own experi , i learn to enjoy life everi day . when i wa a child i wa complet unabl to social , to relat to other children and have fun with my friend . famili problem that i wa go through made me a veri shi girl . in mani occass i could not find the way out from unconfort situat . the inabl to ask for help made my childhood pretti sad . young peopl today have , sometim , problem to express what make them happi becaus of `` peer pressur '' . most of the teenag who are `` follow '' ( mean not leader ) may find themselv in awful situat , do and perform act they do n't want to do . as we grow up , we dare to be deffier . we learn to say `` no '' and do not feel bad about it . our person get stronger and we feel more comfort with who we are . as we grow up we learn to overcom obstacl and as we get older we get wiser and learn from our own experi and other 's experi . the more we know about ourselv , the easier we find our way to happin . it take time to discov and understand what make us happi . that wisdom to understand and comprehend what joy mean to us come with age , with a life full experi , mistak and success . i strongli believ the opposit of that statement . a shi girl who doe not know how to ask for help , or a teenag who feel oppress by hi or her peer and a life with no experi will certainli have a harder time to find happi , to enjoy life . as i get older , i get wiser . when i make a mistak i learn from it . i heard a long time ago that grow older is mandatori , grow up is option . i agre with that .
