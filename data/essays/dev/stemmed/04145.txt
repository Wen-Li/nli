the one of my favorit hobbi is travel . i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i think , when i travel without ani tour guid , i can go ani place which i would like to go , and i can find my favorit place or thing , and i can get more strong friendship . fistli , without ani tour guid , our travel will be more flexibl for plan where to go or when to go . in my case , when i travel with a tour guid , there wa the place where i want to stay for more longer time , but he said `` we must go to next . '' i felt unsatisfi . secondli , it is possibl for me to find a place or a thing which is not so famou . that is to say , i will get my own special place or thing . i do not like crowd place , so if i can find unfam , but veri good place or thing for me , i think i am happi . final , if there is no guid for our group , we will get togeht to make our travel more preciou . i have a friend good at make a schedul , so with her i feel more happi , and our travel will becom more valuabl , moreov , our friendship will becom more strong . for these reason , i think the statement that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guid is not so good . travel is veri excit , so i wish i could go everywher .
