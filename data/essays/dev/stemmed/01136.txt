i fundament agre with the statement that mani advertis make product seem better than they realli are . howev , we should not ignor the the benefit of the advertis for thi reason . to begin with , i admit that most advertis do some exager on the product . it is also the reason whi the manufactur are so fascin in make advertis . the ad arous our interest by demonstr how excel the product are . for exampl , we can alway see the ad for hair clean product on tv . some model or famou start come out to show their extrem shini and smooth hair , and they tell us the special product is the reason for their beauti hair . it is realli attract . but when we buy the product from the market and use them , we will find that the result is not as good as the they claim in the ad . from thi aspect , we are cheat by the ad . howev , the variou advertis play signific role in our life . on the one hand , we can receiv some introduct and suggest from them . imagin when we are shop in the super market , we must to face thousand of brand . there even would be hundr kind of soft drink . if we know noth about the product , we must spend lot amount of time on select . with differ ad , situat chang . we must be awar of sever brand of the soft drink , then we can choos from these small rang . on the other hand , advertis ha becam a big industri . both the custom and the manufactur need the ad firm . and these firm suppli larg number of job opportun for our societi everi year . therefor , the advertis are necessari for us . last but not least , the qualiti and servic determin the product ' fate ultim , not the ad . we custom may be cheat onc , but not alway . besid , not everi product is bad . the famou and last brand in most field are good enough for the custom , in fact . as thi reason , i think it is accept when some advertis exager the benefit of the product . base on the abov reason , i believ that advertis would serv good function to our societi , although they sometim make the product seem better than they realli are .
