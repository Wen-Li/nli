thi is a veri import issu with respect to the commun and the youngster who are part of thi commun . the issu which doe need the attent and analysi . although it is not that whole young crowd ha becom indiffer to help the commun but i certainli believ that look upon it wholli , the young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help the commun . there are sever reason for my accept of the statement and i would like to state them in the follow paragraph . the main reason i feel thi is becaus today youngster have becom too narcissist . they are all self-cent and bother about their person progress . thi is due to the ever increas competit . in thi competit world , to catch up with the pace each youngster is busi polish himself/herself for the contend . and in thi cours he remiss the commun . he is too worri about hi own progress and achiev to look into the commun matter . each of them want to be the best and they dont want to afford wast time on other . the other reason which make me accept the statement is the preval of the corrupt , violenc , robberi , murder etc and whole lot of crime take place . if the youngster gave enough time to the well be of the commun , would n't be the scenario differ ? all those murder , robber , rapist constitut of whom ? are n't the major chunk of them the youth of the commun . instead of be help to their commun they are becom the caus of all sort of suffer and trauma to the commun , i must say . further , i feel that youngster are not contribut to help the commun becaus they are get away from moral valu and disciplin of the societi . today youngster want to be more independ and doe not want to be taught all those lesson of help other . what he learn from the today grow technolog world is how to make himself modern and how to cope up with rest of the competitor . admist thi , he doe not care for the commun . for exampl , today most of the young peopl spend half of their time on internet . now , by exploit internet what are the possibl of them use it for other 's sake or to help someon compar to the possibl of chat , brows , look for job opportun , search for institut for further educ etc . certainli , the probabl of util it for person benefit is quit higher . all these reason and exampl make me accept the statement that nowaday , youngster are not much interest and henc not devot much time to help the commun . thi can be attribut to their ignor about the well be of other and zeal for person holist develop .
