we do not have ani proof about thi statement and so we can say mani differ thing . when i talk to my father and we are involv in traffic he carri on say that he when wa a teen there wa not all thi mess . street were not full of car becaus there wa onli one car per famili . now everyth ha chang . first of all everi year we hear about statist investig that give us a complet differ point : the number of car is increas . thi may be caus by the improv of our wealth condit . when my father wa young itali wa a poor countri and it wa just at the begin of it transform in a modern countri . so the actual situat doe not seem to sustain the statement . there is howev some other consider that we can do . our develop can not be sustain by our planet . our suppli of oil are get fewer and fewer and we have not found valid altern power to substitut oil by now . there is hydrogen but it is more expens . at the same time electr engin do not have the same perform of the actual engin . so if for exampl hydrogen will be our onli alternt it will probabl be imposs for a famili to have enough money to pay more than one car with hydrogen as propel . the other thing that can influenc the number of car is the polici of our govern . as i have alreadi mention , traffic is increas more and more everi year . but it will not be alway possibl to build new street and new rout . there will be a limit . thi fact can be alreadi seen in the choic of some import citi . to get in london with our car we must pay a ticket . also milan is go to adopt similar decis . so perhap there will be a strong develop of public transport . instead some countri have alreadi found differ altern . netherland for exampl is the countri where there is the highest number of bicicl in the world . if you walk around the street of amsterdam , you will see bicicl everywher . even in front of bar , megastor and fastfood . but thi result is relat to the choic of the govern of build street for bicicl . so the politician have encourag peopl to lock their car in their garag . in the end , i do not see the possibl of a spontaneu reduct of the number of car . there are too mani interest often relat to the oil industri and to the factori that build car . they are often import part of our economi and the govern do not want to damag them . but they will be probabl oblig with us to chang our life style when the situat will get unsustain .
