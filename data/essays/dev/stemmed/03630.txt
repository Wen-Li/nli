it ha been an argument regard with the issu that , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . some peopl prefer to travel alon . becaus they do n't need to adjust their time for the other peopl and they can decid everyth by themselv . howev , on my perspect , i think it is better to travel by a group led by a tour guid rather than travel alon . first , if we travel to the place that we are not familiar , everyth is so srang . so in thi case we need somewon who are well known about the place , like a tour guid . it is certain that tour guid is an expert of the travel place , he or she will make a great scedul and adjust the time . the onli thing that we have to do is follow the schedul . i think it is convini and we do n't need to wast the time . second , we can have more great experi with the group of peopl . peopl can exchang their own opinion and also they can take a remark pictur togeth . they can also enjoy more pleasur time rather than feel alon . as peopl are live the social sociati , travel by a group could help to develop their relationship final , becaus of two reason , i think better and effici way to travel is tarvel in a group of peopl togeth led by a tour guid .
