as a young person myself , i often feel guilti for spend so littl time with the commun . i had often notic that the social bond between neighbor have diminish in recent year , and peopl are becom less care than befor . that 's whi i think we should definit spend more time help our commun . but how ? the main reason nowaday that young peopl doe n't spend much time with their commun is that they are cram with homework , extracurricular activ , entertain , ... etc . they are simpli not spend a lot of time stroll about the neighborhood . without ani interact with their neighbor , young peopl will easili neglect their role as a member of their commun . although they read about commun servic in their textbook , few actual particip in it . and when you ask them whi , they simpli repli : ` i do n't have time . ' so if we wish to solv thi problem , the first thing to do is to decreas the amount of burden on young peopl . school should end earlier so that young peopl can spend more time insid the commun . teacher should give their student less work on weekend so they could have adequ time to conduct effect commun servic . parent should reliev their child of to much activ and they should not forc them to go to cramschool . without these correct to our educ system , school would end up to actual teach young peopl not to spend time with the commun . of cours , one might contend that young peopl will end up spend the extra time play comput and not do commun servic at all . that might be the case for some kid , but in my opinion , if peopl felt they are involv in their commun , they would tri their best to make it better . thi sentiment can be further enhanc by govern propaganda and social educ . it is everyon 's responsibil to bring young peopl back to commun servic . they should not simpli put their blame on lazi manifest by the younger gener . i pray for a day when the old bond between neighbor can be re-establish .
