i strongli agre with thi statement . let me explain whi . we live in the era of inform and technolog . our everyday life is sorround by thi fact : comput and internet , televis , cinema . .. enterpris take benefit from thi new way of obtain inform , and settl their advertis everywher . we can see public on the street ( for exampl bu stop ) , on the internet ( while we surf the net , mani differ advertis will show up ) , in the cinema ( film usual contain hidden refer to product ) ... but the main way enterpris expos their product is televis . most of the popul ha a tv at home , or at least , ha access to it in the neighbourhood or at school . .. who doe n't watch televis ? a person that might admit not watch it would be treat as an alien or someth similar . public in televis is the main support of a tv channel : enterpris pay larg amount of money to have a space after a program , so they can show their product . and what about the product show on the televis ? well , as we can daili see , all type of item are anounc : car , perfum , film , drink , food . .. but are these product expos from an object point of view ? no , i do n't think so . public expert design the advertis in a way it will call the spectat 's attent , but not becaus of the product natur , instead of that , they will talk about it effect , about the feel or impress you will experi if you buy it or use it . have you ever seen a `` high qualiti '' perfum advertis ? thi public will not refer to the way the essenc is made , no , thi advertis will talk about the effect it might have in the person and all the peopl that sorround that person . for instanc : the perfum will make you feel fresh ; or make all the men fall in love with you ; or make you the sexiest girl in the citi ; or even compar the perfum 's effect with the great pleasur in life ! the thing is that we do n't realis thi is n't true until we buy the product , and then , it 's alreadi too late . so final we conclud , as the statement say , that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
