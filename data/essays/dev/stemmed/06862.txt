i alway think to myself , what will my grand parent do when i am have fun or boredom in school . everytim i go pass by old peopl , they sit on a bench hold the leesh of their dog and watch peopl walk pass by . but their truth of enjoy wa someth els , someth more impress and tear . therefor , i believ that they may not be enjoy their life in my sight , but they are certainli enjoy more than us , younger kid . when i wa at my grand parent ' place , i wa investig what they would do for the 24 hour . their bed time wa worth half of my bed time and their tv time wa worth not even the half of my tv time . and even , when i wa tri to entertain them by teach them how to use the comput , they sleigh the mous on to the comput screen which made me give up on them . then , i realiz that their enjoy wa someth els , which young peopl can not possibili feel . when it wa my bed time , my grand mother wa stay up watch a seri of drama . i interrupt her ask what is her entertain in life and she answer me that her enjoy of life is all about watch me and my mother 's day go past by safe and our fulfiment of laughter is instantli her pleasant laughter . and the next thing she said to me is that she is enjoy so much of her life that she would not regret for live , even if she die the next day . in conclus , i do not know how their own enjoy of life work , but all the tear say that my grand mother had made for me touch my heart and therefor , i believ that older peopl enjoy their life more than us , younger kid who onli know how to play comput game .
