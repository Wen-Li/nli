someon suggest that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . but i quit disagre with it . first of all , i like to enjoy the journey in my own way . i alway like the pleasur of freedom . arrang the travel is a hard work , but it is quit intreset . but to be led by a tour guid , i have to obey the instruct he make . i have to follow the whole group to go to somewher i do n't want to , i have to go to the place order by tour guid , eat the food order by tour guid , even go to toilet at the time fix by tour guid . so we hire a tour guid or we hire a command ? furthermor , the tour guid alway say the same thing just like the travel book . i can see it in the hotel , or through the internet , whi i should hire a tour guid for thi ? second , which is even wors , is that tour guid onli have most profitablt rout , so there are mani place i can n't find a tour guid . especi for some veri excit undevelop district , it 's veri hard to get a tour guid . last time , some friend and i want to go the a moutain in our provinc , after we explor all the websit of the tour compani , none of them had thi rout . we had to go by ourselv . third , someon acclaim that traval in a group led by a tour guid will save money . it make sens sometim . but busi is busi , you have to pay extra money for the guid not the journey itself . moreov , some tour guid will bring tourist to shop , mall but not the place we want to . just becaus thi shop , mall will pay tour guid for bring busi . i even heard that some tour guid cheat and blackmail the tourist about eat , transport , etc . it 's quit difficult to find a good tour guid . to sum up , i do not like to travel in a group led by a tour guid .
