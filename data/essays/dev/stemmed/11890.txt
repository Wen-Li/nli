i have alway consid travel as excel method to know mani peopl and to know mani differ cultur . but it could be a littl bite expens and danger if you do not have the apropri instruct . in thi paper i want to disscuss about the advantag and disadvantag that we could appear when we are travel with out a suitabl orient . first at all , if we are travel in a group led by a tour quid , we can feel safer and more confid to explor new thing and landscap . it is due to the expertis and experi that a tour guid could have . moreov , the guid could show to the travel the import and interest place that the group should visit dure the trip . it is too import becaus it can be save money and time . ! you go straight to the point . it is fantast . on the other hand , if we travel in group led by a tour guid we can feel uncomfort with mani thing . one of them is that you can not visit some place when you want do it becaus it is usual that a tour guid ha a travel rout decid and schedul befor the trip ha start . ad thi point , you can not enjoy isolet space and activ becaus most of the time you have to share differ activ with tthe all group and it can be bore experi . from my point of view it is veri import to travel with someon els , but if i have the opportun to do it in group it is wonder . becaus of the mutual cultur and interperson exchang . youcan enjoy and involv in mani activ easili . but if you group ha a tour guid is excel tool to know a a lot of place use less time and money . i think the most import issu if you want to travel is to be prepar to do it alon , in a group or with a tour guid . it doesn not matter , ju take into account your happi and your feel to have fun .
