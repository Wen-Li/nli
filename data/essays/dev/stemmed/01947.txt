person i do n't agre with the given statement and i think that if you do what you know and do that well you can be as success as a riski person . today peopl are most like more riski and like to be challengend but thi is whi they can easili fail . for instanc i had a friend who had a veri good job as a banker . he had a good posit and earn enough money but he want to make more out of hi life . he start studi again in anoth field and had to give up all the littl luxuri he wa use too ( like hi car , old apart etc . ) unfortun that wa five year ago and hi `` risk '' did n't work out that well . the normal studi time would have been four year but dure the time he figur out that thi field seem not to be the right thing . he develop bad grade and ha to retak class plu when he final finish hi studi it might be veri hard for him to get a good job becaus the demand in hi field went drastic down . if he would stay in hi old job he could have been the director by now . anoth reason for disagre with thi statement is that i think you should treat all peopl equal and not judg their success base on the way how they got to a certain point . for exampl if it come to a job offer and there are two peopl who appli for it i think that the person who work for year at the same place and ha a lot of experi in that specif area might be more successful than ani other person . but i found it veri surpris that peopl overse those peopl and are more interest in hire somebodi who ha a way more interest past and took some risk to get there . on the other side take a risk might open you new door that you could n't have had imagin befor . given those reason and the choic beween tri new thing and take risk or stick to familiar behavior i person think that you can be veri successful either way .
