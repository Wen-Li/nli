nowaday , young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . i agre with that statement and i think that there are sever reason for that . first , condit of life ha chang , everyth is go faster now , peopl do not have much free time , they time is separ between their studi , their part time job , sport , and some social activ so after all thi they do not have much time left to do someth els . second , peopl now are no longer attach one to anoth as they use to be , it just like if they use the mean of friendship and commun directli with other . so as a result , if they not commun well they will not be abl to help their commun as a group . final , befor in a neighbourhood eveybodi know everybodi becaus there wa not much peopl , but now it get crowd and they may not know who is their second neighbour . so how would they meet and tri to help their commun if they do not even know each other . to sum up , i think that peopl should well organ their schedul and find some time to help their commun becaus after all that is where they live .
