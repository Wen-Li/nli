i do n't agre with the follow statement : `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . i think that the correct statement will be the exact opposit . i 'm gonna defend my point of view first by proov that to success peopl need to studi , then the success need to been build step by step and final the success is come from other trust . fist of all , i personnali think that to succeed , studi is need . go to colleg is not a risk but the opposit , an insurr in life . that an invest in life to a better futur and and a secur one . of cours go to colleg can be see as someth new at the begin , but it 's not exactelli like that . it 's more like a continu of a reach to knowledg . by have a degre , peopl learn how to do someth good . the second reason whi i disagre with thi statement is becaus i think that success is someth which need to be built . it 's not come eas and fast . that 's a long daili work and to increas chanc to achiev it , stabil is requier . rune and rush from one plan to an other one wo n't lead no where . final , i think that to success in life trust from folk is a must have . without trust there is no possibl real success . and take risk is the worst way to reach that trust from peopl around . again , the trust is someth to build day after day . and to get it a knowledg in the activ is also requier , nobodi is gonna trust somebodi new in a realm who doe n't know what he is talk about . of cours success can come to someon who is take risk , but it 's like the lotteri it is happen to one in a million . i think that knowledg , stabil and trust are the key to success .
