i agre with thi statement . in my opinion be successul requir you to be uncommon . you need to have some uniqu qualiti in order to be recognis and acknowledg by public . repeat the same thing you in which you have acquir perfect might earn you attract result initi but in the long run they are n't much fruit . the compet in all field of life is veri tough these day . so to overtak other you need to possess some distinguish charecterist . work on a same project again and again is not go to solv your purpos . becaus gradual other peopl also acquir masteri over them and may even surpass you . though tri to do new thing , say , for exampl start a new busi may ultim turn out to be a disast and in that context the other view appear to be more appropri but as we all know ` failur are the step stone to success ' . histori is full of instanc that support the idea of endeavour new thing . one common exampl is of scientist . it well known that onli those who have tri to innov have been abl to regist their name in the book and are rememb even after hundr of year . what if einstein had accept the alreadi run theori ? the concept of rel would have never aros and of cours einstein could n't have been abl to get the nobl prize . there are numer other exampl of variou leader , businessmen , research who becam success onli becaus they tri to introduc new concept . to name a few , mahatma gandhi who pioneer indian freedom movement , businessmen like bill gate who intoduc window and revolutionis the comput industri and now he stand as the richest man on earth . so base on abov mention exampl and fact i am of the opinion that onli those succeed who do new thing and take risk
