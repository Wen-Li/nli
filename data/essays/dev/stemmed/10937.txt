mani peopl in thi modern world wonder if success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . in my opinion , i think success peopl are the peopl who tri new thing , but in the end it ha it advantag and it disadvantag . i think that success peopl are the peopl who tri new thing becaus these peopl work hard , research and tri there best to find new thing as well as get thing better and more effic so i guess these peopl deserv to get more than the peopl who are just sit in their place , repeat the same procedur again and again through out the year . success peopl in my opinion never stop the hard work , never stop research as well as never stop or speed down the pace from look for the better and the best as thi modern world is modern , and improv day after day so you have to be on the pace and never stop from work hard to find new thing . alway a person , who stop or slow down hi pace in research and work hard , will be thrown out of the compet . there are few disadvantag of tri new thing and one of them is that by tri new thing you may risk yourself , as for exampl if the new thing did not work or benifit it will caus failur and sometim may caus great lose to a specif person or even compani . in my opinion , some time tri new thing is worth the risk as the percentag of success is much higher than the percentag of failur in most time . some advantag of do what you alreadi know , which are few is that you do not risk your self in danger , it keep you out of the red zone and into the green zone . in my opinion , peopl who dont like competit , face , and peopl who do not have strong heart stay do what they alreadi know how to do well in . final , success peopl alway tri to find new thing while peopl who want to stay in their place and not chang keep do what they alreadi know how to do well in and i am a person who think success peopl are who tri new thing and bare the risk .
