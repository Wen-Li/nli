i think that in twenti year there will be fli car ! today the car is becom a statu symbol , there is n't a famili without a car , but the problem is that there are a lot of peopl who prefer to have a beauti car than a sweet home . the famou sentenc `` home sweet home '' is in danger becaus is not more at the first place of the desir . a car wa the symbol of a gener , our parent rememb their first car like a realiz dream , today the guy want a car becaus the best friend ha one and not becaus they understand the real mean that it can have . i think that in twenti year thi object of desir will be more want , more desir and more danger . .. there are just now a lot of car that ride too fast , in the twenti 's it will be certainli worst . today young peopl die becaus they can drive car that run veri fast , tomorrow they will can fli . i hope it will be differ . at my grandfath 's time the car wa a luxuri good becaus he cold n't have one . a car is a lot of money and when there wa the war money are ghost . in the sixti some peopl like corradino d'ascanio creat a way to help these person to discov the world : vespa . thi ha been a real statu symbol thank to the great mean it had . `` with vespa you can fli '' and with thi begin , motor becam the most import thing for peopl . in the sixti it wa possibl to fli away , tomorrow it will be possibl too ? it 's import to be free , with a car i can be free becaus i can go wherev i want . for thi reason there is the fewer car . a fewer that will never pass .
