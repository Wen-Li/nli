there are mani reason whi the number of car in use today will not stop increas in the futur . just judg from the way car have becom more and more popular and common over the past tweni year it is unlik to expect a sudden chang in that area . anoth point support that theori certainli is that car have becom more afford for everyon and also veri easi access for young peopl . most peopl in the unit state of america posess their first own car bz the age of sixteen . anoth problem that in my opinion is directli link to the number of car and that we are face today is the problem of obeseti in sociey . in most develop countri peolp are get bigger and bigger , becom more and more lazi and therefor more like to drive a car . simplz becaus it is more conveni . then again , peopl are also start to be awar of the direct link between car and the effect they have on environment chang . some strongli object to the idea of have a car becaus they simpli can not live with the thought of destroy the planet out of egoist purpos . in a televis transmiss that i happen to watch a few day ago i also heard a discuss about tha earth run out of natur sourc such as oil . if there is no more oil we will have a huge problem suppli our car . although that is not expect to happen anytim soon scientist are tri to find altern by develop more natur and environ friendli way to make an engin work . but i believ that thi will take a huge amount of time and not be present to the public in the next year . so , no , i do not believ that there will be less car in 20 year
