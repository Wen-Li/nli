there are mani way to travel , such as travel with our famili , with our friend , as an individu or in a group led by a tour guid . also the way we choos to travel is highli depend on a place we choos to go . from my person experi , i think that travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best way if we would like to go to a new place or citi . there are sever reason for thi , first and mayb the most import one is that we might choos a countri or a citi that the local languag is not our mother tongu , so the tour guid would be a help resourc in thi case and of cours s/he would help us do the procedur such as book a hotel , know the restaur , etc , while enter the place . also , as we are new in the citi and we do not know mani thing about it social cultur , by have a tour guid with us , we can easili be inform of the use inform about the habit and cultu of the peopl in that specif countri , and we can be well prepar for the travel . the second reason , in my opinion , is the fact that we sure would like to visit mani new place in our travel and of cours get mani new inform about the histori , art , social life , music , etc of the place . how can we obtain such an inform if we travel without a group led by a profession tour guid have lot of interest inform about the citi ? i think it might be possibl to do all of these thing if we travel individuali , but realli we will wast lot of time on it . third and last , to travel in a group is much more safer than the other way , sinc there might be some possibl danger along out trip , the tour member can be help in these case . all in all , if i choos a new place to go , i prefer to travel in a group led by a skill tour guid to have a great time and enjoy my trip .
