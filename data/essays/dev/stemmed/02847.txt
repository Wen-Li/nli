it is a difficult question becaus i think that everi aspectof studi is import for student . i am not agre in total with the statment that say that is better for student to undestand idea and concept than to learn fact , becaus i think they have the same importan in a develop of young peopl . in gener i think that it is import for student to understand idea and concept becaus it is onli with thi passag that they can have their opinion and idea , but at the same time it is also import to learn fact becaus with the knoledg of process of the fact peopl can do what it wa be right in the past and do not what wa danger or wrong . for exampl i thaink that the concept of peac can be better undersand if you know histori , in fact with that matter you understand that war give peopl onli poverti , difficulti and not good thing . i think that it is easi to understand concept if you have a real inviron in some fact . the idea and concept , with the studi and learn of fact give us a strong base of our educ and it is import for a good futur improuv . final i think that both of thi aspect are import for a good develop of young peopl , so student have to undestand idea and concept
