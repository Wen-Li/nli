i firmli believ that exist ani men 's finest hour , and i am not abl to say if it come in earli or latest period of our live . gener i think that a men 's finest hour come when he work hard for year and year , to final discov that he wa right in hi life and so wa the thing he had work to , and thi discov happen when he final lie on hi battlefield , exhaust , but victori . homer said that men becom more tire of drink , danc and make love , than make war : so he would say that men are alway in war , and onli the dead saw the end of it , not becaus their are bad or barbarian , but becaus they enjoy to live their life on the edg , to take match everi day , to demonstr they are victori . i think thi is the mean of `` enjoy life '' : to take part everi day in new competit , go away victoriuo , in the end . now , i 'm not abl to say when occour our best hour , it may happen when we 're old or when we are young , the mean thing is enjoy thi moment . young boy , probabl , live their live and do n't think too much at the far futur , when they will be old , like de'medici said in hi poem . opposit thi argument , we can say that old peopl have a heavi bag full of cultur notion and experi , and they think much more at the thing they have to do , care not onli to themselv , but to all the peopl they have around and with have relationship . in ancient time they said : `` onli the good die young '' , but thi think wa strictli join to a pagan vision of the world and life . now is the coultur of the christian that found it way to rule the world , and we can say that we have not onli a heroic young , but also a respect middl or old age : thi period of life is not yet rate like the autumn . we can enjoy life in everi period of our life at the same matter , it do n't care how much year you carri on .
