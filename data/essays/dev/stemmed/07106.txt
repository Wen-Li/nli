travil is a veri nice thing , it hepl you see new coultcur and to meet new poeplo , there are alot of way for travil and i believ that the best way is to travil with a group led by a tour guid , becus when you go to a new countri u will need someon to gide u aroud u will never know where to go or what to do alon onli if u had someon to guid u to show you the best and the most import part of the citi you are in the guid will have a plan to show you everi thing in the citi so u wont miss a thing and also if u need a help he can help u or if u dont speck the languej of that countri you are in he can help u with that to for exapl if u were in pari and u dont speck french what can u do if u were alon ?? at that time a guid would help you alot , and to be with a gruop is so much fun than bee alon that where u can meet new peopl make new friend and enjoy your time and it also much cheeper to travel with a group rather than travil alon so it would save you alot of mony to for exampl if want to go anywer u will have to take a cab but if u were with a group u can go on the bu it would be much cheeper , that whi i agre that travil with a group led by a tour guid is the best way to travil .
