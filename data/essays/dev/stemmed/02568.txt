i disagre with that articl . it is imagin that there is some subject what i have to solv , i have to explain with sever reason of support detail . and those reason are help the explain . for instanc , i would like to deal with microwav . first , i should judg about the subject . i should have gradual motion if iwant to use the microwav . so i can think about motion how can i use the microwav . also , i have to deal with specif step . when i make the solut , i have to explain hte way more easili . for exampl , first step is what to do , second step is what to do . .. ect inconclus , all these reason are appear that the one special specif subject are good . so it is better to special in one specif subject than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject
