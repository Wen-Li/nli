the student ' teach method is veri controvers between the approach focus on the fact and the other more base on the concept and the idea . i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact for three main reason : understand idea can help the student to underst fact , it is easier to learn fact individu , understand idea allow the student to develop it own reflexion and critic . firstli it seem to me than when a student understand idea and concept than will help it to understand the fact . inde it would be not veri interest for a student to learn a succes of fact without know whi these fact are happen . for exampl the histori fact are numer and it is imposs to keep all of them but if you understand the idea of an special histor event you can learn better all the fact that are associ with thi event . secondli i think that it is easier to learn the fact individu than understand idea and concept . as a matter of fact , the professor can give to their student key that will help them to understand the idea . at the contrari the fact are not difficult to understand and also the support of the professor is not indispens . the professor can illustr the fact with person experi and therefor make them more interest but he will not chang the fact . final , i believ that the understand of idea and concept for a student is the basi of the develop of it own reflexion and also to have critic . by identifi the structur of a conceptor a idea , the student can develop it own idea and build also a think system . for instanc a student that understand well a special philosophi concept can do it own theori about the concept . to conclud i can say that the understand of idea and concept is the most import part of a student learn process , even if it is not unnecessari to learn fact but not as the first prioriti .
