the issu statement state that there will be a declin in the number of car in the next twenti year . i strongli disagre with thi statet . moreov i think that the number of car be use is go to increas in the near futur . first reason i would like to give is that the cost of car is go to decreas gradual . if you obserev the past trend previous it use to be a luxuri to possess a car . but now it ha becom a necess . also the cost of car when compar to the past rate is veri low now . hope that the the same trend continu in some 5 or 6 year even the common man will be abl to afford a car . so everybodi will be rush to own a car and henc the number will rise exponenti . second thing is that car are thought to be more safer when compar to other two wheeler . thi feel is gradual spread in countri like india where the two wheeler domin the road . if thi notion becom stronger present two wheeler owner will replac them with car and again the number of car will increas . third idea is that car can transport mani peopl at a time when campar to bike and scooter . so these bike or scooter owner also will be tri to purchas car . also as the price of petroleum product are go to increas peopl will think of spend money on car and have combin transport rather than invest on individu tranport mean such as two-wheel . last but not the least mani peopl thik that own a car is a kind of prestig issu . in thi modern world where peopl are constantli tri to show off it wont be a surpris if more number of car are purchas . henc in the near futur more number of car are go to land on the road throughout the world
