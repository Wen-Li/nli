responsibl play a big role in our life spicif for older peopl . when an young child is have fun and he doe n't care about money , home and issu that happen for ani person . young poepl think that they still have a good health but when they get older their health will start to go down . i agre with young peopl who want to have fun more than older peopl for coupl reason . first of all , responsibl as i mention in the begin , make ani person think about how to make hi life more confid and never think about how to enjoy life except after finish everyth he want to do . for exampl in ani famili , the father alway think about how to get money for hi children , the mother look after the children and tri to help her husband financi . if we look at the children , we can notic that they want to play everyday and have fun without think about anyth . that wa a good exampl of show the differ of how young and old peopl act . second reason , old peopl alway start to take care of their health which absoultli goe down as they get older . in the other hand , young peopl think about no resposibilti and no problem with their health , so whi do n't they enjoy their live befor anyth happen in the futur . for exampl , if someon who is 60 year old and he is retir from hi job , he could have health problem refus him to enjoy hi life . anoth man who is 20 year old , who just finish hi high school and he want to play sport and go out with hi friend without ani health problem that if we ignor the exceptin like the handicap . final , i agre with young peopl to have fun with their life befor they get older becaus they will have more responsibilti more than befor . also , no bodi know about hi health and how good it go to be . i hope everyon enjoy hi life whether he is old or young .
