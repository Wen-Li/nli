have broad knowledg of mani academ subject prevent one 's true learn , and therefor is not a reliabl way to studi , compar to special in one specif subject . when i wa in middl school in korea , student had much more subject to learn than in new york , where i live in now . we had to master physic to endin , and had major test each term . studi the twelv or more subject that i wa suppos to get as high score as possibl , i wonder if that type of studi realli help me to learn , and achiev what i need to surviv in societi . mani of the subject , such as engineerng , cook , or music in my case , were unatract to me , and most of all , unnecessari for my futur . mani other student would have similar preoblem . also , it is veri hard , or imposs , for a person to master such mani subject . one may argu that in order to well adapt in our societi , peopl need multipl number of field which one can do well . for exampl , in typic compani , employe need to be good at clacul and annalyz informatt , social with other peopl , which might requir variou kind of skill . howev , if one tri to mast too mani disciplin , it is more like not to be help for one 's career , becaus still , he/sh need to be profession good at onli one disciplin , which the person will be work on through out the career . the most ultim reason for studi mani disciplin is that it prevet one from trueli learn someth , no matter what it is . when a person have broad knowledg of mani subject , it mean that he/sh ha no profession knowlegd abut anyth . what is the use of know so mani thing , when one know noth realli use , valuabl , and profession ? whi should one struggl to have so mani meaningless knowledg that everyon els can easili learn also ? there is no mean nor fun to have broad and common knowledg of mani subject . the fun of learn , and concentr on one disciplin sincer and trueli is at consum the subject which you love , and which fascin you .
