everybodi can notic that nowaday the mass media is the most power thing that can leav a massiv influenc on us special on taneeg & children . actual i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are & that is becaus of tow reason . the first reason is they do all the advertis about someth in a wonderful way that show you it is the best thing for you & you cant live without it . then , you discov all these advertis for noth realli worth it . for exampl : onc i watch on t.v an advertis about a straightner for the hair to make it straigh so they made that in a way that all the peopl will thought it realli cool & you will have healthi hair , next i bought it & guess what ?? it wa realli bad , it destroy & burn my hair . anoth exampl : my boyfriend wa walk in the street & he saw poster about a rain-parti , you can see from the poster that everyth will be includ the ticket but when he reach there everyth in the poster wa a lie . the second reason , there is no sencor for the advertis special on the internet , which that make alot of compani & shop do whatev they want & laugh at peopl . onc i met a friend she wa realli angri so i ask her what go on ?? she told me that she pook adress throught the internet & she paid for it but when she went there to take it they told her that she have to pay more becaus she didnt come at the same day . in short , we must take-car of these kind of advertis , also you have to be sure with who you are deal . in my opinion the gover should put sencor on the all advertis in the mass media . at the end dont forget to watch out & to think in a critic way when you commun with these stuff .
