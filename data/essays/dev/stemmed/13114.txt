the idea that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact is veri true . i will like to describ some point that support thi statement to understand better whi i am agre . there are two import point to learn someth and keep it in our cultur baggag , to understand the concept of the main idea and to practic the concept in some situat of the real life . most of the time , when a studen will have some exam , the student want to memor all the date , place , name and rule that could help to answer correctli . but frequent we froget that thi is not the most import part of the learn procc . the first thing a teacher ha to do is to make understand the concept to the student becaus when the concept is understood it is easi to appli it to the problem and , the most import , in real life . when an elementari school student understood whi the citizen of some countri had to make a civil war against their govern , the student had understood the import of a govern taht take care their peopl and do not take advantag of them . when a student understend the main idea of some problem he will never forget that and he will can appli it in the real life . then , affter the understand , it is veri import to reforc the idea by practic with exampl and possibl situat where the student can appli hi or her judgement and make a person opinion about it . to practic is to face the problem in meni other situat each one with differ characterist and that will form the student make him to tought in some solut or creat and a person opinion . that is whi i said that if you make a student to learn the date when the human right were sign he will learn just a date but if you make he or her to understood the import about the human right you will form an excel human be .
