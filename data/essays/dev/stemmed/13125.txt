in a way , i disagre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not devot enough time in help their commun . i beleiv that in the current time , commun themselv do not requir much help or much time in help . in the past , peopl of a small town or a villag identifi themselv as a commun and work toward mutual and commun benefit . there were weekli meet and the problem of the commun were discuss . young peopl who form the most energet part of the group volunt in solv the problem and in arrang festiv and local gather . peopl were more physic involv the commun . they work as a team and one 's problem wa everybodi 's problem . it wa natur for young peopl to be the most activ compon of the commun . in mani modernis part of the world , the situat is in stark contrast to what it wa in the past . the revolut in commun technolog and the advent of the internet ha larg devat peopl from each other to the comput . system and servic have becom more effici and computer . there is much less need for peopl , not onli young to be involv in ani help mainli becaus there is not much help requir . peopl can discuss problem in e-commun and via email and chat . the town administr ha it 's public websit and ani problem can be post on it . respons peopl can then take necessari action . so today , there is not much help requir but there is a big need for idea and in thi case young peopl still form the most activ group . so in view of the current time , i disagre .
