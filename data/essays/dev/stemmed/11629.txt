i would have to agre by the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . as more and more car are rapidli produc today , the govern especi ha been do all it best to provid necessari public transport throughout a nation . the space alloc for the vehicl will soon be not enough . popul growth directli contribut to the increas in the number of driver on the road . highway of hundr of metr tall will anyway be fulli congest with driver . with limit space or land throughout a countri , ani singl govern would sure take the step into reduc the number of car on road , which also could caus pollut . as do the govern here in malaysia , they are tri their best to reduc the number of car on the road . one move that wa made to the malaysian govern on to reduc the number of car is by impos tax . by impos heavi percentag of tax on import as wellla the local car , it wa believ to be an incent for driver to find an altern mode of transport . but thi ha obvious been prove less effect . thi automat brought them about to reduc the number of driver instead . for exampl of an action that ha taken by the govern is by set an older age line for wannab driver to be compet on the road . thi delay of upcom driver is also support by anoth wise move which like ani other countri , which is by improv the countri 's public transport . public transport is the one and onli solut that can help curb futur congest on the road . take for exampl , the train . easi access , low and flat price ticket and large-s public transport is the perfect charactherist of a highli effect mode of vehicl which mani govern are vy to achiev . the most obviou exampl of a highli effect public transport is none other than the bullet train locat in japan . anoth exampl is the countri , australia that i have visit . the sight of see onli small number of car in the road of australia ha clearli shown to me , as a malaysian what my countri should ought to be like . if in austrialia , everi now and then you can onli hear a honk or the screech of the tyre , i 'm sure in twenti year down the road the roadway will be an empti one ! thx , sign
