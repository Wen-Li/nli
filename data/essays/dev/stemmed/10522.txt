in my univers experi i alway appreci what i learnt when i wa at the high school . dure my high school time in itali i use to studi latin and ancient greek . our professor wa alway explain us how to studi these two classic languag wa give us the capac to use in a realli better way our mind , learn someth that wa improv our way `` to think '' . ancient greek and overal latin can help you to understand better a specif topic becaus they are base on a logic structur . latin is realli similar to math and it can permit you to elabor more sophist concept when you know how to use word or sentenc in a logic way . my high school wa call `` classic high school '' in opposit with scentif high school . i didnt learn specif and practic argument as math , phisic or geometri but i learnt to think . dure my univers time , at the architectur school in milan , i found out how much wa true my professor 's statement becaus i didnt get ani problem to studi realli difficult argument as math , structur , calcul , etc. becaus my mind wa abl to process everi kind of data , even if they were differ from what i studi at the high school . for thi reason i think it 's realli import for everi student , with everi kind of person background and goal , to understand and to learn how to understand idea and concept instead of just mere learn fact . when you are abl to understand an idea or a concept you can approach these thing with a critic view , elabor them and creat a person view about them , and not just learn fact without understand whi they happend , wich reason gener them . for student ' futur is the most import thing and understand idea and concept will give them specif skill to approach everi kind of problem in life .
