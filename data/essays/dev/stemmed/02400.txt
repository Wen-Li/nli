help a commun is a nobl act . and i also agre that youngster today do not give enough time to help their own commun . but it can not be complet attribut as lack of concern from the young peopl . there are sever reason for thi . the primari reason is that with so mani activit go on parallelli in young peopl 's live - studi , project , assign and other more import commit that they are left with veri littl time for themselev . and so they prefer to concentr that littl time left in their hobbi or some other person activ rather than help their commun . with the advent of televis and other media 's which ha revultionis our live , we are concern so much more with what is happen around the world that we actual forget the problem immedi surround us . one of my neighbour 's is addict to thi one sitcom , which is play everyday night that he actual leav all hi pend work and religi watch the show . such is the impact of televis on today 's gener . also there is a grow trend among youngster especi among the colleg goer 's that such activ are uncool and out of vogu . so some student deliber avoid help a commun even if it is against their conscienc , just to show that they are cool . to be frank , i myself have wit thi dure my junior colleg year . thi kind of think which is actual much more preval among the youngster in the urban area 's need radic chang . it is realli a shame that youngster today consid such nobl act as cheap and uncool . but there are some peopl in each commun who after all thi thing , dedic some time to such work .
