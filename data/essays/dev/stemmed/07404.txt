i agre with the statement mention that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . if student learn onli fact then they do n't have conceptu knowledg or idea that where and how to use in practic . for exampl , a math teacher taught one problem and solv without give the concept of that problem like formula , method or step to perform to solv the problem . thi will be difficult for the student , if the problem is twist or anoth problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examin . they can not solv the problem as they do n't know the concept of the problem given . so a math teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initi and base on that idea a problem should be solv by the teacher and then the student keep the concept rememb , so that they can easili solv the ani problem base on that concept . for everi problem there will be a concept behind to solv it . anoth exampl as , if we see the physic book there will be lot of concept for each and everi chapter . in that there is a chapter call `` gravit '' . in thi the idea is about the earth 's gravit . due to graviti whatev the thing thrown in the air from earth 's surfac it will fall on the earth again becaus of gravit pull of the earth . if we say to the student that the thing which were thrown in the air from earth will fall back to the earth 's surfac , then they just learn the fact . they do n't know the reason . due to thi type of learn none of the student will not becom good engin or ani other profession . becaus lack of concept and practic knowledg . even if we take a civil engin student who do n't know how to build the build and where to build then definit the build will be collaps . that is whi , it is import for the student to learn concept and understand the idea rather than to learn fact .
