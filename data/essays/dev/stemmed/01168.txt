there are mani way one can travel . peopl can travel alon or in group led by a tour guid or travel in group without a tour guid . i do prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guid . becaus with the help of a tour guid we can save time , save money and get the effect use of their rich knowledg about the place . i prefer to travel in a tour led by a tour guid . becaus they will have experi in plan and arrang tour . by thi way we do n't need to scratch our head to plan the tour . for exampl , one our famili plan to visit singopor . in singapor , we miss mani import place to visit . thi is becaus we had less knowledg about the place and languag . we would not have face thi problem if we had hire a tour guid . with the help of a tour guid , we can complet our tour with less cost . becaus they will have a complet data base of hotel , travel , lodg and other import thing around the world . they can find effect tour plan that will fit into our budget . for exampl , one of my friend who also visit the singapor with hi famili with a tour guid complet the tour with inli 10000 dollar . but in our trip i spent more that 15000 dollar . so i think a good tour guid will help us in save money . by hire a tour guid we can save time dure the tour . becaus they can plan us some good schedul so that we will visit maxium place in the limit time . also , by choos a good and experienc guid we can get to know the histor fact behind the place or citi . though we will get a overhead of pay to the guid , i think it more worth than the amount we pay them . so i think consid all the import fact mention abov , it better to hire a tour guid when we are go to travel in group .
