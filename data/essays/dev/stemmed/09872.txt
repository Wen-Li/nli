it is difficult for me to answer thi question , becaus we must defin some concept to answer thi question . first of all what is realli meant by use the word `` nowaday '' . compar young peopl from now and those who have live fifti year ago is not the same as compar them to those who have live a centuri ago . let me suppos we are compar nowaday young peopl to those who were young just at the end of the second world war . for that exampl it is difficult to answer again for a particular reason that is that the societi wa not the same at that time . the citi were not so crowd , except for a few of them , and then sever peopl use to live in small citi . in that kind of town the peopl are more like to know each other than in the big citi centr . when you live in a small town you can for exampl help your neighboor with hi garden when he is not at home and you are more like to do that kind of thing just becaus you know veri well . in the citi almost nobodi know hi neighboor . a second thing that ha to be clarifi is the mean of `` help their commun '' . must there be a benefit for everi bodi or just for a singl person ? the action that benefit all the commun are so easi to do for young peopl just becaus they do not care about that at their age . to finish i would like to give a part of my opinion on thi suject . i would say that the young peopl nowaday give less time that their parent use to do in the past , but to my mind thi is not due to their selfish but to the today societi 's selfish .
