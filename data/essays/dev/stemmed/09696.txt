my opinion is veri simpl . .. i think that is true , young peopl do n't give enough time to help their commun . but i think that they are n't totali guilti of thi . in mani case the action of a person born to the contest when they spent their life . .. famili , school , fri and tv and all of the thing that a person do in the first part of hi life will influenc hi person . the gift that a young peopl take to hi life coach , are deepli wrong . it 's true that peopl do n't help enough their commun , but is earli true that at the moment there is n't good exampl to follow and so will becom everybodi best person . i know that there are mani person that are more interst to help everyon , but for me thi person are earli a small number . i'am veri interst for thi theme . .. realli !!! at the moment , in fact , i work on a call center that help some student of my countri that have famili problem and thei do n't have the possibl to explain their problem to anyon . .. for thi reason i think that is veri , veri , veri import tell to all the peopl to do the right thing and begin to help the peopl that are around we . and the better way is begin to is't the first of all
