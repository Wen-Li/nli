that is right that some peopl think that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i will explain in thi write which is my opinion . i am 18 year old and then i am just an adult . that mean that i heard thi statement there is not a long time . in fact , all grandpar or parent said that their children do not do all they must do for the commun . then they think that young peopl nowaday do not give enought time to help their commun . they alway said that their childhood wa more difficult than it is for us . it is veri bore when all the time parent are against you do or have done . that is whi , i am disagre with thi statement . i will explain much better the reason in a second paragraph . thi statement is for my opinion wrong . in fact a lot of peopl help old age peopl when they need some help . they often help their parent at home and they do a lot of activ . i think that help the commun do not you ? go to school is not realli help the commun at the begin . but if young peopl do not do studi the commun will fall down becaus we need peopl who have done a lot of studi to manag the other . for my point of view old peopl think that becaus they do thing which do not do . like to go to see old peopl in their hous , do activ for their town like organ the next parti . .. that are activ that we do not have ani time to do . becaus between the cours , the sport and gener social activ it is difficult to find a moment to do what they do . as a conclus , like you have seen i am realli disagre with thi statement . and i do not like when my grandmoth said me that !!!!!!!!
