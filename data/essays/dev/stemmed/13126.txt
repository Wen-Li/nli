most peopl have lost thier interest about thier commun day by day . peopl also do n't want to involv in help thier commun . so it seem to me that these peopl that i am accus not of help their commin are specailli youngster . howev , i ca n't accus them directli sinc the sens of help poepl around us should be taugth in their earli educ such as in elemantari school . moreov famili should be take care of thi issu . the first point that i would like to make is that if you are willingto help your commun you should n't wait earn money . as a result young peopl think that help to other peopl or partip in some charlti organ is wast of time . howev think like that it is not their fault yet their famili do n't talk with their children about the import of help to peopl . moreov teacher or school depart do n't encourag the youngster to help their commin . for instanc when i wa in highschool , our teacher encourag us to go to the hous for elderli . furhermor they were bring us to the forest in order to cultur a tree in everymonth . but the school stop do thi activ becaus of it cost . in addit i am convic that young peopl ca n't understand the benefit of help their commun . let us look anoth reason whi younster do n't help their commun . i believ that their circulum in the school is so busi . they have to studi and they have to pass their class . it is appar that those respons are stress them out . howev they can help their commin in their spare time . i am convinc that most youngster spend their time play video game , chat internet or interest in celebr ' live . they can take a action in some help organ instead of do these activ . to sum up , i agre with young peopl do n't help their comminitie as much as they should . but , the most importanli , it is not their fault . some shoul teach them the importanceof particip to help their commin such as their parent and their teacher .
