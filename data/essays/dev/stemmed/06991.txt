well , i opin in consens with the statement given . ye , i actual prefer to be assist by a tour guid when i am travel as a group . the reason that support my argument are disclos as under ! . firstli it would be of great advantag to be accompani by a guid becaus it prove to be benefici to be direct in a place which a group is not well acquaint with . it is better to be guid in a place which is new to us becaus it prevent the group of tourist be split up in case of ani misshappen ! . therefor the group is led in a unison prevent the chao of lose some member . henc it save a lot of time to concentr on the purpos oftravel . secondli employ a guid provid us the detail of all the import place to be visit . therefor it provid us with a good review of all the import place without miss ani . thi again save us time in search out for place to be visit ! . third pont of advantag of employ a guid is that of the awar of the place visit . a guid realli provid us with veri valuabl inform as of how , whi , when and other relat question of the place visit . therefor it is of great advantag as the knowledg regard the place is complet . anoth advantag is that of the commun with the peopl of that habitat ! . thi is realli veri import becaus the right way of commun with the local peopl might be realli veri difficult in most of the case . thi might mislead a group in know certain thing for exampl the whereabout or a rout to a monument for that matter . therefor if a guid is accompani us we need not realli face the commun problem as he translat the dialect of the local peopl and speak out that is realli understood by us . anoth import advantag is that a guid might realli help us to sort out our accomod at an econom place in case we are pay more for the stay than we are actual meant to pay . thi again prove us an econom advantag of employ a guid ! . therefor from the reason which i have disclos i realli favour employ a guid although it is a bit expens .
