should we learn or should we understand ? thi question may have been a debat for age . everybodi wonder if he had better to learn or to understand . but could we realli understand without learn ? i agre thi the statement , becaus i realli think that it is not alway help to learn by heart . i think it is more import to understand someth and to develop our critic judgement . but both are realli import . nevertheless , i think we should learn in order to be abl to understand what happen is our life or in our societi . let 's take an exampl . if we want to understand a polit debat or we want to vote . we should know and learn what is a republican or a demorcr , in order to vote right . in our life , we alway need to know someth to understand it . thu the import of learn . howev , we should be car of not learn without understand , which is completli stupid . an exampl may be when somebodi ha well learn how to write word . if he doe not practic or understand how to make a sentanc , it is completli useless to know word . despit the fact that learn by heart someth could be veri bore , we should be abl to do it . becaus the more we will have learn a subject , the more we will be abl to talk about it and to understand it . so if we learn how is the american parliament , we should better understand the role of g. bush for exampl . therfor , i think that we should not decid onli to understand or onli to learn . these two notion should go togeth , they are complementari . although nobodi realli like to learn by heart , we must do it , in order to underst better what happen in our life or in our societz .
