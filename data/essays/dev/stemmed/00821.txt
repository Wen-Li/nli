i agre that student should undestand the idea and concept than spend time in learn fact . i believ that the human civil ha come to the zenith of technolog not becaus of lear the fact , but by understand the idea and concept . there have been advanc in mani area . if the human spend all their time on fact , our live could have been end in undestand the histori of our earlier gener . and we could not have seen the progress . there could have been no progress of scienc . so , appli the concept of the fact will move the world to the next level . i alway like scienc which make me a scientist not becaus i know the fact , but the way i undestand idea and concept . i am take a mathamat call i will use the concept and idea to get to gener a solut to the problem . if we use fact there will be time , they will not help get the solut . in our daili life , we live with idea and concept . a veri besic exampl , if my parent want me to go buy veget form the veget market i will decid which way will be easier road . i will analz by ask myself use my concept and not go with the fact . our human mind can take onli some fact and then we have to use the concept to work toward succuss . there are mani fact in thi world and it will not be in our human abiliit to know all the fact . so it is more import that to know how to appli the concept and idea . to deal with the problem . on a whole , i think that fact can onli help to certain level but most importantli it is the idea and concept that will hlep us in deal with daili live , in our career and also in work .
