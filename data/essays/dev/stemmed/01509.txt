although young peolp are more outgo than older peopl , i do not agre with thi statement . older peopl are mostli retir and have much more time and money to go on trip and travel to other countri . younger peopl on the other hand have to learn often and do not have that much money to travel a lot . but they are more interest in discov new countri and make new experi . in comparison , older peopl alreadi have a lot of experi and they often , just want to visit place where they have been befor rather than go on exit trip . howev , older peol often have problem with their health and therefor they are not as flexibl as young peopl are . young peopl can do whatev they want , whithout think about their health . older peopl therefor are more interest in their own famili , which is often the most import topic in their life . and to my opinion it is far better to see your own grantchildren grow up than go into disco and stay up all night , what a lot of younger peopl do . to sum up the main point , i do not think that younger peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl do , becaus there are so mani thing that older peopl can do which younger can not do . to my opinion older peopl enjoy their life differ than younger peopl do , but there is no better way .
