take risk and tri new thing have in common one thing : they are scari or , at least , they are not as comfort as do alway the same thing . yet , i am convic that they are necessari in order to be success . risk can be frighten - i will not deni it . howev , if you do not risk , you miss import opportun to improv your condit . everi decis in life , from everyday to once-in-a-lifetim one , impli some risk . if you are not abl to take risk , thi mean that you are not abl to take challeng decis , with the obviou result . furthermor , in certain situat , take a risk can make the differ between someon who just accept what he or she ha ( but might regret what he or she ha not ) and someon who is realli satisfi . just think of a recent graduat student who receiv a veri interest offer which requir move to anoth countri : should he stay home and tri to find an averag job or accept it ? i am convinc he should accept it and leav straight away , otherwis he might simpli regret it for the rest of hi life . on a less person level , there are contest where tri new thing is almost mandatori . thi is the case for exampl of research : question the statu quo , tri out differ possibl solut is necessari in order to find out new thing - and where would the world be wihtout new invent ? i can not imagin a research who doe not want to tri new thing . for all these reason , i am convic that success peopl are those who are not afraid of risk . peopl who just keep do what they are good at just miss out opportun - becaus that is what a chang realli is .
