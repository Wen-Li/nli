befor three year , i met with my frind who finish hi univers befror one month in that time and he wa veri sad becaus he did n't find a job in ani compani . when i ask him about the reason for that and he had gotten an exel mark , he answerd that all comani want diffrent of skill in the emploe who will work with them . it is better to have broad knowledg to get a good job , big saleri and high postion in ani comani . if you have diffrent major in you educ or sever of knowledg you 'll have a big chans to get agood job . for exampl , if you have engneer major with some cours in coput , you 'll get job faster then if you have just an engneer . also , you 'll work in a diffrent depart and that wiil make your job more excit . it 's not hard to get a job , but to have a good saleri is the hard thing . to improv your skill snd to get a nice saleri you should diffrent then the outher eploye . alot of peopl tri to get one major in teir educ and ther want to work , if you want to be diffrent then the outher you have to get5 broud of knowledg . not everi one can be a manag or import one in hi compani . the manger ha a special proparti then the outher , more educ and strong behavior . we can get the diffrent educ by have broad of knowledg . if you studi difrrent major with diffrent of peopl you 'll get the strong behavior . in cnclusion , you can be an import man with big saleri in an exel job if you have broad of knowledg and diffrent of educ . my friv also have knowen that .
