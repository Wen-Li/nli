i precis agre to thi statement . peopl seldom doe not happen to challeng new thing sicnc they are afraid that they are go to fail on that task , in other word , they are unwil to challeng new thing becaus they are uncertain and do n't think that they would success . howev , in my opinion , i think what is signific is that you actual attempt on do someth even if you fail . i even think that fail is more import than not attempt to tri . onli do what they alreadi know is not go to make you improv more . it would make you confid in onli one thing . for instanc , if you a person is tri and tri to do on someth as much as he can but he is unsuccess , he would be success sooner becaus he would realiz the reason whi he fail on thi task . in fact , if you attempt to do someth howev you fail on it few time , it the lead road to success . for the person who onli doe what he alreadi know , he will not improv at all but a confid . even if thi person realli know what he ha to do and how to do a thing well , he wo n't be as good as the person who fail and had fail mani time . the chanc will onli come to you if you would start do and tri do new thing . the more door you open , the more chanc to have more opportun . if you keep the door close , noth would come to you . chanc would come onli if you open the door . peopl want to success , and want to have more chanc . howev , in order to do that , you need to make opportuniti by yourself . it seem difficult and it is , howev you just have to open the door and you will see a road where fail lead to success .
