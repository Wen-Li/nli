it is often believ that young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl , due to sever reason , which , in my opinion , are relat to the avail of time and other physic and mental resourc , such as enthusiasm . i believ that thi view is , in some way , incomplet , although not entir wrong . the incomplet of the view , is given by the fact that old peopl are peopl with experi . thi mean that they can assess valu to certain action on the basi of their past experi . they know what to do in order to enjoy certain posit feel , as well as they know what to avoid . thi mean that peopl , onc they becom old , have all the necessari resourc in order to exploit their knowledg on themselv , and henc collect the fruit of their live as young peopl . in addit , although some peopl believ that money doe not make happi , old peopl are more like to have money to spend for themselv , make them enjoy life in more way . thi would impli that you start to enjoy life onli at a certain age . howev , there is the opposit pont of view , which is the one of the statement . young peopl , or at least most of them , do not have mani thing to worri about . it is up to their parent to control and administ the so call ` dirti work` , whilst they are free to grow up . thi show that peopl , dure the earli stage of life , have plenti of time to dedic to themselv , to the discoveri of new thing . if it is true that old peopl know what thing they like and what they do n't , with the advantag of not have to experi anymor , it is also true that youngster have the possibl of go through the process of discov , which is probabl the most interest and fulfil of all , as it give you the opportun of know new thing and experienc new feel , which were previous unknown . for exampl , peopl usual rememb their first kiss , rather than their last . in conclus , i would say that life can be enjoy at everi stage , when you are young and when you are old , although in differ way . the first period of life should be dedic to discov what you like and enjoy , whilst the last should be dedic to the exploit of such discoveri .
