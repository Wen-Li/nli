i agre with the fact that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , but the fact is that peopl is afect when is not awar of thi . also i understand that although there is some regul obout thi topic the mean to make it work are not as hard as they should . is truth that market use strategi like give misinform about a product or tri to convic us that their product is what we need to solv our problem or just to make us happi . but it could be a real problem like in a medic exampl , some vitamin suplement are announc to be all we need if we feel tire or weak , but the peopl who make the public do not care or inform consumm about the risk of do not go toa medic check when these synthom are present . also there are documment case of peopl who stop take their medic or cut their medic treatment becaus of use a new product seen on tv . anoth exampl could be the resist of a ladder or a new kind tool , becaus the client could be expect that thi tool or applianc ha a certain last , when the real thing is that it is go to break even put in danger hi life . as a final conclut or a person peac of advic . i think that even though compani have the necesitti to increas their profit they also should have a social conscienc . that is to say be more concern about the respons of lie or misinform about the featur of a product . and thi doe not mean that the client should leav everyth in the hand of the enterpic , but be more concern about the posibl of be buy someth which is not what he is expect .
