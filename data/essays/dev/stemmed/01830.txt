i think the statement is to absolut . i remeb when i wa young , there where not that much possibl to help the commun and they where also not attract to young peopl . there is also a big differ where you live . in larg citi there are not that mani commun you can evolv like they are in smaller villag or smaller town . anoth point is the fact that nowaday young peopl have a lot more to do and not that much time like it wa year ago . they have to go to school or learn a lot and most young peopl have to work besid their school to earn money to life . if they alreadi have a job besid school they propabl will not take a commun job without get paid . they do not have the time and the money to help the commun . work in the commun ha also advantag wich most young peopl do not know about . a commun job integr you in your environ if you are new . it can also help you to find friend , or the commun help you if you got a problem . it also can give you social hold if you do not know what to do or have no other thing in you live . it is a good way for older peopl who do not have to work anymor to get a job for their live . and to get integr in their social envion . but in my oppinon it is true , young peopl do not give enough time to their commun . even if it is not the same that it wa year ago . the most import point is the social contact they get in their commun .
