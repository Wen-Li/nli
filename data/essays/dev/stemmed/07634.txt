some peopl argu as if it were a gener truth that understand idea and concept is much more import than learn factor . but to be frank , i can not agre with them . there are numer reason whi i hold no confid on them , and i would explor a few primari one here . to begin with , we can lean the idea and concept dure studi factor . teacher will be abl to teach the student the idea and concept by teach a specif fact . let 's take look at a physic class . at the veri begin , the teacher give the class a specif problem , and ask them to solv it . the student might not be abl to solv it , so the teacher could tell the some concept suggest that could help to solv thi problem and encourag them to think it again . and thi time , the student might know how to solv the actual problem and also learn the basic concept . further more , whi do we learn the idea and concept ? for practic work , of cours . so , whi do n't we learn someth that is more practic ? learn fact will lead us to work directli , and it would not wast a lot of time studi the bore theori or concept , and thi would save much more time . last but not least , studi fact will sometim be more use than studi concept . for exampl , imagin we are learn how to repair the bike . from the book , we may just know how to solv the gener problem . but when we face a special problem , an intergr problem that nois from all over the bike , for exampl , what could we do ? we might feel complic to solv thi kind of problem . to sum up , learn fact can help us save a lot of time and becaus of the purpos of learn is for work , studyng fat might sometim be more use when we work than studi idea and concept . take into account of all these factor , we may reach the conclus that it is advis to learn fact rather than to understand the idea and concept .
