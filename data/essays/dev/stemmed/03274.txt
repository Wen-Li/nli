the topic under discuss is whether most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are or not . i go with the opinion that the advertis are make the product look much better than what it actual is . the growth of the commun media wide in the form of televis , new paper , internet and variou other choic had lead to an outright growth in the propaganda of ani item . peopl come to know about ani new product in the market through ani of these media . the mind set of the peopl ha chang variabili in the sens that they shift their side from buy the requir one to the one that were advertis by the celebr . gone were the day when peopl use to go outdoor shop to get the requir product . the new era ha just begun through the interenet shop where it reduc the burden to go out and shop . peopl can sit in their home and if they find someth interest in the adversti they opt to buy it through internet . the previou notion of buy the product base on it requir and merit ha total chang . peopl chang their mind set to buy the product that seem appeal and interest in the advertis . as an exampl consid the good olden day when there were not mani of these advertis for a product . peopl use to get a clear understand of the product they were buy and then opt for that . now a day the scenario ha chang where peopl buy the product onli beacus their favourit celebr ha advertis that product . furthermor peopl are more interest in buy the item hi neighbour ha just bought . they consid to be one step higher than them and buy that product even if it is irrelav to them . in thi way mouth to mouth media creat problem . these advertis are now a day make the product look much more valuabl than what they realli are . go through variou advertis provid through the commun media and opt to buy a product is not a wise deciss . these advertis gener hype the product . one come to know the serious of the mistak he ha commit in opt for the product with the onli impress of the advertis when onc he receiv the origin product . next time he might be care enough in select the product to buy . so in my opion it is alway better to select a product base on it merit rather than follow the advertis and select the product .
