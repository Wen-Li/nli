in my opinion in some case it 's better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , instead , in anoth case , it 's better to special in onli one or two specif subject . i think that at the primari , secondari and high school it 's better to have a gener knowledg , like what is actual in use in the majour state of the world ( i beliv and i hope it is truth ) , than to special in onli one specif subject . here we have a thirteen gener year knowledg and i think it is not bad ! i think that when we arriv at univers it is right to special in onli one or two specif subject becaus actual we live in a world where everyon think to be abl to do everythihg but thi is not the truth ! i think it 's import to be a veri good professionist in one thing to be differ from the mass . in itali our univers are not good abl to prepar student for the work world and when we finish school , after eigthteen year , we are not abl to work and we have to wait anoth two or three year to be consid by big agensi , compa
