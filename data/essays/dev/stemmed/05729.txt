i person think that if someon ha a broad knowledg on mani subject , he will be abl to find a solut on a larger amount of problem in life/work . if a person ha to solv problem on hi own and ca n't cooper with other peopl , he would certainli be advantag with thi type of knowledg . on the contrari , if a societi is well organ and all the part that cooper are well prepar just on a specif subject ( obvious each part ha a differ subject ) , effici can be increas a lot make the societi veri competit . take the statement from a more person point of view make me think about those peopl consid as `` geniu '' , that improov a lot in a specif field but consequ had a lack of knowledg in other field , for exampl social relationship . thi make them suffer and escap differ situat just becaus they ca n't stand them . the geniu creat someth with hi abil that will alway be rememb and appreci , but he ha to suffer for it . actual i wish i wa a geniu on someth , but at the same time i like the way i wa educ so i find myself in agreement with the statement .
