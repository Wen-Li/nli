i disagre with the fact that young peopl nowaday do not give suffici time to help out their commun . on the contrari , their level of awar about the plight of peopl around the world ha increas from yesteryear and a grow number of youngster are lend a help hand to the societi . today peopl are make a mark for themselv at veri earli stage of their live . young movi star , musician , sportsperson and the like of them are win the heart of million around them . in the process they are make million . but one can proudli say that a consider proport of their fund is direct toward chariti . the `` bill and melinda gate ' '' foundat wa set up a long time back when bill gate wa in hi prime . the amount of work that ha been put in by the then young coupl is commend when it come to talk about aid and cancer relief . although a middl age coupl now , their work goe on . if we dont talk about the celebr and concentr our attent on the school kid , we find that commun servic ha start come more natur to them . there is a sens of pride attach with reach out to the less previlig . children consid themselv to be hero of sort if they do a good deed and help out peopl . the fact that school and colleg have taken a posit step by accord due import to social work while consid admiss is an ad impetu . it prompt youngster to do their bit . even if done out of person interest , it expos one to the joy of `` reach out '' and prod them to do more . one can cite numer exampl of engin and doctor who have graduat from ivi leagu colleg and can easili make big buck . but statist show that an ever increas number of these graduat are turn their back to high pay job in favor of settl down in small villag and town . all thi becaus they feel a sens of attach and duti toward their homeland and truli believ in allevi the troubl of their nation . thu , the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to their commun is unqualifi and underr the contribut of youngster toward build a better societi .
