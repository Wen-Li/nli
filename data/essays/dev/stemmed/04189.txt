the issu that will be discuss here is whether young peopl nowaday give enough time to help their commun or not . some might say that young peopl are more educ today to be ever of the problem in their commun and more enthusiast to help . while on the other hand some might say that young peopl today are too busi in their own life set up to look beyond it and help their commun . well , i would agre with the first set of peopl who think that young peopl nowaday take out enough time to help their commun . firstli , the reason i think that young crowd nowaday give enough time to help their commun is becaus they are more educ and are awar of the problem that lie in their commun in which they have grown than the young peopl of gener befor thi . let take an exampl of a young man who ha face difficulti in hi childhood becaus of lack of good school in hi villag . now that he ha somehow manag to get educ and get a good job in a multin compani , he know the benefit of good educ facil . he know with hi experi and exposur to the world that hi villag can grow and develop if the children can get good educ . so he would take out time to put consciou effort in the develop of hi villag . secondli , take the same exampl of thi young man who is employ in a good compani also earn well as compar to the young peopl befor . he ha enough money to help the peopl in hi commun and will to chang the infrastructur to facilitit the younger gener in thier develop . final , i believ the younger gener today are more enthusiast and are fill with more jest to take out extra time to chang the condit exist in their commun and help the peopl who need it . the educ system today ha chang which teach more moral valu and inculc a sens of responsibilti in the younger gener to help their commun and their countri . the young peopl today have learn to prioritis their work and have becom more effect in manag their time . so i think the today 's gener are more effect in help their commun .
