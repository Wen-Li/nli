i agre with thi statement which is that , `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . '' i feel thi way becaus if we go for the product by just look at the advertis then we can not realli judg a product just by sit at home and look at an advertis . first reason that think that advertis do n't at all make product better than what they are , is that , what we see can not be true or a right thing most of the time . for exampl an adveris on tv show about a new car launch by some xyz compani . well to buy a car we realli need to go out to a showroom and have a look at it as well as test drive it . but just by look at an ad we ca n't predict the way in which a car would be handl at sever turn and bend . well secondli nowaday a lot of advertisemnt endors is done by popular face like the actor sportsmen and so on . well i saw an advertis of a bike recent on tv . thi bike wa endors by rise sportstar . in my hometown a lot of peopl by see thi advertis went to the showroom and bought that bike . well i certainli know from the respons from which iam hear about the bike from my fellow friend is that the bike wa n't even worth a penni . it wa so poorli design . the electron the engin wa the major problem concern that bike . now my friend are complain to the dealer about their sorri state . so i do feel that by just follow an advertis one should not loos hi normal sens and end up buy fals product . addit peopl who are make these advertis about the product as well as those endors these product do they realli use these product ? well it seem to be an interest question . for exampl an actor in my hometown is endors a product of person comput and laptop . but recent at a film product unit my friend did see him use a laptop of anoth brand . thi mean that he is sure that the product which he is endors is unreli . mostli we would not find all of the abov peopl who make these advertis , use these product . they would be use product from more famou brand and reput one . henc we should not alway look at an advertis an buy the product . in conlus to the abov mention point i firmli believ that today advertis are no more than a fake piec of inform that is shown on televis to make money out of the innoc peopl . thu i believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
