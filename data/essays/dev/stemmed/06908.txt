i agre with thi statement , but i would also say that nowaday are even a lot of young peopl , who help in their commun , but most of them are not be regist . i think , the reason whi some mani young peopl do not spend enough time or even no time help their commun is that our whole societi ha growen dure the last centuri . the result of thi develop is that our societi is anonym and there are no real commun . dure the last thirti year , i think , most of the commun grow into larg citi , becaus of the process of global , which is a mant factor , whi commun broke and even break . in thi case it is not realli supris that mani young peopl do not spend enough time to help their commun . anoth reason , whi i think thi develop is not suprins , is that the most citi and commun do not offer the young peopl the oppertun to help . for exampl in germani , where i live , the govern decid to close more than the half of institut where young peopl can get into and help the commun , mayb to plan a parti for the whole commun or even a special event on eastern . thi aspect is also the reason whi i say that the most do not recogn that a lot of young peopl support the commun , becaus they do it in privat organis or onli for their own . so my conclus is that it is not onli the fault of the young perosn that they do not help so much , becaus they can not chang the develop of last year and of the process of global and also they can not influenc the decis of the govern , becaus most of them are not allow to vote , becaus of their age . howev , i think that young perosn are respons for the communtiy and so i think they should support them in anyway . i also tri to support my communtiy . i live in a villag with a larg and beauti landscap . the problem is that thi area is shape into two statepart and so no state think that it is respons for save thi area . so , the young member of the ride club , includ my own , clean it twice a year . howev the state govern do not realis that .
