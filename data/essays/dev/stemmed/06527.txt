in my point of view , the mentino statement must get a lot of support and i person agre with the statement say that product are made to seem much better by advertis than they realli are . i beliv thi speak from a person experi . onc i bought a set of roller pen . the specifac were that those pen wrote in a 0.7 but when i use them , they were not even 0.3 . i think that the problem behind such an issu is the product compani . those compani tri to make their product as attract as they can in order to attract the most consum . those compani forget that onc someon buy anyth that doe much less than it say , it will be return to the retail sell agent , and the retail sell agent will in return return it to the compani where mani other item have been return . the result of thi is that the name of the compani will not be mush in the market , and will have no futur product under the same name . it could be that what they were after is temporar profit . if thi is the case , they succeed . so , exagger the product 's descript and the exagger in claim that a certain product doe certain thing , while in realiti doe not lead the consum to think about and tri the product befor they buy it .
