i both agre and disagre thi statement . on one hand , a broad knowledg of academ subject is often , dare i say alway , good to have . it is import for man to have a knowledg of mani field as possibl . you as human be alway want to learn more and , in univers for instanc , one subject is not enough all . i am current a student . i studi at la sorbonn nouvel univers which is the top univers for foreign languag . i am major in both english and german but there are mani other languag you can learn such as spanish , italian but also arab , chines or hindi . after graduat from thi univers and thi major , student often appli for job in commerci trade or intern busi . in thi context , the knowledg of mani academ subject is much more than use . in the case of two graduat student appli for the same job in intern busi , somehow i know that the one who ha the knowledg of differ foreign languag will get the post . my univers is also famou for cinema , dramat art , and commun and it is absolut possibl to major for exampl both in foreign languag and in cinema or follow theater class . but on the other hand , i think that there is a time when student have to focu on what they realli want to do and what the realli want to be and then , accord to it , tri to get more chanc as possibl in order to sucess . for exampl , the knowledg of mani academ subject could lead student into confus . they tri to learn as mani subject often becaus they are interest in all sort of field and if you ask these student what they prefer for most or what they would rather studi if they would onli have to chose one academ subject , they do not know . thi fact can explain whi a lot of student fail their first year of colleg . most of univers failur in franc are caus of a mistak in the choic of major which are caus of a bad inform after the twelvth grade . i would say as a conclus that it is alway interest to have a knowledg in as mani field as possibl but student have to focu on the main point which is success .
