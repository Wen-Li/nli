i complet agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are maili three reason for my opinion . first , the advertis agenc over-public a product . thi is particularli done in the case of a launch of a new product in a market . sinc , no one ha ever consum the product , the compani have an ad advantag of refer to their product as best in the market , without the need of ani fact to proov it . it is , after the product launch , that consum read review about the new product and realiz it exact worth . anoth reason is that , most advertis includ creativ idea , which entic variou fantasi in consum . the consum start to believ that they might come true if they start consum that product . sheer curous of consum for that product , forc him to buy and consum it . it is shortli after that that the consum realiz that he is not in ani super natur state , which he thought to be in while consum that product . thi result in lost of trust of consum in the brand . third , nowday there is an increas particip of renoun person in advertis for variou product . for exampl , a new rang of nike sport shoe is be endors by a lead soccer player or a complet rang of cloth be support by a famou celebr . as these famou person have a veri larg fan base over the world , it lead to incorpor of blind trust in these brand by their follow . who want to be like their on screen idol in their live . peopl doe not even search for review on these product or at least consid the use of these product in their live . advertis should display appropri content in them , so that consum is not mis-guid by their curous . product should consid thi so that it may not result in loos their brand name .
