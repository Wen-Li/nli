i fulli agre with thi statement . young peopl donot give enough time to help their commun . they mostli indulg in activ that they want to do or have thing they desir , instead of look at the problem affect their home and local . i myself , be a young person and live alongwith numer other fellow in a hostel , ha lot of experi of such neglect shown by young individu toward social and commun need . most of the time be spent by young peopl goe mainli in fun activ like parti , game , chat etc. or either in studi , prepar for the exam . there seem to be no thought process in the mind that deal with the immedi difficulti , shortag or problem that is go aroung the place which need to be solv . for exampl , in our institut there is a major problem of stand water bodi in and around campu which provid a typic breed ground for mosquito that can caus danger infect to the ocal live in and around the area . but inspit of thi , there seem to be no concern shown by the student who themselv might be affect by it . the situat can grow wors if not taken serious . effect measur can be appli with the help of young student if they are will . similarli , there are issu like educ of poor worker and their children , who work in the campu for construcion of new build . young student can realli help such poor peopl by organ free weekli or monthli class within the area and it could be of great help to the children who can think of have a much better life in futur . but till now , noth ha been done by the young peopl live here . young peopl mostli dont listen to the advic given by senior or the elderli peopl . they alway do what they feel is right . spend time to help commun is not the popular choic in their mind . go by what i have seen in my campu hostel , most of young peopl , includ me , like have fun , go to bar and restaur , have nice unend chat or just studi the curricular cours and interest relat subject . spend time for social and commun servic is not there nowaday among the young peopl .
