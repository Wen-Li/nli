travel ha becom part of our live such as eat , drink , exercis etc . . but whi do peopl travel a lot nowaday ? firsfth reason whi peopl are will to travel is to be open to other cultur and tradit , they can also meet other peopl from a differ ethnic background or religion in order to exchang new idea and form opinion from all that or simpli take a short period of time to relax and that is call ` vacat ' . in fact , when we decid to travel , we usual need someon to lead us otherwis we 'll get lost and be deceiv , moreov we might also find it realli tire and fruitless sinc everyth is new to us we need some time to get accustom to that new countri . on the one hand , we can buy guid book and map and on the other hand we can hire a tour guid . which one of the abov mean is effect ? in my opinion , a tour guid is necessari becaus he can be realli help by make us visit the most interest spot or the famou one and it 's easier of cours as we wo n't to rent a car or look for taxi everytim we need to visit a new place . moreov , he 'll be well acquaint to hi nativ countri and tell us addit thing that sometim are n't reveal in book and we can ask him all the question we would like to ask wherea by use a book , we do n't get realli satisfi with the result and it doe n't all that huge amount of inform given by that guid . anoth interest point is the reason whi peopl prefer travel by group instead of travel alon is becaus they just want to enjoy their time and leav some souvenir of that trip . at last , accord to my experi , i would suggest that the best way of travel would be in group and guid by a tour .
