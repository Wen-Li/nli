in modern capitalist societi , advertis are a natur part of life . in thi situat , i believ that it is all but inevit that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the fundament reason is that modern consumer ha made it necessari for compani to advertis their product simpli becaus there are more good than are necessari . befor the advent of mass product and mass consumpt , the situat wa vice versa : there were probabl fewer good than are necessari . natur , therefor , produc did not need to advertis at all . but in today 's societi , becaus of the tremend advanc of technolog , it is possibl to churn out unnecessari commod produc mainli , or perhap onli , to gain profit by sell them . as a result , produc are forc to make their product look much better than they realli are so that they will be abl to sell them out . anoth signific reason whi advertis exaggr the valu of their product is peopl 's expect to have newer and `` better '' thing . in order to keep up with these consum ' demand , compani are compel not onli to make new , slightly-upgrad product all the time but also to make the small improv as impress . the case in point is the comput industri . pc maker chang their model three or four time a year even though the improv is minor . becaus peopl expect thi and becaus all the other competitor do so , a pc maker can not afford to continu to sell a pc first put on the market a year ago . as a result , it is necessari for pc maker to make their product look signficantli better than their previou model by , for exampl , chang their look although the content is not much differ . in conclust , i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are for two reason . modern consumer ha made it necessari , and as a result , peopl are accustom to have `` better '' product , which forc produc to exagger minor improv . it would be imposs to chang thi situat , and , therefor , consum need to be wise enough not to be deceiv by advertis .
