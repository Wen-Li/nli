can we say that success peopl are the one will to tri riski possibl rather than run busi as usual ? i would think so . there are , inde , diffrent way to `` tri new thing '' : launch a product that creat a new demand almost from scratch , and ad small chang to the way a busi is run as success peopl would not necessarili have to make a `` revolut '' and bring slight chang can sometim be a challeng risk . first , let 's consid meaning chang . when take a close look at the busi world around us , there is no denial that mani compani leader have succeed in creat veri profit product that have sometim meant the start of a new stori for their compani . that 's what happenend with appl when steve job decid to lauch the ipod . instead of mere stick to the core busi of the compani , which is sell mac comput , thi leader decid to take the risk and start a total new product . and , inde , he succed , reach a point at which hi product trigger a new way of listen to the music , therefor chang some cultur habbit in the american societi , then worldwid and creat a new demand for hi specif product . that ha also been the approach of starbuck , that chang the way peopl drink their coffe : not ani more in a caf , but walk in the street ! there wa a huge risk for thi success stori at the begin , as it involv chang peopl 's habbit and way of life , but the risk wa definit worth it given the success of the compani . secondli , we delv into detail in a differ approach : the small chang to a busi model-but that can mean more , inde when put into practic . it can also be a signific risk to chang slight thing in appear , but a veri reward one . for exampl , dell creat a new way to make comput with customar comput order piec by piec by the custom . that wa veri success
