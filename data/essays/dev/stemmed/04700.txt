i do not think young peopl enjoy their life more then older peopl . i think they enjoy it in a more physic way mayb then older peopl . but i think older peopl enjoy life in a more contemplain way . inde when you are young you can do sport . i love horse-rid . in order to be abl to ride a hors you need strong muscl . strenght in thi specif case is associ with youth . inde when you are 80 year old , chanc are you will not have the strength anymor to hold yourself up on a hors . i believ that the shier capac of do someth can make one happi , just as the incapac of do someth can make one unhappi . as a consequ when i will be 80 year old and i will not be abl to ride hors anymor , that might make me unhappi . or , i will recal the time when i sat on a hors and will tell my grand children about how wonder i look when i sat on a hors . which lead me to my next point . i am not capabl of say today that i look wonder on a hors . i think about improov , when i think of hors ride . on the other hand , when i will be older i will be abl to contempl all the thing , i will have done physic and experienc over my life time . in my opinion that is someth just older peopl can do . which in my opinion is a good thing , becaus it show that natur is well made . younger peopl have differ way to enjoy life , in what they are abl to do for exampl . and then their other way they are not abl to enjoy their life , becaus they are young . the same goe for older peopl . they have their way of enjoy life , like for instanc contempl their experi over a life time . whi becaus they are older and they have live for a long time and they also have the time to think about it . just like i do not have the time to think about how i look when i ride a hors , becaus i am young and therefor i am think about improv . so realli there is a time for everyth in life . there is a time to enjoy life , as a young person and as an old person and that make life probabl fair .
