differ approach in educ discuss wether it is more import for the student to learn about fact or to understand idea . if one ha to choos between both of them , i would say it is more import to learn to understand idea . i will first present some argument to support thi point , emphas on the intellectu import of the idea . then , i will tri to explain how complementari are these point and whi they are necessari to ani good student . as a student myself , i feel veri concern by thi topic , especi becaus i am a young research and the relationship between concept and fact is critic . howev , mainli becaus fact can be learn outsid the school i would agre to state it is more import to understand concept . for instanc , in my own research about the gentrif of harlem , i am less interest by the fact and the detail than by understand the whole process and the trend which drive it . it is true it is veri import to understand the concept of class , place and territori ( their role , symbol etc ) . i think it the role of the school to learn to the student to think by themselv and it succeed give them the intellectu and conceptu key and tool to understand a problem , and solv it . howev , say the concept is more import than the fact ( as it impli in the question ) i face a big ethic problem . in effect , how can you understand a concept or an idea if you do n't know some fact to contextu it for exampl . even if fact can be learn differ than in an academ way , they are requir . for exampl , if i do n't know how mani peopl are displac by the gentrif or in what extent the rent rise due to the gentrif , how can i expect to understand the natur of the transform occur in the neighborhood ? i think concept and fact are link and the reciproc of their relat is the secret of a good understand of concept and idea . to conclud , i would say that theoric understand concept is more import but it onli can work with veri abstract object of studi . the realiti is more complex and to understand effici an idea , you need to know the context and the fact .
