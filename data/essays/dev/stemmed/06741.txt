i agre with thi statement . advertis is an art , an art of make product seem attr and perfect . it is also the art of convinc the consum to buy the product . consum who are not wise enough or who are too influenc buy product becaus of the advertis . first of all i would say adversti compani tend to have a lot of money so they can make beauti , attr advertis . they have a lot of mean to attract to consum . tv advertsi are the easiest way to convinc a consum to buy your product wherea written advertis in newspap for exampl are less convinc becaus they are not interact . on tv ad you can see peopl use , eat the product the compani is sell . they reach more easili the consum . second of all , advertis are made to make product seem better than they are in real life . it is an art . for exampl when you see an advertis for a frozen pizza , the pizza alway look hot , savour . usual you can see the chees melt wherea when you buy it and you heat it up it is noth compar to that advertis , it is a normal frozen pizza not a home made one . third of all advertis is a lure for consum . peopl do not buy a product for it consist but for the way it look in the ad . sometim ad tend to lie about the the qualiti of the product for exampl toothpast that make your teeth white as the snow , or a soap which elimin all the imperfect of a teenag skin . to conclud i would say advertis make product seem much better than they realli are becaus it is one of the goal of advertsi the first one be to sell a product . but to sell a product in huge quantiti you have to make it special , better than the other , attract or even emphazis the result of thi product .
