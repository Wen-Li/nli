travel is one of the good opportun to get to know the outsid world , so i strongli oppos to thi statement . i think we can discov new thing more by travel alon or with few friend or famili . firstli , we can be flexibl with our scedul when we travel ourselv . thi mean we can pick place we want to go and arrang the most effect rout . when i went to spain with my son last month , we pick where we want to go first and organ our rout care . we move around use a subway and visit histor site and museum . whenev we felt like chang our plan , we had a cup of coff and made anoth plan . for exampl , after we saw gaudi 's famou cathedr in barcerona , my son want to visit other architectur of hi , so we decid to see other build rather than go to picaso museum . secondli , we can go where our interest are . in granada , we visit an old histor town call albishin . thi town is locat on the hill and it seem to be veri difficult for tour group to go , as these road are too narrow for larg buse to drive and there are mani pass to get out of the town . if i were a tour guid , i might lose my custom as these road are like a huge maze . but when i think back our trip , thi town wa the most excit and attract place for us . if we had gone to spain in a group tour , we could not have visit thi marvel histor town . for these reaso , i prefer travel on my own or with few peopl . we can go where we realli want to go and enjoy what we realli want to see . the spain trip with my son becam one of the most memor trip for me .
