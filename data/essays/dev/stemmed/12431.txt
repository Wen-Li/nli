i am disagre with the statement . i think that it is more import to learn that we all can prove as fact . first , not everi thing we underst as concept or idea is a fact . for instanc , when we learn an specif topic in econom we spect that it will work everi time . but that it is not true , a well known case is the way that one must take a desicion in a game , rememb john nash equilibrium . sencond , it is more easi to memor a fact that a concept . we all know that two plu two is four . on the other hand , tri to understand how physic explain the earth 's movement . final , there are alot of research in each area that when we understand a concept imediatli aris a new theori explain the same concept . for exampl , pluto is not a planet when i wa a child everybodi known that pluto wa the convers . for all i wrote abov i can sincer say that to learn fact is more import for student .
