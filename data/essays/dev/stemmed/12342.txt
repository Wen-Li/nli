i think that learn fact and understand idea are both import to know everyth you could possibl know about a certain subject . but when it come to what is more import i think that understand concept and idea is the reason whi there is fact for exampl if a scintest didnt tri new exper and went to knew plase and learnd new concept he could never come up with a fact that everybodi studi and know . usual a fact is more respect than a concept becaus the fact is certain and it there to see or to check but the concept may be a littel frightn becaus it hard to predect wether it is go to be a fact or the peopl will simpli forget it therefor the peopl rather to studi a fact-ful major than a concept major at the univers . all the new car and the new build start as a concept and the engin modifi it as they want and when they are all done they start do the project , after the project is introduc it becom a fact for everyon who doesnt know about the concept in the first place . deni that the fact are import in our live is wrong but i think that they are less import than the concept . for exampl the fact is a result of a long-tim think and studi readi to read and learn in a number of line , so it is much easier to learn an exist fact than to think about one use concept and idea . final if a person want to get the best possibl of knowledg he should consid and studi both fact and idea becau the start of everi fact is to prove the idea and introduc the concept .
