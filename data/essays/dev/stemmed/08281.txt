i think it is veri much essenti for a student to understand the idea and concept rather than learn the fact . these day the technolog ha develop , new thing are been invent thi is onli becaus of the main reason that is logic think about some thing . the invent of the telephon doe not made graham bell ( who invent telephon ) to refer for the fact . instead , he thought it logic and implement physic experi by use concept . as we look at mani of the scientist of the earli age they donot think much about the fact , rather they understood the idea about how to implement it . so it is better for a student to studi differ concept and implement hi idea . let us consid anoth exampl . if the student do think onli about the fact they onli bother about few thing like onli oil , petrol , kerosin and white petrol are the combust fuel , and automot can not run without petrol or diesel . if that is the case , sastri who wa a student would not have discov the fuel for the automobi . he extract some solut by use a plant 's leaf and mix that with some chemic and final use as a fuel for automobil . thi is mainli depend on lot of understand about the concept and keep a hard effort to implement hi idea . thi idea would be great benifici for the societi . and come to the secondari of the topic which deal with the learn of fact . it is use to some extent for the student . thi is becaus when we deal about the solar system , and a student is be ask about what is the shape of the earth , or how mani planet are there in the solar system ? then the student may refer to the fact rather than experi on that .
