everyon ha one day dreamt of invent someth new which would make him rich and success . i must say i believ in peopl 's intellig . i mean that we are all capabl of invent someth which will make us rich . so i do agre with thi statememt becaus be success is onli the last thing you get when you tri new thing . when you tri new thing you do it becaus you think that what you are tri worth the energi you are spend to do it . you are readi to do whatev it take to accomplish what you began . you are over motiv and that 's whi you succeed in you attempt . thi motiv show your ambit and that 's how you are go to make it . for exampl the film beatrix potter show whi she becam famou , that 's becaus she knew her idea wa good and she had enough motiv to get refus and to be desapprov by her father . and onc you have succeed you alway want to have thi feel again . the feel that noth can stop you , like leonardo dicaprio in titan , you think you are the king of the world . if you tri someth new or to invent someth it is becaus you do n't like to do alway the same thing even you can do it veri well . it is a lot more excit to invent someth , to think day and night on how you can develop an idea and make it real . final , you tri new thing becaus it make you success . you do n't like to be like everyon els , you want to be apart of the other . and even if you are do someth veri well you have to tri new thing or a new way to do it becaus it will show that you do n't reli on your knowledg . it will show that you realli want to improv yoursel . mozart is consid as a geniu becaus he not onli knew how to play an instrument veri young but also becaus he creat symphoni at a veri young age . as a conclus i would say that everyon should tri new thing , it is not interess to reli on what someon els crate for us . we have the tri someth new as well .
