nowaday young peopl seem to be more concern about their look than about the happi of their commun . i think inde young peopl are veri selfish nowaday . we can take the exampl of th riot in franc in novemb , we saw inde that some of young peopl did n't care about good of peopl and commun . so i agre with the fact that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . first young peopl have an obsess with their look , they want to wear onli expens cloth . they do n't have ani respect for their parent . they demand alway the best the most expens jean , the last mobil . .. without think to their poor parent who work hard in order to spoil their children . secondli i find that children are n't polit anymor . they do n't have ani respect for old peopl . some of young delinqu do n't hesit to attack a old woman in order to steal her bag . i think it is sad . then young peopl don ` t care about the cleanless in the public transport , they do n't preserv the infrastructur . they let their wast on the floor and do n't care about who will clean up .
