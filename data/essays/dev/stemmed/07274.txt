i disagre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . in my high school in california , lot of student form the small tutor group in order to help those student who have questio in perticular subject or who live in pool famili . they meet everyday after school in the librari , not onli studi their homework but also help other student . yet there are some student who could n't pay the money to the test-prep school or the college-prep program in commun colleg ; those who form the tutor group would answer almost all the question those helpless student have . i wa one of those helpless student becaus i just arriv from foreign countri ; howev , they help me improv my english abil . now i particip in the group and teach other student in math and chines . as young peopl , i think my classmat and my friend all did a good job in help the commun . i believ that there are other student group in other school that are do the same job . in summer time , most of my friend would particip to take care of the children or old peopl . some of those children have no parent , some of them were abandon . onc a time i particip in the servic , i read stori to them . at first i wa think of practic my english read abil ; howev , i cri after i went home becaus i feel i want to do more for them but i could n't . i ask more of my friend to join thi servic , and we all learn differ thing from it . one of my friend she had onc particip in a servic in a hospit . she talk to the old peopl , and then she read the book and newspap to them . she told me that , particip in a commun servic wa a realli differ experic , and it would lead you to lear more about life , about help other peopl but not ask the reward of it . young peopl do particip to help their commun without speak of it loudli ; they chose to help the societi silent . onc they join it , they would continu the servic .
