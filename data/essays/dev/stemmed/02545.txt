nowaday the car is connect to our everyday life so much more than ani other way of transport is . we often use car to go to work or to go to school , we use car in order to be somewher els in the less time it is possibl ; we use car also , and mayb first of all , for go out in the even , when buse and tube are mayb full of no raccomand peopl and someth like that . .. on one hand car is for sure our best way of transport becaus it is easi to use and it need not to be in queue for the tiket for exampl , but i think that the real question is : is the car realli the best solut , the best urban solut to reach a place , to go to somewher ? or mayb would the car be one day a real problem in our everyday live , instead ? i think that the answer is that in a few year the car will be the worst way of transport becaus of the increas number of driver in the street , and most of all becaus of the incom problem of the pollut ! accord to me , in the end , in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today as a natur consequ of the improv of our own live . i think also that my opinion is support by all those experi that scientist and ingeni are do in order to convert our way of move in a citi with altern way of transport and also with altern carbur mayb less nociv . for exampl i think that in the futur our citi will support much more transport by train than by car in order to move much more peopl at a time , elimin problem connect with traffic and pollut .
