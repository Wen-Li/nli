doe young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ? if i am ask to answer thi question , i would say no . mani older peopl think and say that young peopl have freedom and they can do whatev they want . howev , that is not true for young peopl becaus there are mani thing to do for young peopl befor they becom an adult . as a young person , i feel like i have veri limit life . teen go to school everyday , they have to do their homework and project , and they also have to prepar to go to colleg . prepar for the colleg give a lot of stress to young peopl becaus most of the student want to go to good colleg . in order to go to good colleg , they need to work hard in school and also they need to do mani extracurricular activ . even though they have someth that they want to do , either there are no free time for them or there are thing that is not allow to young peopl . also , in order to achiev their goal in the futur , it seem it is necessari to go to colleg and studi in the field they want to studi . without that educ , it is hard to get a job in the high posit or to earn a lot of money . not onli that , but also they need to listen to their parent becaus they are not adult yet . if the parent do n't agre with someth that you want to achiev , you need to either give up or chang your mind . there is actual no freedom for teen at school or at home . older peopl are more abl to do whatev they want becaus they have freedom and they do n't have financi problem becaus most of them work . basic , they can buy anyth they want without ask or get permiss to their parent , and they can also do whatev they want without be pressur under parent . we do n't exactli know when a young person becom a older person , but what we know is that when a person becom old enough , they can enjoy their life do whatev they want and they have more freedom than the young peopl .
