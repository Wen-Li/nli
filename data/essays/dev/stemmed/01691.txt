although fact provid a clear and better opinion for a particular subject but person i think that to understand the basic concept and the main idea behind the subject is much better as compar to simpli know the fact . so i agre with the statement that it is more import to understnd idea and concept then mere learn the fact . as we see that student in their school or colleg perform much better when they understand the concept well and have a clear idea of the subject that is be taught . they never have to cram the thing when the basic concept is clear in their mind . also they never forget that thing for the entir life . know the fact may fetch them good mark but they forget the subject within a short span of time . secondli , the worker in an offic show much better perform when they understand the basic concept and the main idea behind the project they are work on . simpli know the fact would not gener an effect result . so in order to get a better promot they have to learn the concept well so that they perform well . like in today world one must have the idea and concept of a comput to perform well in offic or in hi or her job . thirdli , it is veri import for a player of ani game to know the basic concept of the game rather then the fact . when i learen to play footbal my coach told me the main concept behind the game and henc i play the game well . simpli know the fact about footbal can not make me a good player . thu we saw that how know the concept and the basic idea behind a subject is much better than by simpli know the fact .
