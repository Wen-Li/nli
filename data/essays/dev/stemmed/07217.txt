the speaker hit truth when he say that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . commerci were origin a mode of inform consum about the avail of a product . but over the year , the sheer innoc of an old banner proclaim the open of a new kfc restaur in the neighbourhood ha been lost in the relentless wrath of commercialis . today , a commerci inform the viewer of what the product actual is would not even be notic , much less lure prospect buyer to a hope brand . in the deadlock of effici brand we find ourselv in today , advertis need to be one step ahead of each other , a phenomenon previous seen onli amongst the firm employ them . and thi veri much involv enhanc the featur of the product they endors . the world of advertis revolv around competit offer by other , and that ha brought it to such a stage where enhanc a product is a common practic . probabl the most appropri exampl would be that of a recent advertis my eye fell on a few day back . it promis of a `` mansion drape in greeneri '' , but the actual hous wa iron differ . it wa a modest two bedroom flat , hardli someth you could refer to as a mansion . but sometim advertis cross the limit of what would still be classifi as accept . perhap the most blatant of these are the one employ by the automobil industri . in a recent controversi , one automobil dealer in new delhi wa fine and bar from oper for a year becaus he had promis a prospect buyer a sedan , which turn out be be a mess of pure lie and thieveri . although sheer malpractic is evid in thi `` enhanc '' of product , some peopl still advoc the valid of these advertis . a recent survey in the unit state of america brought to light a stagger number of peopl who see noth wrong in thi new trend . it onli goe to show one thing ; that we have learnt to live with it and although unwant , it ha becom an integr part of advertis today . so much so , that all you need to do to be sure of it is look into the local newspap . even though it might not tickl our fanci , if statist are anyth to go by , thi practic is here to stay .
