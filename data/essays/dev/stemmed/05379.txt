i think that advertis are the best way to sell product . i think the sell and gain money from a product ha a veri import and coher chain . and advertis pley a veri import role in thi chain becaus without an advertis the product wo n't be known by lot of peopl , then you will not be abl to sell your product to mani peopl becaus your product is not well known and also becaus you did n't sell enough to get poepl 's trust so your product is not enough trustful and becaus of thi you will not gain money . and becaus you dont have money you will be abl to produc your good . and final your compani will be close . if you look to the big compani like coca-cola , you might understand what i am talk about . coca-cola today is a huge compani and ha lot of factori in lot of countri becaus it did introduc itself to the whole word by advertis . eventhough in our countri , turkey , they have a veri big advertis . in everi mounth they produc a new `` creativ '' advertis to attract peopl to buy coca-cola . becaus they know that advertis is a veri import and help way to introduc new product and also to show and make them rememb their old product too . so that whi they put lot of money to advertis to make peopl buy their product even though coke is a veri unhealthi thing . for anoth exampl fast food advertis . we all know that fast food are veri unhealti thing for us . it ha lot of chemic thing which are not need by our bodi , but when you watch mc . donald tw advertis and see a billboard advertis of burger king , you immediatelli think about eat a hamburg and drink a coke and eat extrem unhealti french fri . so advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . eventhough they are extremli unhealti and and not need by human you immediatelli want them . but thi make much better seller advertis are not just food and drink , it can be a car adv . or a game consol adv . or cloth compani adv . or everi singl think you think of . adverti
