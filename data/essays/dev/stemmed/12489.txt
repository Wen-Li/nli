the argument that success peopl are character by be peopl that continu take risk and enter new ventur , and avoid task that they are familiar with is controversi one . on the one hand , more risk mean more return , and greater chanc of reach and build creativ idea and result . on the other hand , work on a task that you know well will promis sure success , as compar to riski avenu that have a tendanc to result in huge failur as much as result in success . person i believ success peopl are the one that stick to the task that they can master , and i support my argument with the follow three reason . first , enter riski avenu without the knowledg and experi in the chosen riski task is similar to a gambl , the chanc of win are equal to the chanc of lose . it may also be that the chanc of lose are higher , as ani task requir the perform to learn and educ himself , and also familiar himself with the task . take snowboard as an exampl , you ca n't success snowboard without practic for long hour and take lesson , you will end up injur . second , work on thing that you are familiar with is the begin of ani process of innov . a number of human resourc book state that ani process of innov within ani field first requir that you have the knowledg and experi within thi field . third , a number of loss face by risk taker that enter field they have no knowledg about lead to veri sever loss that may veri like impair the person 's abil to undergo other task in the futur . as an exampl , the market crash in the late 1990 's lead to subtanti loss for the naiv investor that devot their time and a signific amount of their save in a ventur that they had no knowledg about . mani realli went bancrupt , lost their famili , and their health . all in all , i believ success can be reach if peopl undertak the task they are familiar with . a the choic of the familiar task lead to a much more posit outcom , compar to an outcom of enter riski avenu that you have no knowledg about .
