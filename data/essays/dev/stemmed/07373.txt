nowaday , it is import in time of appli at a univers to consid rather studi generalist or specifi in a certain subject . befor appli student should take follow aspect in consider . firstli , it is often mention that be a specialist of a certain area make it easier onc you finish univers to appli for the posit you are exactli train for at an organis . howev , have a broad knowledg of mani acadam subject give you the possibl to appli for a wider rang of job-ad . be generalist offer you a way to enter a compani more easili . onc you are receiv the job you still can and you even have to , no matter be a specialist or a generalist , adopt to tyhe need of the compani you are work for . second , it is argu that specifi in a certain field doe not take the same time as studi the basic of mani differ area . to some limit extend there is some truth in it , but , undoubt , experi show that no metter what way of studi you have chosen the time until achiev a degre is the same . nevertheless , do a generalist degre is in my point of view better than complet a specif degre that take the same time . in other word your possibl are much broader after the studi time find a job then they would onli be specifi . and the time you have spend remain the same . to summar , student first of all should be awar of the consequ when consid appli after they obtain a degre in a specif subject . furthermor they should mistrust the rumour that studi with the object to get a broad knowledg of mani academ subject take the same time then it would achiev a specif degre .
