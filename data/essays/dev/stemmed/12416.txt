i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . as a matter of fact , peopl who are open-mind , manag their time well and work hard , regardless of old or young , can enjoy their life without question . a bright and vigrou young spirit may have more curioisti than older peopl to explor the world . they are bound to learn ani inform they are enthusiast with . they may have lot of social activ they have to particip in such as parti , concert and sport and make friend . howev , a young peopl who grew up in a dysfunciton famili with narrow-mind , may not have mood to learn and play . they may fall in the depress and hate environ and kill time by dope drug or hook around . they drop out from school and do not know what to do . they do not know how to manag themselv and their time as well , so there 's no good life they can enjoy . on the other hand , a great deal of vivid older peopl may retir from their job and they are veteran who save pension and good at how to lead a beauti life . they manag their time care . they may get up in the morn to take a walk at the park , read newspap on the bench and enjoy sunshin , arrang a nice trip and visit old friend sometim ; cultiv hobbi to make their child 's dream come true . some older peopl who do not manag well from their youth may suffer financilli difficulti to organ their life . they are sick and can not go anywher . ill bring hard and unhappi life for them . therefor , no matter young and old , peopl can enjoy life easili if they appreci how preciou life are and manag their time well and keep open-mind .
