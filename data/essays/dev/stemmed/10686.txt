there are discuss that in the futur , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . although some peopl think that use the car increas than nowaday . becaus they think that the car is the most thing to not improv and they do n't have side-effect . but i think that there will be decreas in use the car in the futur . there are sever reason . first , nowaday , there is problem that oil , ga is reduc becaus of unplan excav . so it caus to lack of oil to move . it mean that although we have a lot of car , we can not drive becaus there is no oil to move . therefor we need to other substitut oil or altern method for movement . i think that find altern method for movement outweigh to find other oil . second , the car caus pollut of air . actual the car produc co2 , nox . it increas earth 's temperatur . so , the height of sea is increas . mayb our land will be under the water . imagin that condit you do n't have land to plant and to live in . from these problem , mani human is studi to find other method to move that it is not caus to pollut the air . third , the car is unconveni . becaus it can not onli out of order frequent but also ca n't cross the other contin . nowaday , there is global world . so to increas the power of nation , we should invent free-cross contin like ship and plane to trade easili . for these abov mention reason , there is no doubt in my mind that there will be fewer car in use , in the futur . becaus it caus air pollut and gradual the oil is reduc .
