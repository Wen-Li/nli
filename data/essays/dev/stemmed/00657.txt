i do agre with the statement that advertis make product seem better than they are . thi should come to no surpris as an advertis by definit respond to an aim . the aim is not to give an inform to the consum ( for which there is the press ) , but rather , to make the particular pruduct more appeal . an advertis is suppos to increas the sale of a particular product , which is sold for a profit of cours . so the manipul of the human individu is the purpos of the advertis . advertis are sponsor and financ by the produc , who essenti dictat what they should say . thi fact is known to everybodi , so it is even fair to do some overtst within limit . of cours there are consum protect law in all western countri . these law discourag an advertis from make outright fals claim . so , realist , outright lie are probabl uncommon in advertis . howev within thi limit , it is rather easi to make non verifi statement or suggest , which are neither true nor a lie . anti-ag , cosmet product are typic exampl . of cours , nobodi suggest that you can stop age . but , most advertis for such product do implictli suggest it as an und , implicit , messag , without explictli say it , by the layout and set of the advertis etc . cosmet product ' advertis alway show fresh , young charact who have no issu with age . .. also , advertis usual tri to convey a dream , a feel , and not a rationali verifi messag . for instanc advertis for expens car , watch and gener luxuri good alway advertis the qualiti and substanc of the product , which is greatli overst , but in the end , the custom buy it for intang reason , such as prestig and exclus associ with own a luxuri product . it is unrealist that a expens swiss manual watch is more reliabl , precis , than a cheap chines copi . .. but that is not the point .
