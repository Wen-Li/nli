in gener , young gener enjoy their life more than older gener do . thi is becaus young peopl have knowledg or skill to adopt now . older peopl are difficult to do that . but , the older peopl had the time to adjust world , and they must have enjoy at that time . so , i agre that young peopl enjoy life than older peopl do . in fact , i am in yong gener right now . i , of cours , enjoy my life . go to school , exrcis bodi and explor new world are all enjoy for me and other young peopl . for do them , pioneer spirit , health bodi and motiv for get new thing are requir . howev , it is heavi task for older . among them , some peopl are still have those power , but most peopl tend to be less motiv . for exampl , my grandmoth doe not want to do anyth except for her rutin which are to take care of household or talk to onli similar peopl in day . one time , i ask her to travel with my famili . but , she refus even if she wa veri healthi . she just did not want to leav her hous and nomal enviro she spent with . on the other hand , we young peopl do not be afraid of new life or enviro becaus we have a lot of dream for new world . it make us more enjoy than the older . i think that the older ought to have interest to enjoy their life . it might help them to suit societi and public . if they do not do that , onli thing they have is that they spend rest of their life unhappi or bore . to avoid thi situat , they should tri to have interest .
