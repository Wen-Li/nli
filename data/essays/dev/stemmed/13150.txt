present our life is a big full-immers into the most differ kind of advertis . no more possibl to escap . not yet . some peopl think that a lot of advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , other believ that advertis are the imag of a safe market . i think the most advertis do n't tell us the truth but obvious make product seem much better than they realli are , in order to enlarg their profit and be competit on the global market . first of all , these day we can assist at the death of the local dimens of market and at the enlarg of the econom actor , therefor the key word to understand thi current process is competit . in order to resist , the econom oper tri to sold as much as possibl make product seem much better than they realli are . second , it is import underlin how today the advertis sold dream behind the product tri to convinc us for exampl that it is enough buy a particular model of a car to find the happy ! in conclus i am total agre with the statement and more , i consid thi behaviour terribl and not ethic as it would be !
