i agre with the statement but i think it will depend on differ reason . it will be difficult to live without car , especi here in itali where most of the trade and travel is made by car . i believ that we will all benefit from the lack of car but we need to get use to other mean of transport . first of all , peopl should start use public transport . in thi way , compani will improv their mean and they will be readi to sustain the chang habit in twenti year . secondli , we should invest more in research and develop for altern mean of transport and to lower the price of transport , such as those of airplan , train and ferri . govern should also improv infrastructur for there mean of transport as often airport , railway station and harbour are not enough effici . as nowaday car are the biggest sourc of pollut , it will be posit for the environ and for all of us . scientist are alreadi work to find altern sourc to make our car run , as in twenti year time , we might run out of petroleum , and thi will probabl be the main caus for fewer car . despit thi , we will need to discov altern sourc to make our car run . new car are alreadi on the market which work with hydrogen , electr or solar pannel . howev , they are just prototyp and we are not sure about their benefit to privat transport . final , it will caus less accid on the road as most of the dead in the western emispher are caus by road crash
