i agre with the statement that most advertis show more fact of the product than they realli have and make it much more easi to be sale . thi phonomenen are show almost all over the world and i think it is reason to be accept . the first reason is that , the advertis is mean to show the good effect of the product and appeal peopl to buy them . it is the use of the advert . peopl who make advertis alway studi the merchan care and make it more use and more worth to buy . they of caus will show a lot of unconvinc fact to be convinc . just even a piec of papper can be discrib to have the capabl to make user more healthi than use other kind of papper . you may think it is redicul , but the advertis offen make those problem . second , the compani pay for the advertis is focu on the profit of it . the compani do thi thing just becaus it want to increas it sale and make more money back . input and output is the first thing to a compani . so the manerg peopl want to make the product more attract to the market . and the advertis will be as better as it could be . no concern about the fact . there are mani illigl advertis in china that mislead peopl and make terribl effect to the societi . the last reason is , sometim , peopl are like to see some amaz thing in the advertis though they do not believ it . for exampl , a women who is not so fit may want to see some medicin that can help peopl to lose weight . and she may dream that she could be as beauti as the fictur shown at the advertis . she dose not want a realli product , but just a dream . so the advertis offen seem much better than they realli are and acceptebl to the societi .
