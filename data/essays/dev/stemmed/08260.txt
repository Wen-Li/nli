travil is sometim for holiday and see new place but sometim it is for job . for the first , you can travel yourself or travel with a group led by a tour guid . sometim you need the first one , sometim the second one . i disagre the statement ; the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . it chang accord to the your physcholog or your destin , that can be abroad or insid of your conutri . i prefer travel my own becus of sever reason . firstli , when you travel with a group led by tour guid you must fallow them all your travel . it sound do not come me good . it seem veri resrict and bore . befor you travel to some place sometim you make some search about thi place anda you imagin someth also you plan someth . when you travel with a group if a tour guid will plan to see place , where you plan to see , it is a problem . addtion to thi , you can be bore the place but becaus of the group you must be in there . so it is not a good situtaion . secondli , tour guid gener take you histor place . sometim it is a good but for person who is not interest with histori or art it is also bad situtaion . in conclus there are mani reason like these to prefer travel my own . tour may not be good as you espect . the hotel may not be clear or comfort . altough there are some advantag of traval with a group led by a tour guid ,
