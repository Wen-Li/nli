no wonder young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . in my opinion , in the earli age peopl can do lot of thing easili without wor anyth . they just decid and enjoy what they do . i agre that young peopl have more chanc to enjoy life for the follow reason : have less depend than older peopl , and the desir of learn new inform and have experi . first , young peopl have less depend such as look after someon , the need of earn money or health issu - obstacl for travel countri - than older peopl have . young peopl are abl to travel differ countri easili without think anybodi stay back like children . for exampl , my parent have three children includ me . if they want to travel to spain dure the rest of their time , they can not leav their children becaus children need to be look after . in thi case , young peopl who do not have ani children can easili go for travel . moreov , young peopl usual want to learn and gain a lot of differ kind of experi dure their earli age . i can rememb , when my brother wa nineteen he use to go to music festiv , theather , and travel a lot . basic , he enjoy a lot becaus he had time , suffic amount of money and energi . also , he could easili adapt difficult condit whatev he face with . i can not imagin that older peopl join a parti and a boat trip at the same day . in conclus , older peopl and young peopl can not be compar eheth young peopl enjoy the life more than older peopl or not . so basic , young peopl should be awar of their opportun in order to enjoy the time .
