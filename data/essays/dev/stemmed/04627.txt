it seem that young peopl nowaday do n't give enough time to help their commun , i agre with thi statement . but i have to say that it onli seem that . i have twenti year old , so i 'm young , and then i 'm part of young peopl . sinc my point of view i believ to thing about thi fact . at first i would want to focu on the fact that young peopl help , young peopl want to help , they want the societi to ask help to them , they have the necess of know that they are part of someth and that thi part is use and that societi need a lot of part , societi and their commun need everi young for run a better societi and that they are need . young peopl want the societi to ask for them ! and that is where i want to arriv , nowaday societi show an imag of the young peopl as if they are lazi peopl , as if they onli want to have fun and to be with their friend . and at least , as if societi doe n't expect no posit reaction of them . a lot of young peopl travel abroad to underdevelop countri to help as volunti . the fact that is , they can be volunti on their own countri , they can take care of peopl around them , they can help in project of benefic in their countri , ... but what happen ? most of the time their own commun do n't ask them help , they do n't know they can help in their own commun and built a better societi . in conclus , i can state that societi doe n't encourag young peopl to help and that is becaus young peopl act in these two way : they get relax becaus they believ socitey doe n't expect anyth of them ; or they travel abroad , to underdevelop countri where young peopl believ that they realli need their help . sinc my point of view , and apart of what i have say , there are peopl that are respons with their commun and have the necess and the aim to help in their own commun and also , they view their commun necess and want to help and satisfi them as far as they can do it .
