i doe n't agre with the statement ` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ' ! i think one reason is that there are some big differ between young peopl and older peopl becaus older peopl have other experi than the younger peopl ! you can not put them on the same basic . in my opionen older peopl enjoy their life in an other way then in their past . in the past parent were much stronger with their chlidren than today . older peopl enjoy their life with do other activ than the younger peopl do . they have n't go to a club or a disco to enjoy their freetim . they do thing like travel and walk around or read interest book or someth els . when you are older you also have more possibl to enjoy your life becaus you may be have more money than the younger peopl . for me it is realli terribl that young peopl enjoy life often in a veri strang way . often they have to drink alcohol or put drug into their bodi to have fun ! for me it is not a way of enjoy life . for exampl there are my parent . in their younger life they did n't enjoy life like they do it today . that is becaus they becam mum and dad in their younger day and so they were n't abl to have fun like teenag or young peopl in nowaday . but today their childern are adult and do n't live at home , so they are abl to make holiday or go to cinema or someth like that whenev they want to . i think that is a good way of enjoy life and freetim . to give a short conclus it is import to enjoy life when you are young and when you are old .
