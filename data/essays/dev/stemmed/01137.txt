car are one of our major transport item in modern life . we have been use them for more than 50 year but it 's hard to tell what their approxim number will be in twenti year time period as thi subject need a larg analysi . but some predict compar their advantag and disadvantag can be made . number of car in use can increas or stay nearli the same in twenti year . first of all , they are not new technolog so that they becam crucial element of our live . for inctanc , we have built larg road , bridg or traffic rule to use them effect and even some of us regard their car as their friend . what is more , although they pollut the environ it could n't prevent peopl from use them . secondli , they still provid easi access to everywher compar to plane or train . for instanc , we will still be use our car to go near distanc . in addit , there can be new materi in twenti year time , which will be altern to petrol and which will enhanc the car usag . on the other hand , it 's also possibl to say that number of car in use will lessen in follow year . new transport opportun can be mention to support thi argument . for instanc , much access and much more effici vehicl can be prefer in the futur . moreov , car use petrol which is a natur resourc that wil be finish soon and for which peopl are be kill for year , so it 's logic to think that peopl are alreadi fed up with problem that petrol caus . not onli it polit and social problem , but also petrol and car have an econom aspect due to the fact that petrol price have been on increas and becam veri expens . in conclus , it 's possibl for car to be popular in follow year as they are up to now . but in my opinion , the backdraw of these littl vehicl are so mani that , peopl will find new option in twenti year . besid , none of us want to face war or high price ani more .
