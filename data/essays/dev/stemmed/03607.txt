i do agre that most advertismenet make product seem much better than they realli are . a possibl explain would be that these advertis are base on differ survey made by profession in order to know what the target public want to hear . for exampl , if a compani want to sell a new skate board , it will interview teenag who are skateboard to know what they are look for in a perfect product . they will do the same with the parent of the skateboard becaus ther are the one who will pay for it . onc these inform are analyz , a public will be made out of that . the content of thi advertis would be base on scientifc data . the target public will see in the product exactli what they are look for , it will appear as the perfect product . howev , they might be disapoint onc they have bought the item realiz that it is not that perfect . an other way to illustr my point is the advertis for kraft 's dinner product . thi public target whoever make lunch at home , i.e. the mother and their kid . the product is sold as a healthi and conveni lunch . the kid look realli happi to eat it and it seem realli tasteful . howev , one can easilli realiz that kraft 's dinner product are not a healthi meal and are not tasteful . the public conceptor know that someon will be more like to buy a product if it as a pretti present . that is the reason whi all the product are in nice littl box with bright color and print with impress design . an other way to make a product look attract is by use the pictur of a good look women or a handsom men . therefor , the client will purchas the item in order to be closer to the model on the box . but the product insid might not be that exceptionn . in conclus , i think that advertis compani are abl to identifi the desir of custom and make a nice public featur all them . they are abl to show a way to peopl to reach their dream . but dream doe not alway come true . ..
