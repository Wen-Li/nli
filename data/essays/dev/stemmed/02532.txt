i agre with thi statement that it is much better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject , becaus if you just one way to a solut , sometim you can not be abl to make a solut , so it is veri import to have a broad knowledg . for exampl you are onli abl to write with your hand and you are not use to write on a pc , you will get in trobl in mani situat in dayli busi live . an other problem can be , if you are special and someodi want to dicuss an problem with you which is also imprtant for you to get awar of but you can not say anyth becaus you do not understand what the problem mean to other . that is a big problem in our societi , becaus everyon is kind special in one 's own life and you often see onli your problem whether other 's have much more problem . the next problem for special peopl is , that they normal can onli do one job in their whole life . i think if you get rid of the job you do , it is much better to have the abil to chang it and that will be much easier with an broad knowledg . but if you are special in one specif subject it will be veri hard to get an other job without lose time by take cours to ` improv ' one 's knowledg . not to forget the money you can not earn in thi period o time . as a result i would say that a broad knowledg give you much more qualiti of life and a higher vareti of job .
