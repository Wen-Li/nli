i agre with the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do it '' . the reason i agre is beacaus i think you can not make succ if they did what they alreadi know haw to do . if you know how to do it , then other peopl would know as well . you tri new thing and that give us the impact , mayb thi is the way to be success . howev i do not think you can succeed by randumli make new idea . you do need to search on them , you need reason and proof to come up with the idea . also you may need some help from other peolp who ha been through and experienc it . for exampl presid of cloth shop call uniqlo . i think it is one of the most famou cloth shop in japan now day . he made so mani new project , and he actual tri . but faill so mani time too . he present to us mass produc . first of all , they start to make simpl design cloth and sold them with veri cheep price . befor uniqlo did thi way of sell cloth , everi one would of thought it wa not veri good idea of produc so mani same design , cheep , simpl cloth . becaus they thoght that costum want to buy someth more individu and good qualiti . howev uniqlo succeed by sell product thi way . but i have also seen them faill quit badli , that wa when they start to sell veget and frite at the shop . it wa an veri big impact on us too like the last time . what kind of cloth shop sell veget at the shop ? but it did not make a seccess end . they stop sell it after few month . it made such a loss for the compani . but the presid of uniqlo still doe not stop produc new idea and project . that is whi the compani is still grow and make a lot of money . i have come to the conclus that i think even other peopl think you will not success with it and stop you , they can be wrong sometim . you might fail a lot of time befor you actual becom a success person . but that is the way to success so you should not be afraid , you need to take risk and tri .
