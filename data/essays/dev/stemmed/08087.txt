i total agre with that statementa that young peopl recent do not have enough time to help their commun . there are sever reason whi i think so : rack of time and busi life , and unfamiliar with the commun . first of all , i am also one of the young peopl who do not engag in help their comun . in my opinion , the big reason is that they are just too busi jsut to go to school . in my case , even i want to give my time to help my commun , i do not have enough time t spend in it becaus of the school . recent , mani student go privat school far from the hous not public school locat close to the hous . i also go to privat school . the school is so far that it take me one and a half hour to get there . threfor , it is difficult to find and spare the time to contribut to my commun becaus of lack of the time . second , most student even elementri school student go to juku school after school becaus amni parent and student are not satisfi with the educ of the school or they think they need support school studi . therefor , they do not have time even to have familti time or to hang out with friend . student of the age that are the time to take entranc examin to next school such as high school or univers go juku almost whole week . consequ , they would rather to have time to spend with famili or friend if they could find the time . third , they and i feel the commun is not familiar with us . i am sure all peopl knew each face of their all neighbor and they communicate each other a lot long time ago , to my disppoint , it doe not happen now . i just move new citi so i do not know about my commun and my neighbor . as a result , even there is a festiv , i alway do not particip in it becaus there is no peopl who i know . i guess it occur to peopl nowaday a lot . in conclus , i am in agreement that most young peopl do not spare enough time to support their commun . even they want to help them , it is not easi becaus recent childrent are have busi day . i think we need to find the way to commun to be more activ at first .
