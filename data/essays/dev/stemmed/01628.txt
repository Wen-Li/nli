most peopl think that enjoy come from experi , but in my opinion , when we first experi someth we enjoy it more . there is a say that a thing is attract until you get it , in other word , when you wish for someth and do not get it easili , you are more keen to get it . after get that thing , you loos your interest in it . thi is the human natur . so the mean is that younger peopl enjoy their life more than older , becaus they experi thing for veri first time . i also agre with thi opinion that young person enjoy life more than older peopl . to support my opinion , firstli , i would like to disscuss the tendenc or the natur of younger . first of all , they are veri curiou about new thing . they want to explor everyth regardless of danger associ with it . for exampl , when i wa a kid , i wa alway curiou about parachut , and one day what happen , i just jump from my roof top with an umbrella . at that time i did not know , what is fear . so mean is that , you can not expect thi kind of absurd behavior from an older person . even , if an old person doe not know the harm associ with the task , he/sh might not take risk . secondli , youth do not care for moral valu , wherea old peopl do follow them strictli . from their experi of life , senior peopl know the valu of ethic and would like to follow alway . on the other hand , teenag are unlik to follow the moral valu , or they follow reluctantli . thirdli , in my opinion , you can enjoy the life if you do n't have restrict on you activ . old peopl have respos toward societi , as well as toward their own famili . while younger are free to do whatev they want . for an instanc , i like to danc public , and i do whenev i get chanc to do it . but i know some older peopl can not do it becaus first they think about other opinion such as , what would the societi think , or what would be the impact on children . last but not the least , young peopl are alway open to new idea or cultur , while older peopl have narrow mind . it is easi for a younger to adapt a new cultur in order to learn it . on the other hand , senior person are rigid to their own cultur in order to preserv it . conclus is that , although it is true that older peopl enjoy life base on their own life time experi , i strongli hold the view that younger enjoy the life more than them . the main reason are , will to explor new thing , no respons , less regard for valu or ethic , and more energi to enjoy life .
