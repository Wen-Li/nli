i total agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . in my observ from the success businessmen or professor , they often do thing or sucject what other peopl do not understand at all . for exampl , ten year ago , while most peopl do not know valu and benefit of the comput , but bill gate knew it . becaus he went ahead and tri the new thing ( comput ) , he made a real big fortun from do latest technolog . on contrari to those person who onli do what they known , success person are alway tri new thing . they usual have a open mind to absorb all the latest concept , and they often take risk . for instanc , if a businessman adopt the idea that he never heard befor , it must be veri riski to use it if the idea is not pratic to oper . there will be two differ way for use the new thought : success or fail . most peopl will not dare to adopt new thing becaus they are afraid that they may lose everyth . in thi way , they gradual develop the idea that they do not want to learn the new thing and take advantag of them . in contast , thi idea seldom be form in the heart of success peopl . they , of cours , know the risk might be , but they are not afraid . success peopl usual have a posit mind to keep them go ahead . in conclus , i think that i truli agre the opinion that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
