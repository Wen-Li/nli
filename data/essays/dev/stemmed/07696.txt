when it come to travel in a group some peopl may say that the best way to do so is led by a tour guid ; i person disagre with that oppinion . it 's true that have a tour guid ha it advantag such as be taken to all the typic local turist attract , you will be almost sertain that you wo n't be miss out on ani must see place . yet , in the other had , have a tour guid limit your freetim . when travel in a group you want to spend time with your friend , and spend it as you wish ; not have to be tie to a schedul as it is when use a tour guid . it could also be said that when travel in big group , peopl alway want to see differ thing , and argument may occur . although have a tour guid could prevent thi disagr by simpli follow the itinerari set for that day , there a better way to solv the problem . the group could just simpli seper , each person goe to where they want , and at the end of the day meet again . the advantag of thi solut is that when a big number of peopl are togeth for a period of time , usual argument happen ; by send each person on their differ way it give them time to refresh from the enviro of the group . most import of all , of whi is better to travel without a tour guid , it that have a tour guid babysit you around the citi take away a great part of the social and cultur interact . the experi that you earn when you explor an unknown citi on your own is someth that can not be show by a tour guid . in conclus , for all the reason name abov , my suggest when it come to traval in a group is to not hire a tour guid and explor the citi on your own along with your friend .
