i certainli agre with the follow statement , which say that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . we all know that advertis have a high impact on peopl it 's the onli way to promot a product , so in order to convinc them to buy their should be a kind of exager somewher but bear in mind that we should n't be unrealist . we have differ type of exager in order to make a product seem better and all depend on the type of media , for exampl when talk about the billboard , how mani time we saw an ad or an offer for a fast food restaur , they show a big burger and say that we can now buy one and get the other one for free , wow amaz by thi offer we all go to thi restaur and order the offer , but surprisingli we see that the burger is such a miniatur and if we eat 1o of them we wont be satisfi ! so in thi case they play with the font of the ad . anoth exampl will be a whiten cream , they tell us that in 4 week we 'll have a white princess skin , the first step for those who want to whiten their skin is to go and buy thi product , they use it for 1 month mayb but no differ at all so we all wonder here if the problem come from us or the produst itself ! too mani exampl can support my answer well let 's list anoth one , the best exampl ever is the `` best seller '' which is an advertis program seen on tv , well here come a catastroph becaus they show too mani product and tri them on the tv , but when we order them home i bet we can use them more than 1 week becaus they 're bad qualiti . deterg are one of the product that do not show the real effect of it , for exampl when they show us a certain laundri deterg on the tv , they bring a t-shirt and drop coffe , chocolat , ketchup . .. on it and as a magic all is gone and the latter becom white as if we just bought it . also advertis for cloth , home apllianc , car , technolog etc ! ha an impact and a strong one over custom beacaus some peopl even if they do n't like the product or do n't use it they will buy it mayb becaus their celebr is in it . i think that good compani do not promot their product , we can see veri profit compani with a rel high profit which do n't put an ad on the tv but everyon goe and buy from it , that 's becaus it 's an old and trusti one , also now we can differ from a medecin which is good or bad , everi compani which promot a medecin is certainli face a low return and it 's medecin is not that good becaus in gener we put ad in order to attract custom and who is not in need wont do it . advertis is an import thing but should some limit in order to be more realist and so can attract mani peopl , it 's better to be real than a dream one ! .
