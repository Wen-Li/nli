inde , mani succ peopl in the histori were will tri new thing and take risk , but do all the succ peopl tri new thing and take risk ? i do n't think so . i think success peopl are the one who are topest in thier field . if he or she can do one thing best , he or she will be a succe person . for thi point of view , success peopl do not alway have to tri new thing and take risk . we see some one who do someth new and succe , so that we say suc peopl `` alway '' tri new thing and take risk . i think it 's too abrupt . we will say that , becaus we onli see the succ one . we have littl chanc to the fail one . tri new thing and take risk also mean high prossibilti of failur . therefor , mani peopl prefer to spend their time on what is alreadi known . and they work hard so that they can outbeat their rival . also , onli the `` tri '' is not enough . we have to spend more time and energi to improv the invit . and the improv part are more annoy and complic . if he or she are one who are onli will to spend their time to find or invit somethhimg new , but too lazi to improv it , he or she will not succeed . on the other hand , if there is a one who are will to work hard to find the imporv way , one is more like to suc that the origin invitor or finder . take janpan for exampl . theamerican invit car , but they do n't spemd time to improv car . and janpanes spend a lot of time and money to improv car . now , janpan becom the biggest contri produc car . therefor , i think the keypoint of success is not tri new thing , but will to work hard or not .
