person , i think that thi statement is a perfect reflect of what i think and do , i have alway thought that you have to understand everyth that you are taught . thi is a veri controversi topic , but i think i have a clear panorama of what i think . the first reason for which i inclin to thi decis is for the fact that learn fact do n't give you an intern satistact of a certain topic . there is a famou quot state by ignatiu of loyola s.j. which is : `` the know doe n't satisfi the soul , but the interpret and like of the thing intern doe '' . thi is a veri reflex quot , becaus when you learn a fact you do n't adquir it 's concept complet , you have like an empti space . for exampl in philosophi , you can know the point of view from everi philosoph , but if you do n't understand them , you could never know what they realli meant . the second reason is that human brain tend to forget easili thing learn but not interpret . for exampl , the thing that you learn in 9th grade , sometim you forget them when you are in 10th or 11th , becaus you do n't realli get the concept complet . on the other hand , if you learn someth and you understand it well , you will rememb it for ever , or if you forget it , with a littl think you will rememb it and could use it right for other aspect in your cotidian life . final , i would like to say that peopl who alway memor fact and do n't understand them complet , usual have less resourc for have success in life , becaus of their lack of understand and interpret in essenti manner . howev , peopl who realli understand all the thing that they are taught , usual develop an abil to solv problem faster , or be more origin in their think .
