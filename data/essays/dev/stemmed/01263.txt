older peopl usual consid young peopl of our gener as more lazi and more self-cent than young peopl of their own gener . eventhough the origin of thi belief is easi to understand in individualist countri , i find it difficult to accept the idea that peopl nowaday do n't give enought time to help their commun . inde , i think that modern societi offer more structur and organis to allow peopl to help the commun indirectli . for instanc , system such as the social secur system in franc allow worker to help indirectli the peopl need health care by pay tax . if thi idea do not seem to appli directli to young peopl , onc again we can argu that young peopl are indirectli help their commun . for instanc , when they spend time work for school in order to get the need skill to eventu find a job and contribut to the wealth of the countri . some peopl would argu on the other hand that govern of modern societi do not offer enought to the peopl who still need individu help , not onli in term of money , but mostli in term of time . an exampl could be the lack of volonti for the care of retier peopl need personn help . if one approach consist in blame the peopl have free time , like the young peopl , for their selfish , and altern attitut can be to look at who help , and who doe n't help to chang the situat . modern societi probabl reach thi point of no-return where peopl got use to reli on the govern for social issu . therefor it seem reasonn to give more credit to the peopl who actual act on the govern - by the power of vote , by protest , or take part in the polit life - so that social issu becom a major concern . as a conclus , they are differ way of help a commin , and we can find , depend on the cultur or the countri , specif group of young peopl who actual give time to make someth useful , either by work hard at school , or by vote .
