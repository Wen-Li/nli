i disagre with thi statement . it is true that enviroment problem around oil are risen nowaday and lot of car compani , for exampl toyota motor in japan , hasten the speed to develop the new system of transport which can be replac from the transport use car . some peopl , especi one who live in the metropolitan area , may use such way of transport . as a result , the number of car may decreas in those area . but there is a condit to be such an area . those area should be develop well in it inflastructur and econom . in other word , the area which is develop now can not afford to buy or develop that kind of system . on the other hand , the demand for car is thoght to be increas as it economi grow bigger . and car are avail for less amount of money than that cost to adopt the new kind of the transport system . global think , the popul in the develop countri is higher than that of the develop . if so , the speed of increas the number of car in the develop countri exce the speed of decreas the number of car in the develop countri . thi is the first reason for my opinion . the second reason is that the demand of the car would not be disappear . car mania exist
