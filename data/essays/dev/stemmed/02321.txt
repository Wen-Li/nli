i , be a student for 12 year now , feel abl to juge and talk about the scholar system and in my opinion our scholar system concentr too much on succ than on valu . there are a lot of differ subject and class you are particip as a student and in everi class you are write exam . but often you do not have enough time to studi for such an exam and therefor you just learn the most import fact by heart to succeed in the exam . but you forget the fact you learn by heart veri quickli and after a few month noth is left anymor and you take onli a minimum of what you have ever learn at school with you . thi is not a veri good prepar for life becaus at school you often onli learn how to reproduc fact about a topic in a few day . by practic idea in an enjoy way like in group work or role play for exampl you keep the essenc and the main contenc of a concept in mind . that way you do not have to feel under pressur to learn fact veri quickli by heart , you can enjoy learn ! and if you enjoy learn you will take more essenc with you . teach concept and idea may content ideal way of behavior you could never teach with the help of fact . student can learn about valu and strategi that are import for their futur life . if they understand the background or the concept of someth they learn they will alway be abl to reproduc these strategi of behavior in daili situat . and in my opinion thi is the task of school . school should prepar all of the student for their futur . it is up to a school to teach valu and virtu becaus veri often parent fail . it is sure that valu can not be taught by give fact or by learn thing by heart . valu can onli be taught by practic them and therefor i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
