i agre that most advertis make product seem better than they reali are . advertis are there to attract custom to a certain product . the product is alway display in a way where it seem appel to the viewer . sometim the compani advertis the product tend to exadur in advertis . they make the product seem to good to be real . each advertis is there to target a certain age group . for exampl when advertis a toy on the televis certain sound effect and bright colour are use to attract young children make them desir the product . therefor the parent take action and buy the toy for their child . advertis is the best way to minpul with young children 's mind . advertis doe not includ the disadvantag of the product advertis . the product is alway prais and made flawless . the compani advertis a certain good main aim is profit . qualiti and custom servic is the last thing consid . it is rare that you find an advertis product that is trustworthi and is exactli like it wa describ on the advertis . in a conclus i would like to say that the problem we are face nowaday is that we are let those fals advertis affect us , but there is noth we can do about it as they are everi where . they 're display as bulletin board in the street , show on the televis as commerci and even play on the radio . in the end were just human and the least thing affect us !!!
