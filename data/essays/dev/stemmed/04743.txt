nowsday , some may hold opinion that it is better to have broad knowledg of amni academ subject then to special o = in one specif subject . howev , other may hold neg opinion about it . as far as i am concern , i do not agre that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . first of all , peopl will not studi veri well if they learn mani academ subject . becaus they need to spare their time on so mani subject . we all know that the more you spend on do one thing is better than the less you spend on do one thing . the result for you spend one hour on studi is differ from the result for you spend eight hour on studi . if you spend more time on one subject , you wil know more about it . but if you spend time on so mani subject , you can not deepli learn about them . secondli , if you have one special skill , it is easier for you to find futur job . becaus you have special knowledg in one specif subject . mani compani need peopl who have special skill . for instanc , in canada , it is lack of peopl who know how to build cabl . if a person ha that skill , he ccan easili find a job and get higher pay . howev , peopl who haver broad knowledg of mani academ subject can easili find job , such as in the foreign compani , they requir peopl to speak 2 or 3 languag . tthey may can speak 2 or 3 languag , but they may not know how to write them . it is better to have special in one specif subject than broad knowledg of mani academ subject . peopl can learn veri well in one subject rather than in mani subject .
