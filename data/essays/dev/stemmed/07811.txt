i disagre with the say that understand idea and concept is import for a student than it is to learn fact . idea give the student a invok for what and how a task ha to be done . concept are studi from the earlier edit of book and from some written or , gener say , from an abstract on wat is alreadi done . concept also mean basic idea of what is to be done . concept is the gener background of ani subject consid . ofcours , without concept noth is done properli , for exampl take a major . a student doe not catch up with the cours if he ha no idea about the concept or the basic of the cours . fact is a veri live word to listen . fact explain which is true , true and onli true . fact are the thing to be consid in everi particular task . accord to me , learn fact alway put us in the place where we have to be . learn fact sound to someth like behaviour , person experi , someth done . for exampl , give a test wchich is relli new to a student . he ha to give mani practic test in order to face the experi when on the real test . if the student just goe to the test with all idea and fulli known concept , it woud not be that good result as it would be when he take practis test befor . anoth exampl is put up a new business.a man plan to start a new busi , he ha to learn the idea , the concept of market , and as well the experiens . he ha to observ some businessman , how they work with the daili share . have an idea an the basic knowledg about the busi doe not just click into the market . there would be less profit in the work done without learn fact . so , these observ conclud that half knowledg is alway danger . thu , i disagre with the say , more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
