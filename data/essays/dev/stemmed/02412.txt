in our centuri , advertis is everywher . we have to deal with and to be awar of adverstis 's trick . to my mind , most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . inde , the aim of an advertis is to sell a product . that is whi they are readi to say everyth which can convinc you to buy it . peopl who do advertis have not the due to say the truth , their goal is onli commerci , not educ . so how can we trust adverst ? to illustr thi fact , we can take the exampl of mc donald . if we look an adverstis for thi restaur , we can learn that meal are usual veri dietet , they are not bad for the health and pictur of meal are realli teas . but accord to the experi make on mc donald ' food in supers me , we can see that , thi food is not good for the health . to give anoth exampl , we can consider make up advertis . women who play in these advertis are model and if we put thi make up , we will not look at the model . moreov , on her rimmel seem to be someth veri effici but on we it doe not have the same effect ! so the product work better on tv or on adverstis than on the real life . it is usual the same for wash product which wash our cloth more white than white . we have to keep in mind that : advertis world is an i ; aginari world where everyth is perfect . that is not suppos to reflect the realiti . that sell we dream and that is what we buy when we buy a product after have seen it advertis . inde all is fack on an advertis , peopl on are retouch , they alway seem happi , and think everyth is delici or amaz . to conclud we can say that , ye adverstis make usual product better than they realli are becaus there main stake is to sell someth and not to be true .
