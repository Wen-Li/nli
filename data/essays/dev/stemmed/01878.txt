advertis are seen all over . they catch public attent in newspap , televis , billboard . nowaday advertis are also seen in cinema . but i person feel these advertis are often exagger . advertis usual do n't mention hidden cost , do n't mention the effici of the product and henc deceiv peopl . first , the advertis project nowaday do not mention about the hidden detail they have for a particular product . for exampl in the master card advertis the advertis mainli portray the advantag like less interest rate , surpris gift . but they do not mention a detail inform about the product . my friend receiv a bill for 500 $ just becaus he cross the due date , which wa not mention to him when he bought the card . moreov for the gift they give to custom they actual demand money from the custom . anoth exampl about such hidden cost is in the mobil phone industri , last month i got a call from my servic provid and they launch a new offer which they mention it wa free of cost . but when i activ and start use thi facil my bill start to shoot up . the servic provid did not mention about the usag cost . second , the advertis do not mention about the effici of the product . for exampl , i start use a calcul from a local market . but the calcul did not work for more than two day . it did not respond to sever button . the advertis which i refer did not mention about the life of the calcul . anoth exampl is when i bought a blackberri the advertis said `` free bluetooth headset for everi blackberri '' . but it fail to work after one month . final , advertis primarili deceiv peopl . they project the product in a bigger size in televis but actual the seem to look so small . moreov they mention that that the entir product is free and onc we go and buy they would say that the scheme is under exchang . sever such way are follow by compani to fool the public . for the abov mention reason , advertis are depict an entir wrong pictur of the product and tend to exagger the product . i person believ that compani must project correct fact about product .
