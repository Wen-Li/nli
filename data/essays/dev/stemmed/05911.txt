i do agre with the statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . success peopl usual come from mani failur and risk and after overcom all thi situat they gain success . so those peopl have a clear idea about how to tackl or overcom with risk and problem . the man or woman who is usual success prefer gain more success from more new thing or the thing which he or she is unfamiliar with . and in order to tri new thing they never hesit , wherea , the man who is usual under a nonsuccess stage fear to tri for new thing . there are mani exampl which support the answer . for instanc , in the consturct field peopl usual succeed in the field of consturct huge build , dam , tower and flyover which is usual a riski factor at those day . becaus they have succeed in there field they are tri for more new thing like go for more huge or enorm work which is also a bit kind of riski . becaus the consturct field peopl know a lot about there work and failur which they will meet in achiev thing they tri to solv them in more logic manner or say in an plan order . not onli in consturct field , we can go for other field like the most happen scientist field where they tri onli for new thing rather than go for the know one . scientist alway think of invent about new thing . if they would have taught that they cant take risk in invent anyth which we had now then we couldnt get mani luxori and also diseas prevent medicin for mani hazard diseas which is usual harm to human . when we go for new thing then onli we get new thing in our day to day life which are becom part of our daili life now-a-day and also daili routin . henc in thi fast move world , success peopl should tri for new thing and should take the risk to becom more success , rather than stick of onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
