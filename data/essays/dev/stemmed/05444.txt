i do agre with the follow statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . it is a known fact that in today societi the word commun is not that usual anymor . it shourli doe still have a strong meanig in the villag or small town but if you look at bigger citi you will find most peopl live along without even know their neighbour name . especi the young peopl are not involv in the commun so actual give time to help their commun probabl doe not occur to them at all . one problem is deffinatli that young peopl alreadi grow into a societi that is doe not reali care about societi ani more . so they do not reali have a chanc to learn how to be part of a societi and that bee part of a societi , in thi case a communiti , also involv bee motiv to give someth back to it . of cours they are suppos to learn it at school but if the parent do not care than the children will keep it the same way . anoth problem is that young peopl often have a lot of other stuff on their mind . like go to town with friend or to a disco . work for your commun is not reali consid as `` cool '' and your friend might even start make fun of you if you start give your free time to help your commun . at last help your commun normali mean work for it as a volunt so you will not gain ani money for it . mani young peopl that want to financ their live or have a bit plu will invest their time do someth they will be paid for . all these reason show whi young peopl do not invest enough time into their commun . but it would be so import that they would do so . first of all your commun is not just a coupl of peopl live at the same pace on thi planet but it can be a wonderful social network that might help you in hard time . but if you want to be part of it you will have to get to know the peopl and be part of the team . that is onli possibl if you show that you are interest in your commun and reali tri to be part of it . commun also have a lot of financi problem . so they need volunt work for them so everybodi can keep the standard of live peopl now have . young peolpl tend to believ thing would just be given to them without think about the work behind it . if the peopl give time to their commun becom less thing will start to disapear . probabl young peopl than will wonder where the bu went drive kid to school or where the mall come from where there use to be a park . all these reason make it so import that young peopl start to learn how to be an activ part of commun and whi it is so import that they start give time to help their commun .
