nowaday , do you think young peopl give enough time to help their commun ? i can sure answer you , no ! but whi ? in my view , i think the young peopl spend all their time togeth with the comput , game , karaok , someth like that . i rememb that when i wa young , there have n't got ani gameboy , playstat , comput , my onli enterta when i finish my homework is to see the televis , swim , run or play the basketbal with my dad , veri seldomli my faher will bring me to my cusion 's home to play the tv-game . but now , the onli after school function of the young peopl is sit in front of the comput and chat with their friend , or somehow play the onlin game . becaus there are too mani funni thing on the internet . then how can they get extr time to help their commun ?
