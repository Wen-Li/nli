veri often , peopl who manag to succeed in life like to discov new thing , new area in which they can tri to succeed or master as well , all for the purpos of alway aim higher . the problem with thi approch , is that it involv take mani risk , and at the end these peopl could end up loos evryth , while they could have stick to what they alreadi knew . thi creat the problem of know if it is worth take the risk to tri new thing or if instead peopl should stay with what they alreadi posess . in my opinion , life is all about take risk , and discov new thing , so that our knowledg doe n't stay confin to what we alreadi are good at , but that inst , these limit extand and allow us to learn and to succeed at new thing . for exampl , if there were n't peopl will to tri to undertsand the anatomi of the human bodi , the progress in medecin would not have been so advanc as it is today . thi show that even if there are risk involv with gain knowledg and master an area , it is still someth that ha to be done in order to evolv . howev , there are some time when peopl who take risk end up regret it , wether becaus they did n't succeed in the other thing they tri to learn and lost what they alreadi possess , or becaus they did n't like what they learn while explor new area . if we take for exampl a man who own a show compani , and he decid to invest hi money in a new parfum compani , or in anoth random busi that doe n't relat to hi are of expertis , he may end up loss money if thi busi doe n't work well , or he may end up give up becaus thi busi is not fit for him . either way , thi man would have lost money and thi could even affect the busi in which he succeed . therefor , take these risk could definitli end up caus these peopl a lot of harm , if they werent prepar for it . in the end , it is all about bee lucki and hope for the best , becaus there is a lot of good thing that can come out of discov new thing , but there are also bad thing . but if i had to choos , i would probabl decid to take the risk , becaus the world would n't be were it is today without our will to discov and to master .
