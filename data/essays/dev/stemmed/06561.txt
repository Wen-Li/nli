i am agre with thi statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . young peopl are gener have great verv and energi . wherea , older peopl can not enjoy the life with such attitud . young peopl normal enjoy their life while do their mundan job . but old peopl will do their job by creat unwant stress around them . the health is wealth . if you are fit and fine then onli you can live your life in most hilari manner . but old peopl are often surround by such kind of ailment pertin to age , which restrict them to enjoy . i have great respect for my grand aunt who is inhabit of our street . i am watch her sinc i wa in 5th class . she wa veri activ and alert at that time . she had littl problem becaus of diabet , but she had overcom ani kind of stress and problem at that time . now , the candit had chang . most of time , she is not even abl to walk properli . she is suffer from such kind of ailment which are veri pain . whenev i watch her i can easili undestand the savour of young life . young peopl readili overcom most of the ailment becaus of proper physiolog function of their bodi . the other factor which make the old peopl lethag towad life is , `` pessim '' . old peopl do not prefer to work after age of 55 or 60 which caus these peopl sluggish and prone to variou dread diseas . young peopl alway ambiti about their career and goal which motiv them to enjoy life rather then to take as a burden . young peopl prefer to social and make friend with whom they can go to danc bar , hotel etc . old peopl like lonli . my grand aunt previous wa fond of parti and get togath . but now , she disdain such kind of crowd and prefer to live in disgruntel candit . young peopl emancip themselv from all kind of bondag and live life with vivaci attitud . in short , normal function of bodi and optimist attitud of young peopl make them so that they can enjoy their life .
