i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . for one exampl , when you think about busi , a compani ha to make new product or explor new techiniq to make differ from other compani . if the compani can do thi , it can apeal cutom the differ of there producut or sevic from other 's and it can profit itself monopolicali . for other exampl , when you think about a basebal team , everi player shoud tri new thing , becaus we do n't need same player so much . it make no senc to have nine power hitter . it make nosenc to have fast runner . to consitut a strong team , the import point is the balanc that can infer best outcom . so everi player have to get skill that are diferr from other 's and new . for last exampl , if you are an investor , it make no senc to invest like other . iif you want to have an advantag , you hav to invest differ . ofcaus i have to admit it is a riski action . you may get a loss sometim . so you have to recogn that there is a risk in invest differ from other . from these reason , i conclud that as long as recogn the risk of an action , we have to tri new thing and teke risk .
