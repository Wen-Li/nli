sinc car were invent the number of them circul ha been grow and grow along with the improv of technolog . for thi reason , i do not see whi in twenti year there could be fewer car than there are today . howev , one could say that car might be replac by other veri high tech mean of transport , but i think twenti year would not be enough to do so . in my opinion , which is also a wish , in twenti year there will be more car or as much as today , but mayb they will not pollut the enivron as they do today . in fact , a lot ha been alreadi done to reduc pollut and i am sure there is still much that can be done . for exampl , italian citi and other european citi are make european buy euro4 and euro5 car , which pollut way less than standard car . thi reduct ha been possibl thank to improv of car technolog . everi month around the world there are show room that present new kind of car , less and less pollut , more and more sofist in shape , motor and accessori . some of these new kind of car are veri expens , depend also on the brand , while some are cheaper . industri are do a lot for make peopl buy these car , from rich peopl to less fortun peopl . not onli industri and the most famou brand compani are act in favour of less pollut . in fact , govern are do a lot as well . for instanc , they organ mani inform campaign ; they defin calendar of day dure which peopl must not use car in the citi where pollut is over the maximum level permit and they financ electr pubblic transport . i think these are good reason to retain that car will not decreas in number for the next twenti year ; on the contrari it is common to expect them to be numer but less pollut than they are today .
