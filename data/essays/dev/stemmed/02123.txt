i do agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . advertis are produc to promot a product and to make it sell better . so what do we do if we want peopl to buy our product ? we tri to tell them that our product is the best choic on the market , which is mayb not true , but peopl need to believ it to chose our product . that is the reason whi mani advertis make to seem their product much better than they actual are . in our everi day live we are confront with mani exampl . my favourit exampl are the wash powder advertis on televis . would n't it be wonder to put your cloth in the wash machin and when take them out again , all the ugli stain are gone and the cloth look newer than befor ? i have tri sever time , but it just doe not work . so there the advertis definit make the wash powder much better than it is . anoth product which ha to be incred accord to advertis , are energi bar for sport . you do not onli get an unhuman power and condit , but the bar turn your outer appear into an athlet 's bodi . `` thi is much cheaper than the fit studio '' , i thought and tri . but again i wa disappoint . neither did my condit improv , nor did my bodi shape chang . disillus about advertis promis i resign , until recent , when i heard ovomaltin 's new public . the advertis of the chocol powder to flavour your milk , doe not claim to make you stronger , but more endur . it say : `` ovomalin - not better , but longer . '' so thi is the one and onli except i have seen in my life , where advertis doe not make a product seem much better than it is .
