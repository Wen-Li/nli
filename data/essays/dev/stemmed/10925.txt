i disagre on have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i feel that we should narrow down our choic of subject rather than increas the knowledg on all subject wide . we all studi for a better career and when we get out of the univers peopl ask for specif skill and we should be the best among our skill to get the job . if we start have a broad knowledg on mani academ subject instead of concentr on what your career exactli need we will loos the race in the job hunt . we all know the famou quot `` jack of all , king of none '' now that what would happen if we start gain knowledg on mani subject rather than one . we would no doubt increas our knowledg but unless we special on all of them it of no use . i would cite an exampl of myself , i alway want to be a softwar engin and there is heavi competit out in the market for softwar job . if i had not taken up softwar as my major in my univers i would not have made a job . no softwar industri want a person who know 10 subject but is not special in softwar . but at the same time i insist we should know a bit of other subject too for the sake of our gener knowledg and to live in thi world . in our school we read about everyth like math , scienc , geographi , histori , etc , . , and that enough for us to know on mani academ subject . onc we come out of school and join a univers we should start focuss on one particular area of intrest which would ultim give us satisfact and better career prospect . i would like to conclud by say that special on one subject is alway more fruit than learn about a lot of subject .
