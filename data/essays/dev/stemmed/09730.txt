the issu of whether one should have broad knowledg of mani subject or one should special in one specif subject ha arous heat debat in the modern era . advoc for the broad knowledg concept say that thi approach will help in widen the outlook of the person . contari to thi approcah , some peopl say that thi is the world of special and it is veri import to be a master in one subject to be success in life . i person feel that there should be a balanc between the two approch . i would present the pro and con of each of the approach and then illustr whi i emphas on the balanc approach . in today 's dynam world , it is imper for a person to have a broad knowledg of variou academ subject . thi will not onli help to acquir a broader perspect but also increas the effici in decis make of a person . say for exampl a market manag of a fast move consum good compani deicd to launch a promot campaign for a product . the knowledg about the financi issu relat to the campaign can be realli help in the decis make . if he doe not have knowleg about financ then he can make an expens plan which can be final reject due to the financi constraint of the compani . knowledg about other subject such as financ , strategi and human behaviour can help the manag in make better inform decis . thi exampl clearli show the import of have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . on the other hand , there is no denial to the fact that thi is a highli competit world . the most promin success peopl today are the one who are specialist in their respect field . a veri obviou exampl are the success doctor . not onli these doctor have to special in field such as dentistri , patholog etc. but also they have to acquir higher post graduat degre in the specialist field . veri few peopl today would prefer go to a gener doctor for their medic problem . i would support a balanc approach as i feel thi can make a person a balanc individu who ha enough broad perspect to make effect decis and is specialist in hi own field . if the market manag in the abov exampl is a person with broad knowledg about mani academ subject then he might find it difficult to devis a market strategi , which need core and in depth studi about market relat polici . similarli if he is just a typic market specialist , he may ignor other vital inform relat to differ subject and end up give a poor solut . if he take a balanc approach where he is a specialist in hi area but also know about other subject , he will make better decis and will succeed in life .
