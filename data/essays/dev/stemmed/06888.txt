in my point of view , i am diagre with the statement , and these are my reason . first of all , becaus of differ age , peopl enjoy their life in differ way , but it doe n't mean older peopl donnot enjoy life . for exampl , compar with younger coupl , instead of drunk and danc like mad . older coupl are like to go to travel togeth and to recal their honeymoon . even thoungh it look pretti bore for younger peopl , but those moment are signific in the older peopl 's life . so older peopl actual know how to enjoy their time more healthi and more meaning . second , there are lot of thing that older peopl can also enjoy , such as younger 's favor thing -- parti , club , and gem . older peopl like to go to somewher that more quiet than the parti room but they do enjoy danc with their lover and share their special beauti to the one who is import for them . and also they love to go to club to know more peopl and friend . for exampl , my grandmoth luse to go to parti and have fun with her friend . third , here is one thing that younger peopl can not undertand and enjoy but older peopl love -- garden work . younger peopl assum that garden work are onli for grandpar for their extra time . but actual it is not true , garden work is anoth way that show how much the older peopl enjoy life , becaus of time goe by veri fast , so the older peopl enjoy the moment that when their flower grew up , or their appl tree ha littl appl and so on . becaus they undertand the joy to creativ life and in order to enjoy life . therefor , in my opinion . older peopl know how to enjoy their life and even better than younger peopl . they wo n't do anyth damag for their heath , they wo n't do ani childish thing that bad for the commun . they have their live style that provid for better live standard and qualiti . so these are the reason whi i am disagre about the statement .
