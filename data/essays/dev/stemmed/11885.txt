i agre with thi statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . here are my reason : more and more peopl concern about the pollut problem of environ , and not onli govern decid to pass bill that can protect our natur environ , but also peopl reduc the damag to our environ . and car are one of vital damag to these pollut , becaus they releas carbon dioxid . if peopl reduc to drive car by themselv , instead , use the mass transport , the amount of carbon dioxid , which is a vital reseason that caus pollut can be elimin . so i think car will be fewer than today . second , citi are develop grauatedli , more and more citi will have their mass transport , such as mrt , train , or buse . these use develop can provid a more ecnom way to transport for citizen . in order to save money and priceless time , peopl will choos to use mass transport rather than drive car by themselv . for exampl , although mani teacher of mine have their own car , but they onli drive car by themselv in raini day . becaus the mrt in our citi provid a cheaper and comfort journey for us . and they do n't need to drive . in addit , the expenditur to maintain a car is veri big . for exampl , the expenditur of gasolin , the tax of car , etc . thi huge expenditur would effect the will of peopl have a car . final , crow traffic situat would also make peopl do not want drive car by themselv . and there is still a big problem to driver : find a park space is extrem hard . to sum up , the idea of environment protect , more convein mass transport , the expenditur of have a car , to avoid stuck in a traffic jam , worri about how to find a park space on time , all of these consider would make fewer and fewer peopl to plan to have their own car .
