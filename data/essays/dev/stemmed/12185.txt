like war and foreign polici also a big part of our futur depend on oil and fossil-resourc . there are two possibl in my opinion . the first one is that there will definitelti be fewer car in use than today . becaus there might not be enough oil to provid fuel for the million of car . but one ha to consid that the consequ is that not onli car are affect . one could easili say that a car is not that import . but if there is no fuel left for the car , there is either non for the bu , for a taxi , for the loanmow and for airplan . nobodi will go nowher . i person could take my bike and go to the groceri store , but what for ? there will be no possibl to do my groceri becaus the shelv will be empti . if there is no fuel for car , then there is no fuel for truck that take the groceri to the supermarket . and thi is onli the peak of the iceberg . there will be no product , no traffic and even today hightech might break down . i do not want to paint thi vision of the futur too black . there is anoth possibl . sinc we know that the whole traffic and one could even say the world is too depend on fossil resouc such as oil , we could chang that . there so mani sophist scientist who work on solut on how to gain energi . and they have result , like wind and sun al renew eneri resouc . we could alreadi reduc the need for oil , if we for examlp buz our veget from a farmer in our town . then less truck would be need . whatev we do we need to start chang our energy-wast habit now . then in twenti year there might be as mani car as today but they will run with non-fossil energi . but i do definit think that there will be less car that run by fuel in twenti year .
