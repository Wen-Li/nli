i agre that young peopl do not invest much time in help their commun . there are mani influenc on all peopl , so also on the young one , that are differ nowaday and in the past . these influenc chang peopl 's behaviour . in the past the person contact someon had wa within a rel small area and the depend on each other wa greater than today . therefor there wa more social commun and also young peopl did their part for the commun . nowaday the rang of peopl someon know is spread over a much bigger area so that there is not longer the close relationship to peopl in your nearbi commun . there are other factor that encourag young peopl to focu more on themslev than on other . in the whole societi there is the pressur of be success with everyth that someon is do . becaus these peopl need the time for be success there is none or onli littl time left to spend it for the commun . also , the interest move from care about the commun to care about oneself . mainli peopl follow just their own busi and do not care about other , wether they belong to the same commun or not . anoth reason may be that life is more anonym than it wa in the past . peopl do not know each other , even if they live in one hous , they might not have been met . if the peopl do not know their commun , whi and how should they care about them ? final i would like to consid the point of respons for rel and the money includ . in the past famili live togeth much closer than nowaday . peopl have anoth opinion of be respons . today they do not care that much anymor about their rel themselv , they rather care by spend money that someon take care about the famili member . there are mani influenc today that are differ in comparison to the past , that chang the willing of young peopl to help their commun .
