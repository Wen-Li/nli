i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are two reason to support my opinion . the first reason whi most advertis make product seem better is that the most import thing is to sell more product in term of the produc . in sell product , advertis are veri import becaus there are mani product of the same kind in the world today . in thi situat , attract advertis are indispens to compet with product from other compani . let 's take cell phone for an exampl . there are mani compani produc cell phone all over the world , and each compani also provid mani differ type . last year , i lost a cell phone and decid to buy a new one . i wa a t a loss as to what to buy , and i final bought one with the most attract advertis in a store . after i use it for a while , i easili found that it wa difficult for me to use it becaus of mani unnecessari accessori function . i usual use cell phone onli as a mobil telephon , and so i do not need a function of take a picyur . therefor , i realli found that it is import to discern the advertis more care . the second reason is that the produc partli believ that the real qualiti of the product are first known after mani peopl use them . in thi regard , produc are eager to sell the product in the first place . they consid the problem of the product after the consum claim to them . it is not realli a good attitud , but thi idea is also rampant and is deriv from the idea that sell product is the most import thing for produc as i metion in the first reason . howev , societi ha chang it regard of a recal movement , so thi attitud becom riskier and riskier in the develop countri . in summari , i agre with the opinion that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
