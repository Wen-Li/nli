as an old say goe , `` one man 's meat is anoth man 's poison . '' peopl 's opinion diverg from each other , not to mention on such statement : `` travel by ourselv and travel in a group led by a tour guid , which one is better ? '' some peopl prefer the fomer , but , i disgre . i prefer to travel in a group led by a guid becaus it realli ha a number of benifit that we can not deni . the first reason for my inclin is that travel in a group led by a tour guid can give me a more pround knowledg of my travel . no one could detail the histori of a new spot onli by your tour guid book . no one could speak out where is a more valuabl spot locat onli by your telphon . no one could know more senari by onli confin yourself on the map . howev , the tour guid can ! the second for my pepens is that travel in a group led by a tour guid can make you a connect to differ kind of peopl . i just took part in a travel in a group led by a tour guid , and i made friend which involv in it and what't more , until now i still keep in touch with one of them who is aslo a univers student like me . and she is in the same major as me , so it is a luck for me to have thi kind of tour and get so good a friend who ha the same person experi and emot concern as me ! last but not least , travel in a group led by a tour guid can make you safer and happier . if you visit by your self , who will help you when you get hurt ? if you visit by yourself , who will help you to go on your tour when you lose your way ? if you visit by yourself , who will talk with you when you feel faint dure your bu way ? nobodi . and thi is quiet differ from travel in a group where you can ask your tour guid and talk with other travel . all in all , travel in a group led by a tour guid is an advis choic with conspicu benifit . i prefer to it fulli . now , what i want to do is to make sure that everi one around me who like travel as much as me can reach all these benifit .
