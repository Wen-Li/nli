for lot of peopl , travel is one of the most enjoy experi . throughout the world , million of tourist travel everi year . some of those tourist travel independantli while other are led by tour guid . in my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid becaus by thi way i will be sure that i will visit the most interist place at the countri to which i travel . i rememb , for instanc , my first trip to egypt and how the tour guid insur me and the other group member seenig the most fascin archaeolog sight there . moreov , i believ that be led by a tour guid is more secur than explor a foriegn countri lone . howev , be led by a tour guid would not be a happi experi for a tourist who want to wonder around the real citi and discov the the other live side of a countri . furthermor , there are other method that can provid the same capabl of a tourist guid . for exampl , the book that includ use inform about the place that can be enjoy for tourist to visit , map and illustr book . anoth import raeson make me prefer travel with a group that be with a group of someon 's countri or clutur would make them feel more secur and safe rather than know no one . in conclus , i would prefer to guid by a local person who know more than me about his/her countri .
