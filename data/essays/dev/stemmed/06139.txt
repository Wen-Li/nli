an increas number of student realiz that it is more import for them to understand idea and concept , unfortun , there is a grow opposit among the other student , who maintain that learn fact is the most factor in their studi . howev , in the final analysi , i conclud that the former one doe make sens . in the follow discuss , i would like to present some point to support my statement . in the first place , the key point for my view is that understand idea and concept , undoubtli , which allow the student to cultiv their abil of self-studi is play the most role in their studi . actual , the final aim of the student studi in the univers is to promot their sens of think independ . for exam , in their begin studi , they need a teacher to guid them . but in their futur studi , they must deal with the problem by themselv . of cours , they need to practic their capabl to solv the problem when they understand idea and concept in class . in addit , the student can understand idea and concept by themselv to check out what they have learnd in the class . it is benefit for them to build up their self-confidenci . furthermor , it is the best way to supervis the student . if they ca n't understand and concept , they would fail the exam at last . given the reason abov , which sometim intertwin to form a organ whole and thu becom more persuas , and we can arriv at the conclus that inspir the student to master the abil of understand idea and concept in the class must be undertaken by the teacher . onli by thi way can we implement the qutity-educ ; onli by thi way can we enhanc the self-confid of the student and onli by thi way can we supervis student ' studi in an effici way .
