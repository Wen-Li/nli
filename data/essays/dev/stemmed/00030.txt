i agre with thi statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . success peopl are those who keep on do experi to make exist thing less complic and they are the one who develop new thing . for exampl in earlyman 's time peopl use to do travel by cart . but nowaday we are abl to travel oversea . we use car , aeroplan , helicopt . if man had n't tri new thing or man had n't use hi innov mind , he would n't been abl to design new and fastest way of transport . moreov for success take risk and do new thing is necessari . for exampl in my famili my mother is a hous wife , my grandmoth wa also a housewif . but i want to be a scientist , so i am go against our convent rule and regul . i am tri new thing which in our famili nobodi ha tri like i am plan to go abroad to get a doctor degre as my countri is a develod one . so , i person believ in the abov statement . we should alway tri new thing and should give innov thing to thi world . make new technolog by take risk is they key to success . for exampl if nobodi had tri go to moon , we wont be abl to explor and know how doe moon look and what are the properti of moon . but sometim tri new thing can be danger too . for exampl `` kalpana chawla '' famou astronaut of nasa , die when her spacecraft wa come back to the earth after do some valuabl discoveri . but in the long run `` success goe to those peopl who keep on tri new thing instead of stick to old thing '' .
