although the basic concept of advertis is itself to promot a product or a servic , i do agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they actual are . advertis for product is essenti the process use to convinc potenti buyer that the product in question is fit and suitabl and the best in the market . howev most advertis blow thi definit complet out of propot by market a product which end up be radic differ when final use . the degre of exagger use in advertis to convinc the buyer is at time ridicul . advertis in the fast move consum good domain especi strictli adher to the polici of display a complet wrong imag of the product which make them seem much better than they actual are . an exampl that come to mind is a commerci for a lead shampoo product which claim to not onli put hair back on the head of of it bald user but also rejuven them to the extent that they will be abl to compet with the best driver in the world on a formula one car race track . advertis in variou other sector also mislead user to believ that the product will offer qualiti that it wa never design to provid in the first place . although one of the sell point of a good advertis is in some case to provid a ting of humor to go with the product , certain advertis and brand use thi to the extent that make their product seem too good to be true . variou mail order catalog for exercis system are also anoth a clear exampl of how the end product differ vastli from the advertis one especi in today 's wolrd where common opinion ha it that media over power print , peopl look to advertis especi on televis , to help them make inform choic about which product suit their need better . thi depend may not be larg when it come to everyday product , but in case of product which are highli expens and involv larg invest , some advertis can often mislead peopl 's desicion . an exampl to illustr thi are the advertis for real estat project or financ and tax save instrument and more recent even in job search portal . some of the advertis have caus peopl to make incorrect decis due to their assur but unrealist claim . all in all , my belief is that advertis should help peopl make inform choic and should make peopl awar of the product . a certain degre of humor and make believ is alright but the core function of the product itself should not be made a fantasi as is the case with mani of the advertis in today world . i therefor ardent agre with the fact that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
