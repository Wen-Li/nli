i do not agre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . the reason be special studi in one subject provid an indepth understand of the subject . it is critic for research and innov . it also help to make a posit contribut toward societ develop . most modern day innov can be attribut to indepth studi and research . for exampl , the develop in telecommun could not have happen but for the innov in fibr optic . these develop have revolution modern commun . distanc no longer matter . life ha becom more easi . in depth studi in manag are critic in find solut to an ever grow and complex world . so , by pursu indepth studi in a specif subject one could contribut meaning and effect to the develop of the world . it is easi to dabbl in mani subject . but seriou studi is critic for success . no doubt read vari subject help broaden one 's think . but , one could gather basic knowledg and inform about other subject without much effort . in thi age of inform and technolog revolut one can have easi access to inform . further , we do not live in isol in a societi . so social exchang and interact would help build our inform and knowledg base on other subject . the modern world is driven by technolog and scienc . in thi modern world one could contribut more meanin if one is focus and doe an indepth studi . even a social scientist need to do more indepth studi to contribut meaning .
