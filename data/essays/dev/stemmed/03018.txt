car are of vital import for everyon 's life . today , we can not imagin a situat without car . even if we do not have one ourselv , other peopl util them to make our live easier - be it a transport bring food to the supermarket or the car that bring us to the hospit in case of a sever accid . in my opinion , we need car and the populatoin in our countri know that . thi is the reason whi i think that the number of car will not diminish in the next 20 year . there are a myriad of argument for and against the use of car : the major argument against car is certainli the pollut of our environ . and it is true - car , as we know them today , need certain natur resourc and do pollut our environ to a certain degre . if thi is alway true , there will probabl be fewer car in use in 20 year that there are today . at some point in time , peopl would recogn the harm of car and would definit tri to reduc the number of car to protect the environ . but thi may not be a realist case : i am of the opinion , that our scientist get smarter and smarter . until today , they alreadi invent hybrid engin and engin that are onli run by solar energi or plant oil . today , those invent can not replac car that need gaz to produc power , becaus scientist are still tri to get more out of the new found . but consid the time the gaz engin need to be as perfect as we know today : it took long year for the car industri to be abl to produc those engin . given thi evolut , it is possibl and veri realist that our scientist will make a huge contribut to the improv of the ` new ' engin in the next 20 year . even if 20 year might be too short to develop a car that doe not pollut the environ at all , i think that the scientist are on a good way to find an engin that drastic reduc the pollut . and after anoth 20 year , we might alreadi use car that do not need ani natur resourc like gaz . if thi is the case , everyon will recogn the outstand advantag of car , so that the number of car will rather increas .
