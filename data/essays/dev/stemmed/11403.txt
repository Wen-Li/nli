educ is ongo for our entir life . in addit , it is commonli known that educ at school is one of the most import part of continu educ of life . i am total agre with the statement that is `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact `` with two reason . my first reason come from the fact that is it is imposs to give all idea and inform at school . that is , becaus of the limit time , you can not teach everi thing to student at school . that 's whi , student must be provid to understand idea and concept . for exampl , last year i took a mathemat class and we discuss about theori of a certain subject . there were plenti of theori to studi but the class wa onc per week for a semest . the professor provid us to understand the subject complet , afterward , we could handl other theori by ourselv . my second reason is that we educ at school to have some idea to practis into our life after school . if we understand idea and concept at school , we can have a chang to appli them into the rest of our life . henc all inform and idea can be valu to worth our time that is spend at school . to give a specif exampl , i am a profession femal now , and last week i met a reali complex problem at work . a studi at univers with my mathemat project help me surprisingli . becaus that time , i realli understood the idea in the project . i also felt that i wa not regret for the time that i spend at univers . to sum up , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact to give a hand to them for their futur . final it must the main point for educ at school . t
