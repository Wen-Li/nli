i do not agre with thi statement , car have been the most effect tool of tranport for half a centuri . i do n't think tool , such as airplan , ship , or ani other can easili replac car in twenti year . car nowaday need petrol as feul , thi ha becom a great problem becaus the amount of petrol we can gain access to is limit on out planet . lot of scientist say that as long as we do n't find other effect fuel for car , we would n't be abl to drive in a few decad . howev , corpor such as toyota , ford , hyundai and mani other have develop their technolog to use hydrogen and electr as the main power sourc of car . theas car do not requir petrol , and therefor we will not need to find a substitut for car in twenti year . the world ha grown rapidli dure the past centuri . citi expand it size and popul saw growth in most citi . thi growth brought new need to peopl , a fast and cheap transport . citi have grown enorm , place that we can go in 30 minut by car would take us a few hour or more on foot . car have becom a necessari element in modern societi . the world is keep grow , citi are becom even larger , and popul is still grow , especi in india and china . the growth the world will see in twenti year will bring more and more need for car . also , car will becom cheaper over time , as it did for the past decad , and it will allow peopl that could n't afford car to buy them , car will becom more necessari over time . dure the growth in the past few decad , our citi have develop in a way which it can allow car to transport most effici . car were allway taken into consider , we have road , underground passg , bridg , park lot , and all kind of system for car . thi system ha lay it root deepli into our citi , and unless we chang thi whole system dure the next twenti year in our citi , car will still be the most effici way of transport , and peopl will not stop use them . car have been by our side for half a centuri , it ha made transport much easier and faster , and it is also becom cheaper , which allow more peopl to afford them . as long as there are n't huge chang , or as long as we do n't creat a more effect tool than car , car will still be in use around the whole world twenti year later .
