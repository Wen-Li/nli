in my opinion , there could be great success for peopl who have inclin to do differ from other . although some might say the such peopl tend to have failur becaus of the high risk , i think that most of them have success in term of their person acheiv . i prefer the idea that peopl should tri to do best within their abil and resourc . and , even if they fail , i think they have had their own success . thi success mean that break the own limit could be happi for peopl . for exampl , there wa a man , who quit a big compani and start a small coffe shop . even though he wa so enthusiast to make the shop profit , he eventu went bankrupt . i saw , howev , in some magazin which cover hi faliur stori , the man said he felt so happi becaus i could know my limit . i think that know own limit could be success sinc it could be help for peopl to have good life in their futur . and , it could be too much easi to do what other can do easili . in thi circumst , even though peopl can have some profit , i can not say it is success . for instanc , after henri ford introduc a commerci car for ordinari peopl , mani car maker tri to follow to jump in the car industri . neverthless , they were just follow . they did just what ford did . while some car maker still make great profit , in my opinion , they are not truli succ . they imit what the great man did . of cours , the follow can have great success . they can reduc cost and attract consum a lot . they might be some kind of success peopl . i think , howev , the trueli succes peopl are the peopl who did new thing and take high risk .
