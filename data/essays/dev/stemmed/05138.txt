i do n't think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i would say that they might convey that kind of illus becaus they can take more benefit from the life than older peopl do but it doe n't mean that they enjoy life more . first of all , i would say that young peopl want to discov the world befor all . inde , the older peopl are awar of the world which is surround them . they have alreadi experienc most of the feel a person can undergo or simpli feel . the young peopl want absolut to tri new thing , to experi other feel . on the other hand , they are actual younger , that 's true . so they can take profit of everyth , do some veri physic sport that an older person could n't do , they also are faster . everyth ha to be quick , it 's becaus we want to discov other thing . i take part to that phenomenon , i 'm young but nevertheless i do n't think that i enjoy life more than my parent . they take profit of the life in a differ way . as an exampl , they travel , that i ca n't do on my own becaus i 'm financi depend to my parent . so i do other thing , i do outing with my friend , i do as everi adolesc doe . howev , thi speed with which we execut our activ may lead to a missunderstand of the situat . except the old peopl who ca n't do almost anyth becaus they are too old , and the depress person who are n't feel in do activ , all the peopl enjoy life the same way . the reason is that we 've got onli one life and it would be without interest to spend that life in do anyth . as a conclus , i would say that i disagre with the statement of the issu and i think t everybodi enjoy the life
