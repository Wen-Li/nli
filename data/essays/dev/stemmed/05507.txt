we often hear peopl say that young peopl should enjoy life as long as they still can . therefor , it is sort of commonli accept that older peopl are not enjoy their live , or at least less than the younger peopl . we will discuss both side of thi statement , and will express our final point of view as a conclus . young peopl have less respons than older one : older peopl are respons of younger one ! as an exampl , it is rare to see parent buy firecrack to make a joke to their neighbour wherea it is clich for youngster to do so . young peopl do n't have to work as to make their famili live ; they attend class and have a lot of activ ; they are young and they enjoy themselv , becaus they simpli have less respons . but thi is a youngster point of view . do older peopl realli enjoy their life less than younger peopl ? obvious not . for exampl , have a famili and give birth to an offspr is enjoy , perhap the most enjoy thing in the world ! if older peopl enjoy their live less than younger one , our world would be a veri sad world . .. thu , some young peopl do not enjoy there life , and some old peopl obvious do . the statement ca n't be true becaus of thi simpl fact . honestli , if older peopl did n't enjoy themselv as much as younger one , would it be worth to live thi ? obvious if life is not enjoy , then life lose it primari purpos , and live thi life would be purposeless . i think the statement is a young peopl point of view , and is not realli well thought . at first , we feel it is true , but in fact it is becaus what we think is enjoy or not chang when we get older ! love to read poetri at the age of 13 is rare , but at the age of 65 it can be fulli appreci and understood , becaus the person ha more experi and can catch the sens of it . i think that how we enjoy ourselv is differ , but no one enjoy him or herself more than someon , base on hi age . enjoy life is univers , and ha no age . young peopl enjoy life as much as older peopl do , and vice-versa .
