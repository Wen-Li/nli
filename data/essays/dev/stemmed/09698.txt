to my mind , it is not possibl to gener say whether young or old peopl enjoy life more ; i think one can enjoy life at ani age , it depend on the age in which way one enjoy it . be young as well as be old have both neg and posit aspect . of cours younger peopl have the great advantag of be physic more abl than older peopl , thi way they have more possibl to enjoy life by play sport . but usual , they do not have much time to realiz that sinc they are busi with school or job . older peopl , when they are alreadi retir , have a lot of time to do all those thing they have not had time for yet , for exampl read literatur or even begin studi , as for exampl an old teacher of mine who start studi philosophi after he left school . becaus of their mani experi , it is also easier for old peopl to deal with problem while young peopl are often discourag and feel insecur about the futur . old peopl alreadi live through mani thing , they do not have to worri about find a job or a partner ani more . while young peopl often have problem with their famili , old peopl alreadi have their own and can spend nice time with them . the greatest problem of be old are certainli the mani ill . it is much more danger for old peopl to walk outsid if it is cold , they might get pneumonia while young peopl remain healthi and could slip on the ice and brake a leg while their grandchildren are abl to fall without hurt themselv . in addit , it is veri sad to be old when one 's friend , or one 's partner , becom older , too , and die one by one . my grandfath becam 93 year old and had not had friend for the last ten year of hi life , which seem incred to me . final , a young person still ha all hi life befor him ; an old one expect the death to come soon . both can be posit or neg , it depend on the specif person 's situat . on the whole , i think it is possibl to enjoy one 's life at ani age , it just matter what one make out of it .
