i disagre with thi opinion that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i will rais the reason in follow passag . first , as one of the japanes , and one citizen of the develop countri , i think there are possibl that the number of the car in use will be reduc , becaus particulari in citi , the person can transport easili without a car thank to the sophist of the network among train , subway , and bu . and i think in the part of suburban also develop the similari method to transport like citi . but what i want to say here is that the opinion i mention now is too micro to think global . second , i think we must think more worldwid . in the earth , there are mani countri want to be more develop . in these countri , i think that the number of car in use is increas . the reason whi the develop countri will use more car in futur is that , to develop the countri econom capacitiy , the need of car will increas to transpor mani good to commeres . i think the transpor abilitiy ha a signific meanig to these countri . in conclus , to think world develop , i think disagre with the opinion .
