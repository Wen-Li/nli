i agre with the idea the `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . '' for exampl , my mother often talk me about when she wa young . she talk about the relationship between the commun she live and her . accord to her stori , the commun provid a lot of festiv for loxcal children and elder peopl . for exampl , cherri blllosom festiv in spring , fire work in summer . they held a moon festiv in fall and the new year day in finter thr shrine in the commun made rice cake with the local peopl . everi case of those the event in the commun , the young local peopl went to help to prepar and the clean up after ward . those experi help the young peopl to knoe the local peopl and to build up good relationship between anoth peopl . so , mani young peopl want to help the hold event again and help it , the circul hold the opprtun and the good reletionship of the commun will be made up . thi is a stori when my mother wa young . then , how about today ? think about when iwa littl kid , i did not have such opportun to join the local event so mani time . becaus the plase i live is kind of old and there are not so mani young peopl to help those event . also , actual i do not have so mani famili peopl in my commun , the relationship of our commun is not so good if we compar to the one of mani year ago . also , when i wa junior high scool student , i joind such mani kind of volunt work , but i did not have so mani opportunit to help my own commun . as long as i ememb , everi time i do volunt work , i went anoth commun which offer to help them . i mean , nowaday , there are less opprtun for young peopl to searv for commun . also the other reason i think recent young peopl do not help the comun is that there no goiod relationship among the commun .
