`` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' travel is realli import to my life . travel can show us a lot of thing and make us learn about a lot of cultur . travel in a group can certainli make the trip fun and nicer . in my opinion , a group doe not need a guid to help him . discov and take risk , in a group , of get lost is fun and is an unforgotten memori . travel in a group is alway part of my vacat . last summer for exempl , i travel with my friend to spain to discov the countri and to get to see a new cultur . there when we arriv , we did n't have ani guid . so we take a taxi , gave him the adress of the hotel and he dop us in the right place . after we deposit our bag in our room , and talk to one of the employe , we went to the rester he talk us about and had so much fun . on our waybak , we got lost in the citi and could n't find the hotel . after three hour of walk and the help of the other , we arriv to the hotel and sleep . what is interest , is , when i talk to my friend about how we got lost and how scare we were , they laugh and they dream if these day can come back . so we can think that travel in a group with no guid and get lost , is an entertain part of the trip . anoth reason whi peopl doe n't need a guid anymor . becaus of the internet and the easi way to know the place where we want to go . when my famili organis a trip to a countri or anywher , they take and do everyth on the internet , includ the address . also with the flourish of the technolog , we have the gp that can locat our place if we are lost . in the end , travel with a guid is not necessarli the best way to travel . there is a lot of other way that can be enjoy .
