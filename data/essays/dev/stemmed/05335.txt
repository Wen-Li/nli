i agre with the follow statement . in my oppinion success peopl are success onli becaus , at one point of their life they were face with a chaleng and they had to take a risk in order to succeed . peopl that onli stick to what they are good at will onli be ` good ' yet they will not succeed if they do not take risk and face new challeng . tri new thing , idea , and be abl to overcom new challeng is what defin a succes person in my opinion . for exampl , if a person is quit gift at a certain sport and is consid talent , it is still not enough for him to be ` labeld ' as success . thi person will have to test hi abil against other peopl , tri improv these abil , and risk injuri or loss , and improv even more in order to move forward and becom success . if thi person did not risk lose to peopl better than him and overcom them , he would never know how good he actual is . anoth exampl could be open a new busi . if a businessman doe not risk lose some of hi money while start the busi , he would not be abl to make-up for hi loss and gain even more money . not onli is it import for a person to face new chaleng to imporv on himself , but it is also import to proceed forward , and see hi level compar to other peopl or ani other competit around him . face new challeng , and take risk is the onli way a person would be abl to succeed in life overal . talent is import yet it 's not the onli factor toward success . all the famou athlet , busi men , superstar , etc. have face mani challeng and were abl to overcom them regardless of how talent they were , and that 's what make them success .
