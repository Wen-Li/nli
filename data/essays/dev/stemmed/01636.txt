dure almost 18 year , i studi mani cours and i know the best way to learn . so what i am sure about : the idea is the most import thing to understand than the fact . i will explain thi in two gener part : the first part will be about the idea that a fact is one exampl of the idea ; and the second one will deal with the fact that we can easier an idea than a fact . so first , it is obviou that the idea is most import thing to understand becaus the fact are just some case of the main idea . usual , dure the class , the teacher tri to explain us an exampl which permit to understand the idea . for exampl , to better understand the idea that peopl is calm when they listen music , it 's to give the exampl that in mani medic room , we can hear some classic or jazz music . but it is not the point expect to learn . thu , thi is someth we can use to better understand someth els . when we tri to make our own opinion , we use the idea memoris to think . in thi import case , we can see whi it is so more import to learn the idea than the fact . if we continu with our previou exampl , what do we think about the import of music in the world ? to answer , we could select the idea that music calm peopl and we could use it to conclud that without music , there will might be more war in the world , and so , most of the popul of the earth will be sad . it is in thi way i see the import of the idea . as i prove in thi respons , to better learn , we have to more concentr on the idea than on the fact . but the fact are need to understand the idea . so , in the perfect case , we would care about idea as well as fact .
