in my definit the enjoy of life is live life to it fullest . and thu , i believ that young peopl enjoy more life than older peopl . there are variou point with me to discuss thi issu . firstli , young peopl are mobil . in other word , they are young mind , young blood with dynam energi . if some one is mobil he can reach ani where to satisfi hi need to live life and make it at it full wihtout ani compromis . wherea older are at the age at which they have atleast one problem , which make them immobil . at thi age they are out of energi and liabl to have atleast one health problem , make them to stay at home and depend . secondli , young peopl are do atleast one task like studi , job etc. and thi make them to come in touch with lot of peopl and new friend . thi give them the opportun to make new friend , with whom they can enjoy life by week end , long drive etc. on ohter hand the older are handicap in thi regard . sinc they are compromis through health . which make them to seat at home and alon with hi health . so , no health , no go out , no friend and no enjoy of life . moreov , in other word young peopl are twenti first centuri peopl . young peopl util all the latest technolog by gain it knowledg though the reliabl sourc , sinc they are intellignet enough to utilis it and convert it in to the new sourc on enjoy of life . on other hand the older peopl still have the older mind setup which is out date enough for the enjoy of life . in conclus , the younger peopl do have the enough energi , chanc to make friend and adequ knowledg to live life at it fullest , which older lack in .
