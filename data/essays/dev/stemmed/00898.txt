i agre to the statement accord to my experi and to what i have seen in the past and present and can predict the futur sole through my reason . the fact that car bring major pollut , are ineffici , and car need oil to be use are instrument that i agre to the propos statement . most importantli , car have signific detriment effect to the natur environ around us , and therefor explain that , in the futur there will be a decreas in the number of car . first of all , the exhaust creat from car have pollut the air that we breath , sometim stimul diseas to infant , children , adult and mani other peopl . given that the natur environ is a resourc that peopl all valu and desir to protect , make it clear that car will be less use when peopl have seen or will see the dramat and harm effect car have on the earth 's atmospher and to overal human health . on the other hand , car , in the first place , need oil to be access by a consum , therefor car would be ineffici in the futur . oil , current is a veri delic and priceless resourc current at thi time of the 21th millenium . sinc oil price are increas at an alarm rate , peopl may not have access to oil or petroleum in the near futur . therefor it is obviou that oil is not a natur resourc that can be renew fast enough to sustain it amount when human are ` over-exploit ' it resourc . as a result , it can be confirm that at thi rate of the consumpt of natur ga or oil , how will we be sure that there would be enough resourc for car to run , in the next 20 year ? lastli , from the experi that i have seen is that govern are truli tri to decreas the number of car for critic reason . car may be convieni to the individu that use it , but it ha number detriment effect that govern and the public have to deal with and clean up . therefor , everi year govern use a larg percentag of their budget to pay up the car expens . expens such as , pollut , car manag , car accid and mani more . becaus of such expens , govern are reinforc public transport , such as railway , buse , and subway and is suggest as substitut for car becaus it is much for cost effici as well as convieni for it user at the sametim . from my belief and opinion i agre to the specifi statement , given that car creat major pollut , are ineffici , and costli .
