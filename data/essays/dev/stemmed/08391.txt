it is a veri common idea among young peopl that they are more enjoy life than older peopl , especi their parent ! but are you happi onli when you have fun ? i do no think so . i beliv that at each stage of your exist you `` enjoy life '' in a differ way . first , when you are young , you have no child . one can consid that , as he ha no constraint such as feed hi offspr , he is more enjoy life . but i think that i will be deepli happi when my child will grow up and becom an autonom human be . at that that time , despit all the constraint , i think that i will `` enjoy life '' . in addit when you are young , even if your entertain yourself play tenni for exampl , you can not do everyth you want . you have to respect your parent rule . be an adult allow you to choos your activ and experi new leisur . for exampl my mother use to prevent me from swime becaus she wa afraid of water . i discov thi sport quit late but now i realli enjoy it . moreov , when you are older , you start appreci new activ . when i wa young i found highli bizzar the idea of watch paint for hour . but now i am fond of art exhibit ! in the meantim i learn to enjoy life in a differ manner . be older also enabl to have a profession life . you can manag to reach great achiev and be financi reward for it . when i receiv my first incom , i wa realli happi ! the idea of make money just use my brain still thrill me . it is a way of enjoy life that i never thought about when i wa in my earli age . in a nutshel i think that be happi and enjoy life is not a matter of age . it is more an abil to enjoy the best moment and learn from the worst . i hope be hppi with such a philosophi of life !
