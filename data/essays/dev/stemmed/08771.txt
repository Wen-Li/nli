although some peopl , perhap market major , may argu that a product consist both of it physic form and of the good advertis that present it , even if they are not so correct , i do not agre at all with thi view . in my opinion , a product must be judg as good and , of cours bought , accord to it qualiti and advertis should be base on the qualiti of the product and should not make the product seem better than it realli is . the main concern of thi market habit is that low qualiti product are actual invad the market and the consum can not distinguish between a good item and an item which is onli well present . furthermor , in spite of it low qualiti , a product of the latter kind is often much more expens . as an exampl we can take timberland shoe . in my countri i see a lot of peopl buy them onli becaus they have been influenc by the advertis . moreov , the shoe with that brand cost nearli three time the price of a high qualiti pair of shoe you can usual find in a shop , the differ between the two is the mislead advertis . howev , i do not mean that timberland shoe are a low qualiti product , but of cours , the sole differ between these and the one that are not present in the same way , is the price . i could also have brought more meaning exampl but the problem would remain the same , we should care more about qualiti and the quality-pric ratio .
