some peopl tri to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , while other wish to special in one specif subject . i believ it is more prefer to first have vast knowledg . first , knowledg is good for my children . if i have more knowledg , i will be abl to educ my children better . my father use to teach me thing that i did not learn at school . for exampl , my school did not teach whi water is form around a glass of cold water . i wa alway curiou about it , and it wa my fater who told me the answer . as my father taught me , i want to do the same thing to my children . in addit , the chanc of get a job increas . let 's say that i took geometri , biolog , and psycholog in colleg . although i did not special in one subject , i still have a lot of inform in each subject . i can be a math teacher , a worker in biolog museum , or a guidanc counselor at middl school . what will happen if i special onli in geometri ? onc i can not be a geometri teacher , i will have noth to do , but just wait . final , i can pick a subject and special in it later . i will experi and evalu the subject while i learn mani subject . after the educ , i will have a pretti good idea which subject fit my interest . use the same exampl as befor , let 's assum that i becam veri interest in biolog . peopl say there is no end to learn ; i will not hesit to take biolog again and go deeper into it . in conclus , i think learn a varieti of subject is import , becaus it allow me to teach my children , get a job , and special in subject that is suitabl for me .
