today is an era of compititon and for surviv in thi competit age man ha found variou trend . public is one of the trend man use to increas the popular of hi product . so i m kind of disagre with the statement that `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . '' now a day we get to see big celebr like tv and film actor and actress and even sport person flash everi now and then on the televis endors a product or in a news paper . . pepol may fall for these trap and can end up havin a product which is actual not worth of those huge amount if not inspect properli . i cant deni the fact that , sometim in compet with the similar brand these advertis do show some fals statement and just becaus peopl trust these brand ambassedor blindli , end up buy that product . so that whi i dont complet disagre with the abov statement . but at the same time in my opinion , viewer should see these advertis vigilantli and befor buy them they shuld examin the product and check out the valid of the statement and claim made in those commerci . it is the duti of the custom to keep in mind that there are some agenc who overr their own product to improv the sale . also , in a countri like india there is a govern bodi call `` iso '' which check the authent of product and after seri of close inspect give them the author to be sold in the market . so with such author lik `` iso '' overr a product and advertis is not easili possibl . advertisemnt help the viewer to discrimin the good and bad qualiti of the product by compar it with other similar brand . it also creat awar in the mind of custom about the newer and technolog advanc product . so in conclus , keep in mind the advantag of advertis we cant make a generalis statement that product are made to seem better than they realli are . it is as a `` custom '' our job to check the authent of such product .
