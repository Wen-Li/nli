i agre with the comment that the yonger peopl now a day do not give enough time for help their commun . thi could be a result of mani reason . help the commun is a part of everi person duti . in improv their commun they would tend to improv their surround and their qualiti of live . for exampl , if there is a need for some good social worker for their commun they would not have much of their intrest in such a kind of aspect becaus they are busi with their work tension . they would rather spend their time enjoy in some play groud or a film theater rather in do some social work for their commun . the younger gener now a day would prefer to stay out of halp their commun to develop becaus they are intrest in some other aspect . they would less concentr on halp their commun becaus some ego feel which their fellow collegu would never do . they are veri busi with their academ career that they do not have much time left for help commun . it would not be the problem of the educ institut for have such a tight schedul of academ . but it would be the sheer intrest of the younger peopl to have the commun . it would be their personnel intrest for help the commun . like wise there are veri few younger peopl who would rather show some intrest in help commun . it would be the older peopl who would like to help more rather than the younger peopl becaus they have no work tension . it would be rather correct to say they have much less work tension rather than the younger peopl . so they would sure have some advantag over the younger peopl in help their commun . in conclus , i would like to say that the younger peopl have veri much less time for help the commun when compar to the older peopl . it would help the commun grow faster if the younger peopl show some intrest in their commun becaus they are much more energet and enthusiast then the older peopl .
