nowaday peopl are live in a mix world with all kind of gener and where the commun grow faster . how help your communauti with the time you have ??? fisrt of all , in my opinion , i am a student of twenti year old , and i would say that in your evderydaylif , you never find anought time for all you want to do . as far as i am concern , i would say that give time for other peopl , or be investig in an activ requier to you a lot of human qualityand a strong engag . it might not be easi to help our communauti when you have responsibilti at work , at home , with children . in order to manag a good way of live we have to make choic at ani time dure our own life . secondli , we can consider the problem with a differ point of view . if you are live in a huge town it will be more difficult to help communauti than live in the countri . thank to there small villag in the countri , everybodi know everybodi . the fact of the densif of the popuat , it 's easier and faster to make link and creat central meet . obvious , the communauti will grow up with help younger . i do n't realli agre with the fact that young peopl do not give enough time to the communauti . for exampl , sometim in your job , the director ask to you hight resposabil , even if you did'nt choic you have to control and help your compani . but what we forget it is the fact that it it probabl for the biolog research , and htne the communauti progress . to believ that young peolpl are not enought help with the communauti will be wrong , their behavior is differ . they stay investig in thi huge world .
