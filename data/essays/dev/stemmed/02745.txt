i 'm not so sure that is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i think that thi statement is quit gener and incomplet . if it is refer to histor studi , it could be accett . for exampl , it is more import for a student tho understand whi the world war had occur than the specif fact and date link to war 's histori . and thi exampl could extend to the gener comprenshion of the actual world 's polit situat . but without know fact it 's difficult to make a person idea on an argoument . if we take for exampl scientif field we have to refus thi statement , it 's imposs to discuss about a scientif idea without know the specif fact ( rule , law , properti ) connect to thi idea . so , my person opinion is that there is n't a divis between fact and concept , they are strongli connect . ( here we could open a philosoph discuss about fact and judment in kant 's theori ) i suggest to the other student to make sure to know veri well a fact befor give an opinion , and to investig a fact befor accept other 's opinion . thi problem involv the etern problem of the histor fount : scholar have to believ in histor narrat whithout the real possibl to control themselv the trueli of a fact on the contrari , the figur of the critic should be an exampl of a person who can see and studi a fact and than give hi opinion about that fact . so , in order to give a correct and credibl opinion about someth , is veri veri import to studi the fact themselv .
