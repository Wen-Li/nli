i agre with thi statement becaus i think that a person who ha a differ special can be help in hi / he profession carrer . in fact we can understand how difficult is to found a job and for thi reason i think that a person who is abl to do a lot of thing ha some facilit . economi and work want that a person is a good worker , with differ experi . as the matter of fact my opinion is n't correct , in fact i undestand that it is import also that a person is abl to do his/her work in a good way and thi is possibl also if that person is special in a particular field . for all these reason i think that it is import to have differ special when a person is look for a job , but , when he/sh found it , she/h must special in his/her own work . sometim it is not request a licenc in a particular field . a simpl cours can help you to found a job . so i think that it is import to know differ subject , but thi know ha import if it is special .
