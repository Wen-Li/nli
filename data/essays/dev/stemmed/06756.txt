in my opinion , thi is a veri strong statement and i can not total agre with it in the way in which it is current phrase . as a first gener point , i think that similar statement can never hold absolut true or fals , so befor discuss the merit of my opinion , i would like to narrow down the reach of the statement by specifi a particular geograph or cultur set that we are refer to when talk about young peopl and their commun . i will therefor take my home countri as a refer . commun face constant chang as societi as a whole chang , and most of these chang result into challeng and demand impos over individu of all age . in particular , the begin of the 21st centuri ha seen a macroconomi revolut in term of the labour market - in particular highli specialis and train labour - and inform technolog resourc . extens outsourc of certain servic to asian countri and move big part of the manufactur industri to the far east caus mani young peopl to be unemploy in europ , and in my home countri too , as a result . where onc commun use to be wealthi and secur employ could guarante social welfar and enough free time for everyon to spend with their famili or in social activ , now the younger gener face difficulti in earn enough to mantain thei usual standard of live . i agre that they spend less time help out their commun , and therefor , it is understand that they will have to dedic a lot of time to job hunt or even engag into a second and a third occup , and will have no time or energi to spend on help the commun they live in . well organis activ such as particip into chariti work , or more spontan and ` privat ' one such as care for an elderli member of the famili or a disabl neighbour will eventu have to be put asid by those young who face econom difficulti , and will onli be pursu by the luckiest individu who do not have to worri about earn enough to feed themselv and their children .
