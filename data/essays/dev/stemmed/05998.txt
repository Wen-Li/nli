i disagre wtih that to understand idea and concept is import for student . there are two reason ; step of studi and correct idea . the first reason is that it is neccessay to learn basic knowleg for understand idea and concept . if student are lack of basic knowleg , they can not understand all of it . for exampl , student in japanes univers primali learn basic fact . then , they begin to studi applic one . it is deriv the evid dure long educ histori in japan . so , it is import step of studi for student . the second reason is that learn fact is essenti for correct idea . it is doubt that student trueli understand idea and concept unless learn fact . for instanc , nutrit studi , student do not know nutrient , they can not understand metabol of their bodi , and can not find new idea and passway of bodi system . for these reason , i disagre with that to understand idea and concept is more import for student than to learn fact .
