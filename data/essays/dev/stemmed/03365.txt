i disagre with thi statement . there are some disadvantag for have a trip in a group i think . first it is quit difficult for in a group to decid the best destin everyon feel satisfi with . second dure a trip in a group , we can not have a trip in the way we each like . i think such a trip is far from enjoy and relax . we need to think well about the true purpos of trip . traver definit is not get stress . in a group we can not help but feel certain stress . it is better for us not to have a trip if it appli to us . on the other hand , have a trip by myself i think i can make my trip meaning , free from stress and of cours fun . there are some reason for thi . first i can go to the destin which i think i want to visit . second , i do not have to care about other peopl . in such a situat i can enjoy see sight for much time which i thought would like to more . that is whi i think the best way yo enjyo a trip is to do it by myself .
