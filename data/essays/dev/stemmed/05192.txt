scholar 's main goal is to make sure their alumni have learn their teach . understand idea assur them that the student ha a clear imag of what wa taught by portra it into concept . onc they have knowledg about these statement and idea they can develop their own , expand the alreadi made or come up with counter idea . all of the previous mention forc student to keep on with their mental growth . fact are obvioulsli help , howev that 's as much you 'll get from them . fact will avoid learn becaus most you do with them is memor and file them in a redund folder of your brain . they 'll show up when their convini ; idea will stick around . i attend a model un annual debat meet in 2005 . me and my classmat chosen to repres our school in the meet were newcom and need explan in order to fulfil expect . we were n't clear about the process . our highli demmandig teacher made us particip in an re-enact of last year 's meet and even though it took us a while to get the idea onc we got the hang of it we clear our doub and understood the concept . model un is not just anoth extra-curricular activ it wa an opportun for sucess . we were train our mind to think for other , to speak for the one that ca n't for themselv and to come up with resolut to world wide problem . that is the thruth concept of the model un and we knew that even befor get there . onc we got to la ceiba , model un scenari , we had an ultim learn experi . our instructor could of list a seri of fact and sure it 'd help but we 'd have to wait until next meet to outstand and get the idea . it is alway a clever move to be abl to have an imag of what is the teach suppos go and not walk blindli through a learn path . therefor , understand idea and concept is much import than learn fact .
