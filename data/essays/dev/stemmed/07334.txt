today we live in a world where everyth is fast and in movement . to attract the consum attent often the advertis made by the productor , or a compani , is better then the product itself . i total agre with thi statement becaus we can have exampl of it everyday ; it is suffici to go in a supermarket and have a tour to see that it is full of similar product , and the onli differ between one and anoth is made by hi advertis . anoth exampl can be taken from the televis : there are a lot of advertis made onli to catch the consum attent . there are a lot of way to catch the consum attent : some product and , obvious , their advertis look to the histori of the compani who made it , like a `` design '' object , other tend to be new and innov . i think that an advertis should show the real potenti of a product , without exager , in order to prevent unhopeful case of recrimin and also a bad notorieti of it . the failur of a product must not be a stymulu to creat a fals advertis in order to sell it : it must be a motiv to improv it . becaus now our life is , for the most part of it , in movement , advertis had begun to be greater and greater . when we are block in the traffic of the citi , big advertis tri to catch our attent with provoc and funni phrase . but not everytim what is show is good as hi advertis . in conclus i think that who made an advertis should be sure of what he , or she , want to sell and what is the real potenti of the product .
