in my opinion , there is no gener answer to the question whether or not new thing and risk will lead to more success than stick to old shoe . i think it highli depend on the charact of a person . peopl might be veri success in do what they have done all their life . usual , they are veri experienc in what they do and with their knowledg and their background they are abl to make the right decis which eventu might lead to a great success . on the other hand , peopl who take risk and who are will to learn new thing , new theori and new perspect , can gener be character as more open-mind . they have to arrang with new situat and be more flexibl . they have to pay attent to the chang of market and chang with their environ . it can also be assum that peopl who seek new challeng are more motiv than peopl who do the same thing everi day , becaus they will not get bore by a daili stupid . not onli that new challeng lead to new opportun for success , i also think that have and gain knowledg in more than one field rather than be a specialist on one certain topic provid a lot more option for success . be abl to follow and take part in discuss on a varieti of field might earn the respect of other peopl . it is a lot easier to give an object opinion , if one can verifi thi opinion through solid experi in a varieti of field . i think have a wide rang of basic knowledg is a lot more impress than just be abl to lectur on one specif topic . peopl with common sens and a varieti of interest might more like be employ by an employ than probabl would be a specialist who ha not ever look beyond hi narrow borderlin . although i can see situat , where experi in do familiar thing can lead to success , i , as to speak for myself , would prefer learn new thing and accord to that i would also be will to take some risk . despit all these argument on success , i also think that life is a lot more worth live with the opportun to face new challeng and learn new thing .
