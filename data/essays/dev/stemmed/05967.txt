i agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i have three reason to support my answer . firstli , take risk is a way of find new chanc . i think the bigger the risk is the bigger the chanc you have . and to make that chanc your own you willne hard work and that will make you a strong person . secondli , take a risk and tring new thing can give you new perspect and can make you have a bigger knowleg that can help you to becom more success . for exampl for me to start cheerlead in my highschool wa a big risk for me . becas i use to be veri shi person and did not like to do thing in front of everi one els , but for me to start cheer gave me the courg to let myself out in front of the croud . the practic are veri hard and that made me a stronger person then i wa befor . thirdli , tring new thing give us an oprotun to meet differ peopl and know there thought . and give us new prospect . these are the reason i agre with thi statement .
