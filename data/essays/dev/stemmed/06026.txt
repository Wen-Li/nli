unfortun i have to agre with the statement that nowaday young peopl do not invest enough time to help their commun . in my opinion a possibl reason for thi develop might be the lack of a strong incent for the young peopl to spend their preciou free time on help the commun instead of mayb hang out with their friend , play video game etc . as especi citi grow to becom more and more anonym , young peopl do not see the reward of their work in the commun as they would in a smaller one where everyon know each other and the youth would get more appreci for their voluntari work . thi is , of cours , a misconcept , becaus volunt for a good caus is appreci in both environ , it just may be not as obvious to the young peopl . so the question is : what do the youth do with the time that they onc spend on help their commun ? they spend it on activ that they simpli find more pleasur . in fact , thi is a trend that we can detect in all layer of societi and in all age , we do not need to search for thi phenomenon among young peopl onli . of cours , it is more fun go to the cinema than help elderli member of the commun . so what we need is incent . we could get incent from the parent , help their kid realiz at a young age that it is import to take respons and help out in the commun at least everi onc in a while , depend on the child . small activ done for the commun may be more import and more valu than one might think and everi kind of work is strongli welcom and appreci . the commun itself must have a strong core in order to creat network and to attract the young peopl through for exampl specif institut and activ onli for the young . i say thi , becaus i believ that onli if the zoung peopl can identifi themselv with their commun , at least to a certain extent , will they be will to becom an activ member and help by invest a bit of the work as well .
