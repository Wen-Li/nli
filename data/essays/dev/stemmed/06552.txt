for mani decad professor , politician , employ , intellectual and student in germani have been discuss the question what an academ educ should be like : is it better to educ the student to generalist or specilist ? some peopl say that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . although thi idea is support by good argument , i prefer to special in one specif subject . first , it is better to take a studi cours in which you are realli interest in instead of take cour in mani differ academ subject , becaus the student can focu on one singl topic . if he concentr on one specif subject , he will finish hi studi cours right in time and will pass hi exam with good mark . take too mani subject cours is veri confus , and a student doe not have the time to deal with each singl subject in the way he is suposs to be . for exampl it is veri complic to combin a literari . cultur or media studi cours with mathemat or ingen . second , compani nowaday are not interest in generalist , becaus they need specialist . there are onli a few branch where generalist can get a job . advertis for job in newspap alway give a detail descript of the skill an employe should have . and mostli onli a specialist satisfi the compani ' need . therefor special on one subject is the best way to get a good job . final , be specail in one specif subject doe not prevent you from get in touch with other academ topic and studi cours . if you are good in one topic , you might also deal with other academ subject that are interest . but it is vital that you still focu on `` your '' studi cours . take all thi into consider , i arriv at the conclus that it is veri import to special in one specif subject instead of have knowledg of mani academ aspect . in some way , we are all generalist . but be a specialist is a uniqu characterist that improv your chanc to get a good job .
