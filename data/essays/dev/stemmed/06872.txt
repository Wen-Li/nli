person , i do not think that fewer car will be use in twenti year than today . probabl , the author of the statement base hi view on the fact that the increas of the use number of car ha been decreas for the last 25 year . furthermor , anoth thesi support hi view might be that public transport will becom not onli more access but also less expens . the invent of a new form of transport might as well contribut to a reduc number of car . anoth veri import point is , that the street are overwhelm by the number of car and simpli can not provid space to even more vehicl . the last point seem to be pretti evid , especi in a countri like germani . howev , in countri like china or in other third-world countri , space is not a restrict factor . in opposit , the develop of those countri will even increas the demand for high-pric technolog as is the car . develop happen rapidli and the chanc that countri like india or south africa join the club of the develop countri within the next twenti year is more than realist . also the invent of a new form of transport might not be absolut out of space but it is nowher in sight and it would take much longer to gain gener accept than the given 20 year to have ani impact on the number of car in use . what i definit hope and as well believ is the fall of price for public transport and it spread over the world - even in countri where it is not establish yet . howev , i am afraid that the car as much more comfort choic will alway attract human enough to convinc peopl to take it . i myself use the car for my way to thi toefl center instead of take bu or train . germani again serv as a good exampl . while the public transport system sure is one of the best in the world , street are fill with car . thi demonstr that even the exist of a public transport system doe not have great effect on the number of car use . furthermor , outsid europ , countri are much more rural than here . the establish of a public transport system is by far more expens than the build of road . the statement that the increas in the number of car decreas is definitli true but thi doe not necessarili mean the end of an increas number of car is close . as state befor , though europ reach a peak which can hardli be increas , in other countri the demand will rise dure the follow year and outnumb potenti decreas in europ . thi effect is even promot by a rise popul on the world . though in germani and in other highli develop countri , the number of inhabit decreas slightli , the total number of peopl still increas fastli . thi will not chang dure the follow 20 summer . conclus , i can not see ani conveni reason whi the number of car might decreas dure the next two decad - mayb an atom war or a meteor - but noth realist to happen . though i do not appreci the trend of more car , i am absolut sure that it will hold on .
