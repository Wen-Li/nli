traffic issu are certainli a huge problem in our current world . a distanc of ten kilomet would usual take about ten minut to cross twenti year ago ; howev , nowaday that same distanc would take about fourti minut to cross . peopl are begin to wonder if a person walk a certain distanc , or drove in a car , doe the walk individu reach the design point faster ? such issu are becom a seriou concern to our world . yet everi problem must have a solut , and earth ha a trait that when a human creat a problem , eventu he will find a solut . yet that solut , would caus anoth problem . i person agre with the statement sinc alreadi certain protocol are be done in order to deal with such a problem . mass transit ha be extrem subsid and an incent to carpool is be stress upon . subway rail , train , and monorail are be creat inord to draw away all the individu found on the road . in twenti year their will be definatli fewer car than what is present today , sinc individu would no longer depend on a biast form of transport . certain citi in our world today can prove how mass transit is an effect way of reduc the number of car . london , england is a perfect exampl to be use as a citi who use all it transport method and incent to the max . a person who live in london doe not necesarilli need to be stuck in rush hour when he is tire from work and just want to go home . such an individu can just enter the tube station and ride the subway to the nearest station to hi resid . thi type of transport when peopl began to adapt to it greatli affect the road of london , as year by year the street began to clear up . countri would probabl follow the footstep of london in the near futur . tokyo , japan is anoth exampl of a countri that enforc mass transit ; howev poorli exectu . underground station are present within the citi , yet the transit system doe not support such a mass amount of individu . such a situat might solv the problem of fewer car on the road , but it caus the problem of more peopl crowd at underground station . the exampl present support the theori behind thi argument , which is ye their will be fewer car in twenti year than their is today ; howev , that doe not solv the main problem . car on their own do not caus a crowd effect , peopl drive the car caus the crowd effect . when mass transit are use effici , than that certain amount of individu will be evenli distribut among differ rout of transport . yet if mass transit is provok , than that mass of individu would just yield to anoth rout , transfer the same problem from point a to point b. fewer car will be present in twenti year , but it up to each individu countri to distribut the main problem .
