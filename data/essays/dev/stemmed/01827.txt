i agre with the statement and i do think understand idea and concept is realli import for student . and i have three reason . first , it 's quit necessari to understand the idea and knowledg when student first learn them . in thi way they learn more effect than simpli memor the fact we come across . also , a good understand of the knowledg would help student recal what they learn befor . if the studi is all about recit and memor , there would be not a better student than a comput . second , as my teacher alway told me that student should learn `` how to learn '' , rather than gain the knowledg onli . and believ that 's the real purpos of educ , to teach the student how to think and solv new problem they will meet in the futur . my high school could be a bad exampl . when i studi there , although my teather told me it wa import to know how to learn , care too much about memor . it wa indic in the exam . in order to get a good mark of the examin , all we should do is to copi the fact into our mind . what 's wors , the process of studi wa so fast that we could n't have time to have a good think about the idea . as a result , i onli can rememb a few of the thing i learn from the high school textbook now . in addit , to understand and take a deeper think of what we learn is the way how we 've develop our cultur from the veri begin ! it 's the way we gain the knowledg from the peopl befor and creat new idea of our own . imag if all the student do n't learn how to understand and how to think deepli , how would be the futur societi like ? ! in a word , the way i see it , it 's not onli import but also fairli necessari for student to understand idea and think more about what they learn .
