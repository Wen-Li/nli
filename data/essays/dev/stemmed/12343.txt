i complet agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . our modern world is full of such exampl where peopl took risk and creat new thing . upto a larg extent , our modern age is made by these peopl . i will classifi these activ in mainli two way . first , where peopl just chang the way in which we do thing . for exampl , take the music industri . few year back , music industri wa domin by the walkman from soni . if you want to hear music then you need to buy a walkman and cassett . soni thought that thi wa the best way but steve job from appl had differ idea . he creat i-pod where you can download your music in flash memori . thi wa more effici and one can download larg amount of music that wa not possibl with walkman . thi made steve job famou but soni lost a market becaus soni execut were just make more effici walkman . they never tri to tri a new thing . second , where peopl leapfrog the current way of do thing and creat a total differ solut of the problem . for exampl , take the postal servic . earlier , if you want to send a letter to your love one then you have to write that in paper and send it by mail . it use to take time and process wa in-effici . few peopl thought about the electron transmiss of inform and internet wa born . now , send a letter to someon is a click away by e-mail . e-mail is much effici and much faster . some peopl will not agre with the statement and they will say that tri new thing is riski so we should not tri new thing . i would like to tell them that if our ancestor would have thought in the same way then we would have been live in stone world today . i agre that onc you tri new thing then you might fail , but , learn lesson from failur and tri again make some one success .
