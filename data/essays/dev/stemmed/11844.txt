i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i beliv that a lack of altruist and selfless act are directli spur from econom and social reason . in today 's world , mani youth do not see a valid social reason to immers themselv in commun servic . although the major of the world 's popul live in abject poverti , those who are capabl of give to their commun are often segreg from those who are in need . henc , the lack of awar prevent today 's youth from help out . speak from person experi , i find that there is a gradual declin in my own commun of youth that refus to give or help out their commun in ani manner . as the presid of key club , an intern commun servic organ in my high school , i find it more and more difficult everi year to recruit new member to replac the one that have depart . i rememb when there were about 40 member in the group - now i find that it is even difficult to gather 20 member for the meet . the onli sens of give that can be felt in my school 's atmospher is pure caus from the need to `` look good '' on transcript for colleg . of cours , i 'm sure not all of them feel thi way , but i truli think it 's safe to say that the major feel thi way . everi year , monetari donat rise in key club as the number of member declin . thi is an econom reason whi i beliv that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . inevit , most of us in the world have been brought up be capitalist - when we give , we expect someth back in return . howev , when youth help out with their commun , they do not receiv someth tangibl as reward . henc , today 's youth neglect to help their commun . due to thi fact , those who can help and give find it extrem annoy to invest their time in help other . thu , their onli token of help is through monetari mean , which they believ is compens for not give time to their commun . nonetheless , societi 's greed can even prevent the give of money . it 's truli a shame to look around and see that today 's youth , or tomorrow 's leader , refus to invest their time when they are perfectli capabl of do so . it is time that societi creat more awar in young peopl to be will to invest their time for other . onc youth overcom their lazi , fear of help out , and learn that the greatest reward ( as clich as it may sound ) is the fuzzi feel they get from give time and help other , it will be the massiv step stone in get the world 's youth more involv .
