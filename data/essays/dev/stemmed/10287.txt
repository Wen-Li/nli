i agre with the opinion ; young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . younger peopl have mani relationship with other peopl from commun such as school , compani , or internet societi . i believ that to keep be relat with somebodi make life more enjoy , becaus i can commun and share the happi or pleasur with other if i am relat with somebodi . of cours older peopl have the relationship with peopl , but it is much smaller than younder peopl ha . old peopl do not go to school , probabl retir their job too , therefor younger peopl ha larger relationship with other . younger peopl are more aggress , activ , and power . they can act and do as well as what they want to do . they can go other place whenev they want to go , they can play sport or other activ whatev they cant do . it is hard to move their bodi for older peopl . i think mani old peopl enjoy their hobbi insid their hous or around their hous by theirselv , but i do not think that those are real enjoy thing . my grandfath live by himself sinc my drandmoth wa die , and he say he enjoy water hi bonsai and walk around hi subdivis with hi dog , but he doe not look happi for real . if i do not have much relationship with peopl , it would not be so much fun at all . i think peopl can feel that `` i realli enjoy do thi ! '' from their deeper part of their heart if they are connect with other peopl . therefor , i agre with the statement `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . ''
