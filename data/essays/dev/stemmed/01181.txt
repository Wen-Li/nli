in my view , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i do not prefer to travel alon as i believ that when you travel with friend then you can take atmost pleasur and inform of the travel as there will be mani question for the tour guid as there will be mani brain , not one . i just want to emphasis thi by use an exampl of my travel with my friend . i am a histori student by profess . in the last year of my colleg i had a thesi to be submit on a great monument , taj mahal . it wa a tour where a group of 4 ( includ me ) have gone and the place wa to new delhi , in india where taj mahal is locat . it is one of the ancient citi in india with great histori and also the capit of the countri . there we hire a tour guid , who is believ be the best in the place . while look at the monument and hear to the inform from the guid , we were astonish about the histori , beauti and the effort requir for it construct . there were lot of area in the monument whose name were not even heard by us befor i.e. none of the book contain these detail , which are veri import for our observ and thesi . there are lot of question that were ask by our group to the guid . i think my share of question would be onli one tenth of the total . then , i realis the import of travel togeth . i felt that if i have come to the place alon then i would have learnt onli one tenth of the inform for the thesi which would have reduc my score . after come back from new delhi to our place we have check our share of expenditur for the travel and it wa onli 40 % when compar to expenditur if one one travel els . with the abov mention exampl , i believ that travel in group with a tour guid not onli help in get more inform about the place you visit , but also help in reduc your expenditur for the travel . it reinforc your relat with your friend . you will rememb and recollect your experi and incid in the travel through out you life .
