i think that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept rather than to mere learn fact , henc forth agre to the statement . one of the best exampl to support thi statement goe back in time befor the renass period in europ . the roman cathol church at that time wa the rule author . they propos fals fact that the earth wa the centr of the solar system and that all the other planet revolv around it . thi wa tought to the mass and then at that time prefer wa given to the fact even if they were untru regardless of the underlyng concept on how a solar system work . so even if the fact didnt have ani underli idea to it or concept , it wa given import , thu the result that peopl live under a lie . now if the idea that understand and conceptu wa more importand than just learn mere fact wa present at that time , there would have been a great advanc in the knowledg of the univers even befor the renes priod . the statement also support one of the idomom that `` necess is the mother of invent '' . if the student are expos to onli fact , which are a kind of invent by other who understood idea befor , there would not be ani room for free think and the result , which in thi case is the futur ( student are the futur ) would be stagnat ! also i believ that some fact can be alter and/or prove wrong by understand idea and concept . again the exampl state abov serv for thi statement . at the reness period the fals fact were prove wrong by free thinker like galleleo with the help of their abil to understand idea and concept . great discoveri and invent were made at that perioid and mani new fact were made . thu all and all we can consid that one need to develop idea and concept in order to make fact in the first place and that fact are just result part of it .
