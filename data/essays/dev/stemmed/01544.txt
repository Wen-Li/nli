have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , or special in one specif subject ? have broad knowledg of mani academ subject can make the student know a littl of everi subject but it wo n't get focus on a specif subject . special in one specif subject can make the student know everyth in one subject but wo n't make them know almost anyth about other subject . peopl choos job and they onli have to know all the inform about that specif subject that they work on . they are n't respons to know inform about ani other subject . these way the distrubit of job are form . although thi way job distrubit are form , know everyth about one subject can make peopl bore . know a littl about everi subject make peopl open mind and more interest . they can look at the world at differ angl and sinc human are social live , a littl color into everyon 's life is need . if peopl onli knew about one topic and had no idea about ani other topic , everybodi would be bore . peopl would onli make friend with peopl of the same job type becaus they would have no common subject with peopl of other job type . if the peopl knew a littl of everyth and did not focu on one topic , then everybodi would have to do all of it work itself and no job distribut would be made . also subject like scienc , histori , geographi , surgeri , etc . . would not go alot of distanc becaus nobodi would be work on mainli one topic . thi way new invent and explor would not be made . in the conclus , i think onli focus on one subject and not know anyth about other topic , also know a littl of everi topic and not focus on one are both bad but if i had to choos one , i would say that special in one specif subject is better than have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus thi way the standard of life do not decreas , onli peopl get more bore and have friend onli of their own area of knowledg , but by have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject make the life standard decreas .
