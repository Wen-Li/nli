in my opinion the state argument is right and the amount of car will decreas dure the next twenti year . there are mani altern to use a car , there will not be enough space on the rout for all those car . in addit i am sure that there will be certain law in the futur to keep the amount of car at a certain level . today one can use the train , a ship , a plan or even the public transport systen to reach diffger place . those altern will becom more attract becaus of technolog progress which will final make the use cheaper . mani peopl in germani for exampl prefer to take the train becaus it is more convini and it is sure to arriv on time . furthermor the oil price increas dure the last year and a chang can not be seen . the industri react to thi problem by build engin which need less petrol but becaus of the eclectron equip the sum of need petrol could not be reduc . anoth argument is that citi will becom more overcrowed and there will not be enough space for new car . for exampl in japan is not enough space for new build and the street have reach a critic size which can not be enlarg . one solut is that peopl just share car to to go to work . and finali there will be certain law to keep the amount of car on a certain level . the world ha mani problem with pollut and governm just start for exampl to introduc special law in the faster grow economi . by do thi the state want that industri and common peopl pay more attent to their use of energi . if thi group chang it behaviour one consequ could be that less new car will be bought . in conlus thi are my three main argument whi there will be fewer car in 20 year .
