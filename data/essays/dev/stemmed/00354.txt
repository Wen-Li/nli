i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . when advertis , compani tend to make their product sound like that they are the best by provid fals inform and fals result . an ad on the tv may tell you thing that you usual want in a product . these inform may misslead you to build an idea about the product that usual tern out to be wrong . for exampl , when you watch televis , you see a commerci about a certain type of cleaner . on the commerci , they say that thi cleaner can make old thing look new . you immedi think that thi cleaner will help you make your old dress made by your mother look like a new valinteno . but instead , it shrink your dress . other commerci , show what happen when other peopl - actor - use thi product . for exampl , a compani that sell a drug for weight loss will show imag of peopl who use to be fat , but now they are in a good shape . later , it turn that these imag were either taken for differ peopl , or were manipul with by comput . when conpani tri to make their product seem much better than they realli are , they fool peopl into buy their product . peopl will see later that thi product is not like what they expect . thi will eventu lead the compani to lose it credit and honesti , which will lead to financi nose dive in the futur .
