i disagre with the statement ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid ' . i would like to putforth exampl and situat i person have experi to support my opinion . a person who travel alon i believ will have a lot more independ in make hi own decis rather travel along with a tour guid . with a tour guid we see our desicion be influenc by the guid and we get to see place the guid want us to see rather than what we want to see . it wa in my school trip that my classmat and myself had a pretti bad exeri with the guid appoint to us . the guid would take us to place we did n't want to see and he be a localit got us into a hotel that wa quit expens , becaus by do so he would get a commiss from the hotel author for get them custom . other than that we had some other bad exeri onli becaus of the reason that the guid wa a localit and wa look for grab commiss wherev we went . the best advantag in travel alon would be that we could find out about a place by interact with the localit or get a copi of the local travel guid to guid us to the best place of visit . in today 's advanc world we get to have the inform of a place on our fingertip through the internet . we also have amaz travel guid book that come in variou languag and help us in get a feel of the local cultur . i would like to end the topic on the point that i took thi decis base on my person experi and the other travel experi that where great just becaus of the fact that we did n't take guid along .
