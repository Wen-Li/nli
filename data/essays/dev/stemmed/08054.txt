petrol is the main sourc of energi use nowaday but the problem is that scientist 's research say that there is n't alot of petrol still store in the earth 's crust . most of the petrol which wa underground wa dug up . peopl nowaday use a lot of petrol for their car and they do n't think about the futur . they dont think what will happen when the petrol run out ! . the petrol dug from the earth 's crust is decreas everi day veri rapidli due to the huge number of car present on earth and the factori use petrol as a sourc of energi . as the petrol present decreas it price will increas a lot ! . sometim in the near futur the price of petrol will be veri high that alot of peopl ca n't afford it , so peopl will have car but they ca n't afford the petrol !! iron is n't it ? ! . on the other hand , a lot of scientist are now devot themselv to stop thi crisi befor it happen . so they are research differ sourc for energi like solar energi and electr energi . there are other sourc of energi that are be research but electr and solar energi are the one be focus on but the problem is that both thi energi sourc are not depend . first , the sun give out vast amount of energi but the problem is it is not avail all day long . it is not avail at night . second , electr energi is a good sourc of energi but the problem is nowaday electr energi is conduct by conduct which work on petrol so that bring us to the first problem !! . there is no definit solut to the problem of petrol be finish , the onli thing peopl can do is that they tri to decreas the use of petrol now to tri and stall thi crisi from happen . so in my opinion in twenti year definitli there will be fewer car in use than there is today .
