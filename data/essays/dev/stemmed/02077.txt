now a day the young peopl do not devot their enough time for help their commun which they should do . a youngster should alway help hi commun becaus they are the one 's who will help him if he will have ani problem . they safeguard the youngster . from my point of view , the young peopl are not devot suffici time to the commun . instead of thi they like to parti with their friend . some utilis their time in studi and tution . some find play game interest rather than provid support to their commun . the have now a day no feel in their heart which the peopl in the past use to have for serv their commun . they are unawar of the fact that the commun is the one who is go to help them when in need . he should therefor work for it to take hi commun to great height and creat a level for it i.e a separ entiti . for exampl - mohanda karamchand gandhi wa not call the father of india like that onli . he had suffer a lot in free hi countri from the british who were rule it for mani year . he did not did thi all alon . slowli and steadili he gather indian to support him and carri out sever movement to rule them out . at last hi countri gain freedom on 15th august , 1947 after struggl for a few decad . the young one 's should therefor wake up from their sleep and help in strengthen freedom . the should not leav it at the stake . thu , the youngster view should alway be on help their commun as guru nanak did for the sikh . therefor the primari function of everi peopl belong to a particular commun is to have the potenti to do whatev hi commun requir from him . he should serv hi commun as best as he can .
