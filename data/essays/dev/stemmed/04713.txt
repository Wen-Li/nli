sucess and failur lie in the hand of the person andalso depend on the the dedic and effort which he give on hi particular work . i feel that succesful peopl doe differ thing and enjoy do do them . these peopl gener dont depend on the result of the work which wa done by them but they concentr on the effort which put on it . thi the best and most fascin thing in them . when they donot tri new thing and work stick to one kind of work which they are habitu to do which ani risk and problem the man would certainli not call as a success person . for exampl take a biologist reserch , he start reasearch in one particular feild and conduct experi draw hypothisi and he continu the process till he succeed . he go for exped and also do mani adventur to studi the natur of a particular speci and draw conclus by observ the behaviour of differnt anim in that speci . hi journey would be certainli though and it also take long time to make conclus , if hi conclus is right and match he is succees in hi reaserch , but he donot stop till he will reaserch on anoth speci and hi life goe on . if he is confi to one particular reserch in hi life time that would be that effect as thing goe on chang and the speci can adapt to differnt environ so he had to suc further . the same is the case of a bussi manag or a owner of a bussi . a bussi man is succes in the coprat world with hi product and one a lot of profit with thi product , but he will not be restrict to make that particular product onli he would certainli do experi and launch new product , if the product click he is succees but if the product doesnt click still he would be succees and would tri to make implic on that . anoth thing is succ doesnot lie in do a routin job , everyon should experi and do differnt thing as there is a lot in the world to still learn and we can come through them . if we are not succes in ani of the experi we did it doesnt matter to do the experi we get through the subject and we can then finnali have a pool of knowledg on differnt fei
