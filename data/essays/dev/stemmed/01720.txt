i agre in part with the statement that the `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . the statement state by the author seem to be correct at some situat and prove to be wrong at other situat make thi statement as debat . i will give some exampl to prove my point in thi essay . the statement of author mention `` enjoy of life '' . thi term is veri rel in respect of peopl . everi person tri to live hi life colour in hi own way . if enjoy mean parti then it may be possibl that young peopl are do more frequent than older peopl but when it come to celebr then older peopl are not step back from the younger gener . i do agre sometim becaus younger gener are have better and suitabl condit for the time to enjoy . young peopl are enthusiast , activ and have energi to enjoy the sport event by play and cheer , they are veri eager to explor the new place . young peopl have interest for movi go for it whenev they get time , they go for picnic to have a chang and the thing that gener mani young peopl enjoy that is to danc continu for hour . they enjoy variou food of differ tast at mani of the time . thi can be term as enjoy . if we accept the author statement then it would be like that older peopl are not enjoy but carri thier life ahead onli . the thing which are done by younger gener are be done by older gener earlier and thu they lost the charm in those thing and they are not have enough strength to do the same thing contin . but they are enjoy in differ manner , sit on a chair take sunbath , read newspap and give advic to younger gener . they are not abl to tast variou food becaus of their physic condit but even take that food by hide from other peopl . they are the leader of the hous , they are have certain respons to be taken care of . thi can also be term as enjoy but of some differ kind . in sum we can say thi point is quit debat and need to do sampl of peopl and other techniqu to reach some conclus .
