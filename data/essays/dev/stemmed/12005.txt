i would like to disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl and would present argument against the topic . first of all we need to clearli defin the word - '' enjoy life '' . a lot of us misconstru the real mean of these word . true enjoy mean someth done to bring joy and happi to oneself or love one and not as a public demonstr effect . thi is especi true for older peopl . after have experienc life and gone through differ stage dure their life time , older peopl are much more experienc and matur in their outlook . therefor they would seldom indulg in activ which are popularli seen as be part of enjoy life . young peopl on the other hand , due to a varieti of reason which can includ peer pressur , need to experi , energi , enthusiasm etc. are often seen indulg in the more demonstr form of activ which can classifi under the broad term - enjoy life . so while older peopl might not go out as often for travel or adventur trip or movi or parti , they have their own set of activ like book read , garden , religi activ , commun event etc. to complet a happi and enjoy day . i also believ that while at a young age peopl often enjoy themselv by indulg in self driven activ , at an older age human be get more happin , satisfact and enjoy by do thing for their close and love one . for exampl a father who invest day and night to build a hous so that he and hi famili can have a secur shelter for a lifetim get an equal amount of satisfact and happi as doe a young adventur trekker . thi gestur should not be miscontru as evid of not enjoy life . therefor in conclus i would like to state that enjoy is not depend on one 's age . it is a state of mind which all human be strive to achiev through variou method and activit dure the differ stage in their life cycl .
