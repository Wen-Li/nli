there are two way for train to work and to live . one of these is speecial in one specif subject , the other is studi in order to have a broad knowledg . in my opinion each of these way ha some advantagesand some disadvantag , but the second is the best . as regard the first possibilti , that is have a specif knowledg , i think that the most import advantag is that who ha a specif educ , have a high possibl to find a job , a well reward job , in the field where he or she studi in depht . inde , nowaday , firm and compani , look for peopl who can give a sensibl help to the firm . student well prepar are a competit factor that allow firm to gather much money . on anoth hand , peopl or student who have a wide rang of interest , who studi differ subject , have the possibl to use the inform they gather dure their train in order to creat a good social life . moreov i think that these peopl are more flexibl in chang their work dure their life . for these reasonss , even if at first view , the first kind of knowledg could seem better , i think that , expeci in the liong time , for exampl dure the whole life , the second kind of knoledg is more use for peopl . i think so , becaus i chose to studi a subjet in depht , that is manag engin , and i studi thi subject in depht for make myself more competit that the other student in the world of job . whene i have some free time i prefer not to spend it in read becaus i 'm veri tire for my work at univers . but when i meet peopl stude someth differ from econom , mechan or industi subject , and i talk with them about someth they have discuss in class or they have read in a magazin i alway feel that i 'm incomplet , my educ is incomplet , becaus even if i 'm clever i have n't the basic inform to say my opinion about the topic . so i think that everyon should be spend part of the day to read magazin , journal and so on in order to have a reward life .
