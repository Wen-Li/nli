the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun is may right , but in my opinion it could be said not onli for young peopl and not onli nowaday . i think the time after childhood and befor adulthood have been a difficult time eversinc . teenag have enough to do help themself , so they are may even the onli agegroup who should not be blame for be a bit selfish . but even after you reach your twenti succes , there is a high number of reali ignorr and selfish peopl . it goe on dure everi ageclass . it is easi to blame the young one , but even most middel-ag and older peopl are look away if someth uncomfort happen . anyway , thi do not mean , that the statement , that young peopl nowaday do not care enough , is wrong . if there are too mani peopl in everi ageclass who do not spend enough time to help their commun , the younger one are includet . but in my opinion , most time , they are at least the most help orient group , at least after they maneg their teenag . just becaus there are more often more open mind young peopl than older one . wich bring us to the word `` nowaday '' . it is may like that in pass time the famili bond wa stronger , so there wa more help dure most famili for each other . but the commun doe not mean onli the peopl we love , but also peopl who are may totali differ , with opinion we do n't share , with behavior we do n't understand . but to help the commun mean even to help them , if help is need . to help some stranger on the street wa way more uncommon in past time but today . and even if most of the chariti organis have mostli older member and helper , it doe n't mean that the younger gener do n't care . most time the young peopl are those who want to chang someth . i totali agre that there are not enough peopl who spend enough time to help their commun , but at the end you ca n't blame it onli to the younger one nowaday . it is and wa a gener problem .
