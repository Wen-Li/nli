young peopl are an intergr part of the communities/societi in which they live . they develop their skill and gain educ from their peopl - their famili , teacher , friend and other peopl in their societi . i be a youngster myself believ that i have acquir the valu and principl of my life from my commun . we younger gener owe our life to our elder , so we can not neglect them . we have learnt to respect our elder and peopl in our societi . therefor i would not like to agre with the statement that young peopl are not give enough time to their commun . young peopl attend colleg studi differ disciplin - scienc , commerc , human etc . but they particip in a lot of other activ outsid their curricula . there are numer club and organ form by youngster that invlov themselv variou kind of commun activ like protect the environ by spread awar among the peopl , fight for social evil like corrupt etc . in my univers itself there are sever student societi like these . for exampl , the natur club , whose member spend their time to make peopl consciou about issu like nois pollut , harm of plastic etc . they express themselv by variou mean like banner , conduct quizz and so on . similarli there is anoth club which rais it voic against mani social problem preval in my countri , for exampl dowri , femal foeticid etc . i myself is a member of thi organ and we organ variou activit like trip to local neighborhood , stage street play to spread our messag . anoth aspect that show the commit of young peopl to their commun is their increas interest in polit issu . in my countri , right from the colleg student compet for differ posit in the univers polit and they have an import role in bring import nation issu to discuss forum where student can discuss about possibl solut to them . young peopl also contibut toward econom and technolog develop of their commun by implement new idea . for exampl , they can use their educ to help creat new type of job by be entrepreneur . in thi context i woul like to add that mani alumni of my colleg who have now gain imp postion in societi contribut by give donat to variou social organ . i do agre that there are some youngster who forget their peopl in order to earn money , who leav their countri for better life , but a larg major of them includ me are determin to serv their commun from where we start our live .
