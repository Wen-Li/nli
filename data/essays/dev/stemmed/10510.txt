in our studi , we often have the choic between learn mani academ subject and special in one in particular . it can be quit a dillema . in my opinion , special , at least in the end of our studi , is more interrest . i will explain the advantag and disadvantag of each solut and explicit my feel . broad knowledg of academ subject is appeal at first . you do n't have to make the choic between the theme you like , and learn from one can improv our understand of anoth . for instanc , learn the live of speci in biolog class can help in ecolog class . swith between subject often also help on not get bore . on the contrari you do n't have enough time to each class , and that can be realli frustrat to learn onli basic in the one you enjoy the most . the other choic that is offer to us is special . the great thing about it is learn more and more inform about a subject you like ( or at least you should like ) and get more and more confid about it . furtheremor you make less mistak . the major drawback is when you need knowledg ( even basic ) on other academ subject you do n't have them , and probabl do n't have the time to learn them , and need to ask for help . thi will result in a huge loss of time . an other neg aspect about special is that sometim you are to much concentr on your subject you ca n't see by yourself the mistak you are do . final , i prefer to special in a topic than to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . the main reason is that you can be good in a topic onli if you practic often , and i do n't mind ask for help if i need knowledg about anoth subject in order to fullfil my work . moreov , in order to begin in profesion life you need to be good at least one thing .
