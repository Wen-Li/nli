peopl alway said that if you want to learn more about a unfamiliar citi or place , just stop read , make a trip there is a definit way to solv thi problem . i do agre with thi , but should we travel with a group by a tour gaid or just go there by ourselv ? i believ that the attitud that peopl maintain to thi question will be differ . i would rether say that i 'd like to go to a new place on my own . first of all , it is hard to be deni that the goal of our travel is to feel and enjoy differ cultur , in most part . i would say that i am a boy who like to adventur , becaus that is more excit than go with a group . the cultur could be seen as a represent of a place , and also should be respect . if i get a great amount of knowledg about those cultur from the tour guid , that will make me feel disappoint and those knowledg will becom tediou and bore to me , the onli way that i get to know a kind of new cultur is to feel it by myself . in addit , join a group that led by a tour guid is seem freeless , becaus our journey is alreadi project by guid and the guid can even tri to convinc us to by some expens local craft which can benefit the guid . that will make our trip unaccept . forthermor , it is imposs that the travel with a group is cheap . if i go somewher on my own , i will make a precis project to control my cost and i can even live in my friend 's home that besid that place i want to visit , which can not onli cut down numor money , but also let my trip have more wond feel and more signific mean . as what i have mention abov , i would rather say that i do like to travel a place on my own .
