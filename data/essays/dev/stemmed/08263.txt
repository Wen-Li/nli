i agre with the statement that the young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . they spend too much time in stude their class , wast much of their time in person enjoy , and do not understand the real mean of help their commun . as a fact , the parent in taiwan alway want their children to have good academ achiev more than the other thing . they want their young peopl to studi again and again , and do not expect them to pay ani attent and spend much time to the other thing except read and stude . as a result , the young peopl will not spend much time to the other thing such as help their commun . the young peopl are still like children , so they prefer to play such as spend their time to play comput game or watch tv in an air-condit room in their vacat or off-school time rather than to help their commun outsid the door , espcial in a hot summer weather in taiwan . for exampl , my nephew is a teenag , but he did not know ani thing about the commun where he live for more than ten year . he prefer to talk to hi friend by cellar phone , and have a date with hi girl fiend . he spend hi time to help hi commun onli when hi high school ask him to hand out the report about hi servic in hi commun and the report will be grade . except thi . when i suggest that he may have a commun servic in our commun , he wa surpris that i have such a strang idea that he never have . in conclus , it becom a common social phenomenon that the young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun becaus their parent and the whole commun did not facilit them to help their commun and give a good reward and help them to understand the real mean of help their commun . as such , the young peopl are loos their recognit of their own commun .
