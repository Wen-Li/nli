to choos between a broad knowledg of mani academ subject or a good special in onli one specif subject is not easi , as both possibl have advantag and disadvantag . anyway i agre with the idea that it- better to have a broad knowledg of sever differ subject , and that for sever reason . first of all , a person with a varieti of interest and knowledg in differ field is probabl a person with an open mind who show a strong intellectu curios . famou intellectu of the past , like leonardo da vinci , just to name one of the most known , had an incred varieti of knowledg and curios . then , have a broad knowledg of the world in gener might help peopl in their carreer and profession life . also , have a good knowledg in a varieti of subjct doesn-t necessarili mean that a person can-t have a special field of interest in which he or she is more compet . an open mind and a broad cultur can be a great advantag in a fast chang world as the one we live in today . in fact we must be readi and abl to adapt to differ situat and condit . on the contrari , if we are too rigid , if we are overspeci in a veri particular field , we might be unabl to get the whole pictur , so to speak , and we might be less flexibl , less abl to cope with ani chang we can have to deal with in our live . of cours there- noth wrong with be veri good in a particular subject we like more . i think that onli overspeci is wrong . if someon is compet and interest onli in a veri special field , he or she might be veri good in hi or her job , but might not be abl to adapt or to react to situat that requir a more gener approach . sometim you read on paper of terribl mistak doctor do in their work , as not understand exactli a patient- deseas or simpli confus symptom describ by patient . that can be due to the fact that some doctor are extrem well prepar in their field , but are sometim unabl to anal the whole situat , and they might miss the fact that they are deal with peopl and not just with sick kidney or liver , to give an exempl . for all said reason , i do believ that have a broad knowledg of mani subject and keep the curios and passion for learn all our life is definit better that limit our knowledg onli to a specif field of studi .
