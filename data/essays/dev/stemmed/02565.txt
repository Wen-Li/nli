i alway think about the day the i wiil be old without a particular fear . that 's becaus i think that the experi gain dure an inter lifetim can be use to go throuhgh the problem more deepli . thi broader vision of think , given by experi can definit lead to a good qualiti of life . as an exampl i would like to talk about my grandfath : until the age of almost eighti year he enjoy hi life . dure hi lifetim he had a lot of terribl experi , infact he went to the second world war and he lost hi first son . all those experi gave to him an addit strenght . i also think that to be an adolesc can be veri hard becaus , in thi sort of twilight , you still do n't know what to do when an import choic have to be done . on the other end , elderli peopl have gain the necessari experi to make ponder and ration choic . as anoth factor that make me state that you can still enjoy life also if you are old is that , in modern day , there have been mani improv in medic field that , as a consequ , brought to an averag better condit of elderli peopl . all those factor as a broader vision of think given by experi , a deep knowdleg of itself and the recent improv in health condit of elderli make me see my futur year in an optimist way and make me look at futur with no fear .
