as peopl ' age chang , they begin to enjoy differ pleasur in life . young peopl have fun and feel veri pysch at time when they believ they are be prais by other . i rememb , for a while in my life , anytim i would walk into someplac with a slick and snazzi new haircut , i would believ peopl look up to me , and it would be for the rest of the night that i 'd enjoy myself , due to my newli instal confid . howev , no matter how illog it is , that would be my almost onli way of have fun . today , i have fun when i am with close peopl such as my good friend or famili . i also enjoy lock myself up in my room and program websit . three year ago , i would mock someon who would tell me such a thing . i would n't consid fun , and on the contrari i would consid it ridicul bore . for my parent , they have fun play the slowest card game ever ( which i think is call bezik ) . at thi age , i do n't understand how they consid that to be fun . they also enjoy go on boat trip . to me , noth could be more monoton than the empti sound of the lone sea . howev you never know , mayb in around 30 year , those may be my pleasur in life . mayb , i will begin jog everi morn by six a.m. at the age of sixti . what my pleasur will be , is certainli not certain . the same appli to everyon . therefor , i do n't believ that the question pose can be answer . i believ all age group have their own way of have fun . you can not compar one 's action to anoth one 's action , if the action have their own definit for each individu .
