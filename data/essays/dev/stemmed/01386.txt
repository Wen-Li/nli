i 'm agre with the follow statement : `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . i think that young peopl live your life more attent to old peopl . they go to a parti , disco , pub but also cinema , univers , teatr , ecc . the young peopl love travel and they visit all town of europa or asia . the older peopl must think at their famili and at their children or also their parent . they watch televis or walk in the park . they play at `` tre sett '' ( tipyc italian 's play ) young peopl havent not too problem and too respons that older peopl have . young peopl are the futur , they must learn to older peopl 's error . i studi and i have not more time for my obbi . i do n't like to disco but if i have freetim i prefer go in a pub to drink few beer with my friend
