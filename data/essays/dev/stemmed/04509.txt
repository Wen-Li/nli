i am of the opinion that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . there are mani reason and exampl that i would like to list in support of my posit . first let us consid those case in which the author 's contens , in fact my contens , hold good . firstli let us consid the field of scienc and technolog . consid for exampl a biolog student is face with the problem of replac the burn out fuse . if he do not have ani knowledg about the electr subject he may not be abl to fix a veri simpl task . also a student of technolog should have minimum idea of what medicin to take when a minor health problem aris . so a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is necessari . secondli , if for exampl a student is confin to studi onli the histori of hi own countri which is hi specif academ subject then he may face problem when ask about the world histori and some import event in the world histori . thirdli , consid the exampl of desig a comput . mani peopl who do differ task are involv in desig a comput . if the person who design a part of the comput do not understand the funtion of other part and the link between those part then a comput can not be design . final , also a person of sceinc or technolog may find difficulti in the bussi world if he do not anyth about the stock market . thi can be extend even to polit . if the parti member have idea onli about their own parti then they are at risk of lose their posit if they do not have the knowled about the other parti . in sum , i would like to reiter that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani acdem subject than to special in one specif subject which help an individu enhanc hi gener knowledg in addit to the regular subject .
