i agre with the statement , it is a need to take risk in life to be success , if you stay in your confort zone you will never improv and grow to becom a success person . we are all born with no knoleg , we do n't event know how to walk , that is one of thefirst chaleng we face in life , to lear a new thing . if we were to start life stay safe and not explor we would not even know how to walk . later in life we have to push our self to go to school and becom part of a class , and keep tri new thing like read write , improv and get smarter . by the time we take that first job we have alreadi done alot of thing out of that confort zone , new thing , and there is peopl that in that point of there life are confort with were they are . in my oppinion you have to keep go . tri to inov , chang and grow , learn new skill that can make you successful in what you realli want to do . becom seccess mean someth differ for everi bodi , to me a success person is one that know what is look to get from life , and is not afraid to tri new thing in order to do what make them happi . i thing everybodi shoul take the risk of do new thing in order to becom succes and happi peopl . the last time a took risk do someth a did not know how to do well wa learn to surf . now is one of the thing i like the best in my life and i can not pictur my self live in california not do surf . take risk pay off .
