in my view it is alway help to have lot of interest in acquir as much inform in everi field or subject rather than to concentr mere on one subject . as far as i am concern individu will shine if he continu to gain knowledg through out hi entir life , more so in differ field as world is chang faster . as a child i wa do lot better in most of the subject dure my secondari school . but i never wa domon in ani one subject . thi continu when i wa in intermedi , which use to worri me a bit , as after the higher educ there wa an entranc exam for which i had to score veri good in academ subject . but my matern uncl who wa close to me suggest to make a slight alter to my studi pattern and concentr on subject which will be test for the exam , but said to rememb one import thing that jack of all trade is better than master of none . while i wa studi 10th standard i had a friend who wa good in natur scienc . but he never use to concentr on other subject as he found them uninterest and worthless . becaus of hi attitud he got lot lower mark in the final and could not qualifi for the state govern higher educ colleg . he had to settl with a privat colleg . the main import reason for hi descend is by gain lot of knowledg in one particular field , he might have thought that he ha noth to learn further and stop learn all of a sudden , which is a danger pattern for ani individu . also he might have got bore and stop concentr on other topic as a whole . the abov exampl in my life convinc me that by gain knowledg of mani issu and topic will help you interact more express with your colleagu and make you more social interact . also with chang world all the time everi second , by keep thi attitud in your mind , will help you adapt quickli and smoothli .
