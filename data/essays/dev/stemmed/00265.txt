nowaday young peopl ha chang a lot , their educ chang and they chang with it , is suposs to be a more liber educacion with less rule and more freedom , but mayb we are give freedom to peopl that is not readi to use it properli yet . what i want to say with that is that young peopl today spend more time look at themselv than tri to be part of the societi . mayb is becaus they are live in a societi that do not offer them what they are look for and for that reason the are not in the mood to particip of their commun . we are live in the telecomun era . you can live without human touch . without go out of your own hous . most of young peopl think that hi commun is to small for them so they use internet to feel they are part of someth realli great , to feel importan . they do not mind if hi neighbour need salt or if hi hometown is clean or not . they are upon all that . as an exampl i can use new kind of cultur that i have red about in a magacin last week . it is a new way of life , it is veri extend in japan , and their philosophi of life is not to have ani person relat if it is not via internet . so they bork off whit their famili and with their friend and they star live all by themselv . use internet for everyth , for work , make their shope , make friend and all the natur thing that we are use to do in our live . hear thing like that i have got the hopp that mayb in the futur young peopl will help their commun , mayb they would be cybercommun but the main idea is to be part of someth .
