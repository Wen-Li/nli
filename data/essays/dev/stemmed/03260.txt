the new thing i agre if you tri new thing and take more risk you can achiev your goal and earn big money . i am talk abaout money becaus my major is a intern trade in my univers and i would like to do thi busi buy an d sell someth . i know how to do thi job but i think tri new thing for instanc you can buy anoth product and you can chang it and sell . it ha more risk , may be you can not sell cahang product . successful peopl in my countri alway tri new thing for their goal . they are sometim loos but if they win , they would have more profit . for exampl , it a biggest turkish compani . first it a shoe compani , they produc shoe and export it . they know how to do well shoe . one day the owner who ha a compani tri anoth thing they sell all of hi properti ( hi factori , hi busi , hi car , etc . ) and he bought a land for produc onion . he doesnt know anyth about how to produc onion , how to sell . ? ts like a gambl . he found a farmer who is live in a rural place . he help to produc onion and sell process . and they found small packag for onion . for exampl 1pound , 3 pound packag and they sold directli market . it make more profit and more useful for consum . and he ha a onion brand name . now the ex shoe produc ha a big onion 's farm and he earn 1 billion dollar a year , he is export onion all over the world it a big deal . in my opinion tri new thing and take a risk are not good for everyon becaus you need a littl bit good luck in your busi life .
