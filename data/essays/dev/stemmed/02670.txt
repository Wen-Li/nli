peopl are alway tend to pursu the most that they may obtain . when it come to the aspect of knowledg obtain , the situat is similar . howev , sometim they have to choos whether to have broad knowledg of mani academ subjet than to special in one specif subject . for myself , i will choos the latter , but will tri to get some balanc as well . nowday , knowledg is explod everyday , as a result , it is rather difficult for one to learn broadli and deepli at the same time . have broad knowledg seem attract , but actual , it is not practic after the second thought . in the academ circl , there are expert and author in almost everi field , all of whom hold some specif research interest and accompish of their own . if one just spend most of the time on learn knowledg of mani subject , he or she may not have the time to do relat research . besid , sinc it is quit easi to gain inform current , it is not necessari to know all , for if you want , you can look the need inform soon . howev , if one special in one specif subject , thing will be quit differ , especi when he or she choos a valuabl but rarely-touch field . under thi situat , he or she will becom the expert in thi field and it is possibl to do some quit profound research on it , which will be more benifit if one know about a lot but realli know littl on each subject . as long as the research are will to share their result , communicat to each other , and do teamwork when it is necessari , it doe not matter whether all these research are abl to have broad knowledg . at the same time , to keep some balanc , it is also import for a research to know some basic knowledg on relat subject , which could broaden the eyesight and inspir him or her fresh idea . besid , thi will not wast too much time . to sum up , gener , i think it is better for one to special in cetain subject , but it will be good to know some concern knowledg at the same time , which can make the work most effect .
