the answer to thi question depend of the situat that a particular person is at a time . in the case that the person doe not know the citi or place that is be visit , i would recomend to contract a tour guid and do it in a group becaus he is go to take you to the most import place in a quick , safe and with all the explan need to know the place that you are visit , and also you can enjoy the compani of other peopl , give you the oportun to meet and share experi . one of the most import thing when you are travel is to see the cultur of the place , for exampl the food , danc , festiv , etc. and i think that a tour guid can help you to accomplish thi goal , also the tour guid can give you histor inform about the place which is veri import when tri to understand the way the resid of the region visit behav . on the other hand i think that if you have been befor in the region and special if you have been there for a coupl time , hire a tour giud is a wast of money and time , becaus thi kind of servic are usual expens and you can use that money in someth more product in you trip , also the tour guid is go to take you to place where you have alreadi been . instead of that you can use that time to visit new place of the region , do someth differ than your last visit . so the conclus for thi is that it depend base on you previo experi on visit the region . i will absolutli recomend so in the case that it is you first time , but if you have been befor i do not see ani reason to take a tour .
