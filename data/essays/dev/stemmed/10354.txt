it is a common statement that today young peopl do not give enought time to hepl their commun . although i think it is not alway true , and each case should be consider a part , i agre with thi statement for sever differ reason . nowaday we are live in a world much more competit than the past one wa , furthermor , famili is today normal compos onli by parent and son and thi fact doe n't help youg peopl to develop their sens of comun . firt of all , the word where we are live in is get more and more complex : for a young person is more diffucult today to achiv hi or her goal , to have a success career ad a good job in order to give safeti to hi or her new famili . thi fact impli that today there 's gener not enought time to spend on take care of someon els , like their commun . the second problem is relat to the normal structur of a famili . live in a such a small unit does't permit to develop , from chilhood , a sens of comun and solidarieti for other person . if someon is use to live in a famili with mani brother and sister , and also grandpar , uncl and aunt , he would be mayb more sensit to the problem of the other . in conclus , i have to agre with the statement that sai that today yong peopl do n't spend much time on hepl their commun for the reason that i explain befor . i 've said `` i have to agre '' becaus i think thi is not a posit fact , and it give a bad idea about young peopl , but , with sorri , i have to say that thi is the truth .
