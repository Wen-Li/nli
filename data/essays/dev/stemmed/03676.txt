i am in accord with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . the reason way i am in accord it is that i suppos that success peopl are vocat to make better in ani way they oper , and they want everytim a new target , much difficult from the past , to obtain . for thi reason they tri new thing and sometim they take risk but thi give them the sensat of the power and the potenti they have . the normal peopl see them and consid that in the same situat or posit they did n't take risk fairli like the success peopl do . infact normal peopl mani time , consid success peopl too much out of world for the reason that i mention at last . contrari to the normal peopl think i consid ordinari that success peopl goe in anoth way from normal peopl becaus , if it is not true , they can be success peopl . the success of a person it is give first of all by natur becaus a success peopl , befor he had success , he wa born with particular abil in speck , play in gener and to made better wath he had to do , respect the other peopl . with the growth up of the person the success come to the peopl that had thi particular abil sice they wa young and for thi reason they becam `` effect '' success peopl . the societi in gener consid that take risk is the better way to falliment or the die . i support a differ posit , and thi is that if a man did n't take mani risk in hi life continu to be the littl ordinari man that he is . but if a man take mani risk ( not everytim , but sometim ) it is a sign of that he could be a success peopl . the success peopl have to hi part the luki , infact sometim he made an activ with much more success than a normal peopl could obtain . thi is a particular but it is n't want by peopl : it is a supernatur want .
