not just becaus i am a lawyer i can neither agre nor disagre to thi statement becaus it is far to gener . a person who doe not enjoy life as a young person will most like also not enjoy life when he becom older just becaus he ha just never `` learn '' to enjoy life . even if you look a the question as a comparison of peopl at one defin time one ca n't evalu which group of peopl enjoy life more than the other becaus it just depend on to mani factor and age itself is rather an unimport one of these . much more import are factor like , health , relativ wealth , and environ . howev i believ the most import factor is person attitud . person attitud is so import it can even outweight mani or even all factor . anybodi would agre to thi in gener howev veri few tri to benifit from thi fact . e.g. somebodi who is healthi , rich and live in a peradis among mani friend but will is unhappi would look for a reason and mayb just come up with the fact that he is rel old . the other exampl would be a young , poor , sick , and lone person . thi person could still be happi and enjoy life and would not even think about the question whi he would do that . whether you are young or old doe not indic anyth about whether or not you enjoy life . i person think that my life ha improv a lot sinc i have grown up . i think i will never fight my age but work on myself to improv myself and my attitud and to enjoy the thing that are realli import in my life which are my two son and my wife . if my famili and i stay healthi than what els do i need ?
