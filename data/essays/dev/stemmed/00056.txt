ye , i agre with the statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . the homo sapien can be broadli classif into two categori . the first categori consist of those peopl who are happi to live a risk-fre normal life . they like to get up in the morn , do the hous chore and leav for the offic , sit in a cubicl and spend 8 hour 5 day a week . they want to enjoy the weekend with the famili and live happili ever after . the main charaterst of thi categori is that they want to live their life exactli in the same manner as their neighbour is live . the onli exampl that come to my mind for thi categori is the common man . thi is what differenti them from the other categori of homo sapien . they make a contribut to the societi as a whole but their individu contribut is minim . they will not be rememb becaus of the fact that they do what they are told to do . the second categori of homo sapien are those who actual make the world a better place to live in . peopl in thi categori have the name like albert einstein , thoma edison , mahatma gandhi , yuri gagarin , and mani other . what make them special is the fact that they all were curiou and excit to explor new area in their field . albert einstein and thoma edison made a breakthrough in scienc , gave us gravtiy and elctric respect . mahatma gandhi creat rippl in the polit world through hi approach of non-viol movement . becaus yuri gagrin dare to enter into space , that we were abl to think beyond the planet earth . these peopl had some characterst similar at root level . they were readi to work in a monoton environ . they were readi to risk anyth to prove their point .
