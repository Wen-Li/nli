i believ that a strong conclus tell that have a broad knowledg of academ subject are better than special in one specif subject would be faulti . there are both advantag and disadvantag of the two . first , be an expert on a special field is unquestion necessari . the develop of scienc is base on use the knowledg gain by our ancestor . so . in order to make use of previous conduct research on specif topic and to take them to further point , we need specialist . a man have a broad knowledg in mani field would not work in thi kind of a situat . second , in our daili life , we can clearli observ the necess for specialist . for exampl , think of a situat that you are sick and went to the doctor . the first doctor you went to would probabl be a repres of a person that ha a broader knowledg on human bodi . you would expect that doctor to direct you to a specialist for the specif health problem you have . then you would need a doctor special on your problem . thi situat also illustr the necess for both . final , peopl that are special on a topic may sometim becom blind by the long time of same kind of work they are deal with . in such case , a broader knowledg person could see the big pictur and would be more benefici to solv the problem . to illustr , industri engin , which is my major field , requir see the big pictur in a compani as we tri to solv the problem in it . when we deal with the problem state by a depart in the compani , we observ that the depart doe not consid the possibl caus of the problem which can actual be caus by ani other depart . so , thi experi of me from summer internship indic the possibl disadvantag of work on the same topic all the time . in conclus , we need both specialist and peopl have broad knowledg sinc they are both need for solv the problem of human be in the real life . so , a clear conclus that one of the posit is better than the other would be veri mislead .
