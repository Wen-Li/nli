advertis often teas the pospect custom with the newest , most advanc and simpli coolest good or servic . to be uniqu in a divers market environ it is liter inevit to cheat the buyer . advertis have to have a short and stong messag . due to thi brief it is imposs to present the product in an appropri and honest way . consum who bought a product which wa advertis as reliabl or easi to use often are unsatisfi with what they final hold in their hand . but who is to blame ? of cours the compani are present the product in the best possibl way , that 's what i would do too . on the other hand we , the custom , do n't want to hear lenghti advertis in which product are explain in detail . the phenomenon of wrongli advertis product is not a new one . in my opinion peopl should be clever enough to know that compani say whatev it take to sell a product . for exampl when a cellphon is advertis the commerci could say : the best cellphon ever built . thi statement , of cours , can not be proov by anyon . therefor we have an exager and probabl even a fals statement . anoth exampl is food and drink . how can a commerci serious say : the most delici burger ever . a custom who buy and tri it ultim ha the expect of a great burger . but what if he doe n't like it . thi mean the advertis industri is neither abl to shape our tast nor to advertis product in a proper way . so far i have been describ the black sheep among the advertis compani . nonetheless there are compani who present their product honestli without exagger or even lie . especi when comparison are made the custom can be sure to watch a good advertis . in the end it 's all up the the prospect custom whether a commerci is believ or not .
