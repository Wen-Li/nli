i do not think that in twenti year there will be less car in use than today . it is no like to happen becaus automobil repres a huge engin for today 's economi and some peopl wo n't let their gold mine to be close . for exampl , let think about the tire industri and the posit of goodyear or pirelli about the decreas in the number of car in the near futur . i have no doubt they would use as mani resourc as they have to undermin everi idea or project that could result in a contract of their market . anoth exampl is the fuel industri , better said the busi of mobil , bp , texaco and a few more brand . they have been invest billion of dollar tri to avoid the develop of altern sourc of energi for automobil . their biggest busi is to produc car 's fuel and they wo n't let it go so easili . if they are contrari to car transform , logic they will fight fierc against automobil diminish . anoth exampl of how econom issu wo n't let the number of car go smaller is the fact that public invest in the western countri consist mainli in road build . about 50 % of the public budget all around the western countri are use to aloud car circul . if the number of that kind of vehicl radic goe down , it will produc a huge administr collaps sinc the tradit polit economi would be mennac . in concluss , neither the tire industri , nor the fuel produc or the public planner and administr of the western countri will aloud the number of car in use to decreas . in fact , i think in twenti year the econom pressur around the car relat industri and econom field will not onli imped the decreas , but will boost the automobil use .
