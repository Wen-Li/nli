in our societi student were confront with new knowledg in school , but the question of whether or not it is more import for them to unterstand idea and cencept instead of learn the fact it is anoth matter . from my point of view it is veri difficult to take side over the other in these argument becaus it seem to me that there are both advantag and also disadvantag . in the follow passag i will make my point of view clear . on the on hand , i think that it is in same subject import to unterstand the idea and the concept . in thi context i can mention my own experi in my school time . i realiz and unterstood math just becaus i realli learnt the differ way which i could choos to come to a solut . it wa sometim definit hard to unterstand . howev , it lead to a deeper unterstand in thi area . anoth argument i can mention in thi context is the histori class i attend . histori contribut so mani fact of the past which are not essenti to becom an educ student . while there are positiv aspect for becom awar of a good unterstand of idea , i feel that it is in some subject not necessari to unterstand the whole background of the subject . sport for instanc is a veri theoret lesson and the histori is not import . consequ , my argument make clear that it depend on the topic if a teacher realli should confront their student with all the inform which are avail or if he better focu just on the import and signific one .
