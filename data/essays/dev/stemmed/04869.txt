do young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ? perhap it is diffecult to answer becaus everi one of them have their method to enjoy their own life . but in my opinion , old peopl enjoy life more than young one becaus of sever reason so i disagre with thi statement . first , old peopl have a long experi in life so they know exactli how they enjoy . in contrast , young peopl do't have enough experi . for an exampl , mybe an young person tri to enjoy by someth which is harm but he did n't know , and after some time he enjur him self . but an old one may have an experi with that thing so he will not tri it again . second , even though that young person have a lot of chois to enjoy but in the sane time they have sever thing to worri about . for exampl , their job , their busi , their famili , their healthi and other thing that the life now requir to worri about . on the other hand , old person do n't have ani thing to worri about except thei healthi . for exampl , young person go to the gym to enjoy and whil he excersic he rememb someth that make him go out from the gym and lose that enjoy time . but the old one will not care about ani other thing than hi enjoy and hi health . final , everi one ha hi own enjoy .
