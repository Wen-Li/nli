with the develop of our countri 's econom . travel becom a new fashion of spend the time of holiday . now there is a heat concern over whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . some peopl think travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best choic . from their point of view , the guid will give you a plan and arrang your travel rout . well , thi might be good , if the place you want to go is in the plan of the tour guid . howev , as far as i am concern , travel in a group led by a tour guid is not the best choic . i prefer travel alon . first and foremost , trave by oneself can do whatev you want to . you can go on the internet , search the place you admir , learn more knowledg about it , find the way to it . the follow thing is to find some time , pick up your bag , take some food , go directli to the place you want . you do not need to go to the place you are not interest in or you have ever been to . equal import is that the time for travel by oneself is flexibl . you can do travel by ani time in ani season . if you appreci some place of interest , just stay a littl long , look around more about it . it doe no matter with other . while in a group , you have to respect the opinion of other ' . in the end , anoth point that we should not forget is that some tour guider will take travel to some place that peopl do not want to . guider may take travel to some local market where the price are veri high . meanwhil , the good are inferior . all in all , i disagre with the satement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . travel by one 's own wiil much happier .
