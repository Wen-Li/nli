the world is chang , also peopl are chang . young peopl becam more irrespons , the world becam more competit and young peopl start not to care about thing happen around themselv . first of all , young peopl are irrespons to what they do . young peopl are not help the commun . we ca n't say , not at all . but it is reduc compar to long ago when it wa 1900 , when the revolut were occur . at that time the lead group wa univers student . but these day , those age peopl are harm and ruin the societi . sinc they do n't have ani difficulti such as coup de ta't , war , or revolut . they becam addict to drug , crime and other bad stuff . they are not respons to what they did , especi for rich peopl when they make problem , they ask their parent to solv the problem . these irrespos act by young peopl ruin the societi more than past . secondli , the world becam more competit . sinc , the unemploy goe high and competit rasi . young peopl do n't have time to help their own commun , besid commun servic which they have to do as a school work . young peopl should spend their time more in the studi to get a job or to make their busi bigger . otherwis they will be buri from the societi . for exampl , my countri dure the 1970 peopl who graduat univers could choos compani where they want to work . but these day , even from the first rank univers ca n't get a job . the percentag they get a job wa 77 percent . it mean it will becom harder and harder . also , the competit will be more and more . lastli , young peopl do not care about thing happen around them . young peopl becam selfish becaus of the second reason . so that they becam dull about other peopl 's harsh and hardship . so when they see old peopl stand in the bu when they are sit down . they rather ignor them or pretend sleep . young peopl do n't want to involv other peopl 's busi , especi danger thing . when i wa watch news program , i saw an interest news that show the survey . the survey ask peopl that when they see pervert in a crowd subway . most of peopl answer they will ignor it . they think that that 's not their busi . as time goe by , the world becam harder to live . and lesser peopl are help the difficulti in societi , even though the societi becom harder , i want to encourag young peopl to help their societi . when they ask me whi , i will answer that `` you will see the differ .
