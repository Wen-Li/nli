there is a common belief that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are peopl who do not believ that advertis do not say the truth but the oppon of the subject do not think so . i also agre that advertis make the product seem better that they realli are . here are three main aspect whi adverti may lie . first to think about advertis is their purpos of prepar . advertis are design to convinc the consum to buy or consum that particular product . in order to convinc a consum for a product , one should make him believ that he realli need that particular product or make him believ that the product is best at all . for both of the purpos , the product ha to be shown to be the best . thi bring us the possibl that advertis may reflect non-real fact about a prodct . secondli advertis are prepar to increas the profit for the specif product . the produc , who would like to profit more and more , would also agre to display a non-realist advertis in order to make the product seem better so that increas the sale . when the sale increas , the profit also increas . in short if the product seem better , it sale increas and thi lead to a higher profit for the compani . final , the third purpos of an advertis is to help the compani to domin in the market . compani have to compet with each other with respect to their product in order to surviv in the market . so an advertis that show a specif product better that that of anoth compani would make that specif compani to win the race among the compani . thi again show that advertis are not design to describ a product but rahter make it seem better . in short , peopl believ that advertis make the product seem better thatn they realli are , are right to think so . becaus advertis are prepar in the thought of financi profit . a compani would not agre to say the truth in the cost of earn less .
