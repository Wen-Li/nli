the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid is a statement i can total agre with and my opinion is base on sever factor . first off , the main reason of travel usual is to explor the place visit , and see the beauti attract in it . that 's whi it is necessari to find a profession and experienc local to guid you to the place becaus he know hi job and he know what he 's do so he would with no doubt take you to the place often tourist admir like : beauti scene and natur beauti . for an exampl , i rememb when i went with my famili to egypt . i rememb we met thi young woman who wa appoint to meet us as our tour guid . i ca n't find word to describ how excel were her choic and how greatli were we satisfi with the place we have seen and the activ we 've taken part of , sinc we saw most of the breath-tak attract in giza like : the pyramid , sphinx and the nation museum in that area where we had thi short lesson about hyroglyph . also get a tour guid who 's also local can make a splendid combin becaus you ca n't find someon who 'd tri hard to show you place in hi town to make you love the place like a local . second off all , by get a tour guid you can avoid some great deal of troubl you may face if you were all alon . tour guid often accompani with secur guard who 're common and familiar with situat that can caus some tourist a kind of unhappi , or make them uncomfort or in worst case be in danger such as : get caught in the overwhelm traffic , be lost , get a good deal of disturb by beggar , or even in worst case be endag by tourist-target crimin . so that 's whi i do think that tour guid are a must , instead of go solo , get unsatisfi with what you see and give the place you visit a bad name as a result of that choic you 've taken .
