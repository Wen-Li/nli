although i understand whi some peopl think it is more import for student to learn fact , i think that it 's more effici for them to understand idea and concept . to my view , there are three reason whi idea and concept prevail . first , idea and concept enabl a student to understand not onli one fact but also plenti other fact becaus fact happen onc and idea can explain mani fact . for exampl , you can know how to cook a specif cake but if you understand how cake are made in gener you will be abl to cook everi cake . it mean that by understand a fact , a student would be abl to anticip onli thi precis fact next time he experi it . instead , if a student understand the concept he will be abl to anticip the outcom of mani relat fact . secondli , idea and concept are the first thing that you learn at school and i think it is effici . for instanc , in mathemat , you alway begin by learn the rule befor appli them . moreov , theori is someth that gather inform from the experi of other peopl . that is exactlwhat the teacher is teach : concentr experi rather than a fact . last , accord to my personn experi i think it 's more import to understand first idea and concept . i creat a fashion compani but i knew onli a few thing about thi industri . thank to my knwloedg that i have learn in class i wa abl to adapt and anticip thing as i alreadi knew thi industri . for exampl , market concept can be use for everi industri . by use them i wa abl to cleat the hurdl which wa my ignor of the industri . to conclud , i think that idea and concept prevail on fact and that is whi . still , as i said at the begin , i understand peopl who think the opposit becaus you need to fact to understand how to appli the theori .
