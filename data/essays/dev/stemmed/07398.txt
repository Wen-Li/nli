the statement say the young peopl enjoy more than older peopl . person , i do n't agre thi statment in all of thi part . infact , by my point of view the young peopl is less respons of other matur peopl . gener , in the last year the way to enjoy life is chang . infact today young peol have less problem than young peopl of forti year ago for exampl . today a boy depend total from hi parent . in thi way he have less respons and thi caus a total insoddisfact of all . instead of the young peopl , the older peopl have achiev a total matur that permitt they to enjoy life more than young peopl with small thing , like a onli dinner with friend or a travel with famili . it is also true that the young boy have a lot of enthusiam respect to older peopl . but thi concept do n't go to over see the problem . there are also case where older peopl do n't enjoy life beacus they have veri big problem like the fact of to not fand a work or for exampl becaus their are veri tyre . so , my person opinion is that the young boy , in the state of pariti of condit , do n't enjoy life so much . infact also in my famili i see that my parent enjoy life more than me and my brother . final , in thi way i say that i disagre with the abov statement .
