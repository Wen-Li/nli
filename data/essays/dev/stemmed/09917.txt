how would you react if an adult tell you that he wa more happi when he wa a child ? doe it mean that becom an adult , dissip happi and good time ? accord to my own experi , i think that peopl were get happier when they were children . they just live how there mind guid them trough without think about consequ . firstli , i think that young peopl are happier than adult becaus they do not care about anyth materi . they live their life without think about the consequ . inde , everyth they want to do is possibl , so they just have to realis what their heart tell them to do . peopl are use to say that mankind are lead by money and interest , contrari to children who are onli guid trough life by happi and pleasur . for exampl a young boy doe not care about what hi mum is do . but her mum must take care of her babi , and she ha to safe ihim and protect him from danger . we can also say that young peopl are in good heealth that abl them to live their life without money problem , job problem and more . .. they spend most of their time play with their friend without be disturb . accord to my own experi , i can say that be a child is the best period of your life . you do not have to care about anyth than just play outsid . you are not stress by your destini and by the world around you . but say that adult do not enjoy their life is wrong but it is a question of prioriti , yopu hqve less think to count of .
