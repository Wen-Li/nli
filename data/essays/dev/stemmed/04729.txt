i think that it much better for a person to have a special knowledg of a specif subject than have a broad knowledg of mani academ . becaus be special in one subjuct get you to know more about it and to be abl to discuss it easili and thoroughli without ani problem , unlik have a broad knowledg of mani academ becaus have broad knowledg leav you on the sufac of eveyth not be abl to dive in ani subject . for exampl if you where in a convers session or on a debat about someth , have broad knoweg would let you be abl to talk for alittl bit with everbodi use the thin layer of knowledg you have to discuss stuff with peopl , but if you are specifi in one subject you may be abl to get into a deep intrest convers . also be special in one subject give you better work opportin than the opportun given to broad knowledg peopl . becaus these day institut want special peopl that can handl complicati iss in buis and life , peopl that can be put in hard situat wich they can handl easili without panic and to problem , and talk about money wise these institut pay alot more money for those specefi peopl . anoth thing is that when we talk about the career issu special peopl are alway rememb and respect everywher they go and thier name will not ever be forget , broad knowleg peopl they are not well known or at least the major of them . for exampl when we tri to say who is the best in chemestri of all time we have a name , or when we tri to rememb who is the best in math we have name . that doe not mean that peopl who have broad knowleg are bad or have less experi but i think that special peopl leav thier memori on the mind of other or they leav thier finger print on the book of histori .
