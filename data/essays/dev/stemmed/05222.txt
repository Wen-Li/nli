in mani situat , as human be , peopl are often cage or trap in a knowledge-cag and onli some except will occour onc in a while . not say that know alot is a bad idea but , special in a perticular area is the step of leav your name in a histori book . the depth of which a perticular area of knowledg is explor is far more beneifitu than have a broad knowledg of everi academ subject . therefor , i strongli disagre with the statement , sinc that onli guid you more into a --- normal person . from not onli histor evid but also person experi , special in a certain area of knowledg would sure make you speical from all the rest , not onli so , it is the best way of lead to sucess in futur life . to begin with , a famou biologist english plant scientist ha made the most remark achiev to the area of biolog . but , when you ask what he differ from the rest of the biologist scientist ? is becuas of hi consist and special work in the observ of pea plant ; he studi the same plant for over 20 year and thu , final he got a nobel prize for he achiever . not onli , he will be rememb but hi work of invest and achiev to the ground of genet code will also do great benefit to the rest of the societi . further more , a famou french wirter call `` silva plyth '' is famou for the poem that she wrote , the sad and emot through her poem ; by read her poem , emot and a sens of sad would soon aris . she is not ani differ from ani other poet but , onli one aspect which is differ would make her so famou , is the fact that her use of metaphor and the descript of surround is known to be so percis and carri a sens of shadi cloud through read her work . thi , made her work still popular and is now what mani modern poet are look to achiev and tri to copi her style . lastli , not onli peopl that are in the academ area are famou but also , one of the most famou person which most peopl would know is , `` the great michael jordan '' he is known for hi basketbal skill . howeevr , mani do not know that even though he may seem to be the best basketbal player in that time , it wa onc said by hi colleg professor and hi colleg coach that , `` it seem like basketbal and michael ha a strong bond , he seem to onli know how to play good basketbal '' and sure , the world ha prove him right , he had won himself billion and billion of dollor and fame , just simpli by do play good basketbal . in conclus , from these exampl , we can clearli see that be spcializ in a specic area would not onli make one famou but also , it would sure leav one name in the histori book . by thi , i strongli disagre with the p
