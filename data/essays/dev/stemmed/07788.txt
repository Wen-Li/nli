in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . thi is an interest view of the futur life . nowaday there are lot of car . in everi famili with four peopl there are at least two car . thi is a big problem about pollut and environ . car are everywer , we do n't move without them and we do n't use veri much pubblic transport like buse or train . gener peopl work in citi where there are lot of pubblic trasport but they prefer to park near the offic or near the factori . it should be an idea to start to go by buse or by train but there are other problem . if they want that more peopl catch train , train will must be alway on time and cleaner . on the other hand i do n't think that peopl will leav their car at home . car is a statu symbol . with a big car you can show to the other that you have a lot of money and a good job . in addict technolog involv and thi will permit to elimin petroil and to use other materi . so pollut will be elimin . in conclus i hope that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today becaus i 'd prefer go by bicycl or by pubblic transport but i do n't think that thi will be possibl and mayb the ca use will be more than nowaday .
