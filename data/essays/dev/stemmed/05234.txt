one thing histori teach mank is that extrem are never the best solut . they might serv one purpos for a short term , but on the longer run they usual reveal their shortcom . the veri same rule can be appli in thi case . at a first glanc , the advantag of a specifi knowledg seem to be overwhelm . nearli everi modern compani or even scientist in univers serv as good exampl . to be success in your part of busin , you have to know everyth about it , and addit knowledg onli serv as distract . sinc the time of big breaktrough-invent are all gone , everybodi special on a veri narrow field . on a small subject , we now have an absolut expert , know nearli everyth about it . to a certain extend thi is absolut necessari . who els can deal with nano-composit , for exampl , exept someon who ha studi thi subject for mani year ? but as soon as an wider overview is need , thi type of scientist veri often fail how can he know about new method in medicin , that might well be adopt within the field of nano composit , if all they ever studi are nano-composit ? it is therefor possibl , that lack interdisciplinari skill often result in disadvantag . furthermor , a person with a tremend amount of knowledg on onli one field most definit lack interest in other thing , and therefor miss so mani thing in life . the other extrem would be peopl who know someth about everyth , but noth of import about ani specif field . while these scientist might have the interdisciplinari skill , they would certainli lack the knowledg they need to combin anyth of real use and import . there is simpli no need for these person in academia , sinc a certain understand of specif problem is alway need . i therefor strongli support the idea of a combin of these two type . of cours i am awar of the fact , that we can never gain specif knowledg on all academ subject . thi will remain an illus . i favor the humanist approach . special on one or two subject , but never loos your abiliti to overview a wider field . if you are a mechan engin , do n't loos your interest for theatr .
