i have a quit open opinion about the statement that `` in twenti yearsther will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . on the one hand i would total agre thi . each day you can read somewher in the newspap , how the price if petroil increas from day to day . petroil reach hi highest price and there might be no decreas in the next year . as well as the limit oil reserv which begin to reduc everi hour , it will be difficult to drice a car . perhap peopl will wake up and use the public transport , like the bu or train . that would lead to a better environ , becaus pollut and nois would reduc . as we could also see with the transrapid the public transport develop is great . on the other hand we all see that there is no end of new car produc . nearli each inhabit over 18 - year ha onc drove a car . unfortun for a lot of peopl , car are a symbol of standard and lifestyl . they like to express their positon in the societi . some also dont want to give up drive a car , becaus it is a comfort way of get somewher quick and easili . for a lot of peopl , especi men , car are more than onli a thing to transport them . it is a play thing , which they like to show and compar with other . conclus , i think there will be fewer car in twenti year becaus some peopl in futur have to stop drive their own car . insur and petroil will becom too expens , when the price will further increas .
