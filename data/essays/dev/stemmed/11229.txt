some peop in japan say that young peopel give enough time to help their comun , howev , i agre with the satament that young peopel do not ginv enough time to help their comun for the followin reason , first , youug peopl can not have enough time to help their commun becaus it is harder for yourg peopl to live on fo theirselv . for exampl , i have start work in the goldman sach , which is one of the most famou invest bank , in the tokyo branch in japan from 1996 . at that time japanes economi wa the worst of the worst , so it wa veri difficuit for young peopel to find out and hold even a work place in japan . fortunet , i found a good compani to work for , and sinc then , i had work for long time everi day without long sleep and a lot of rest . consid thi situat , we , young peopl , can not have enough time to suoport our commyn . second , comun ha been decay themselv . for exampl , i live in roppongi , tokyo , japan , which is one of the cental district of japan . a lot of youg peopl , who have to work for long time for themselv , live in thi area . at thi area , each peopl doe not have ani idea that a commun exist itself . in thi circumst young peopl do not think to help for the commun . so they do not give no time to help their commun . consid the situat in rural area , there might be opposit opinion mention abov . but a lot of young peopel think for the opinion mention abov . thu , i strongli believ that young poepel do not give enough time to support ther commun .
