i believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are two reason as follow . first of all , most peopl would agre that the product in the advertis are present under the best circumst sinc the purpos of advertis is to sell the product . for exampl , cloth manufactur and design put their cloth on good look model which make cloth more attract . anoth exampl can be food advertis . food is present in the best dish with pictur perfect lighten and everyth . i rememb that i had to return some of the product i bought becaus they were differ from what i had seen on the ad . secondli , advertis is one of the most power way for produc to communn and convinc peopl that their product are benefiti to cutom , therefor , peopl tend to emphas the strength of the product rather than show their shortcom unless they are legal ask to do . for exampl , when we listen to tv or radio commerci such as cosmet item , we feel like that item can be solut to all of our skin problem . the ad doe not say how time or money consum the product can be . that is , i think , one of the reason that certain product such as cigarett or sleep pill are requir to state the possibl side effect . unless the law requir , compani would not want to show their shortcom . as i state abov , advertis are use to promot the slae and commun with cumstom and viewer in favor of the product . consequ , i am truli convinc that product are better project in advertis than they are in realiti in most case .
