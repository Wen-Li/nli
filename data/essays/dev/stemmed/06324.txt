nowaday , car are major mean of transport . they have been use for over 100 year . somehow , peopl are now addict to car . it ha becom an essenti thing in our everyday life . besid , it 's unlik that peopl get rid of that mean of transport . there is alway someth new to learn , to discov . car might be technolog advanc in twenti year , but i hardli think there will be fewer car in use . in saudi arabia , peopl tend to use more and more car , as everi singl famili ha , in averag , 2 car . actual , car need mainten , energi , fuel . the onli reason that could lead to the decreas use of car are the unsuffieci quantiti of petroleum . as we all know , that ressourc is limit on the earth , and we could run out of fuel in 50 year . howev , the human be is known to be solut finder : we could probabl invent new car that work on anoth energi , for exampl the sun energi . actual , some of these car are be test all over the world . that suggest the fact that there is alway a solut for everi problem . in my opinion , i think car are veri use , even though they make air pollut . it ha serv the man for centuri . but , eventu , if there is no more petroleum , car are useless . that natur factor could be the major reason of the usingless of that mean of transport . in conclus , that statemnet is wrong if there is not that natur factor that stop us from provid energi to make our car work .
