well it a kind of statement that can be made just to encourag kid to learn more and new thing in their life . but as the say goe that `` all that glitter is not gold '' the same can be appli to success peopl as well . the fundament caus of thi problem is not in the peopl we talk about , but it within us . it is becaus we alway measur a success person onli when hi / her work achiev more recognit / fame and or money and that he/sh is realli worth someth which most of us are not . thu it veri hard to judg and measur success in term of money or fame or recognit , as for him it just a task he want to accomplish for himself . let consid a sport say soccer . we know that some of the player do play veri well compar to rest of the player of that game , but in realiti they onli play those game which they practic for year without have to gain success in other game . the veri same way we can not just say the founder of microsoft ha been a veri success person as he did not do ani thing apart from be in the busi of provid softwar for comput . i wonder how much of knowledg or expertis he would have in the area of mine , the same would be the case in the design ware and cloth segment of busi . interestingli there wa an argument that walmart or the other chain store should be consid success peopl . i would opin against the peopl as well in term of success as what they had been do is that of sell . i definit would have said some peron success if he would have achiev a good name and money in the area of sell , also gain the same momentum in other area such as manufactur and in research . thu i would rather say that some peopl remain success even when they tri new thing .
