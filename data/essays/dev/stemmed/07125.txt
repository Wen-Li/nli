the issu at hand is whether success peopl should take risk or do what they alreadi know how to do well . the issu is import becaus we are face with a lot of daili `` risk '' in thi manner . i believ that one should tri new thing and explor all the oppurtun around him/her . i believ thi becaus ' life is full of risk and if someon ( a success person ) doe not take ani risk , then he/sh will end up losing/miss a lot of good oppurtun that the life bring in . first of all , i believ that all the risk gener offer a great benefit in return . if one doe not want to take ani risk , he/sh will receiv no benefit . for exampl , a bank offer you a new type of bond which can bring you an addit incom of 1000 $ per year . that is great ! whi not go get it , and go for a 100 $ bring '' safe type '' becaus `` you alreadi know how to do it well '' . in my opinion , a person who goe for a 100 $ is not awar of his/her abil , and it is a shame to not to take a risk . in my view , a success person would never miss it , and that is whi they are call success ! secondli , life is full of risk and one can not be success by choos to stay conserv . everyday , life bring in thousand of new oppurtun to a lot of peopl and most of those oppurtun can add beauti to your life ( of cours not everyth is relat to money ) . for exampl , take a risk and join a good club to meet new peopl : beauti can be in term of friendship , whi not ? that is whi , i believ that a person who alway goe for what he/sh alreadi know can never discov new oppurtun in life , but a success person util these oppurtun in all the good way . final , in my opinion , success peopl do not lose oppurtun . when one observ , i believ that one can infact detect success peopl by detect their risk-tak behaviour . success peopl are gener the one who not onli takem but `` catch '' more risk . to summar , i would like to say/and suggest that everyon should take more risk to be more success . take risk will alway bring them better thing in mani way that will make them success . if napoleon bonapart wa aliv , i believ he would say `` risk , risk , risk , success , success , success '' instead of `` money , money , money '' .
