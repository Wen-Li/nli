i disagre the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . in my opinoin , enjoy the life is to be peac in the innersid and live everyday without regret , then make yourself happi . in thi regard , i suppos that the real life for self usual start when a peopl ha hi own work and financi independantli . first of all , it is differ from the young peopl , who liter reli on their parent for their experditur , the older peopl are indep and pay all of their experditur by themselv . therefor , they can spend whatev they like and wherev they like to go at their own mean . besid , after have earn the experi from the life , most of peopl have their stabl goal for life and own interest . so , the process of presu their goal and interest is the time of enjoy their live . at last , especi for the elder peopl , who are retir and free of the respons to rais their children work for daili expenditur , have more time to enjoy the life . to summari , although the older peopl have more respons in life , they can also enjoy life as the same as the young peopl do for their indeped and matur .
