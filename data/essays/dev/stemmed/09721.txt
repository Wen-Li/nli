to tri to give an answer to thi import question i would say that i do n't realli agre . in my mind we have to keep fact in mind to improv and to understand concept . for instanc , when we made some mistak we alway could and should learn about it . that 's whi i think that some fact are realli import . concern nasism , we ca n't ignor that it ha exist and thi becaus peopl made some great mistak . they choos to put confid in a leader which wa a dictat and it end in a war that we could have avoid . now that we know how that kind of ideolog can be , we are awar that we better have to choos quietlier . but learn about some other fact is not alway as import as it is in thi case . some fact are useless if we consid cours as philosophi . some act influenc our live and our behaviour but some other are noth interest to developp conscienc and awar . but when we studi thi other point it rais anoth issu which is directli link to my first opinion : we have to learn fact to learn in gener . how ? becaus everth that seem to mean noth to you is mean more than you believ . nevertherless we can understand lot of thing without have learn everyth about the subject . we can know world war two without be born and have live dure thi war . you learn that there were million peopl who die for your freedom but even if you did n't felt what is wa to be affraid of bomb you can understand what it is like . so to conclud i would like to underlin that it doe n't matter with the way we improv thing . the most import is to be interest when you tri to learn someth to someon and to be curiou when it is you that is learn . we learn from everyth but not onli from fact .
