i agre with thi idea that chareng new thing and do n't care about fault . there are two reason : tri are profit and newt have usual fault and it need to growth . firstli , chareng can proceed tecnolog and deverop . for exampl , the histori of deveprop supac tecnolog were face to mani fault . in order to bing out human to the speac , mani fault roket lunch were happend . the space deverop are typic of tri new thing and overecom risk . secondari , if you do the same thing ordinari , it is imposs to growth . for exampl , although you learn someth in the school , you do n't take for the imform , the imform becam an invain . peopl have desir to know new thing by natur and they use the fommer imform . if they do n't tri newth , the life area would be narrow by now . threfor , i believ worth activ that peopl chaneng new thing and do n't worri fault .
