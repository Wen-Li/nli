the way we are educ is influenc a lot what we becom later . i think that have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is import . it can be veri useful when one want to interact with other peopl . it is essenti to share idea and thougth with other . in the profession life , for instanc , if somebodi in a compani ha to work with anoth depart , hi task will be much easier if he know a littl bit about the activ of thi depart . even if it is not a complet understand , it will be appreci by the other part . to give anoth exempl , relat to person life thi time , it is veri agreabl to be abl to argu or discuss when we meet someon new . without thi broad knowledg , how wolud we make contact , at least at the begin ? we would obvious miss the oportun to get in touch with peolp . i would say that , have a broad knowledg is realli a plu in life , it is like the promis to be welcom and integr almost wherev we go . on the other hand , i think we can not onli be satisfi with a broad knowledg . we need to go further sometim . we need to be in someth excit to keep a goal to our life . and thi can not be achiev without be special in one subject . again , professionali speak , it is essenti to be special . nobodi can pretend to a job , which is someth specif of cours , if one doe not know enough on thi particular topic . that is whi we usual start our studi by gener educ , a broad knowledg , and then , graduali focu , year after year , on what we want to do . plu , i think it is someth veri valuabl for a human be to go in depth of someth , to prove to ourselv that we are abl to do someth special , someth that defin us . to conclud , i would say that both approach are necessari . we need both to learn thing about our environ , about the world , in order to interact , but we need to surviv , by say , `` i can bring you thi , i can be helpful with thi '' .
