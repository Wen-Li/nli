in my opinion fact is more import than the other . becaus idea and concept can chang easili but fact can not chang becaus it is real thing . somebodi live or someth like that . if we look all the histori book that written about the world : we can see a lot of differ idea and concept . for exampl : in world war ii some countri said that their countri did the right thing and on the other hand their enemi said that they just defens their countri so there were right . i can give more exampl but i want to tri to explain thi exampl ; if you want to do someth you have to have reason so it can not chang person to person so it is real . but everybodi have angl to look at the situat everbodi can say i am right and thi is ihe idea but no bodi chang the fact . if i want to learn someth i realli have to know fact . of cours we should learn the concept and understand the idea but these are not the main thing . becaus i want to have my own opinion about someth . howev concept is import to creat an idea but if you learn fact you can imagin the concept and you make your own true . unfortunatelli thi is realli difficult , a lot of peopl choos the accept anoth peopl right . but not me . if live in a democraci we have to decid our own way : we can choos our idea and concept . if we realli want to do thi we should have knowledg to say someth which we have an idea . the last thing is i read a lot of thing about u.s. but when i went their i saw the real u.s. it wa not the same as my past opinion . that whi i can not total believ all the idea that some peopl ha and i can not accept all the concept that somebodi tell me .
