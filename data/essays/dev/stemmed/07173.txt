i realli agre with the statement . in itali , the place where i live there are a lot of advertis that make product seem much better than they realli are , i hope these advertis will disappear becaus i think that the the way how peopl spend money it 's not a joke . i could write a lot of exampl about these stuff . i have a friend , kate , she bought a shower gel that ensur her bodi skin to becom smooth just like silk , but it is n't the truth ! anoth exampl could be the lcd televis that clerk encourag you to buy with the promis of a great view and a lot of light , but then you discov that you need to submit a new pay-per-view frequenc to see it . in past i had a lot of argu with peopl who sold these kind of stuff . i do n't want to say that is alway the same , sometim there are a lot of thing that seem to be great trought advertis and after you buy them you discov they are realli pretti good . in my life i do n't like lie , and i do n't like liar peopl , and i realli hate who promis you someth and then you discov it wa just a bad lie , and i think that these peopl deserv law judgment and to go in jail especi when they handl other peopl 's money . i think that in the time that we live with a lot of diffus it 's import for economi to be clear , becaus have a clear economi is the first step for peopl to trust in their own govern and make world work in the right direct . in my opinion it 's import to have law that allow peopl to trust in advertis and made advertis clear and sure for peopl who buy somet without bad surpric .
