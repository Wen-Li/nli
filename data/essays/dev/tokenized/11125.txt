In today 's world , cars are the main kind of transportation used for transportation on land .
As the cities grow and distances get longer , people need ways of transportation more and more in everyday life .
Therefore , nowadays almost every person that can afford it over 18 and has a lincence owns a car .
If you consider the number of people living on this planet , that would make quite a number .
However , on the other hand , ways of public transportation are developing , which reduces the necessity for cars .
So what will happen in twenty years ?

First of all , there is the fact that to get from one place to another , you need to have a way of transportation .
For most people , in the large cities they live in today , it is impossible to get to work or to go shopping or anywhere within walking distance .
So , they need to have a car or a way of public transportation .
Most people prefer having there own cars and it 's easy to see why : methods of public transportation are slow and unreliable .
You never know when the bus is going to come and it 's almost certain that you will be late to wherever you 're going .
Also , buses go slow and stop many times for passengers to get on and off .
Metros are usually very crowded and it is very uncomfortable to travel squeezed against people that you do n't even know .
Taxis are usually very expensive .
Plus , if you go grocery shopping , there is no way you can carry all your bags unless you have a trunk to put them into .
Picture yourself in a crowded bus or metro with ten bags full of heavy fruits and vegetables , gallons of milk and juice , meat that is about to get spoiled and ice cream that is melting all over the floor .
Not very conveniant , nor is it going to work .
This is an example of why at least one car is needen for every family .

However , there is the growing problem of pollution and traffic .
There are so many cars that it takes you an hour to get home during rush hour when it usually takes fifteen minutes .
Plus , when you get to work , or the mall , there is always the problem of parking .
Would n't it just be great to go and catch a movie or get a bite to eat in the time you use looking for parking spaces ?
That is why shopping malls and working places have started to schedule service buses which will take you directly from home to work or wherever you are going .
Also , there is the problem of the oil resources running out , and put that aside , cars heavily pollute the air .
So , instead of twenty people going to a place in separate cars , imagine how much it would reduce pollution and traffic if all twenty people used a bus to go there .

My opinion is that the number of cars will reduce in the next twenty years .
Governments that are aware of the pollution and traffic problem are developing methods of public transportation to encourage their people to use those methods instead of cars .
For example , in the United States , carpool lanes have been arranged in big cities like Los Angeles which you can use only if you have more than one passanger in your car .
So , in my opinion , the rising public awareness of pollution , the raise in the cost for fuel for cars and the development in public transportation will reduce the number of cars in the future .
