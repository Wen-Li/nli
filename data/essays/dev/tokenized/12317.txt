Yes , i am totally in agreement with the notion that it is better to travel in group instead of travelling alone led by a guide .
Actually , in todays materialistic world their is more safety concern then ever before .
so it is wise decesion to travel in group .

For ex , if a person travels in a new town or country and he does know not anything about the new place .
Then it is better for him to travel in a group because it lessen his chances of being confused in an unknown place .
A person could be face a lot of defficulitios ion new place like where to stay , have food and some times he may encounter langauge problem .
so travelling in group with guide will be helpful option . .

Travelling in group led by guide is very good choice , because the guide is familiar with local language , culture which helps a lot .
Actually , travelling with a guide enhances your joy of the trip because he can tell u a lot about the the places you are touring .
Further it is also cheaper economical to travel with many people .
Beause in group everybody is contributing in the whole cost which is mostly less then the cost of travelling alone .

Exploring a exile place in alone is not a good option because sometime their are few minor prolems regarding to security which may encounter by an single traveller .
For instance like a person is going to catch a train in a railway station and someone steel his purse , then he feel that he is in critical dillemma .
Actually , there are few thieves who attack on alone and new traveller .
But if you are teavelling in group , they can not dare to steel your thing or you can con = mpliant with your group members .

Basically , travelling alone in a new and unknown place is always a risky task , one should have to be very careful about himself as well as his luggage too .
On the other hand travelling in group secures a person from these minor problems .

At conclusion , it is a good and intelligent idea to travell in group with the guide .
It makes you safer and allow to enjoy journey .
