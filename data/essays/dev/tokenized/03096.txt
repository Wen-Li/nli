I agree that young people do not give enough time to help their communities in these days .
People have to work individually , but they also should work for the group that they are a member of .
Not a spesific group I mean , they have to participate in public , for example in a school , or in a family .
Teenagers are not familiar with their responsibilities as a student and also as a family member .

Usually , people start learning to be a part of community in a family .
Children should study lessons , show respect to older members , when parents should work for the family , and help their children to become a better adult .
Besides the general idea , they also have to love each other and should have a good relationship .
Unfortunately , young people avoid to be closer to their parets .
They do n't listen the advices an experienced adult can give , instead they start getting away from their home .
Teenagers even want to be with their unknown friends , rather then spending time with their brothers or sitsters .

Another example where young people show responsibility is their schools .
They have to participate to classes , study for exams and also study for the future to get a good job .
Recently , students think school is somewhere to get away from home , or have fun without any preparing for lessons .
They see the rules as challanges that they have to break and get attention .
Then school diciplines have more strict rules to control them .
So the community they try to work fells apart .
Teenagers should give some of their freedom to have a peaceful school life .

To conclude , young people should sometimes act like a grown up to control their lives better .
If they can be a good student , friend , sister/brother , daughter/son , they can create a better community and they also can enjoy where they are and what they are doing .
