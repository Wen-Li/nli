I agree with this statement that says that it is more importanto for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

One might agree with that statement because on many situations it had happened to me that I had to learn all the facts for a test and I end up learning them all , but at the end of the test is like if everything wipped out of my head and that happens exactly the same with all of my classmates .
But when we learn the concept of the fact instead of the fact it stays with you forever .
Many times when I am in a conversation talking about history or chemistry I star talking about concepts that I have learned in a period of time and explaining my knowledge that I have obtained by me understanding the concepts .

This are the reasons for which I agree with this statement .
Knowing the facts can work for a day or maybe a week , but the concepts stay with you forever .
