Young people are an intergral part of the communities/societies in which they live .
They develop their skills and gain education from their people - their families , teachers , friends and other people in their society .
I being a youngster myself believe that I have acquired the values and principles of my life from my community .
We younger generations owe our life to our elders , so we can not neglect them .
We have learnt to respect our elders and people in our society .
Therefore I would not like to agree with the statement that young people are not giving enough time to their communities .

Young people attend colleges studying different disciplines - science , commerce , humanities etc .
But they participate in a lot of other activities outside their curricula .
There are numerous clubs and organizations formed by youngsters that invlove themselves various kinds of community activities like protecting the environment by spreading awareness among the people , fighting for social evils like corruption etc .
In my university itself there are several student societies like these .
For example , the Nature club , whose members spend their time to make people conscious about issues like noise pollution , harms of plastic etc .
They express themselves by various means like banners , conducting quizzes and so on .
Similarly there is another club which raises its voice against many social problems prevalent in my country , for example dowry , female foeticide etc .
I myself is a member of this organization and we organize various activites like trips to local neighborhoods , staging street plays to spread our message .

Another aspect that shows the commitment of young people to their communities is their increasing interest in political issues .
In my country , right from the college students compete for different positions in the university politics and they have an important role in bringing important national issues to discussion forums where students can discuss about possible solutions to them .

Young people also contibute towards economic and technological development of their communities by implementing new ideas .
For example , they can use their education to help create new types of jobs by being entrepreneurs .
In this context I wouls like to add that many alumni of my college who have now gained imp postions in society contribute by giving donations to various social organizations .

I do agree that there are some youngsters who forget their people in order to earn money , who leave their countries for better life , but a large majority of them including me are determined to serve their communities from where we started our lives .
