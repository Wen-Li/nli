Since cars were invented the number of them circulating has been growing and growing along with the improvment of technology .
For this reason , I do not see why in twenty years there could be fewer cars than there are today .
However , one could say that cars might be replaced by other very high tech means of transportation , but I think twenty years would not be enough to do so .

In my opinion , which is also a wish , in twenty years there will be more cars or as much as today , but maybe they will not pollute the enivronment as they do today .
In fact , a lot has been already done to reduce pollution and I am sure there is still much that can be done .
For example , Italian cities and other European cities are making Europeans buy Euro4 and Euro5 cars , which pollute way less than standard cars .
This reduction has been possible thanks to improvements of cars technology .
Every month around the world there are show rooms that present new kind of cars , less and less polluting , more and more sofisticated in shapes , motors and accessories .
Some of these new kind of cars are very expensive , depending also on the brand , while some are cheaper .
Industries are doing a lot for making people buy these cars , from rich people to less fortunate people .
Not only industries and the most famous brands companies are acting in favour of less pollution .
In fact , governments are doing a lot as well .
For instance , they organize many information campaigns ; they define calendars of days during which people must not use cars in the cities where pollution is over the maximum level permitted and they finance electric pubblic transportation .

I think these are good reasons to retain that cars will not decrease in number for the next twenty years ; on the contrary it is common to expect them to be numerous but less polluting than they are today .
