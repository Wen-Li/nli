It is commonly assumed that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Althought it might not be exact for every advertisements , this gap between reality and representation is experienced on a daily basis .

First , we have to keep in mind the primary goal of an advertisement , which is to attract customers to a specific product .
Hence , advertisement makers have to rely on commercial technics that give the impression that their product is not only good , but that it is better than other products of the same category .

It is precisely in this process that a gap may occure between what the product really is , and how it is presented to the customers .
Even if we assume that the advertisement makers are aware of the basic qualities of a product , what is to be understood is that their goal is to make you think that you need this particular product , hence emphasizing it 's qualities and of course passing under silence it 's negative aspects .
This unbalanced and biased view on the product inherent value will surely produce a distorted perception of it 's real desirability , making it seem much better than it really is .

The car industry provides numerous examples of this phenomenon .
This very competitive market forces advertisement makers to present every car as they are perfectly fitted for you , which is not always the case .
For example , american car makers have the tendency to promote their vehicule by stating their durability and their power .
But they naturally never mention the fact that these vehicules are much more energy-consuming than non-american cars .
Hence , if one relies only on the advertisement , he will be conviced that this particular american automobile is a really good product .
But , if he buys it , he will soon realize that his vehicule has a high gas consumption rate .
He then might have the feeling that he made the wrong choice , that the vehicule was not as good for him as the advertisement pretented .
This illustration shows clearly that advertisements are by definition enhancing the apparent value of a product in order to sell it .
