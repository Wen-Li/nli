I agree with the statement that , `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
My opinion about this topic is based on personal experiences as well as personal opinions .

Who has not seen an advertisement that appealed to his/her own needs and wants ?
Furthermore , I will go a step further and say that I am sure that almost everyone has bought a product because he/she remembered an advertisement about it .
Advertisements are temptous and play with the customer 's emotions .
In addition , the way they are put together they appeal to the viewers ' eyes ; it makes them want to have whatever is displayed on the advertisement .
In the center of Advertisements is usually a woman with a perfect body , few clothes , a big smile .
Moreover , this kind of advertisement makes woman want to be her and men want to get her .
At this point the product being sold is not as important as the emotion involved in the advertisement .
For example an advertisement for a cigarettes company sells a cancerous stick to people by presenting a tan , attractive , and good-looking woman with a glowing cigarette in her hand on a huge billboard .
Do people really want to start smoking or rather be as good-looking as the woman .
Now , this supports the fact that the advertisement makes the product seem much better than they really are .

Another point to be made in this commentary about the statement is that even is people do not try to be influenced by the products sold on advertisements , they are still influenced by them .
As soon as people leave their house they are surrounded by advertisement on huge billboard , on trucks driving by , on school blackboards , or in magazines and newspapers .
These advertisements will store subconsciously .
If people then go to the crocery store to make their weekly supplies they will remember what they saw on the billboards .
They might buy those products and recognize that what they bought was not as good as they thought it would be .
They are surprised by the fact that the advertisements sold them this product and , more important , made it look better than it actually was .

In conclusion , it seems athat in today 's world we are surrounded and enclosed by advertisements and people who try to sell things .
This is the reason why it is hard to distinguish whether the product being sold is actally worth buying or if it is just trying to trick our eye .
It is important for people to recognize that not everything advertised will have exactly the same effect on everybody or will taste the same way to everyone .
But also I had to make the experience first before I recognized that `` advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
