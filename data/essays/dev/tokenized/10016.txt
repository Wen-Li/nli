It is common that many people begin to gain knowledge in a variety of ways .
At the same time the question that if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject will be brought about .
What do you think of the issue ?
As far as I am concerned , I will agree with the idea that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
In the following paragraphs , I will add some examples and details to support my point of view .

In the first place , specializing in one specific subject has advantages in various ways , of which , the most significant is that it will save our time and energy .
We have to the point out the essencial fact that we do not have enough time to finish every work well , which means that we can not do good in many academic subjects .
If we focus on one subject , we are able to spend enough time on that subject .
Therefore , we will have more chances to be successful in the subject we concentrate on .
For instance , if a student whose major is computer science studies art to broaden his eyesight , he will not have much time study his major , which will influence his grades and credits .
As a result , there will be bad effects on his study .
In consequence , we will make good use of our limited time to study , if we concentrate on one subject .

In the second place , what is also worth noticing is that it will bring benefits to our future job , if we specialize on one specific subject .
As we all know , in the future we will find a job which we are interested in .
In that case , we should focus on one subject which attracts us a lot .
Then we will find a good job after graduation because of our professional knowledge .
For instance , if we study biology , we are able to learn more in the subject , which means that we can gain the knowledge related to biology .
Therefore , when we have the interview , we will have a lot of academic knowledge to be discussed which will leave a good impression to the manager .
We will get the job we want easily .

Admittedly , if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we will become knowledgeable .
However , if we have knowledge in a variety of aspects and we do not know much about each subject , it will cause bad influences on our future life , which is not good .
Therefore I tend to hold the opinion that it is better to specialize on one subject which we have lots of interests and we will get benefits from it .

To sum up , taking into account of what has been discussed above , I can draw the conclusion that specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
I wish that there will be an increasing number of people who can get benefits from the one subject they specialize in .
