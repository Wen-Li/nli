Personally I do n't agree with the given statement and I think that if you do what you know and do that well you can be as successful as a risky person .

Todays people are most likely more risky and like to be challengend but this is why they can easily fail .
For instance I had a friend who had a very good job as a banker .
He had a good position and earned enough money but he wanted to make more out of his life .

He started studying again in another field and had to give up all the little luxuries he was used too ( like his car , old apartment etc . )
Unfortunately that was five years ago and his `` risk '' did n't work out that well .
The normal study time would have been four years but during the time he figured out that this field seems not to be the right thing .
He developed bad grades and has to retake classes plus when he finally finishes his studies it might be very hard for him to get a good job because the demand in his field went drastically down .

If he would stayed in his old job he could have been the director by now .
Another reason for disagreeing with this statement is that I think you should treat all people equal and not judge their success based on the way how they got to a certain point .

For example if it comes to a job offer and there are two people who applied for it I think that the person who worked for years at the same place and has a lot of experience in that specific area might be more successfull than any other person .
But I found it very surprising that people oversee those people and are more interested in hiring somebody who has a way more interesting past and took some risks to get there .

On the other side taking a risk might open you new doors that you could n't have had imagined before .

Given those reasons and the choice beween trying new things and taking risks or sticking to familiar behavior I personally think that you can be very successfull either way .
