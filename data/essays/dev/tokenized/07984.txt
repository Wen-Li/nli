I personally agree with the statement that `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' not only beacause they are physically more fit to do so , but also because their outlook on life is full of illusions and great dreams .

Young people 's first advantage is thier physical condition due to their age .
They have a vigorous body and therefore a vigorous mind .
Mix these with a good moral education and a spirit for adventure and the result can be a young adult that truly and deeply enjoys his life .

On the other hand , older peple tend to be limited by their deteriorating body and have to deal with a limited diet and activitiy plan .
They can have the moral base and the unbreakable spirit of a young person , but thier bodies will not keep up with these for a long time .
It is obvious that the range of physical activities available to young people in life is much greater than that available to old people .
Sky diving , snowbording , rock climbing are some examples of activites off-litimts to older persons .

The second advantage young peopel posess is their fresh outlook on life .
This view of thier lives has not been tarnished by mistakes , torn relashionships , of failed attempts .
Their emotions are strong and every new detail life brings to them is embraced with passion .

Older people tend to carry around old memories of lost loved ones , of failed attempts , torn relationships , mixed feelings , which in turn drane spiritual energy that would otherwise be used in more effective ways to enjoy life .
A younger person has a better of acomplishing his life goals because he does n't waste valuable energy in regrets , or regrets .

In conclusion , young people have a better chance than oler people to enjoy life at its fullest , because of physical and emmotional advan
