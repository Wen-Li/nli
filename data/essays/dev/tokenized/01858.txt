People start the cycle of learning and understanding from the moment we were born .
During the cycle , we discover many things in different ways .
While understanding of ideas and concepts can provide us with a basic knowledge of the nature and society that surround us , on the other hand , learning facts gives us the opportunity to feel and experience things that might happen in our life .
Both of the ideas are important , but for students , it is more improtant to learn facts rather than understand ideas and concepts of a subject .

Firstly , learning facts is more accurate and reliable in many fields of different posts .
We can find the answer in crime scene investigation , we do n't know the exact cause of the death of the victim until we open the body and examine it thoroughly .
A single substance in the artery may has vital influence to human , but in textbooks , we ca n't find them .
The same thoery applies to the teaching of students in school , especially biology , only through a real experiment can they understand the concepts more clearly and correctly .

Secondly , through learning from the facts , students can remember thing more efficiently , the vivid image of the process of how organs work and respond to each other may leave a strong impression on student , which are easier for them to remember rather than the boring contents of the concepts or the textbook .
As a high school student myself , my classmate and I both prefer the classes in labs rather than classrooms , they are both exciting and impressive .

Thirdly , in the view emotional development , learning facts can make one 's life more colorful by experiencing and thinking the connections and consequses of how things are organized .
Because at the early years of our life , we learn things through facts and experiences .
Knowledges we attain at this period are original and pure , they are just the fact , which are more realistic .
The more experiences we have , the more calm and objective attitude we can have when faced with an emergency .

As a conclusion , despite that we can get a cut through by learning the concepts that are already proven and given to us , we should still try to find the answers by ourselves .
