I fully agree with the statement that succesful people try new things and take risks .
In our everyday life , we have many examples that confirm this opinion , but the most important one is given by our interpreneurs .

Interpreneurs are always risking a lot in terms of money and time .
Moreover , enterpreneurs are always innovating , trying new things in order to survive in the market , to be competitive , to improve their position on the global market .
The main result of this behaviour is the success that everybody can recognize as tipical of enterpreneurs .

On the other side , we have the low level employes .
They only do what they have been teached to do at the beginning of their carreer and they do this work for all the life .
Very often , this kind of people are really very good in doing some specific work and they usually work for all their life for the same Company .
Generally , they never take any risk and the company fully protect and support them because they have a very strong know how .
But if we analyse the lifes of these people we can see that they never achieve any success .

To conclude , I think that to be succesful in the life , we need to take risks and try new things .
Moreover , in this way we can keep alive our mind , we can train our creativity , we can better express ourself as human being .
I think that we need to live as deep as possible our unique life , therefore we musttry as much as possible new things !
