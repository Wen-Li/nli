I agree with the statment that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Here are the reasons why .

First , advertisement tend to over exeggerate the effect of the product .
For example , many cosmetics claim in their advertisements that they have speical elements that make your skin white within just two weeks or make your face looks better .
When you see the advertisement you will be attracted by the slogans or marvel at its magical effect , and you will buy it .
There 's no solid evidence or medical reports that proves that the product is that useful , but the advertisements often use beautiful models and exaggerate speech to convince you to buy the product .

Second , the advertisement is a work being thoroughly and specially designed .
Through the lightening and computer adjustments , the product can be seen perfect in the advertisements .
Take the shampoo advertisement as an example , the model 's hair always look so shining and smooth in the ads after they use the shampoo .
However , the hair is very artificial .
There is no way people 's hair can be that perfect , but the company that produces the shampoo spends a huge amount of money on the filming to make you believe that their shampoo is really that good .

Finally , the advertisement is often selling a concept of lifestyle , not the product itself .
It is not the product that is apealing , but the ideal lifestyle beneath it that attracks you .
The product can be bad , but as long as you want to have the lifestyle that the advertisement promote , you will buy the product .
For instance , in a house ads that emphasize on the idea that single woman can live alone happily , the house itself is not that important .
It is the wish to live as a happy single noble that makes you want to buy the house .

To conclude , the advertisement is a carefully designed work that promotes concept and often exegerates the product .
Thus , it makes the products seem much better that they really are .
