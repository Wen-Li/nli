Some people believe that it is better for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
They think that students get benefits by studying others ideas and concepts and use it as a derictory in thier lives and thier educational jaurny , they may use as an example for that the old concept about the shape of the earth and how it had been hold until it was aproved .

I totally disagree with this concept for many reasos , first of all this concepts and ideas might be wrong so it is rediculous to make student hold them .
In contrast , we can let them develop thier won under our opservation .
Also , some of these concepts are harmful , for example , it is untill recently in my cultural background , poeple inheret and believe the stories about how sertain tribe members are able to come back after thier death .
The third reason opposing this concept is that students are the futre .
At the time they will be in charge , they need thier won ideas and concepts to deal with it because the every new day the world change .

In conclosion , I disagree with the statement because of variation of the relibilty of the ideas and conceps content , the posibility of it is harm , and to allow them develop their own .
