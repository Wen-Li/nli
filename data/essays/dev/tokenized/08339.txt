`` Education is what remains with you after you finish schooling '' The statement explains that it is the knowledge you learn that remains with you than the facts .

While at school students learn a number of facts and ideas .
The huge academic syllabus is a combination of both facts and ideas .
However the point that needs to be focussed on here is , `` How much do students remember afterall ? ''
They remember only what they learn and not what they mug up .
Therefore we can sum up as it is important to grasp concepts while at school than merely registering facts and forgetting them later on .

The endless chapters on history often fail to teach us what we are supposed to ` learn ' .
For example , Alexander the great was a great conquerer .
He conqured emdlessly .
However being murdered and left was what reached him to the almighty .
Here we need to appreciate his dynamism and heroism , not failing to see the other side of the coin that is , he was over confident and was consumated by his own avarice to conquer .

We need to formulate our education system where students can develop there mental capacity .
A developed individual would be self confident , reliable and a good human being .
In this context , the ealier system of education in India is worth having a look at .
The then schools , called `` gurukuls '' , meaning house of the teacher , were considered sacred and holy .
Students would focus more on learning and understanding .
Ofcourse they were taught facts , but they knew how to use them and gain knowledge as well , which is the ultimate aim of education .
A confident student , with understanding of basic concepts would be more successful than one who has simply mugged up facts which he will ultimately forget .
