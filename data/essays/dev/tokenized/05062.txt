Young people nowadays often live in a society where education and work becomes a more and more difficult task due to high competition .
Today 's young people also live in a modern world with much more accessible distractions than before .

On the one hand , I think the society we live in has become highly competitive in all aspects .
Since good education is becoming more and more accessible , universities , companies now require an even higher level of education .
In my opinion , that is why some people now work harder than before .

On the other hand , the invention of computers , video games , and all the other different accesories made the young people of today much busier .

These reasons are why I agree with this statement in most cases .
I think that young people nowadays simply do n't have the time to help their communities .
I also think that these young people are not to blame , modern society is .

If I talk about my personal experience , I can say that I do not give enough time to helping my community .
One of the reasons why I do n't is because nobody encourages me to do it .
People around me are becoming less and less aware of the problems in their communities and are becoming more selfish .

I think it is also important to say that it is not 100 % true that all young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I think it applies more to rich and weathy countries .
In the third world countries , I think people are more aware of poverty and as a result are less distracted by all the new technologies .
