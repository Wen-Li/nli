Have you ever seen a boy playing with his toys ?
Do n't you think that they are in their own happy world ?
I believe that children are extremely more happy than old people .

When we analize old people 's life , there are to many things involve that make them worried .
For example , the bills that they have to pay every month , or that boss at work that ask them for more every day .
It does n't mean that they do n't enyoy life , because that is life .
However , it is too much going on .
As much as you know , as much as you are worried .

Children keep their lifes simple , and there is the secret of their success .
They can watch the cartoons for hours without worried about what are they going to eat tonight because mom is there to take care of that .
Or , they can play with their neighbors all afternoon until they are so tired that it is time to take a nap .

In the adult world , the situation is so much different .
Old people still have fun .
They can have nice conversations with friends , go to the movies , or have dinner with their family , But there is not the same energy and entusiastic that young people have .
Yougn people are more optimistic , positive , because they have a whole life in front of them , so that motivate them to experience new things .

So , in conclusion , young people enjoy life more than older , otherwise It would n't be to common listen people saying how much they would like to be a child again .
