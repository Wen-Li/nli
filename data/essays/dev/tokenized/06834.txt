I agree wich this idea : most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There are two important reasons why I think that this statement is true .

First , today , in our society , the most important thing for people has become the appearance , and not the really essence of things .
In the every day life of each individual , the esthethical and exterior aspects , such as clothes , beautifulness , money , richness and material things are most relevant rather than the interior aspects , such as ethical values , love , friendliness , helpfulness etc . .
For this reason people think tha is right to appear and to demonstrate these aspects rather than their essece .

Second , today tv , radio , papers and others forms and source of informations , like mass meedia have devoloped very quickly connecting groups of different people all over the world .
So individuals are slaves of this information sphere that influence them .

So we can transport this two concepts from the life of people to their relationship with the different kinds of products , which they see and consider all day .
I think that because people are are influenced and pay great attention to exterior aspects most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

In conclusion , I think that this process is really developed , but it is wrong and it demage our society within few years .
