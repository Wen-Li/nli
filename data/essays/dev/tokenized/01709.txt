In my opinion there is no single correct answer to this question .
Of course both ways can lead to success .
My main reasoning is that it depends on the path one wants to follow whether an academic specialization makes sense or not .
My aim is to explain this argument in the following sentences by looking at the broad academic field of business .

In Switzerland , a masters student can choose whether he wants to specialize in one specific subject - as finance - or to keep his focus on a broad approach which includes subjects such as marketing , human resources , finance , strategic management , risk management , leadership .

To illustrate my hypothesis mentioned above I will now have a look at two different jobs within a company .

A general manager and his management team need not to be specialized in one specific subject as they have to address problems of many different fields - such as leadership issues , marketing decisions and financial topics .
An important aspect in the job of a manager is the need to quickly decide on many different issues .
Thus a broad education is actually an advantage .

An employee in the financial sector such as in a bank does not need to have such a broad knowledge .
Rather it is essential that he possesses in-depth knowledge of the transactions within the sector and on the sector itself .
The job requirement is much more focused .
Rather than just knowing little about everything it is advisable to have a solid knowledge of this special topic - and finance for example is actually still a rather broad subject .

But of course it is needless to say that knowledge is allways an added asset .
However one has to decide first which path will be chosen in order to be able to make a sound decision whether an academic specialization makes sense .
