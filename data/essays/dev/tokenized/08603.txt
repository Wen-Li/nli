Being committet to your community can have various forms .
It starts from helping your family in its daily chores , taking care of the neighbours ' house while they are away or spending some time in charities organisation .
At the core of all the above is the recognition that we are not just individual , but part of a community .
There is also the sense of gratitude for one 's gifts in life , such as youth , health or any skills , and the sense of enrichment that comes from sharing those gifts and making them useful to others .

Overall I agree with the idea that young people do not seem focused enough on the needs of their communities , and I actually think that they are fairly detached from the concept of community altogehter .
I think this is a very complex phenomenon and linked to a great number of reasons .

First of all , it seems that our society and culture put a high value on time , especially spare time .
Partly because modern life is very demanding , partly because the offer of entertainment and outdoor stimulations is so varied , we praise our time as a supreme luxury and feel very frustrated when we can not use it in complete frredom .

Secondly , I think Western societies have developed more and more in a hedonistic direction .
In other words , we feel it is our own right to enjoy ourselves , feel free in our choices and simply follow instant gratification .
I think this is particularly apparent in young people , as they claim they right to play and have fun , and resent any request of help or support as a form of injustice .

In a dominant culture of self-absorption and pleasure , taking the time to communicate with people that are different , for background and frame of mind , seems unjustified and this leads to another worrying trend .
It seems to me that there is a general detachment between young people and older generations or people in need .
These are generally the people that need more time and support within the community , and it would be the duty of the younger generation to look after them .

In conclusion , I think that values that have become more and more present in our societies are now central in young people 's vision of life .
As a consequence , there seems to be a more selfish conception of one 's use of time and gifts , that unfortunately leads to the neglect of parts of teh community that might be in need .
