In my personal opinion young people do not spend enough time helping their communities when it is needed .
Our personal goals focus on ourselves whereas others generation 's goals focused on community .
there may be many reasons why this change came upon us , however , I guess the most important one is related to this our new style of life .
Our way of life push us to worry about personal things rather than global ones .
We care about our personal image , our personal grants and our personal skills .
We have to .
However we must try to change and we ought to realize what it is happening outside and in fact we should give our helping hand .
Anyway , I think young people are no blame of this kind of selfishness but they are unaware .

First of all , we have adquire a new way of life .
We do live comfortable .
Our parents usually provide us everything we need .
Everywhere it seems as if nobody needs anything from us as long .
Our community is rich and everyone can reach a good position as long as this person works .
Thus , our goal is not related to our community in which everything runs `` perfectly well '' but it is focused in ourselves .
Our own complains and artificial needs are highlighted .
We have to be perfect not just good , but perfect .
We have to worry about such things in order to survived in this `` ideal community '' .

Inasmuch as we are so worried about ourselves we are not able to see the problems our community has , we are not aware of that .

Regarding this lack of awareness we can explain why we do not help but we can not avoid trying people realize their selfishness .
We have to take a look over our reality .
We must do more for our community than we are doing up to now .
It is a good chance not only for the community but for us to grow
