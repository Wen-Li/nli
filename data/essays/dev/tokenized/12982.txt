The influnce of advertisements on the customers is worth commendable .
The advertisers are projecting thier goods to the customers in a ` larger than real ' manner . '
I would like to agree with the statement that advertisement make products much better than they really are .

As an example consider the advertisements of washing powders , under which ever brand-name it may be .
The advertisements claim that it can remove different kinds of stains .
make the clothes shiny , maintains the colour of the cloth for long etc .
Most of these statements are projected ones .
Take another example of washing soaps which help to make people beautiful , according to the advertisements .
Some washing soaps claims that they can make people healthy also .
As long as my knowledge is considered i never heard things like this happened any where in real life .

In the same manner as the case of washing powder and bathing soap mentioned above the advertisements of clothings , motor vehicles , food items etc are all claiming things which are little bit exagerated .
The manufacturers of motor vehicles claim that they are having the latest technology about which the consumer has never heard before and the fodd products claims that tey are having all the vitamins and proteins which are necessary for human beings .

In short the statement makes it clear that that the advertisements are claiming things that are not exagerated to a great extend .
Hence it seems reasonable for me to agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they re
