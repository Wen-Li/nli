It is often thought that young people enjoy life more than older people do , but is it really true ?
A young person and an old person differ completely in terms of social status , experiences , physical abilities and other factors which can explain that statement .
Let 's analyze them .

First of all , old people can sometimes be limited physically because of their age and it can prevent them from doing all they would like to do .
Simple things of life can be difficult such as going shopping , driving , or maybe going out with friends .
All this difficulties added together can make their life more difficult to enjoy .

Moreover , older people often have more responsibilities in terms of family or professional goals .
This can create a lot of stress , psychological tensions which prevent people from enjoying life at its maximum .
However , I have to say that having a family ( children . .. )
is not only a source of stress . ..
and can therefore be a great cause of happiness !

On the contrary , young people are often more ` free ' psychologically as they are more unconscious than older people and want to experience life in a fun way and to enjoy it .
They often do not have the preoccupations linked to a family or a professional situation .
Consequently , they can be more selfish and have fun in life .

We also have to notice that young people often do not have the same problem of money than when they get older .
Most of the time , the parents supply their chidren with money and all their material requirements .
It is thus an important worry which dissapears and allows in one sense young people to enjoy life .

Finally , we arrive to the conclusion that young people enjoy life more than older people do because in a way , they are sometimes unconscious about some worries or problems which can exist in an older person 's life .
However , some people prefer to make sacrifices during their youth and then enjoy life when they are older whereas other people make the opposite . ..
But which is the best solution to enjoy life as much as you can ?
