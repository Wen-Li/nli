Advertising in the art of convincing customers to buy specific products .
It is obvious that advertisements do not provide a complete information to the customers .
That is not the original purpose , even if it provides sometimes useful information , and other ways exist for customers to get information about the products they want to buy .
For example , a lot of independent websites compare all the models of the same product available in the market .

But even if advertisments are not supposed to provide a complete information , they often describe some features of the product .
Doing that , they can not lie about objective characteristics because it is not legal and the advertisement would be forbidden by the competent authority .

Then , how advertisements can lie to the customers ?
The way to describe a product can be very subjective and it is obviously the case for advertisement .
For example , if you present a car with very beautiful girl or boy driving it , you do n't lie but you give the illusion that the car is better than it would be with a normal driver .
That is seduction .
A advertising is seduction .
When you are interested in someone and you have a date you do not wear every day 's clothes .
You take more time to appear `` much better than [ you ] really are '' .
That is seduction too and nobody seems to be against this kind of `` subjective lies '' .

In my opinion , the statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' is true but that is not a problem because everybody know that advertisements are subjective .
There is a game of seduction between companies and customers .
We have to know the rules and take part of the game .
I think that the life would be less interesting without this kind of subjective communication , beyond technical descriptions .
