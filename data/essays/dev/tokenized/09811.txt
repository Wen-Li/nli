First of all I would like to state that there can never be given ` enough ' time to helping the local communities .
Yet , by drawing comparisons between different communities all over the world I would like to present my home community in order to illustrate the youths ' commitment to their communities .

For my working definition I see ` helping communities ' as a willing and unpaid commitment in the local affairs .
There is a huge amount of youth groups covering all ages and interests which meet once a week in order to pursue their common interests and aims .
There is a range from choirs to play groups to sports clubs .
By coming together they foster the community , some arrange public events like summer parties where everybody can take part and the profit is being donated to local institutions .

Additionally , many youths willingly become members of e.g. firemen to be able to safe their families and neighbours when required .
Weekly meetings and trainings prepare them for this task .
Moreover there are many who decide to be a social worker at least part-time , some even full-time for a whole year .
They can work wherever they desire .
Either they help in old peoples ' homes by taking them for a walk , doing their shoppings or simply spend time with them .
Others decide to work with disabled people .
Helping them to manage their daily lives .
Some others prefer to work with young children who have problems at home or at school etc .
There is a variety of possibilities where they can and do spend their time in order to improve the conditions .

Another possibility to get engaged in the community 's affairs is to get engaged in the local politics .
Thus , young people 's ideas and suggestions can improve the community .
For example I have just run a youths ' campaign which informed the citizens about and collected signatures against the bad conditions in our local kindergarden .
Soon we achieved the necessary pressure to achieve our demand .
