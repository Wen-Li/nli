Older people usually consider young people of our generation as more lazy and more self-centered than young people of their own generation .
Eventhough the origin of this belief is easy to understand in individualistic countries , I find it difficult to accept the idea that people nowadays do n't give enought time to helping their communities .

Indeed , I think that modern societies offer more structures and organisations to allow people to help the community indirectly .
For instance , systems such as the social security system in France allow workers to help indirectly the people needing health care by paying taxes .
If this idea do not seem to apply directly to young people , once again we can argue that young people are indirectly helping their communities .
For instance , when they spend time working for school in order to get the needed skills to eventually find a job and contribute to the wealth of the country .

Some people would argue on the other hand that governements of modern societies do not offer enought to the people who still need individual help , not only in term of money , but mostly in term of time .
An example could be the lack of volontiers for the care of retiered people needing personnal help .
If one approach consists in blaming the people having free time , like the young people , for their selfishness , and alternative attitute can be to look at who helps , and who does n't help to change the situation .
Modern societies probably reached this point of no-return where people got used to rely on the governement for social issues .
Therefore its seem reasonnable to give more credits to the people who actually act on the governement - by the power of voting , by protesting , or taking part in the political life - so that social issues become a major concern .

As a conclusion , they are different way of helping a comminity , and we can find , depending on the culture or the country , specific groups of young people who actually give time to make something usefull , either by working hard at school , or by voting .
