I disagree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give sufficient time to helping out their communities .
On the contrary , their levels of awareness about the plight of people around the world has increased from yesteryears and a growing number of youngsters are lending a helping hand to the society .

Today people are making a mark for themselves at very early stages of their lives .
Young movie stars , musicians , sportspersons and the likes of them are winning the hearts of millions around them .
In the process they are making millions .
But one can proudly say that a considerable proportion of their funds is directed towards charity .
The `` Bill and Melinda Gates ' '' foundation was set up a long time back when Bill Gates was in his prime .
The amount of work that has been put in by the then young couple is commendable when it comes to talking about AIDS and cancer relief .
Although a middle aged couple now , their work goes on .

If we dont talk about the celebrities and concentrate our attention on the school kids , we find that community service has started coming more naturally to them .
There is a sense of pride attached with reaching out to the less previliged .
Children consider themselves to be heroes of sorts if they do a good deed and help out people .
The fact that schools and colleges have taken a positive step by according due importance to social work while considering admissions is an added impetus .
It prompts youngsters to do their bit .
Even if done out of personal interest , it exposes one to the joy of `` reaching out '' and prods them to do more .

One can cite numerous examples of engineers and doctors who have graduated from ivy league colleges and can easily make big bucks .
But statistics show that an ever increasing number of these graduates are turning their backs to high paying jobs in favor of settling down in small villages and towns .
All this because they feel a sense of attachment and duty towards their homeland and truly believe in alleviating the troubles of their nations .

Thus , the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to their communities is unqualified and underrates the contribution of youngsters towards building a better society .
