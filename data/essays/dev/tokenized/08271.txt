Yes , i totally agree with this term of travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
It is mainly because as we are a tourist so we dont know much about the places in a particular place .
We will visit only those places which are known to us .
But if you travel in a gruoup led by a tour guide you will be able to see more new places that u have neevr imagined to see in that particular place .

The tour guide plays a very important role in making our tour very intresting and adventurous .
He tells us about the stories of the different places of that place and make us feel more and more excited to visit that place .

I visited Agra ( India ) .
I was traveling with my friends and we all planned to hire for a tour that is led by a guide so that we can visit more and more places and can come to know about the history of those places .
As i know , Agra is a city of history .
It have lots of history in it and i wanted to know the proper history of that place .
I was sure that only a group tour guide can only tell us about it and i was not wrong at all .
He told the whole group about the history of all those historical places in that town .
As we know one of the Seven Wonders ` Taj Mahal ' is also located in that city .
I was touched by listning the history of that Wonder .
Not only me but the whole group was touched by what all he told us about it .

I think i was not in that group with that guide i would have never enjoyed my trip to Agra .
As i would not have come to know all wat he told to the whole group .
The history of great Taj Mahal .

Since then i love to travel in a group which is led by a tour guide .
Actually what i think one should must visit new places in a group led by a tour guide .
Im saying so mainly because you come to know about the places of that town and everything about that town .
If you like it then you can come again on your own without a torurist guide .
But if you are visitng a new place for the first time then you have to travel in a group which is lead by a tour guide .
If you have a tour guide then you need not have to take ant tension for accomodation traveeling from one place to another .
All these tasks are done by a tour guide only .
We dont even have to buy tickets again and again .
In all when we are travelling in a group led by a tour guide we are in a full mood of enjoying .
No work tension nothing .
Only enjoyment and enjoyment .

So i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
