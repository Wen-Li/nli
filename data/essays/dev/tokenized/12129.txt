I think successful people trying new things and taking risks when doing new things is better than doing what they already know .
I agree with the successfull people , because if the people are successful for wat they are then they can be able to think for new things .

Obviously while trying new things risks may taken place , but if we are worrying about the risks then no one can be successful in their life .
For example the scientists will produce new things by taking may risks if they are thinking that this work is very risky to do then now we ca n't get this light , radio , tv and satellites and many more which we are using in in our daily life .
So for every achievement there are many risks taken for the things to do .

So successful people only can think of the future , for every achivement there are many risks taken by many persons for those achievements .
For example if we are not trying for better future and being happy for what we have , then we will never succeed in our life .

Finally my opinion is to agree with the hard working people i.e. , successful people .
Because if the people are not successful then they ca n't think for their further future .
So for every success there are many risks had been taken to achieve it .
So finally i agree that successful people try new things and take risks is better .
