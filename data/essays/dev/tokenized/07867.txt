Travelling in a group led by a tour guide presents many advantages .
First , you can share and exchange your opinion and feelings on sites you visit with the groupmates .
It is often very enjoyable and refreshing to listen to other people ' feedbacks .

Second , the tour guide takes you only to locations that matter the most or that are the most representative of the country visited .
Therefore you avoid waste of time deciding where to go and whether the designated location worthes the visit .
The guide is often a great source of important information about the visited site .
He can turn the visit in a very interactive way , something you could n't get from a book .

Finally , the tour and the guide make the travel much more enjoyable as everything is already planned .
There is no need then to bother with organization details and unexpected events .
Everything is handled by the guide and the tour company .

However , travelling in a group and a tour guide may also have some disadvantages .
In my eyes , being in a group means that you no longer master your time .
Unless being selfish and imposing your ideas to others , you can not do what you want .
You got to stay within the bounds and respect other peoples ' wishes .
And listening to someone whining the whole day because the schedule does not please him is indeed extremely annoying .

Besides this , a tour means everything is already planned .
There is therefore no room for sudden change of schedule or unexpected location to visit .
The exitement might be undermined .
If the tour company provides poor services or the guide lacks knowledge about the location , then your experience may turn out to be very disappointing and frustrating .
Another very bad habbit of touring companies and guides is the fact that they often take you to locations , restaurants , museums with which they have a partnership , a deal , so you are invited to purchase items in those locations and not others .
Personally I dislikes very much those practices as I have the feeling to be a kind of toy in their hands .

My best advice is to choose carefully the tour company .
To rely on other people 's feedback , friends in order to determine which tour company suits the best our wishes and needs .
About the group , my suggestion is to welcome things as they come and all the time to focus on what pleases you the most and to sweep away any little annoying detail .
