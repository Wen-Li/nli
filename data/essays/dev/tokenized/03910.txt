It is debatable whether young people do not help their communities not spending enough time .
Some people say that young people provide enough time to helping their communities in that they are doing some voluntary works for communities .
However , I agrees with the statement in that young people tend to spend more time studying and they do n't have the sense of belonging to their communities .

To begin with , nowadays students do not help their communities enough time .
This is because they think that their grades are more important than helping communities .
Therefore they are spending more time studying for their good grades than doing volunteer works .
For example , my brother is a high school student .
When he were asked to work for his community from his school , he got angry .
That 's because he think helping his community is a waste of time and also does n't help improve his grade .

In addition , because young people do n't have the sense of beloning to their local communities , they are not willing to help their community a lot of time .
Young people think they can move other places whenever they want to move .
Therefore they do not feel the necessarity to provide aid to their local communities , sacrifying their own time .
For instance , according to KBS , Korea national broadcast station , 70 % of young people they do not have to help their local society .
When they were asked reasons , they answered that they did not have the sense of belonging to their communities .

In conclusion , enough time for young people to helping local communities do not meet needs of communites .
This is because young people invest their time on studying for good grades .
Also they do not feel the sense of the belonging to their communities .
This phenomenon must not be underestimated in the aspect that young people will be a person who leads the local communities .
