In todays world , nearly every product which is offered to consumers , is being marketed with advertisements .
These advertisements introduce the product to its buyers and demands them to buy it .
Although these advertising is good in terms of marketing and introducing new products , it is also clear that these advertisements could result in wrong , over-rated assumptions about the product in question because of three major reasons ; the the fact that the advertisement is a marketing technique , the varying expectations of the people and the influence of professional techniques to our emotions .

Firstly , the definition of today 's advertising is `` making people want something '' , the introducing part of the advertising is being ignored .
For instance ; advertisements are being prepared by marketing departments to sell them more and more to make profits , not just to declare that the product is made .
The increasing number of adverisement-officies and the money in this job also indicates that everything about advertisement is about making more money .
Because of these factors happiness of the consumer is usually being ignored .
Secondly , people often expect differrent things from a product , one may want durability but the other may want more reasonable price , but an advertisement should be prepared for every potential buyers .
Plus , a negative feature which people may want to know would not be emphesized because of these thinking .
This , again , would result in the disappointment of the buyer .
The third thing that would make buyers uncomfortable is the fact that advertising is being used for a long time and there have been clear ways to make you buy thing .
For example , when I saw a person who drinks or eats something I immediately feel a bit thirsty or hungry because my mind thinks of an oppurtunity to eat something .
This fact will affect me to buy the stuff which is being advertised , but probably I would be disappointed becasue I would have bought the think without thinking .

Advertising has becoming a great part of producing and marketing of new goods , every company is using it for nearly every good it produces .
It is clear that this thing makes people to buy thing , otherwise profit centered companies would n't use them , but making people buy something directly increases the expectations and therefore , as people expect more from the thing whic they buy , they become more disappointed .
