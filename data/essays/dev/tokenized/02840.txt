Advertising was created in order to make people buy things .
Nowadays , competition is very significant between brands and each brand has to struggle in order to convince people to buy their products .
Marketing departments deal with that .

As for me , I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Because of globalisation , we can nowadays find almost whatever we want in each country and more particularly in developped countries .
Which implies that competition is very rude since there are so many products available for customers .
The choice is huge and how can we decide which product to buy when we do not know them ?

As a consequence , brands launch many advertising campaigns .
They do their best in order to do the best campaign .
Thanks to advertising techniques , they enhance their products as much as they can .
Because they need to have the product that would the most catch people 's attention

Usually , when someone look at a billboard or watch a commercial on TV about a new food product , it is so well promoted that we are most of the time very interested by the product and we are very excited to go and test it .
But we are unfortunately often disappointed .
Indeed , if I take the example of a new burger launched by McDonald , the burger will seem very very good in picture .
However , when I will go and try it , the bread will be too dry , the cheese will not have the same aspects . ..
And once again , I will wonder why things are almost never the same as in the advertising .

Advertising agencies usually deal with significant budgets and they use amazing techniques sometimes to enhance the product .

Not only , the aspects are not the same , but also the features are not what they tend to be .
Actually , some products ensure to do this or this and when you try them , the result is not the one you were expecting .

Finally , I would like to add that this does not only occur for products but it also happen for famous people .
Most of the stars you see in magazine are gorgeous but in the real life they are not the same , you can be very surprised .
All this is due to the marketing that makes everything or evyone being perfect .
