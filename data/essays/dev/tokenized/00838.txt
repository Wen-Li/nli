Since World war 2 was ended , Young generation has enjoyed their life more than olders .
They , Would-be Baby-boom generation , were good at various entertainment , and were exposed splendid media such as Holly wood movies or Broadway musical shows .
There are a few reasons why young people are better at having a great time than older people .

First , young people know well how to play whenever they want eagerly .
They know well where is the best bar , what trend is going on , or who is the most famous actor in these days .
Of course older people have no time to have a fun in order to get enough money for their family like a daughter who is intersted in an expensive jewelry brand .
However young people do n't need too much money because they have no one to be preserved .
They just maintain thier living cost that contains money to go the best club in Soho .

Second , young people are healthier than older people because they have young and strong body that older people do n't have .
Old people have to pay for their medical cares , medicines in order to maintain the body .
In contrast , young people are not needed to get any medical payment at all .

Finally , young people tend to be curious toward all of the strange things what they have never seen before .
When older people avoid a stranger from another country , young people try to be closer with positive activity .
For example , in a small town , a tourist visit for his/her academical research such as modern agriculture from a strange country , young people or children will try to talk to him/her .

These reasons are why I think that young people are more enjoyable than older people .
