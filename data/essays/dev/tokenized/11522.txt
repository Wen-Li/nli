The way we are educated is influencing a lot what we become later .
I think that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is important .
It can be very usefull when one wants to interact with other people .
It is essential to share ideas and thougths with others .
In the professional life , for instance , if somebody in a company has to work with another department , his task will be much easier if he knows a little bit about the activity of this department .
Even if it is not a complete understanding , it will be appreciated by the other part .

To give another exemple , related to personal life this time , it is very agreable to be able to argue or discuss when we meet someone new .
Without this broad knowledge , how wolud we make contact , at least at the beginning ?
We would obviously miss the oportunity to get in touch with peolpe .
I would say that , having a broad knowledge is really a plus in life , it is like the promise to be welcomed and integrated almost wherever we go .

On the other hand , I think we can not only be satisfied with a broad knowledge .
We need to go further sometimes .
We need to be in something exciting to keep a goal to our life .
And this can not be achieved without being specialized in one subject .
Again , professionaly speaking , it is essential to be specialized .
Nobody can pretend to a job , which is something specific of course , if one does not know enough on this particular topic .
That is why we usually start our studies by general education , a broad knowledge , and then , gradualy focus , year after year , on what we want to do .

Plus , I think it is something very valuable for a human being to go in depth of something , to prove to ourselves that we are able to do something special , something that defines us .

To conclude , I would say that both approaches are necessary .
We need both to learn things about our environment , about the world , in order to interact , but we need to survive , by saying , `` I can bring you this , I can be helpfull with this '' .
