Today we live in a world where everything is fast and in movement .
To attract the consumers attention often the advertisement made by the productor , or a company , is better then the product itself .
I totally agree with this statement because we can have examples of it everyday ; it is sufficient to go in a supermarket and have a tour to see that it is full of similar products , and the only difference between one and another is made by his advertisement .

Another example can be taken from the television : there are a lot of advertisements made only to catch the consumers attention .
There are a lot of ways to catch the consumers attention : some products and , obviously , their advertisements look to the history of the company who made it , like a `` design '' object , others tend to be new and innovative .

I think that an advertisement should show the real potential of a product , without exagerations , in order to prevent unhopefull cases of recriminations and also a bad notoriety of it .

The failure of a product must not be a stymulus to create a false advertising in order to selling it : it must be a motivation to improve it .
Because now our life is , for the most part of it , in movement , advertisement had begun to be greater and greater .
When we are blocked in the traffic of the city , big advertisements try to catch our attention with provocations and funny phrases .
But not everytime what is showed is good as his advertisement .
In conclusion I think that who made an advertisement should be sure of what he , or she , wants to sell and what is the real potential of the product .
