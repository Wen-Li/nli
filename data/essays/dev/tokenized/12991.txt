America is considered a great country because it offers opportunities to common people to gain a better life trying something new , like pursuing a new business or getting real an extravagant idea .
This example underlines the great importance in our culture for conquering something new and taking the risks correlated .

If we were born just to do the same life , the same job and the same experiences of the peple lived before us , problably the humanity would still live in the caves .
The evolution itself of the human persons is strictly related to what some people discovered when they tryied to go under new ways .
Thinking about Cristoforo Colombo , for example , if he did n't navigate his fleet trough the ocean , putting his life in danger , the Americas would n't be discovered .

Of course , taking risks is the other face of the same coin .
It 's very rare to try new things without any costs , even the implicit ones like loosing the credibility or the social status kept till that moment .
For istance , in the past a lot of people died trying to develope aircrafts .
But with their persistance , we can now fly from one continent to another one just in few hours , and who succeded will be always remembered as a pioneer and a founder of our contemporary world .
For me , the real issue is alway to understand the trade-off between the advantages that new things or discoveries can bring and the risks related to them or to the path to discory them .
Real successful men always analyse this relationship , because otherwise the results could be catastrofic , maybe not at the beginning but in the future .
Quick success without any solid analysis behind is to be avoided as much as the fear of running for your inspirations or new ideas .
