Yes I Agree that most advertisement make products better than they really are .
Allready advertisement to focus to buy and consumer products .
way of reaching their purpose is makin to admire consumer .
So products must be attractive and services to other sense of consumer .
Deemands must creative by advertisement .

The advertisement is one of them marketing tools .
It is n't given direct message by advertisement they are general , imagination , colourful and attractive .
It mus n't be border .
Advertisements are serviced 6 sense of human to creative demands .

For example orenge juise advertisements , All ages of people could be a product .
Messages might be power , enegy , sex , dream , healty , even as like medicine .
Even pictures of nice real oranges and more colourfull but its integreds sugar , water , fruit parfums , glikos , fruit nectar etc . .
May be they will be enjoyable atmosfer in back ground of the advertsiement for example a young people party .
That could be message sex , romance etc . ..

So succesefull advertisement will be determined by rate of cunsomer .
So how much sperate of people , earns profits , addvalue are important points of making advertisement that Products are seem better than they really are .
