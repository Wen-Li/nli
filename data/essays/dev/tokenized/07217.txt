The speaker hits truth when he says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Commercials were originally a mode of informing consumers about the availability of a product .
But over the years , the sheer innocence of an old banner proclaiming the opening of a new KFC restaurant in the neighbourhood has been lost in the relentless wrath of commercialisation .

Today , a commercial informing the viewers of what the product actually is would not even be noticed , much less lure prospective buyers to a hopeful brand .
In the deadlock of efficient brands we find ourselves in today , advertisements need to be one step ahead of each other , a phenomenon previously seen only amongst the firms employing them .
And this very much involves enhancing the features of the product they endorse .

The world of advertising revolves around competition offered by others , and that has brought it to such a stage where enhancing a product is a common practice .
Probably the most appropriate example would be that of a recent advertisement my eyes fell on a few days back .
It promised of a `` mansion draped in greenery '' , but the actual house was ironically different .
It was a modest two bedroomed flat , hardly something you could refer to as a mansion .
But sometimes advertisements cross the limits of what would still be classified as acceptable .
Perhaps the most blatant of these are the ones employed by the automobile industry .
In a recent controversy , one automobile dealer in New Delhi was fined and barred from operating for a year because he had promised a prospective buyer a sedan , which turned out be be a mess of pure lies and thievery .

Although sheer malpractice is evident in this `` enhancement '' of products , some people still advocate the validity of these advertisements .
A recent survey in the United States of America brought to light a staggering number of people who see nothing wrong in this new trend .
It only goes to show one thing ; that we have learnt to live with it and although unwanted , it has become an integral part of advertising today .
So much so , that all you need to do to be sure of it is look into the local newspaper .
Even though it might not tickle our fancy , if statistics are anything to go by , this practice is here to stay .
