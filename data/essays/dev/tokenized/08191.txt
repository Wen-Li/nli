I agree with this is the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide .
If u will go to the visit the one country without guide .
If you know little bit about the visit place you can manage what ever you know about the country .
you want visit more places in that country u dont know about the visit place then you need guide .
There is no guide along with you whatever u know you can visit the place .
If there are more visiting place are there you can not visit that place .
At the same time you can face languge problem .
If you visit the place simply by saw the place it is waste If the guide is along with you he can explains if there is a histerical places are present .
If you know about visiting places completely u dont need a guide .

In some case If you want to visit the new place uyou want know the language of that visiting place .
At the some times food at thevisiting place is not good .

If you take the guide along with he is familier with that place this can be helpful to us .
Guide known the languge so that there is no communication problem .
next some visit place food is not good .
So guide know the where the food available fresh food .

Another one is he is familiar with whatever the visiting places are there in the visiting place .
Another one is he well known about the which hotels is good and which hotel is available at our allowabel financial .

it wiil beeter to go with guide whenever you t
