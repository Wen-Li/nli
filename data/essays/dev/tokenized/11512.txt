There is a common belief that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There are people who do not believe that advertisements do not say the truth but the opponents of the subject do not think so .
I also agree that advertisements make the products seem better that they really are .
Here are three main aspects why advertiements may lie .

First to think about advertisements is their purpose of preparation .
Advertisements are designed to convince the consumer to buy or consume that particular product .
In order to convince a consumer for a product , one should make him believe that he really needs that particular product or make him believe that the product is best at all .
For both of the purposes , the product has to be shown to be the best .
This brings us the possibility that advertisements may reflect non-real facts about a prodct .

Secondly advertisements are prepared to increase the profit for the specific product .
The producers , who would like to profit more and more , would also agree to display a non-realistic advertisement in order to make the product seem better so that increase the sales .
When the sales increase , the profit also increases .
In short if the product seems better , its sales increase and this leads to a higher profit for the company .

Finally , the third purpose of an advertisement is to help the company to dominate in the market .
Companies have to compete with each other with respect to their products in order to survive in the market .
So an advertisement that shows a specific product better that that of another company would make that specific company to win the race among the companies .
This again shows that advertisements are not designed to describe a product but rahter make it seem better .

In short , people believe that advertisements make the products seem better thatn they really are , are right to think so .
Because advertisments are prepared in the thought of financial profits .
A company would not agree to say the truth in the cost of earning less .
