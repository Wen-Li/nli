I do not agree with this statement , cars have been the most effective tool of tranport for half a century .
I do n't think tools , such as airplanes , ships , or any other can easily replace cars in twenty years .

Cars nowadays need petrol as feul , this has become a great problem because the amount of petrol we can gain access to is limited on out planet .
Lots of scientists say that as long as we do n't find other effective fuels for cars , we would n't be able to drive in a few decades .
However , corporations such as Toyota , Ford , Hyundai and many others have developed their technology to use hydrogen and electricity as the main power source of cars .
Thease cars do not require petrol , and therefore we will not need to find a substitute for cars in twenty years .

The world has grown rapidly during the past century .
cities expanded its sizes and population saw growth in most cities .
This growth brought new needs to people , a fast and cheap transport .
Cities have grown enormously , places that we can go in 30 minutes by car would take us a few hours or more on foot .
Cars have become a necessary element in modern society .
The world is keep growing , cities are becoming even larger , and population is still growing , especially in India and China .
The growth the world will see in twenty years will bring more and more needs for cars .
Also , cars will become cheaper over time , as it did for the past decades , and it will allow people that could n't afford cars to buy them , Cars will become more necessary over time .

During the growth in the past few decades , our cities have developed in a way which it can allow cars to transport most efficiently .
Cars were allways taken into consideration , we have roads , underground passges , bridges , parking lots , and all kinds of systems for cars .
This system has layed its roots deeply into our cities , and unless we change this whole system during the next twenty years in our cities , cars will still be the most efficient way of transporting , and people will not stop using them .

Cars have been by our side for half a century , it has made transport much easier and faster , and it is also becoming cheaper , which allows more people to afford them .
As long as there are n't huge changes , or as long as we do n't creat a more effective tool than cars , cars will still be in use around the whole world twenty years later .
