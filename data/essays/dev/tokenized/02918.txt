It is a challenging question that whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
First of all , I want to mention that both of them are good but it is impossible to be the best in many academic subjects .
In my opinion , unlike having a broad knowledge of many subjects , being the best in one specific subject is much more valuable .

I think that the specialization in one specific area can give person much more advantages when we compare it to the broaden knowledge .
For example , if you have only broaden knowledge about many subjects , this tells people that you are not a qualified person .
It only makes you more intellectual but spacialization is required in order to have a good job opportunity .
Today being intellectual does not enough in order to live well .
Unless you have any specialization , you can not earn good amount of money .

Moreover , being specialized can be seen as the reflection of the success .
You can be the most successful person in your specialized area with researching and working more and more .
For instance , you can be a well known scientist or professor in your field .
This is impossible for the person who has a broaden knowledge in many areas because life is short and you do not have lots of time to learn the everything about every subject .
Instead of this you should use your time in one area which can make you the best .

In order to summarize , as I mention in my essay , I am disagree with the idea that it is better to heve broad knowledge of many subjects .
According to me , being the best in one area is much better than having a broaden knowledge .
Specialization is not only the chance of the good position but also the reflection of the success .
