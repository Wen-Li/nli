I do not believe that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Many factors contribute to my belief .
These factors include the current state of driving , current drivers and development in the area of driving .
Through this investigation , it will be shown why I disagree with the statement .

The current state of driving today , is one that has morphed several times , to reach where it is at .
Before cars ever existed , people found other ways of transport such as boats and horses .
The general aim was to be transported or transport items from place to place .
The first car that was produced , revolutionized the transportation system .
People became more time efficient in reaching where they want to arrive at .
Technological advances are made everyday , so as cars started to become faster , people started to lose sight of the purpose of a car .
Now faster cars constitute faster drivers .
People now place more importance on the pleasure of speeding and performing stunts , rather than getting to where they need to be .
This state of driving has an effect on the drivers .

Today , we find that more adolescents are interested in cars than before .
As young adults , they enjoy extremes and risks , and the young age at which they are granted a license does not help .
Most accidents in my country of Bahrain are attributed to speeding of young people , and the fact that the mortality rate increases each year , seems to have no effect whatsoever .
Now , for a driver seeking an adrenalin rush and a living on the edge attitute , the right technology has to be developed .

As I mentioned before , cars today are faster and technologically better than before .
We should acknowledge that advancements will not cease , and if we take other life factors into consideration , we see that cars are demanded and are needed even more .
As job requirements relating to cars change , so do car expectations .
New roads are always being built and so faster , more reliable cars need to be engineered according to the newly built roads .

No matter what is done to reduce car usage , such as increasing the age requirement , or investment in other modes of transportation , I believe that people can not give up on cars due to the privacy and efficiency it provides .
Logically speaking , if the world progresses we go forward , not backward , and so in conclusion , forward to me means more cars and not less .
