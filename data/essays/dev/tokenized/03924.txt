I think that this statement can summarize an important problem of the actual society .
In my opinion we live in the society of appearance , where exterior aspects sometimes have considered more than the substances of the things !
I think that it is evident in one million of situations .
Let 's think for instance at our markets , they are full of colored boxes and bottles and I am sure that everyone of us , at least one time in the own life , has bought a kind of food or beverage just for how well it was showed on the box that contained it !

We can think also at the spots on tv , that everyday introduce to us so many kind of , I call them usefull things , that seems to be the new and perfect solutions at a lot of our problems ( and the most of the time they solve just one `` problem '' : how to spend our money ! )

Another example comes from the fashion world , it is a little bit different from the previous ones , but I think that in a different key it can reflect the same problem .

How many times we have seen some perfectly slim models that seemed to be healty and , of course , satisfacted by their own bodies ?
And how many times we have heard ( some time later ) that they had a lot of problems with anorexy , their everyday lunch was a carrot and their lifes were unhappy ?

It has happened a lot of times I guess . ..
Now the point is that the society presents to us some patterns that are almost never real , or better it shows to us , thanks to some advertisements or something else , what it does want to show to us , but not all the truth !

I think that it is not easy today to not be impressed by the external side of the things that are around us but , I think also that to not going into a lot of delusions in our life we should start to look behind the appearance of the things that are presented to us to understand what they really are !
