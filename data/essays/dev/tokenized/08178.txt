The idea that students should learn ideas and concepts rather than facts neither looks logic nor rational .
I would completely disagree with that idea for a lot of reasons .
I do think that in order for young growing people to learn facts of life and science in different specialities in order to be able to have the ideas of their own , otherwise they will just come with mixed out ideas and concepts .
So it is sort of chronological process .

I do not think for example how would a student could come up with certain invention or innovation in certain machine or subject without clearly taking in all the basic facts of how this machine is working and the basic scientic factors contolling its function or he may end up with catastrophy .

Another reason , is that study of facts broadens the horizon of the student vision , then he would be quite capable of finding out the concepts and basic ideas by himself , by studying how every thing in life would correctly work .
It is only after passing that stage of basic learnig that his ability to investigate and relate new concepts and theories .

Young students tend to be arrogant if they believe that they know concepts and ideas , that would be useful only after ensuring they really learn the facts and be able use them in the proper context .

And last but not least , education is an active process , and unless the students forced from their younghood to learn hard and given facts and certain assignments they would be reluctant to offer any thing useful to the world or be aids in world 's progress .

It is that young age that students could be taught all the human sciences and knowlege and if we start by the idea of coming off teaching them the facts and basic sciences we will end up with ignorant generation .

In conclusion , i belief students should be taught facts and basics of sciences rather than merely giving them ideas and concepts as it would not help them enough to proceed in their careers .
