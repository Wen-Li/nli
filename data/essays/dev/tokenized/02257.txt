This is very difficult question for me , because I am a one of the young people who do not have a relation with my community , so I copletely agree with this opinion that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There are several resons I think for this question .

First , almost young people do not know their neighbours , because there is no opportunity to contuct with them .
In the past of Japan , people did anything with the community members , because the people who belonged to same communitiy were families , so people decide the important things , like a rebuilding the house or changing the job , with the communities .
People do help the others in their communities .
However , people nowadays are not interested in others , and they do not want to have a relation with the neighbours , because the horrible actidents occures recently .

Second , older families and younger families have a generation gap .
If there is a chance to do something together in their communities , but both families have a different opinions .
It is a natural thing for the people , because they tend not to have a complex problem , so they do not give enough time to helping the communities and not have a relation .

When I was a child , I had to clean up the park where I always played with my friends for the community 's event .
This was a task for the children .
Many adult observed us , but another day , many adult taught sports for the communitiy club .
I agree with this opinion that many young people do not give the time for their communities , but we should change this custom to improve the relationship between the neighbours and me , because if the accidents happens in daily life , others near us help first .
People help each other and get a good relationship in the communities .
