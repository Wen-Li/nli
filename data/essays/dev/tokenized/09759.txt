The statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is may right , but in my opinion it could be said not only for young people and not only nowadays .

I think the time after childhood and befor adulthood have been a difficult time eversince .
Teenager have enough to do helping themselfe , so they are may even the only agegroup who should not be blamed for being a bit selfish .
But even after you reached your twenties succesful , there is a high number of realy ignorrant and selfish people .
It goes on during every ageclass .
It is easy to blame the young ones , but even most middel-age and older people are looking away if something uncomfortable happens .

Anyway , this do not mean , that the statement , that young people nowadays do not care enough , is wrong .
If there are too many people in every ageclass who do not spend enough time to help their communities , the younger ones are includet .
But in my opinion , most times , they are at least the most helpful orientated group , at least after they maneged their teenage .
Just because there are more often more open minded young people than older ones .

Wich brings us to the word `` nowadays '' .
It is may likely that in passed times the family bond was stronger , so there was more help during most families for each other .
But the community does not mean only the people we love , but also people who are may totaly different , with opinions we do n't share , with behaviors we do n't understand .
But to help the community means even to help them , if help is needed .
To help some stranger on the street was way more uncommon in past times but today .
And even if most of the charity organisations have mostly older members and helpers , it does n't mean that the younger generation do n't care .
Most times the young people are thoses who want to change something .

I totaly agree that there are not enough people who spend enough time to help their communities , but at the end you ca n't blame it only to the younger ones nowadays .
It is and was a general problem .
