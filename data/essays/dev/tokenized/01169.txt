The community associations are formed in order to serve their community , to make it develop .
As the engines need petroleum products to work ; the community needs young people 's attention to be strong and well-organized .
However , because of the education that young people have , the way of living that the others , with whom the young people live with , the daily events , which make the young people think pessimistic , young people do not pay enough attention to their communities as they do before .

Firstly , education , that we have during our lives , has really important effects on people 's way of living .
It can be easily seen that , well-educated people are caring their community more than the other people , who are not well-educated .
For example , think of somebody who graduated from university .
The person , we are talking about , has a knowledge of things that a community needs and can give a decision about what to do for the community .

Secondly , young people can get easily affected from the people they are living with .
Is not it right that young people want to be like their parents ?
Nor , their parents do care about the community that they live in , neither the young people are the small versions of parents .

These are not all the factors that can affect young people in a bad way like this .
Has anybody ever thought the idea of daily events can affect young people in a bad way ?
For instance , think about the topic of war , occuring in the middle eastern countries .
This can be told as one of the reasons that young people are pessimistic about the future and their community .

Finally , from my standpoint it is true that young people do not give enough time to their communities .
I do strongly believe the thing this can be so
