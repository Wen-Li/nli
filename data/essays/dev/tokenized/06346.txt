The answer to this question depends of the situation that a particular person is at a time .
In the case that the person does not know the city or place that is being visited , I would recomend to contract a tour guide and doing it in a group because he is going to take you to the most important places in a quick , safe and with all the explanations needed to know the place that you are visiting , and also you can enjoy the company of other people , giving you the oportunity to meet and share experiences .
One of the most important things when you are traveling is to see the culture of the place , for example the food , dances , festivals , etc. and I think that a tour guide can help you to accomplish this goal , also the tour guide can give you historical information about the place which is very important when trying to understand the way the residents of the region visited behave .

On the other hand I think that if you have been before in the region and specially if you have been there for a couple times , hiring a tour giude is a waste of money and time , because this kind of services are usually expensive and you can use that money in something more productive in you trip , also the tour guide is going to take you to places where you have already been .
Instead of that you can use that time to visit new places of the region , doing something different than your last visit .

So the conclusion for this is that it depends based on you previos experience on visiting the region .
I will absolutly recomend so in the case that it is you first time , but if you have been before I do not see any reason to take a tour .
