The statement says that students should importantly understand ideas and concepts instead of learning them .
This is a question that I face myself as a student almost every day .
On the one hand it is necessary to understand the theory that lies beneth all facts and all new information , in a way to get a solit knowledge how things work .
On the other hand it is also necessary to just learn new words or relationships .
Without that base knowledge it is not possible to communicate with others because they do not know what you are talking about .

I guess there is no black and white view whether to say that a student should learn everything new just by heart or to understand just the facts .
It must be a middleway you have to find to combine this both views .

When repitition is the aim then i would say that learning the facts is enough but when it is necessary to find new conclusions and relations between different cases then it is a must to understand basicaly what the new information wants to tell .

Nowadays the knowledge is given to everybody through various databases like books or the ultimate information base with techonolgy of the internet .
It is just a matter of how to find information and how long you need to access the new information .
It is getting more and more unimportent to know every fact by heart with help from data on pages like wikipedia online .
With that help it is just a matter of a few seconds to access the right topic and to get any information that is so enormous nobody could keep in mind .

To come to a conclusion I wish that in many more fields then today already exist students learn the `` why '' standing behind instead of just pure facts and knowledge they will never need in that particulaly case in the future .
