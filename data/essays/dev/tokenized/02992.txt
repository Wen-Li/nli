The issue at hand is that is it better to have broad knowledge of many academics subjects than to specialise on one subject .
This is important becauseit makes us know what students are actually interested in .
Ipefer it is better to specialise in one subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academics .

First reason to support my statement is that when we concentrate on many academic subjects we could not concentrate well on all of the subjects .
And we can not do well in all the subjects .
when you take one specific subject and specialise on it you could concentrate well on the subject and can do justification to the subject .
for this reason I think my choice is superior .

Secondly , by specialising on a specific subject makes you learn many new things without any difficulty .
and you can focus more on a single point in a better way .
By researching on the subject you can discover many new things in that subject .
for example many great prople such as einstein devoted his entire life to a specific subject in which he is interested and many discoveries in that field such as mass energy equivalance theorem e.t.c therefore from this reason I support my choice is best .

Finally , all the people would not be interested or capable of learning all the academic subjects .
for example if somene is forced by something to learn a subject in which he donot have interest he can not learn it in a proper way .
so it is better to specialise in one subject in which he has interest instead of learning all the subjects .

So according to the above reasons mentioned it is better for a student to specialise in one subject in which he is interested rather than learning all academic subjects .
