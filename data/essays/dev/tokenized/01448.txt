Most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .
This reminds me of an incident which occurred only a few days ago .
I was out shopping with my friends and i was on the look out for a new mobile phone which i had fallen in love with as soon as i saw it on my television screen one fine morning .
I had vowed to buy that mobile phone whatever be the consequences .
This action can be appraised by the fact that the phone looked really cute in the advertisement and it boasted of many features as well .
This phone was the ultimate gadget for any teenager .
But i had the ultimate shock when i saw the same mobile phone in the mall .
It did not look as cute as it did in the ad , for one thing , and it did not seem to have as many features as it did in the ad .
The ad was an illustration of what is defined as cheap publicity .
The phone had been wrongly displayed and if it were not for my trust-worthy friends , I would have bought it with all the love i previously had for it and then would have ended up as the loser , disappointed as well .

Most advertisements seem to display products in such a way that the consumer would fall in love with the product just by viewing the advertisement .
This can result in serious damage of the customers ' trust in advertisements as well as in the manufacturers of that particular product .
The consumers will be heart-broken when they come home and realise that the product , with which they were previously so in love , has really let them down , quality-wise .
The advertisers or the manufacturers are hood-winking the consumers into buying their products at high prices , ensuring profits for themselves , but breaking the trust of the consumers nonetheless .
The advertisements should be more realistic and they should not display something which the consumer may not find in the product later .
The advertisers should only advertise those charactertistics of the products which actually exist and serve a purpose .
Not the characteristics that ought to be in a product .
If the advertisers are so keen on advertising such characteristics they should suggest to the manufacturers to actually integrate these characteristics into the product and then advertise them so they would not be cheating the customers but actually showing a true , realistic picture .
