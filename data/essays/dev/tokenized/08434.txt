I believe strongly that the question seems to be controversial in one way and very relative because i can see that , it depends on persons ' views and thereby the conditions also under wich the travel is made .

In one hand , a tour guide is not bad , if i will try to picture the why of a tour guide or its purpose actually , i can really go further to illustrate that .

As i guess we all know nobody wants to be unsecure or not well protected , or not well guided .
Why am i led to talk about people ? , for the simple reason that , travel is made mentionned and basically is has to do a lot with people .

For instance , if i have to talk more about the security aspect of the thing .
When we see today , in the most technologicaly advanced century or age , the way people wants to be secured ; tbe it political leaders are guided or secured even countries .
It really shows the long or the desire at the maximun of anyone wanting to be be secured .

So from this point of view , i can really see that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is one of the good way of travelling in connection with some of the reasons that i have announced previously .

But i can also say that is not always necessary the only best way to travel .
As i said formely , it can be relative i mean by also depending on people point of views of what is the best way of travelling .
Because for some people , during their travels , they use means of transportation wich do not have a tour guide and all the same they qualify their travels always as being the best .
So from this angle we really see the restriction of what is called best way of travelling wich is connected to being led by a tour guide .
