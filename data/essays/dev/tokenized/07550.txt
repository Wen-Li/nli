Many people have the problem that they do not know what to do regarding the subjects they can choose form , in a universtiy .
Should they take their time to study many acadamic subjects or should they specialize in one specific subject ?

The first positive point of choosing many academic subjects is , that you have a broad knowledge of many different thinks .
That makes you more flexible when you look for a new job and also gives you more flexibility on many other situations .
The second positive fact is that you are able to talk about many different topics , which can help you to increase your relationships with others .
If a person talks about various topics you are able to enter the conversation because of the fact that you have more knowledge about different thinks .
You are able to talk about many differnt thinks than a person who just study one specific subject .

To specialize on one specific subject has many positive benefits .
First of all people who take many courses have not specific knowledge about a certain subject .
People who specialize on one subject are more professional and therefore able to answer more specific questions because they have more knowlede .
They are also able to use their knowledge to solve higher problems .
Another positiv fact is that companies allways need professional people who have a lot of knowlede in a specific area .
Therefore people are better paid than people who are not so professional .

I strongly belive that it is better to have more knowledge about a specific subject .
You are more able to solve complex porblems and you are also able to answer to more specific questions .
In addition people with more knowledge about a topic are more likley to get more money from companies because they need professional people .
