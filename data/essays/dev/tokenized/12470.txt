It is often said that young people 's interest in their communities has been decreased recently .
Some people might agree with this opinion because of the society getting more and more individualistic .
However , I disagree with the idea that the young spend much time for communities because of what schools and societies require for them .

To begin with , schools encourage students to more actively participate in the community service .
Many schools , nowadays , offer volunteering programs for additional credit or elective courses .
To support this point , studies done by the Ministry of Education of Korea have shown that the number of official community service provided by educational organizations such as high school and university has been 67 % increased compared to that of 10 years ago .
Also students ' participation for these programs has been 87 % increased .
It seems clear that schools have a positive influence on young people 's assistance for their communities .

Moreover , societies put more stress on helping communities .
Communities display a lot of advertisements to get help from young people and their participation is highly praised by the society .
The young peoplebeing considered as virtuous are rewarded by the government making their name on the local periodicals .
For example , I happened to see the poster for rebuilding of my community damaged ny huricane earlier .
I immediately made my mind to be part of it as the team leader and awarded by the represent of my village .
This volunteer experience written on my resume greatly affected the employers of my current work .
They said virtue of helping others is the very criteria they esteem .

In short , I disagree with the opinion that young people spend not enough time for communities to make them better .
This is because of encouragement of schools and societies .
