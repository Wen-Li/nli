I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than to merely learn facts , hence forth agreeing to the statement .
One of the best examples to support this statement goes back in time before the renassance period in Europe .
The roman catholic church at that time was the ruling authority .
They proposed false facts that the earth was the centre of the solar system and that all the other planets revolved around it .
This was tought to the masses and then at that time preference was given to the facts even if they were untrue regardless of the underlyng concepts on how a solar system worked .
So even if the fact didnt have any underlying idea to it or concept , it was given importance , thus the result that people living under a lie .

Now if the idea that understanding and conceptualizing was more importand than just learning mere facts was presented at that time , there would have been a great advancement in the knowledge of the universe even before the renesance priod .

The statement also supports one of the idomoms that `` necessity is the mother of invention '' .
If the students are exposed to only facts , which are a kind of invention by others who understood ideas before , there would not be any room for free thinking and the resultant , which in this case is the future ( Students are the future ) would be stagnated !

Also I believe that some facts can be altered and/or proved wrong by understanding ideas and concepts .
Again the example stated above serves for this statement .
At the renessance period the false facts were proved wrong by free thinkers like Galleleo with the help of their ability to understand ideas and concepts .
Great discoveries and inventions were made at that perioid and many new facts were made .

Thus all and all we can consider that one needs to develop ideas and concepts IN ORDER to make facts in the first place and that facts are just resultant part of it .
