In a leaning process , the aim should be well defined in order to get closer to the target , being awarness of where to reach and what to get .
To me this is a must for the learning process .
I strongly belive that we need to differenciate the conceps , ideas and facts .
To me students need to learn what is necessart yo analyse and differenciate the facts and results . .
To analyse the facts and results they need to learn ideas and conceps ; ok , why ?

First of all ideas and conceps are the main resources of the behaviours , inventions , expressing emotions and etc .
So to make connection with results we need to consider idaes and concepts that based on .
To me students will learn both of them , unporved concepts or ideas can turn to facts tomorrow ..
But also learning facts is necessary to anaylse the root af facts .
What are the resources of the facts ?

As a second students need to learn the methodology of comparing conceps and facts .
This help students to anylse the facts and also make easy to learn .
In the learning process as an additional thing we can put to learn how to make comparison .

Further more while determing the aims of learning ; it should be to learn facts but being aware of ideas and conceps . .
It is like learning three situation of matter , but now scientis proved that there is one more sitiation of the matter .
So being aware of conceps is helpful ' it is like not to close our eyes from what others thinking .

As a consequence stundents should have an idea that why they need to learn , and how ?
and they need to learn make connection and comparison with facts and conceps while learning . ..
l belive that learning conceps is not harmfull and wasting of time and also learing just learning facts is like closing our eyes to the other .
Students need to learn both and make comparison of facts and ideas while learning .
