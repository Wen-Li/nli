I do agree with the statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
To understand ideas and concept is not very easy but once you understand , to know the facts is easy job i think .

I would like to talk about based on my experience , when i was study i used to learn facts first then try to understand ideas .
That was a huge mistake for me , i thought i understood what i learnt but it was not .
I was understood totally different way so i had to study again which takes much more time .
Also when we had group work i was the one who always give wrong suggestions and it was very embarasing in fornt of my friends .
So , from that point i decided to change which was understand ideas first and learn facts .
It was little hard for me at the first time but time goes by it was much easier for me to learn facts after understood ideas .
Well not only that , after I understood ideas and concepts i had a lot of questions to ask and opinions to suggest .
Also time that i spent on to understand became much more shorter so i can study other things as well .
In the class I was the one who never ask questions and suggest my opinions in class but i changed .
How ?
I became the one whos most talkative in class because to understand what i learnt i had so many things to ask and want to know .
So i knew from that time , because i did n't understand the concept i had no questions to ask and no interest to think about that topic .
From my experience i do strongly agree with the statement .

To do easy work or better work , to understand what is the idea and concepts are the first thing to do then learn fact will be the faster way to learn from my opinion .
