I definately agree with the statement that it would be more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it would be for them to learn the facts .
To support my opinion I will give three reasons in favour of the latter .

Firstly I surely agree with the opinion that students have to learn some facts .
It is obviously important to know certain things but it can not be the main objective .
As I experienced , the things you remember in the end are not the ones hardly learned and memorised , but the ideas and concepts transmitted by a book or a professor .
To be capable to memorise you need to connect the facts and to transform them in bigger pieces , in concepts .

Secondly it is not just important to know things , but to understand them .
By memorising numbers and numbers of facts you do n't automatically also understand them and you are not necessarily able to see them in relation to other factors .
You are may not able to see the overall meaning of all the factors learned .

Thirdly , when actually using the the knowledge learned , you need concepts and ideas rather than pure facts .
For example if you are a doctor , it does not help you to just know where the knee is but also to be aware of all the different parts of the body that can influence and affect the knee .
Experiencing pain in the knee is not necessarily caused by the knee itself .
It can also be originated in another part of the body .

Summarising I think there should be both , the learning of facts - serving as a basis of knowledge - and the understanding of concepts and ideas , to be able to get the meaning of the knowledge learned and memorised .
What counts in the end is the ability of using the knowledge and this is just possible when having a profound understanding of the facts learned .
