For a long time ago , I visited Europe with my family in a group led by a tour guide .
Although my family payed a great deal of money , we enjoyed the travel since the travel was convenient and helpful for increasing our knowledge .
Like my case , people should notice that the best way to travel is in a groups led by the tour guide .

First of all , since the tour guide provides enough knowledge and information to people , it is the best way to travel in a group led by the tour guide .
There are two purposes of travel .
One is to have a rest and the other is to earn information related coutries or places that people travel .
When people travel to acquire knowledge , they need professional guide as it is hard to get information about certain places by their own power .
In contrast , when people travel without the tour guide , they will sightsee without getting information and this will not be beneficial for increasing their knowledge .

Safety of the tour guide also makes the tour guide more attractive .
The foreign countries or places that people have not visited can be dangerous to people since they can not know factors that can be harmful .
Therefore , people who travel alone sometimes get in troubles .
For example , I heard news that one traveler who visited the foreign countries alone was kidnapped .
Thus , to decrease the risk of travel , people should travel in a groups led by the tour guide that has been guided people for a long time and has bountiful knowledge about the dangerous factors , so the tour guide can make the travelers to travel safely .

Finally , the travelers do not need to concern about their travel plans , if they travel in a groups led by the tour guide .
When people plan to travel alone .
they have to consider various factors .
They have to arrange hotels that they will stay and they have to purchase airplane tickets .
Also , they have to plan their schedule and choose where to visit to see .
However , people who travel in a group by the tour guide do not need to worry about these factors because tour guide companies plan everything .
What the travelers have to do is just to pay money .

To sum up , the best way to travel is to travel in a group led by the tour guide because people can earn knowledge properly and travel safely .
In addition , people do not have to endeavor to make plans .
