Travelling is always an enjoyable , sometimes tedious , leisure acitivity .
Nowadays , with travelling being such a normal thing to do , one is confronted with the choice of choosing between travelling with a group and , or by yourself .

So , can the one choice be better than the other ?
First of all , most of the time , travelling with a group tends to be relatively cheap and with the tour guide usually being a local , allows the tourists to receive additional information during the trip .

Also , since the tour guide is doing this for his living , preferably as a professional career , it is ensured that the quality and quantity of the information given during the trip will be better than a tour organised by one 's self .

Secondly , a point that is often missed is the socialising factor .
While travelling with a group , it is impossible for one not to get to know anyone .
It is not a given though , that one 's fellow cohorts is as gregarious as one 's self .

Lastly , efficiency is the key , meaning so much as : Seeing a lot with little time .
This allows the traveller to see as much as possible in a limited time .
On the other hand , efficiency , such as many other things , is a double-sided sword .
Being as efficient as possible prevents the tourist from savouring his moment during his travel , such as Mt .
RUSHmore for example .

On the other hand , travelling without a group releases the tourist from the shackles of time .
One can enjoy every moment of the tour , go back to an exhilirating sight , or just relax for a day - freedom is the key element here .

Informing one 's self is of the essence when travelling without a tour guide though , since nothing can be worse than a tourist without an idea what he is doing .
This does n't mean that one may not opt for a private tour guide though .

Of course , all of this comes with a price .
With this one can conclude if one wants a truly informative and economically feasible trip one should opt to travel with group .
Yet if one wants to truly appreciate the true enjoyment of travelling , savouring every moment of one 's trip , then one should opt for the other .
