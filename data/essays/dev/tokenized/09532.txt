Apparently , young people have much more time to enjoy themselves .
However , it is difficult that to say that young peole enjoy life more than older people do .
There is a problem somewhat too colplicated to speak easy way .
Everyone enjoys their life .
Indeed they enjoys their life in their own way .
So young people and older people both enjoy their life , but in their specific ways .

Older people , of course , have more time to work in their field to make money for their family .
Sometimes they can not have a break all day long .
Even , in Asian countries , older people can not have a vacation all around year .
They have great royalty to their family .
Although they may complain about their life like this , they will not leave it .
Sometimes they enjoy this situation , to have chance to support their family by themselves and to grow their children in better circumstance .
This is the life actually they enjoy everyday .

Young people can not help enjoying their time everyday .
They have no responsibility to work for someone except simple homework .
So young people have much more time to spend for themselves , in my experience , more time does not mean more joyful .
In fact , young people spend time useless more often than older peole do .
But it is obvious that if young people can manage their life valuable , they have much more chane to ( really ) enjoy their life .

In conclusion , the critical point of about this question is not the quantity but the quality of life managing .
Although older people have less time for themselves to enjoy than younger people , they can manage their life more valuable , so they can enjoy about the result .
