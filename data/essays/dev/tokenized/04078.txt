The technology keeps on changing day to day .
In the next twenty years people might not be using as many cars as there are today .
Although cars are the major means of transport today , by the increasing technology there might be a new vehicle that may be replacing the car today .
Also the scarcity of the resources may urge us to less the car number .

Now a days many people are using the cars in all parts of the world .
The more we use the cars in number there will be more demand for the resources for car fuel .
By the next few years the fuel which we are using now for the car may be in scarcity .
So the world will any have to abandon the use of the cars as they were running out of fuel .
So people will certainly look for the other fuel vehicles .
Thus the number of the cars used may be reduced in the next twenty years .

There is always been a new thing replacing the old one in this world .
People are always hunger of hunting the new technology .
As the cars are the faster transport media within the city and also comfortable means , people are using them in large number .
If a new car with new technology and with better speed is brought in the market , people will rush to buy it .
In fulfilling the requirements of the people there might be a new vechicle , which may be a small air craft , in the market that attracts the people .
Then the people will obviously will keep the cars in the back .
So the era of the cars may change with the introduction of the new transport vechicle leaving it to the back stores .

The advancements in the technology , the changing requirements of the people and the changing environment may some day , probably in the next twenty years , reduce the number of cars we are using now .
