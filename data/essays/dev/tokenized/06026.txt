Unfortunately I have to agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not invest enough time to help their communities .
In my opinion a possible reason for this development might be the lack of a strong incentive for the young people to spend their precious free time on helping the community instead of maybe hanging out with their friends , playing video games etc .
As especially cities grow to become more and more anonymous , young people do not see the reward of their work in the community as they would in a smaller one where everyone knows each other and the youth would get more appreciation for their voluntary work .
This is , of course , a misconception , because volunteering for a good cause is appreciated in both environments , it just may be not as obviously to the young people .
So the question is : What do the youth do with the time that they once spend on helping their communities ?

They spend it on activities that they simply find more pleasurable .
In fact , this is a trend that we can detect in all layers of society and in all ages , we do not need to search for this phenomenon among young people only .
Of course , it is more fun going to the cinema than helping elderly members of the community .
So what we need is incentives .
We could get incentives from the parents , helping their kids realize at a young age that it is important to take responsibility and help out in the community at least every once in a while , depending on the child .
Small activities done for the community may be more important and more valued than one might think and every kind of work is strongly welcomed and appreciated .

The community itself must have a strong core in order to create networks and to attract the young people through for example specific institutions and activities only for the young .
I say this , because I believe that only if the zoung people can identify themselves with their community , at least to a certain extent , will they be willing to become an active member and help by investing a bit of the work as well .
