Does young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
If I am asked to answer this question , I would say no .
Many older people think and say that young people have freedom and they can do whatever they want .
However , that is not true for young people because there are many things to do for young people befor they become an adult .

As a young person , I feel like I have very limited life .
Teens go to school everyday , they have to do their homeworks and projects , and they also have to prepare to go to college .
Preparing for the college gives a lot of stress to young people because most of the students want to go to good colleges .
In order to go to good college , they need to work hard in school and also they need to do many extracurricular activities .
Even though they have something that they want to do , either there are no free time for them or there are things that is not allowed to young people .
Also , in order to achieve their goals in the future , it seems it is necessary to go to college and study in the field they want to study .
Without that education , it is hard to get a job in the high position or to earn a lot of money .

Not only that , but also they need to listen to their parents because they are not adult yet .
If the parent do n't agree with something that you want to achieve , you need to either give up or change your mind .
There is actually no freedom for teens at school or at home .
Older people are more able to do whatever they want because they have freedom and they do n't have financial problem because most of them work .
Basically , they can buy anything they want without asking or getting permission to their parents , and they can also do whatever they want without being pressured under parents .

We do n't exactly know when a young person becomes a older person , but what we know is that when a person becomes old enough , they can enjoy their life doing whatever they want and they have more freedom than the young people .
