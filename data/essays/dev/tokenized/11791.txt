In my personal experience , I 've noticed that having a better knowledge of one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of a number of academic subjects .
At the University I attended different courses referring to three main areas : History , Law and Economics .
After my graduation I can say that I had a good knowledge of a series of academic subjects , but I realized that this was not so good for those who are searching a job , in particular the first job experience .
In fact , like all my friends did after graduation , I began to search for a job .

In trying to find something adequate to my generalistic preparation , I 've understood that it is difficult for people who do n't have a specialization to find a job , in particular a qualified job .

Talking with some friends coming from Economic studies , they all told me that the labour market has notably changed in recent years .
These changes took place since a strict division of work had become a necessity for companies and factories , for example .
Consequently , it could be noticed that who offers a job is generally looking for qualified candidates , for people who have a high knowledge of a particular topic or , in better words , who is specialized in a specific subject .

I have found that this is true , because all my friends who obtained a PhD or attended technical faculties have found a job in just a few months , while others with a more generalistic knowledge or university degree are still searching for a job .

In conclusion I agree with those who prefer to specialize in a specific subject , because I think that in doing so , they could have more chances to find a job .
