Some people believe that is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide but I disagree with sentence .

First , If we should n't travel with tour guide , we can sight seeing any where For example , In the past year I went to Japan with my freinds without tour guide .
I think it is not at all also we could arrive to the japan well and went on a shopping , took the picture with native people .
ect .
in this travel , we get along with my freinds .

Second , we can be known to travel place history .
By without a tour guide , we can study about the travel place history .
Nowdays , According the international social develop , we can saw many Japan 's informationg and history .
such as read a tour guide book and the Internet web surffing .

In this reasons , I think I like the best way to travel is in a group without tour guide leader .
