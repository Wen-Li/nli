The statement asserts that understanding ideas and concepts is more important learning facts .

Before we move on to judge the merit of the assertion lets try to differentiate between `` Ideas and concepts '' and `` facts '' .

Ideas and concepts represent the fundamental `` line of thought '' or `` logical progression '' behind any phenomenon .
For example different cultures use kinship nomenclatures e.g. Uncle , father , mother etc. in order to express not just natural relationship , but also social relationship , status , power equation , economic situation etc .

On the other hand , `` Facts '' represent the `` hard examples '' or `` expressions '' which can be immediately placed in their context and are self explanatory .
For example , Uncle is term used for father 's or mother 's brother .
But in many cultures uncle is also a term used for any significantly older male , even if no biological relationship exists .

What it essentially means is that it is very difficult to understand `` ideas and concepts '' as separated from `` facts '' , and vice versa .
The two are interlinked in many ways .

Its only thorugh `` observation '' of similarities between facts that ideas and concepts emerge .
That is if it is observed that in a culture all providers of food and security and termed as `` Father/Mother '' , it means there is more to nomenclature than the biological relationship .
Its no conincidence that Hitler was termed `` Fuherer '' i.e. father .

On the other hand , once an idea or concept has been `` obserevd '' and `` established '' through the study of `` facts '' , it provides a medium for understanding of all future factual observations .
That is whether they support or oppose the idea or concepts .

Hence , observation of `` facts '' is both the `` initiator '' and `` distiller '' of concepts .

In this light , it will be fool hardy to see ideas and concepts as opposed to facts .
Both of them are equally important for real learning .
Students need to understand a `` concept '' through assimilation of facts .
Concurrently a concept or idea provides the medium for assimilation of large number of facts .
Both are inseparable for complete learning .
