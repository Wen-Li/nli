I disagree with this statement .
There are three reasons .

First , anybody can enjoy its life whether he/she is young or old .
That 's the matter of feeling or thinking of individuals , not age .
You can see it from the statistics about the age of suicide people .
The number of older is n't different much as younger people 's .
They die because of dissapointment to their life .
I think that may be one of the proof of young people does n't enjoy life .

Second , that olders who usually move and speak slowly may give an impression to people to think they are boring or have nothing to do .
It is not true .
Thanks to their experiences and knowldges come from their long life , they know how to enjoy and have fun in their way in any situation .
Older

Third , the number of older people who goes to educational facility , like city college , is still increasing .
That means they have passion to get higher education and enthusiasm to earn new knowledge .

Compared to older people , younger seems spend much
