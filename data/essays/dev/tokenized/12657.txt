Nowdays advertisement is one of the most important aspects to sellI their products .
I fully agree with this question that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Advertisements of products can made their goods more beautiful or attractive .
It is nessasary for peolple to notice their products more impressive .
There are many types of advertisement , one could be televison advertisement , another one could be suppoting entertainers . .
and so on .
And Showing some specific advertisemet many times people can accustome to the product .

For example , the i-pod which I bought by seeing many advertisement and seeing my favorit entertainer who has i-pod can be a good example .
i-pod is the most popular item .
Many hoolywood star has this item .
Many people bought this item .
we can see i-pod advertisement every where .
And we can see the goods in the movie or drama .
It is seemed to us many times not only direct advertisement but also indirect such as supports .

One of my friends has this i-pod .
She told me why she bought that product , that 's because it is just looks good and she attracted i-pod 's advertisement .
And she saw many her favorite hoolywood stars with this item , so she felt the item more attractive .
I also purchased i-pod because I saw their advertisement many times than other products and I saw my favorits actor Jung il-woo has the product .
I think i chose the product because I saw the adverisement both directly and in directly manytimes than other products which has similar function .

In conclusion advertimsement is neccessary to look better their products seems much better than they really are .
It makes products more attractive .
