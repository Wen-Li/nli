`` Jack of all trades , master of none ''
This is a saying a lot of us grew up listening to .
The question is whether you want to be a Jack of all trades or the `` King '' of one .

Personally , I believe , that it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to have broad , abstract knowledge about many .
When you specialize in one subject , you gain a lot of knowledge and authority on that subject .
This can lead to a lot of advantages .

Firstly , mastery in one subject can help you with your career .
If you have complete command over your subject , you can effectively utilize it to further your career goals .
For example , in a competitive industry like the Information Technology industry , if you have a good grip on your domain , it will benefit you much more than having incomplete knowledge about a lot of other domains .
If you are knowledgable about a subject , not only can you do your own work better , but you can also help your colleagues or peers with problems they may be facing .

Specialization in a subject makes you an authority on it .
This can lead to other people looking at you for direction or help if they are stuck .
So not only do you become more popular , you also gain a lot of respect by helping others out .

Lastly , i would say that if everyone just wanted to have broad knowledge on a variety of different subjects , then no scientific or other development would ever have been possible .
Take Leonardo Da Vinci for example .
Had he not developed his skill in painting to such a high degree , we would not today have been able to exclaim at the beauty of the Mona Lisa .
Or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , who with his skill in music , gave us so many beautiful compositions .
Or Albest Einstein , whose immense study of scientific phenomena lead to so many inventions .

In conclusion , I firmly believe that it is much better to specialize in a subject you feel passionately about than to have a lot of unimportant data on subjects you might be just mildly interested in .
