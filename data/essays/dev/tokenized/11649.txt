At first glance , we may think that speacilazing in one subject is good for us as we can concentrate all our time and energy on just one subject .
But having this kind of strategy might prevent us from to complete our necessary improvement .

Firstly , all kinds of sciences have complex structures that no specific subject can be thought to be completely independent from other academic subjects .
Having no knowledge about other academic subjects is something that will always limit us during our studies .
For instance , a computer scientist like me may never need information about sciences like physics or chemistry during university studies .
But if on one day , I need to create a software for a company that produce chemical products , I will need asistance from other people for everything that is related to chemistry .
From the projects I have made for the industry , I realized that having some knowledge about every topic really helps .
In fact , a computer engineer can not be seen as a real engineer , if he does not even have basic concepts of general engineering principles .
He will always will be incomplete and in need of help from other people .

In addition , as far as I learned from the software industry , having broad knowledge of many subjects is something that seperates you from other people in the same area and makes you chosen instead of others .
If we really want to be good in our jobs , this can not be succeeded by just concentrating on one subject .

Another fact is that there are so many interesting academic subjects in the science .
We may be happy if we can have spend some time on some other subject and improve ourselves .
It is not a good thing to limit ourselves to just one subject all the time as there might be lots of topics that might be interesting for us .

In conclusion , I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
As we have time and resources to get knowledge about many academic subjects during our university studies , we should try to get familiar with the highest number of academic subjects and we should not limit ourselves to just one top .
