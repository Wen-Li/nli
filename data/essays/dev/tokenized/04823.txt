Generally people which are remebered are those who leave a trace of their life in history .
Nobody remembers or notice a person whose life has been carried out in an anonimous pattern .
We notice what stems out from daylife , something exceptional , new .
The key for success is risk .
Oscar Wilde used to say that an idea which is not risky can not be considered as an idea .
To give evidence to this statement we are going to outline some main points and then summarize with conclusions and caveats .

First of all , nowadays we consider successful people who occupy certain social positions due to their efforts in seeking their place .
This successful social position varies depending on cultures .
Nevertheless , this position is regarded as successful when the position itself is exceptional .
Nobody would consider successful someone who works in a normal or standard position .
This means that success depends on extraordinary situations carried out in particular conditions : it is finding a new solution , a new idea to obtain something .

Secondly , people will recognise success only when it is visible .
If nothing could lead us to distinguish something from normality , we would not be able to determine the difference between the two .
We will not be thus capable of recognising the new into the normal .
Hence this will not be differentiable .
Success is also difference , uniqueness .
In other words new things .

Third , stated that success is based on difference and new ideas , it is also to be said that news find their root in risk .
Elaborating something new , it is not possible to understand whether it will be regarded as something really new and meet the taste of the others or will just fail to communicate its difference .
This uncertainty has to deal with risk .
To be noticed as different one idea has to be new , thus risky .

To conclude , we demostrated that success comes from difference from normality ; exceptionality and risk .
The last factor is perhaps the essential key for success .
As Oscar Wilde said .
