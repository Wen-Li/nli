Some people may believe this is true , but I totally disagree with this statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
From my point of view , I think that young people do not enjoy their life more than the older people do .
First of all , young people have less spare time than the older people , because they are young , they have a lot of working pressures and long working hours .
They must strive for their future by hard working Therefore , they do not have much spare time on what they are interested about .
However , older people have less working responsibilities and they have less working hours than the young people do , and many of them are retired form their work .
they can spend more time to stay with family and do many hobbies that they are intersted about .

Secondly .
Older people have more friends than the young people do .
As time past , older people have been in society for so many years , so they have met a lot of people , they can have fun with so many friends .
It is really a happy thing to stay with many friends , and there must be a pleasant atmosphere .

Finally , they older people have less living pressures than the young people do .
Many older people have already retired from their work .
they did n't think much about how to keep their work and how to make more money .
they have already done this when they were yong .
now the only thing that they need to think about is that how they sepnd rest of their life to enjoy the wonderful things in the world .
they can travel to many beutiful places in their spare time , moreover they can visits their friends and have fun with them .
They do not think much about work , and just playing for fun .
however , the young people will still face the heavy work and the pressure from the society .
So , they can not enjoy themself as much as the older people do .
Making my father and my grandmother as an example , my father work more than 40 hours a week to earn money to afford my study fee abroad , and he does not have much time to have fun .
however , my grandmother have a lot of spare time and less working pressures , so she can play a lot of funny staff with her friends .

Therefore , from the reasons I listed below , I think that older people enjoy their life more than thhen young people do , because they have more spare time , more firends and less working pressures .
