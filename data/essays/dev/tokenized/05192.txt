Scholar 's main goal is to make sure their alumni have learned their teachings .
Understanding ideas assures them that the student has a clear image of what was taught by portraing it into concepts .
Once they have knowledge about these statements and ideas they can develop their own , expand the already made or come up with counter ideas .
All of the previously mentioned force students to keep on with their mental growth .
Facts are obvioulsly helpful , however that 's as much you 'll get from them .
Facts will avoid learning because most you do with them is memorize and file them in a redundant folder of your brain .
They 'll show up when their convinient ; ideas will stick around .

I attended a Model UN annual debate meeting in 2005 .
Me and my classmates chosen to represent our school in the meeting were newcomers and needed explanation in order to fulfill expectations .
We were n't clear about the process .
Our highly demmandig teacher made us participate in an re-enactment of last year 's meeting and even though it took us a while to get the idea once we got the hang of it we cleared our doubs and understood the concept .
Model UN is not just another extra-curricular activity it was an opportunity for sucess .
We were training our minds to think for others , to speak for the ones that ca n't for themselves and to come up with resolutions to world wide problems .
That is the thruthful concept of the Model UN and we knew that even before getting there .
Once we got to La Ceiba , Model UN scenary , we had an ultimate learning experience .

Our instructor could of listed a serie of facts and sure it 'd help but we 'd have to wait until next meeting to outstand and get the idea .

It is always a clever move to be able to have an image of what is the teaching suppose go and not walk blindly through a learning path .
Therefore , Understanding ideas and concepts is much important than learning facts .
