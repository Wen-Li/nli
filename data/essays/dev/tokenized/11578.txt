I disagree with this opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I will raise the reasons in following passages .

First , as one of the japanese , and one citizen of the developed country , I think there are possibilities that the number of the cars in use will be reduced , because particulary in City , the person can transport easily without a car thanks to the sophistication of the network among train , subway , and bus .
And I think in the part of suburban also develop the similary methods to transport like City .
But what I want to say here is that the opinion I mentioned now is too micro to think globally .

Second , I think we must think more worldwide .
In the earth , there are many countries want to be more developed .
In these countries , I think that the number of cars in use is increasing .
The reason why the developing country will use more cars in future is that , to develop the country economic capacitiy , the needs of cars will increase to transporate many goods to commerese .
I think the transporation abilitiy has a significant meanig to these countries .

In conclusion , to think world development , I think disagree with the opinion .
