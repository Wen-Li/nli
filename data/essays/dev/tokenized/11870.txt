For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
This goes back to a varity of reasons .
Primarily cars today are indispensible to go to work for a lot of people .
Secondary cars are more than that , their use is comfortable .
What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative .
And there are no factors prospected , which could chance the need of cars during the next twenty years .

First of all cars are neccessary for many people to reach their place of work .
Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportion .

If you consider big citys , you can not always make use of public transportion .
Especially in smaller citys , where public transportion may only exist in small or even does not exist at all and taking a bike is not possible either , you really need a car .

Furthermore I can not see any reason , why this state of being should change during the next twenty years .

There will be no doubt .
Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastes and therefore most comfortable way .
Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily .

Everyone , who ones had the comfort of owing a cars appreciates it .
So I can so no reason in the future whz this would chance , either .

Lastly we lack an alternative .
There is no more convienient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business .
In decrease in consume would help to kill manz thousand jobs .
Worldwide car producing industries hold so manz jobs .
Their falling apart would be fatal .
Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business , which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil .

Here another job giving area exist that manz people depend on .
I can not see that the influence politicians might chance that .

Still a lot of cars are sold and , in my opinion will be sold .
World population does decrease in the industrial states slightly , but it will not have the effect , that less cars will be in use in twenty years .

Considering the facts it may be a good thing , if there were fewer cars for this would help our environment get healthier again .
Even so the need and lacking alternatives will not chance the amount of cars during the next twenty years .
