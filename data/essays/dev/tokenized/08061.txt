Personally speaking , I do n't think the best way to travel is in a group led bt a guide .

Firstly , travel is a course for relax and feedom for sight seeing .
If we do everything in the trips follows by someone , it just look like working as usual .
when I take a trips by myself or with my friends , we could go everywhere we want , we could eat everything we like .
We talk and laught loudly , and we enjoy myself .

Secondly , in the jounry , the time we spend in the place we loved is depend on how much we like .
If we find some place beautiful , we can have a good time there for long .
Once we feel tired during some part in a trip , we can stop and have a rest , we can have a drink in the cafe in the way , too .
No one could stop you .

Thirdly , it is said that the tour guide may shows you manythings so you would learn more in the trip , however , in my opinion , it is not neccssary for me to know much by hear the guide said , also , it makes me tired , during the holiday , we should enjoy and learn things by tring and seeing by outrselves .
We will find more while we take a try in everthing .

The best way to travel is to travel yourself or with your few good friends .
It will give you a hard forgetable time , and your frinendship would be deeper .
I am not here tosays the other choice is bad , but I think , not as good as mine , you know , travel in group may make you tired . .
So , I do n't think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , enjioy yourself in the travel .
