YES , i agree this statement , `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than the there are today '' .

At present technology has been improved .
At same time cars model are increased .
In twenty years past there only two or three models of cars available .
But present there are some models of cars and with technology cars are manufacturing .
There will keep the people in safe mode even if accident will appear .

For example in olden days there facility to see television in the car , listen music in the car .
It used only for travelling purpose .
But at present by reading newspaper also we can drive car .
That much has been improved the technology .
If car has been accident there is no harm to the human beings because all safety has been arranged in the car .
The old cars are polluting the climate so much by leaving smoke .
But the present cars are using the gas instead of petro or disel .
It will reduce pollution of climate .
In past cars this facility is not available .
Different cars have different technologies .
At present populations also increased at same timeusage of car also incerased .

Finally i conclude that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
At persent technology cars have good selling in the maarket .
