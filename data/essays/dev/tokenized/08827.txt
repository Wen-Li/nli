I agree with this statement partially ; because although we have to explore new areas where to pursue success , it is almost obligatory to gain a high level of expertise to attain it .

I should be admitted that there are several good reasons for trying new things .
First of all , it is difficult to be successful in an already developed field .
People in that field have been specializing and putting their effort and energy for a longtime .
For example , the technics for shoe = making is already very wel established and people in this sector know very well how to produce high quality shoes for low costs .
Secondly , the change is unavoidable in virtually all the areas of human activity and people not taking any risks for exploring new things are deemed to be surpassed by the '' risk = takers '' .
Sticking to the same example , a person using leather as the raw material for making shoes and not willing to learn about how to use other potentially useful material , would one day have to retire .
Maybe the most important reason for trying new things is the potential of generating synergy between what we already know and wwhat we will explore : the world is divided into '' things '' artificially by the humans and we can always find fruitful relations between one '' thing '' that we already know and another one that we get to know .

On the other hand , history is also full of famous people who caught the success via persevering in a well = defined field , from army commanders to artists to shoemakers and athletes .
The reason is that in any given area , there are many very talented people trying to be the number one ; through improving their related skills and also via obtaining relevant knowledge both of which require long periods of hard work .
So the definitoin of success is always pushed furhter in terms of required perfection .

Although the first man on the earth had naturally to try new thinghs he also had to improve on his skills for not failing = if he had not ; we would not be here .
There are always new areas potentially very useful for the humanity to explore .
But the process of exploration requierd l
