I agree with this statement , but I would also say that nowadays are even a lot of young people , who helps in their communities , but most of them are not be registers .

I think , the reason why some many young people do not spend enough time or even no time helping their communities is that our whole society has growen during the last century .
The results of this development is that our society is anonyme and there are no real communities .

During the last thirty years , I think , most of the communities growed into large cities , because of the processe of globalization , which is a mant factore , why communities broke and even break .

In this case it is not really suprising that many young people do not spend enough time to help their communities .
Another reason , why I think this development is not suprinsing , is that the most cities and communities do not offers the young peoples the oppertunity to help .
For example in germany , where I live , the government decided to close more than the half of institutions where young people can get into and help the community , maybe to plan a party for the whole community or even a special event on eastern .

This aspect is also the reason why I say that the most do not recognizes that a lot of young people support the community , because they do it in private organisations or only for their own .

So my conclusion is that it is not only the fault of the young perosns that they do not help so much , because they can not change the developments of last years and of the processe of globalization and also they can not influences the decisions of the government , because most of them are not allow to vote , because of their ages .

However , I think that young perosns are responsible for the communtiy and so I think they should support them in anyway .
I also try to support my communtiy .
I live in a village with a large and beautiful landscape .
The problem is that this area is shaped into two statepart and so no state thinks that it is responsible for saving this area .
So , the young members of the riding club , included my own , clean it twice a year .
However the state governments do not realises that .
