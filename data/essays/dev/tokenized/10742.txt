Yes , I agree with the statement `` its more important to understand ideas and concepts than for them to learn facts . ''

I feel its very important for us to understand an idea than simply knowing it .
If you are good at understanding ideas and concepts then you can make yourself think of the facts pertained to it .
An idea when brought into implementation , then it can be known about the good and bad associated with it , there bymaking us to think about the facts related to it .

I feel the sequence related to this idea concept is , firstly generation of an idea is important and is folowed by its analysis , this is made in our brain thinking about its results .
nextly , its implementation and there by deriving the facts out of it .
So , the fact can be derived from the concept itself .

In my opinion , simply learning facts without knowing any information regarding will be like `` eating food without knowing what it is ? ''
The food that you are eating may be tasty and you are enjoying it but withou knowing what are you eating seems foolish .

In this contemporary world understanding ideas and concepts is in existence .
So , when the world is running if you still continue to be lethargic its not good on your part and you cant do justice to your profeesion .

Understanding an idea makes a person think about it there by making him develop or innovate new ideas regarding the topic .
It enables man to be thought-provoking always .
Knowing the fact will be a part of the this process if a person adopts a habit of understanding the concepts and there by filling the essence of the studying .

Thus , i feel its more important for a student to understand concepts and work upon them mindful that he is also filled with the fact along with the idea .
