Young people definitely contain the advantage of a fresh thought and innovative independent spirit , differently from the elderly that has often experienced much of the world 's phenomenological offerings and seems to approach situations with more tranquility and serenity .
However , this proneness of both groups of people to behave in a certain manner does not determine the exact outcome of the indiviual development of personality , which is a key factor that truly determines how effectively a person chooses to enjoy the beauties of his or her existence .
Hence , when we speak of a vast majority one should definitely considerate the fact that younglings are more open to challenge and extasis than senior citizens who seek a calm state of being , which to the eyes of society is less likely to express the true enjoyment of life .

Young people have the strenght and availabity to discover new grounds ; it is part of our nature that whenever we discover and explore , sentiments of joy fill our souls .
That is what young people take advantage of , this is , their physical condition and psychological standpoint that drives them to seek gratifying experiences more often than elders do , and finally accomplishing such goal .

My grandfather used to play soccer when he was young and that was his favorite sport .
He received so much joy and gratification from this activity that he would never miss a game .
Now , he is 70 years old and all he wants to do is rest .
He used to tell me : `` Soccer is it son , once it 's gone , you only live from your memories '' .
Now I am a soccer player and this sport has become part of who I am , like a blueprint .
My life would not be the same if I do not play , due to the fact that I find so much joy and happiness in it .

Thus , I believe young people do enjoy life in a more complete manner , not to be unjust or parcial , but because it goes beyond what is palpable , it is a cycle , the cycle of life .
Just like a flower reaches its most beautiful point and opens up in all its splendor and after a certain time dries up and dies , similarly is a man who lives and finishes his race .
Even though older people might find joy in different tasks , their cycle alrady allowed them to reach a certain climax that was once considered as true enjoyment , therefore leading the way for those behind them to discover and get to search for the same type of gratification , making the levels of joy definitely higher at a young age .
