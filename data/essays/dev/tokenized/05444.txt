I do agree with the following statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
It is a known fact that in todays society the word community is not that usual anymore .
It shourly does still have a strong meanig in the villages or small towns but if you look at bigger cities you will find most people living along without even knowing their neighbours name .

Especially the young people are not involved in the communities so actually giving time to helping their communities probably does not occure to them at all .
One problem is deffinatly that young people already grow into a society that is does not realy care about society any more .
So they do not realy have a chance to learn how to be part of a society and that beeing part of a society , in this case a communitie , also involves beeing motivated to give something back to it .

Of course they are supposed to learn it at school but if the parents do not care than the children will keep it the same way .
Another problem is that young people often have a lot of other stuff on their minds .
Like going to town with friends or to a disco .
Working for your communities is not realy considered as `` cool '' and your friends might even start making fun of you if you start giving your free time to help your community .

At last helping your community normaly means working for it as a volunter so you will not gain any money for it .
Many young people that want to finance their live or have a bit plus will invest their time doing something they will be paid for .

All these reasons show why young people do not invest enough time into their communities .
But it would be so important that they would do so .
First of all your community is not just a couple of people living at the same pace on this planet but it can be a wonderfull social network that might help you in hard times .
But if you want to be part of it you will have to get to know the people and be part of the team .
That is only possible if you show that you are interested in your community and realy try to be part of it .
Communities also have a lot of financial problems .
So they need volunters working for them so everybody can keep the standard of living people now have .
Young peolple tend to believe things would just be given to them without thinking about the work behind it .
If the people giving time to their communities become less things will start to disapear .
Probably young people than will wonder where the bus went driving kids to school or where the mall comes from where there used to be a park .
All these reasons make it so important that young people start to learn how to be an active part of community and why it is so important that they start giving time to helping their communities .
