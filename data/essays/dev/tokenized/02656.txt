From past 20 years one of the grooming industry is Automobile industry .
It showed its impact on all parts of the world .
There is a gradual increase of cars every where .
I dont think that number of cars will be reduced after some years .
Instead therewill be more number seen than what today .
They are palying major role in transportation .

Firstly , cars are ragarded as status symbol for many people .
They buy it just to show their status rather using it for some genuine reason .
Cars seem to have drastical impact on every class of people staring from lower middle class to upper class .
So nowayo a car can be disappeared . .

Seconly they are considered to be more comfortble .
car is preferd because it is easy to raech our destination rather waiting for some public transportation .
It dont give much stress and makes people get relaxed when compared to other means of transportaion .

Any time it can be used and make our work done in a cool way instaed of rushing for other ways .

Finally , now a days the prices of cars are also declined due to some reasons .
so they are affordble by even a middleclass person which again symbolises rise in the cars population .

Being a car owner any person can make a plaln spontaniuosly and even implement it .
Like planning for a picnic .
And example why anyone go for car is it may be used for all purposes both for official and personal things .
And car doesnt realease much of the gas and it is not the victim for pollution too .
cars not only serve as personally but they are even used as public transpotation like taxies .
So car has its effect on every walk of man 's life to reach the destination and to enjoy luxieries too .
I conclude that i cant imagine road without a car as it carry many advantages .
