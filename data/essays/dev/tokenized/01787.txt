I believe the statement which tells `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects '' because more knowledge youhave , more job you can get , and sometimes broad knowledge makes you become more trustful person after the graduation from the university because people are tend to trust a person who have more knowledge than they do .

If person have broad knowledge , it will make people around you to be more unitize , and it will make this person as a great leader .
For example , I trust the person who have more knoeledge than I do .
My football coach have a lot of experience than I do because he plays football in NFL for 4 years .
Because of he have more professional skill and knowledge , everybody trust him .
Then I realize that the more knowledge you have more trust you got from other people .
The trust unit the team , and it makes a team stronger .
it is not only for sports , this statement fits in the company too .
If you have trustful boss , your company will unit more than having a untrustful boss .
However , broad knowledge makes change of your surrounding , and it also helps to be a great leader .

Because of people are tend to believe a person who have more knowledge than they do , the broad knowledge will be needed by a person who like to have a lot of frineds around you .
The people who have a lot of kind friends always have broad knowledge .
They have friends who is good at history , math , computer , and sports because the people who have a lot of friends have a lot of connection between these kind of people .
Without any connection , nobody want to be a friend because they will not have a topic that they are going to talk about .
However the broad knowledge are needed to make a lot of friends who will support your life after the gruduation .

It is better to learning a lot of academic subject before you graduate from university because it will help you after the schoollife .
