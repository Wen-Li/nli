Teaching , learning , studying : it 's all a method !
During our school and college years , we have all had the chance to experience many teaching methods throughout our professors .
When some teachers believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts , other believe that what matters is learning the facts .

During lectures , Professors try to pass along a certain idea or concept to his students .
Undoubtedly , lectures are too theoratical and not too exciting , but remain essential .
What will the student remember on the day of his exam from his lectures ?
What is he supposed to remember ?
I believe that part of making studying an enjoyable experience , is understanding the material we are studying .
Once we have understood the material , it is printed logically in our heads .

Understanding a lesson begins with understanding the ideas and concepts , as they form the essence of the material .
But to understand the ideas and concepts , especially when it comes to complex ideas and concepts , it seems useful to start by learning the facts .

Learning the facts makes you understand the ideas and concepts more easily .

For example , if a student wants to understand Einsten 's concept of relativity , a revolutionary concept in physics , it would better to start with the facts .
Once the student would have understood the facts about the relativity concept , he could be more capable of understanding the concept as a whole .

Therefore , i believe that it is as important to understand ideas and concepts , as it is to learn facts : the two being linked to one another , leading to a better understanding of the material .
