In modern capitalist society , advertisements are a natural part of life .
In this situation , I believe that it is all but inevitable that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

The fundamental reason is that modern consumerism has made it necessary for companies to advertise their products simply because there are more goods than are necessary .
Before the advent of mass production and mass consumption , the situation was vice versa : there were probably fewer goods than are necessary .
Naturally , therefore , producers did not need to advertise at all .
But in today 's society , because of the tremendous advance of technology , it is possible to churn out unnecessary commodities produced mainly , or perhaps only , to gain profits by selling them .
As a result , producers are forced to make their products look much better than they really are so that they will be able to sell them out .

Another significant reason why advertisers exaggrate the value of their products is people 's expectation to have newer and `` better '' things .
In order to keep up with these consumers ' demand , companies are compelled not only to make new , slightly-upgraded products all the time but also to make the small improvement as impressive .
The case in point is the computer industry .
PC makers change their models three or four times a year even though the improvement is minor .
Because people expect this and because all the other competitors do so , a PC maker can not afford to continue to sell a PC first put on the market a year ago .
As a result , it is necessary for PC makers to make their products look signficantly better than their previous models by , for example , changing their looks although the content is not much different .

In conclustion , I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for two reasons .
Modern consumerism has made it necessary , and as a result , people are accustomed to have `` better '' products , which forces producers to exaggerate minor improvements .
It would be impossible to change this situation , and , therefore , consumers need to be wise enough not to be deceived by advertisements .
