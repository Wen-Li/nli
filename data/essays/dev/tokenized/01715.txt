One for all and all for one , each one have the right to be in a society , and involved in a community , and be a part of it , and every part of the community has to build it up .

Every person in the community has to work for acheiving the community 's golas , he should give efforts to reach these goals , by improving there societies they improve themselves , everyone should share in helping the community , every thinkinful person have to encourage and motivate other people to help in anyway , as an example : everyone who can pay from his extra money .
is paying for a charity for helping poor young people to learn in shools , to prevent food for them , homes , maybe clothes , young people might not be able to pay money , they might be able to do some jobs , such as teaching the young kids , babysitting for the babies , making food , gathering things , maybe if they arrange certain days for making certain activities , like the cleaning day or week , which everyone in a certain age has to come and share in the cleaning .

Young people have to improve their skills and themselves , by reading , learning , escpically the third world countrie 's people , they have to raise up their countries and communities , young people might do meetings for discussing what to do for improving their societies and their communities , I think there are many ideas in order to make young people do somethings to their communities they have to give some efforts to them , I admit that if young people do something , they will do it in perfect ways that lead their communities for being built up and improved , and at last the one should never forget what his community did for him and try to pay it back and work for it
