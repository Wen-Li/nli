Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , yes of course , i agree with this .
The way advertisement used now a days as lost the meaning of its purpose , early days its pupose is to bring to the people , make people aware of that certain product is available in the market , which benefits the customers in different ways , in that advertisment they clearly give the description of the product , and way that could be used in real life .

The very purpose of that advertisement is lost now a days , they are just showcasing the product , then it orginally exhibits its characterstics , comparing it with other product and fooling the public of the worthiness of the product , then really it has .

They use some girls , for advertising face creams , before they use this product they look not beautiful , but using the products for a few time brings chane in them itseems , they wiil be looking charming , how this happens , its just the camera trick and the make up they are given , if we use it orginally will we get that change , no definetlty no For example take an product , namely toothpaste , the companies related to it are pepsodent , colgate , closeup , all this product have same ingredients and mixtures of same level , but while advertising each company showcases its own product , differently , comparing with others , not mentioning name of the differnt company , that their companies product has better features than others , u just tell me how the product desingned with same formula , but with companies different have different features .
So the way advertisement is now used is just showcasing the product than it orginally be , makes product seem much better than it really is .

Another example is soap , the company JOCIL designes soaps , and they sell those to bonded companies , they just labels the paper on it and advertises about the product and simple express the features of it with out knowing it .

For advertising , now a days , the famous body is used , such as actor , sportsman , singer so on . ..
so the people who liked the famous body , will automatically buy the product and others who doesnt like it , they dont go near the product , and this is one of the way that product is being showcased more than it is worthy of , as people like the words of famous bodies , they feel that the product is really worthy of being purchased , and they simply buy it as his/her famous body advertised the product .

Thus i feel that , the advertisement , is just showcasing the product than really the worthiness of it , make product seem much better than they really are .
There is no doubt that certain qualities are there in the product , but all the qualities mentioned in advertisement , not neccessariliby in it , its just added qualities to attract the public to the product .
