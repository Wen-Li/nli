I disagree on having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

I feel that we should narrow down our choice of subject rather than increasing the knowledge on all subjects widely .

We all study for a better career and when we get out of the university people ask for specific skills and we should be the best among our skills to get the job .
If we start having a broad knowledge on many academic subject instead of concentrating on what your career exactly needs we will loose the race in the job hunt .

We all know the famous quote `` Jack of all , King of none '' now thats what would happen if we start gaining knowledge on many subjects rather than one .
We would no doubt increase our knowledge but unless we specialize on all of them its of no use .

I would cite an example of myself , I always wanted to be a software engineer and there is heavy competition out in the market for software jobs .
If I had not taken up software as my major in my university I would not have made a job .
No software industry wants a person who knows 10 subjects but is not specialized in software .

But at the same time I insists we should know a bit of other subjects too for the sake of our general knowledge and to live in this world .
In our school we read about everything like maths , science , geography , history , etc , . , and thats enough for us to know on many academic subjects .
Once we come out of school and join a university we should start focussing on one particular area of intrest which would ultimately give us satisfaction and better career prospects .

I would like to conclude by saying that specializing on one subject is always more fruitful than learning about a lot of subjects .
