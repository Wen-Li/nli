No i do not entirly agree on the statement that group travel led by a tour guide is the best way to travel due to numerous reasons

i have gone to many countries both in a group with my parents and alone , in my experince the best time i had was with a group of teenagers my age in Usa because we were all the same age and of diffrent backgrounds , but it wasn ' entirly like a vacation where you had your peice of mind , and complete freedom to they ways you wanted to enjoy your time .
Rather than waking up at 6 in the morning and going accordiong to set guidelines made by the tour guide i would chose to roam the place alone , discovering numerous places on my own and taking the vacation as an adventure .

Altough moving in a group can be fun , but i belive going with a small group of maybe about 2 or 3 freinds that think alike is a better option and even though going with a huge group is amazing fun , the tour guide is what spoils all the fun .
tour guides usually have the whole vacation planned out with set timmings making the holiday seem like another school day where you have a worked up schedule to follow .

therefore in my opnion the best way to travel would definatly be in a group but without a tour guide , because then you get the freedom to do you want and the liberty to make you own dicisions rather than following a tour guide .
but if the tour guide is another person similar to the group your traveling in and knows the place well the tour could defintly be the best ones .
But going to the himalays for adventure with a tour guide would defenitly kill the adventorus feeling that could be achived by going alone .

therefore the statemnt has its pros and cons dependiong on your tour guide , the group and the situation .
but if all the three are perfect then the statment is defenitly justified .
