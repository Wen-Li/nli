Nowadays people are living in a mixed world with all kind of generations and where the community grows faster .
How help yours communauties with the time you have ???
Fisrt of all , in my opinion , I am a student of twenty years old , and I would say that in your evderydaylife , you never find anought time for all you wanted to do .

As far as I am concerned , I would say that giving time for other people , or be investigated in an activity requieres to you a lot of human qualityand a strong engagement .

It might not be easy to help our communauty when you have responsibilty at work , at home , with children .
In order to manage a good way of living we have to make choice at any time during our own life .

Secondly , we can considerate the problem with a different point of view .
If you are living in a huge town it will be more difficult to help communauty than living in the country .

Thank to there small village in the country , everybody knows everybody .
The fact of the densification of the popuation , it 's easier and faster to make link and create central meeting .
Obviously , the communauty will grow up with helpful younger .

I do n't really agree with the fact that young people do not give enough time to the communauty .
For example , sometimes in your jobs , the director asks to you hight resposabillities , even if you did'nt choice you have to control and help your company .
But what we forget it is the fact that it it probably for the biologic research , and htne the communauty progress .

To believe that young peolple are not enought helpful with the communauty will be wrong , their behavior is different .
They stay investigated in this huge world .
