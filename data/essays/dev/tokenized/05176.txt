As we now that in this world every one want freedom , no one want to be a slave .
Because they think that they had born individual .
According to this statement i am not agree with the following statement .
Because its not a need to go in a group or led by tour guide .
The main purpose of tour guide is to lead the team , and show the direction .
In the group or with tour guide there are lot of boundation , like we have to move with group only .
we cant move as we like to move any where .
we have to follow all the instruction which is given by group leader .
even we like that place or not we have to be stay with them .
Lots of problem we can face at the time of trevel .
If we are going in a group we cant leave that place without permission .
So now a days in our society no body wht restriction , they want to move free and enjoy any where .
Like i am taking a example of college student , if they are going picnic for five days for the permission of college principal .
There college principal suggest them better you people go with tour guide , so that in future you need not to be faced any problem .
But student were not agree because they want to go without guide or any faculity member .
They want only freedom , because then only they can enjoy any where and use there time in a better way .
some time we need a tour guide but not every time , and also we keep in mind that up to a certain limit freedom must be there , if it will ecess it will not good for individual .
In my opinion the best .
Finally i would like to conclude the best way to travel without any tour guide , but we have to manage all the things , in a right manner and in a systematic way .
