Although I understand why some people think it is more important for students to learn facts , I think that it 's more efficient for them to understand ideas and concepts .
To my view , there are three reasons why ideas and concepts prevail .
First , ideas and concepts enable a student to understand not only one fact but also plenty other facts because facts happen once and ideas can explain many facts .
For example , you can know how to cook a specific cake but if you understand how cakes are made in general you will be able to cook every cake .
It means that by understanding a fact , a student would be able to anticipate only this precise fact next time he experiences it .
Instead , if a student understands the concept he will be able to anticipate the outcome of many related facts .

Secondly , ideas and concept are the first things that you learn at school and I think it is efficient .
For instance , in mathematics , you always begin by learning the rules before applying them .
Moreover , theory is something that gather information from the experience of other people .
That is exactlwhat the teacher is teaching : concentrated experience rather than a fact .

Last , according to my personnal experience I think it 's more important to understand first ideas and concepts .
I created a fashion company but I knew only a few things about this industry .
Thanks to my knwloedge that I have learned in class I was able to adapt and anticipate things as I already knew this industry .
For example , marketing concepts can be used for every industries .
By using them I was able to cleat the hurdle which was my ignorance of the industry .

To conclude , I think that ideas and concepts prevail on facts and that is why .
Still , as I said at the beginning , I understand people who think the opposite because you need to fact to understand how to apply the theory .
