Does success come to you or do you come to success ?
Would doing only what you are used to do be proficient to take it to another level ?
The key to success often comes with a certain risk involved .

Observing successful people you often find a pattern that those people are open to new ideas , will go new ways and broaden their vision continously .
The are not shy to take risks , and thus help progress to be made .

If one only did what he used to be doing for years , his vision would narrow and his success be steady .
Many people succeed not in doing the same year in , year out , but in breaking out of their usual work pattern .
Certainly , this very step involves a lot of risk .
If you fail , you might lose your job .
If you invest lots of money , it might be lost .
If your are working with hazardous materials , you might risk your health or even your life .
But technical progress hardly would have been made if it was not for people who risked their lives in order to find ways to improve airplanes , cars or machinery .

If no one dared to award Larry Page and Sergej Brin with two million dollars in 1998 , Google would not have revolutionized the internet .
Now , it paid off a millionfold .

Risks have to be taken , and people need to be open to new ideas to develop them further , to try them out and to eventually decide whether they are worth it or not in , order to gaining a competitive advantage over their rivals .

Nothing is secure , and nothing is to be gained if we just stuck with what we know , and only in very rare cases success and development comes to us .
In most cases , we have to work hard for it , never knowing whether it will pay of .

One of the best examples might be stock brokering .
Is he most successful who always went for the safe bets ?
Generally , the highest revenues are made through investing in the more risky stocks .
And only those who are open to take the risk will succeed long-term in this market .

Being open to new things and daring to take risks brings you further than just go with the normal daily routine .
