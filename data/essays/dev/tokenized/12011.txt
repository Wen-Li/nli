I disagree with the given statement becuase I strongly believe that society has managed to reach the hieghts that it has today through specialization and division of labour .
Specialization is a theory that emphasizes the importance of concentration in one particular field .
When this theory was employed by factories and manufacturing plants , it resulted in a dramatic increase in production .
Ofcourse specialization has its drawbacks and faults which are caused due to lack of knowledge in other fields , but the benefit of knowing one thing really well , greatly outweighs the faults of specialization .

A reason why specialization is so successful is because eventually ( usually after 12 years or so of schooling ) , people realize that they are better at somethings than other things , or they realize that they have a passion for a certain field and that that 's what they want to do for the rest of their lives .
At this point in time it becomes apparent to them that other knowledge , that does n't further their understanding of their subject choice , is a waste of time .
After all , if some one wishes to be a mechanical engineer , why does he need to know the literary feature that Shakespeare had used to capture his audiences attention .

I 've already decided what I want to do in life , and to tell the truth studying things like Spanish and Business seem to divert time away from my goals of becoming a research scientist .
I love reading about the latest medical breakthroughs and discoveries , but all I get by learning Spanish is frustration and low marks .
I sincerely doubt the importance of spanish in the long run , I mean sure it might help me communicate with people who only know spanish , but how many people will I meet like that .
Through my personal experiences I 've learned the importance of knowledge in all areas , but I 've also seen the importance of specialization , and in my opinion , to know one thing very well is a lot better than knowing relatively nothing in everything ,
