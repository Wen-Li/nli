Helping a community is a noble act .
And I also agree that youngsters today do not give enough time to help their own community .
But it can not be completely attributed as lack of concern from the young people .
There are several reasons for this .

The primary reason is that with so many activites going on parallelly in young people 's lives - studies , projects , assignments and other more important commitments that they are left with very little time for themselevs .
And so they prefer to concentrate that little time left in their hobbies or some other personal activities rather than helping their communities .

With the advent of television and other media 's which has revultionised our lives , we are concerned so much more with what is happening around the world that we actually forget the problems immediately surrounding us .
One of my neighbour 's is addicted to this one sitcom , which is played everyday night that he actually leaves all his pending work and religiously watches the show .
Such is the impact of television on today 's generation .

Also there is a growing trend among youngsters especially among the college goer 's that such activities are uncool and out of vogue .
So some students deliberately avoid helping a community even if it is against their conscience , just to show that they are cool .
To be frank , i myself have witnessed this during my junior college years .

This kind of thinking which is actually much more prevalent among the youngsters in the urban area 's needs radical change .
It is really a shame that youngsters today consider such noble acts as cheap and uncool .

But there are some people in each community who after all this things , dedicate some time to such work .
