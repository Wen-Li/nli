In a way , I disagree with the statement that Young people nowadays do not devote enough time in helping their community .
I beleive that in the current times , communities themselves do not require much help or much time in help .

In the past , people of a small town or a village identified themselves as a community and worked towards mutual and communal benefit .
There were weekly meetings and the problems of the community were discussed .
Young people who form the most energetic part of the group volunteered in solving the problems and in arranging festivals and local gatherings .

People were more physically involved the community .
They worked as a team and one 's problem was everybody 's problem .
It was natural for young people to be the most active component of the community .

In many modernised parts of the world , the situation is in stark contrast to what it was in the past .
The revolutions in communication technology and the advent of the internet has largely devated people from each other to the computer .

Systems and services have become more efficient and computerized .
There is much less need for people , not only young to be involved in any help mainly because there is not much help required .
People can discuss problems in e-communities and via email and chat .

The town administration has it 's public website and any problem can be posted on it .
Responsible people can then take necessary action .
so today , there is not much help required but there is a big need for ideas and in this case young people still form the most active group .

So in view of the current times , I disagree .
