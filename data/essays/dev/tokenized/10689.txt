I does n't agree with the statement ` Young people enjoy life more than older people do ' !

I think one reason is that there are some big differences between young people and older people because older people have other experiences than the younger people !
You can not put them on the same basic .
In my opionen older people enjoy their life in an other way then in their past .
In the past parents were much stronger with their chlidren than today .
Older people enjoy their life with doing other activities than the younger people do .
They have n't go to a club or a disco to enjoy their freetime .
They do things like travelling and walking around or reading interesting books or something else .

When you are older you also have more possibilities to enjoy your life because you may be have more money than the younger people .

For me it is really terrible that young people enjoy life often in a very strange way .
Often they have to drink alcohol or putting drugs into their body to have fun !
For me it is not a way of enjoying life .

For example there are my parents .
In their younger life they did n't enjoy life like they do it today .
That is because they became mum and dad in their younger days and so they were n't able to have fun like teenagers or young people in nowadays .
But today their childern are adults and do n't live at home , so they are able to make holidays or go to cinema or something like that whenever they want to .
I think that is a good way of enjoying life and freetime .

To give a short conclusion it is important to enjoy life when you are young and when you are old .
