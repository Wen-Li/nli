There are many reasons why the number of cars in use today will not stop increasing in the future .
Just judging from the way cars have become more and more popular and common over the past tweny years it is unlikely to expect a sudden change in that area .

Another point supporting that theory certainly is that cars have become more affordable for everyone and also very easy accessable for young people .
Most people in The United States of America posess their first own car bz the age of sixteen .

Another problem that in my opinion is directly linked to the number of cars and that we are facing today is the problem of obesety in sociey .
In most developped countries peolpe are getting bigger and bigger , become more and more lazy and therefore more likely to drive a car .
Simplz because it is more convenient .

Then again , people are also starting to be aware of the direct link between cars and the effect they have on environmental changes .
Some strongly object to the idea of having a car because they simply can not live withe the thought of destroying the planet out of egoistic purposes .

In a television transmission that i happened to watch a few days ago i also heard a discussion about tha earth running out of natural sources such as oil .
If there is no more oil we will have a huge problem supplying our cars .
Although that is not expected to happen anytime soon scientists are trying to find alternative by developping more natural and environment friendly ways to make an engine work .

But I believe that this will take a huge amount of time and not be presented to the public in the next years .
So , no , i do not believe that there will be less cars in 20 years
