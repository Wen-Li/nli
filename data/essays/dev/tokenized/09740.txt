In my opinion in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ; although this statement can sound totally unaware of the fact that cars ' possessors are quickly growing all over the world , I will now explain the reasons for my idea .

Cars ' prices have been decreasing slightly in the past few decades : originally born as a super-luxury status symbol back in the end of the nineteenth century , we can therefore clearly state that today cars are a commodity affordable by almost anyone in any industrialized country .
However , this apparently good change of the situation , has led to two extremely negative effects : the abrupt rise in oil prices , and a tremendous impact on the planet 's environment .

Firts things first , since cars are produced and sold even in big , heavily populated countries like China and India ( together comprehending more than one third of the world population altogether ) , markets where once they were unavalible to almost the totality of people , their demanded quantity has risen to the sky , and so the fuel prices : petroleum extracting sites are used in a more and more savage way , but the lack of offer of this fundamental mineral caused , according to a very well known economic law , an increase in its price .
As of today , even extracting sites placed very far from any valuable market , or very expensive to use , have been approaching by excracting companies ( e.g. in Alaska , in the North Sea , through Oceanic platforms . .. )
after the traditional sites ' shortage .

It is my opinion that the oil prices , unfortunately , rise more and more , to the point where cars will be once again an item affordable by , and only by , very rich people , therefore decreasing significantly their number .
The only solution to this inevitable economic disaster would be to find some alternative energy font ; however , researches in that field have been growing slowly in the last years , thus our energetic future is not looking bright at all .

Besides , how not to mention the fact that since cars ' use spread around every continent ( and it 's gonna be worse and worse in the short period ) pollution 's effects on global environments have icreased so much ?
Cars are not what you might call an ecological way of transportation : having more and more of them drinving around all over the world might even lead to the worst solution .
Some scientist , in fact , even came to think that , if their number is still going to increase over the years , world governmentscould even ban them from using , so to prevent the enivronment , that however , by that day will probably be seriously compromised .

To summarize , I think that cars ' number will grow in the short period , until it will be too much to afford them ( in economical and ecological means ) : since that moment on I believe there will be fewer and fewer of them , even less than today .
