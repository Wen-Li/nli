Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects plays essential role in our lives .
Broad knowledge effects our analysis of events and it also determines how we will think in certain situations .
It is difficult to think about the topics that you have not heard before .
You can not even express your feelings without having knowledge about that topic .
It is better to have broader knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one subject .
Specialization would restrict your world views and also it is difficult to decide in which subject you are going to specialize so in that case you would lose your other chances .

Specialization should occur after the broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
For instance I am studying International Relations and my department underlines the importance of having broder knowledge .
I could not just focus on Cold War without having knowledge of the results of First World War .
Also the broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help you to analyze the events in different dimensions , With the broad knowledge that I have , I can analyze the actions of states in different aspects .

In addition ; if you specialize in one specific subjects , you would not even know so many things about other subjects .
It seems dangerous .
It is difficult to face with a subject you do not have any opinion .
Also , examples can be given from daily life .
For instance ; you can be an excellent cook but it would have no worth if you did not know how to wash the dishes .
It would complement each other .
This is the simple example but it reflects the importance of having broad knowledge .

Finally ; with the broad knowledge of many academic subjects , people will have chance to see events in different perspectives even reading newspaper ; they can create relations with other events strongly .
Also it is difficult to choose a one important subject for specialization .
Specialization can only be achieved after broad knowledge of many academic subjects but broad knowledge can not be achieved after specializing in one subject .
