And they will decide what they want to be in their futur life for example an engineer so they will join the university after they will dream about their futur life , and they will really enjoy life when they will love a person they will dreams about making a family .
So they will have many things to enjoy and to share it with others .

In the same time the older people enjoy life in many ways , when they will remember their own life that passed and the things what they did they will see their family growing up and especially they will be happy when they will carry their children 's childrens they will be absolutley enjoying life and the older people will enjoy their life after the retirement they will be free for example to go fishing hunting whatever , in the same time they will have problems but they will still enjoying life with the rest .
