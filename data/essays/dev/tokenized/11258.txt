I believe most advertisement make products seem better than they really are .
This is because the kind of things shown in advertisement do not take account of real life conditions , also to differentiate products from other competitors they are hyped for their goodness .

Firstly advertisement make products seem better than they really are because when advertisement is made they do not account the real life conditions .
For example when an advertisement of a bike is shown the advertisers do not take into the account of braking , stopping , idling of the bike when they show the mileage of the bike which is most of the times never turn out to be actually achievable at all .
With hyped mileage quoted in the advertisement the product in this case the bike seems to be a better than it is really as it can not deliver the quoted mileage of advertisement .

Secondly companies intentionally make good advertisements of their products than they really are to differentiate their product from the other products which are available of other companies .
By doing this they try to create a branding and a niche of their product which is very much smiliar to the other product .
Take for example laptop companies like Acer , HP which show about the ease of work , graphics display which would not cause eye strain .
But in actuality it does it and is very similar to the other product .

Ultimately advertisements make products seem much more better than they really are .
