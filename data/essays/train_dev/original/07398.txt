the statement says the young people enjoy more than older people.
personally, i don't agree this statment in all of this part. infact, by my points of view the young people is less responsable of other mature people. 
generally, in the last years the way to enjoy life is changed. infact today young peole have less problem than young people of forty years ago for example. today a boy depends totally from his parents. in this way he have less responsability and this caused a total insoddisfaction of all.
instead of the young people, the older people have achieved a total maturity that permitt they to enjoy life more than young people with small things, like a only dinner with friends or a travel with family.
it is also true that the young boys have a lot of enthusiam respect to older people. but this concept don't go to over see the problem.
there are also cases where older people don't enjoy life beacuse they have very big problem like the fact of to not fand a work or for example because their are very tyred.
so, my personal opinion is that the young boy, in the state of parity of conditions, don't enjoy life so much.
infact also in my family i see that my parents enjoy life more than me and my brother. 
finally, in this way i say that i disagree with the above statement.
