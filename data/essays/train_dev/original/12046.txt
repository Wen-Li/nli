As we know every community was builded by their people. People such old persons or young persons work together to make great nations and provide good life.     

        In my opinion, I dont agree with the following statement "young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping thier communities". Becouse the most important role in creating any powerful nation is her young people. Becouse they have the powerful and young mind to keep developing it. Nation that give the hand and support for its young people we found it aproud of its acheviments. Young people are participate in different side of coumminty. They work in teaching, engineering, medicene, and hand crafts to provide the good environment of raising new generations of young people. These new generations will continue carrying the future of the nation and its development. As we see today, in lebanon were the war is killing all people and destroying building. Young people stand thier to help their nation in hospitals and in places war arrive to it. And to share them their pain and fear. While other young people are standing to defend their lands from this war and its results. Young people give their lifes for the community and the nation should be the examples and the leaders for all young people around the world.

       Finaly, nations and communities are measured by thier young people and their achivements. More powerful young people, more powerful nation it is an easy eqaution have just two variables. And the young people who raised on old people hands continue to carry the message for all generations come after.
