There are two way  for training to work and to live. One of these is speecializing in one specific subject, the other is studying in order to have a broad knowledge. In my opinion each of these ways has some advantagesand some disadvantages, but the second is the best.
As regards the first possibilty, that is having a specific knowledge, I think that the most important advantage is that who has a specific education, have a high possibility to find a job, a well rewarding job, in the field where he or she studies in depht. Indeed, nowadays, firms and companies, look for people who can give a sensible help to the firm.  Students well prepared are a competitive factor that allow firms to gather much money.
On another hand, people or students who have a wide range of interests, who study different subjects , have the possibility to use the informations they gather during their training in order to create a good social life . Moreover I think that these people are more flexible in change their work during their life.
For these reasonss, even if at first view, the first kind of knowledge could seem better, I think that, expecially in the liong time, for example during the whole life, the second kind of knoledge is more useful for people.
I think so, because I chose to study a subjet in depht, that is management engineering, and I  study this subject in depht for making myself more competitive that the others students in the world of job. Whene I have some free time I prefer not to spend it in reading because I'm very tired for my work at university. But when I meet people studing something different from economical, mechanical or industial subjects, and I talk with them about something they have discussed in class or they have read in a magazine I alway feel that I'm incomplete, my education is incomplete, because even if I'm clever I haven't the basic informations to say my opinion about the topic. So I think that everyone should be spend part of the day to read magazine, journal and so on in order to have a rewarding life.
