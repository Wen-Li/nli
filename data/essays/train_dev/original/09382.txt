As it is said that high return cannot be gotten without high risk, it seems to be true that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know. However, I disagree with the idea because of following reasons.

	Firstly, success can be achived if you continue doing what you already know how to do well. For example, in Japanese traditional arts like Kabuki or Nou, the performers repeat the practice of the same story every day from the day they start the practice when they are 3 years old or so to the day they die. However, we all admit that they could succeed in fully expressing the traditional arts as parts of Japanese culture. The same also applies to traditional craftmakers or even professional baseball players. They improve their abilities by repeating the same things which is the most familiar to them every day. These examples are enough to deny the statement above.

	Besides, even if trying new things brings you the chances for success, new things must mean the things which is new to everyone, not to the person alone. Someone who always change their focuses cannot have a chance to get success.
