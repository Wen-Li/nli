I do  agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem better than they are. 
This should come to no surprise as an advertisement by definition responds to an aim. The aim is not to give an information to the consumer (for which there is the press), but rather, to make the particular pruduct more appealing. An advertisement is supposed to increase the sales of a particular product, which is sold for a profit of course. So the manipulation of the human individual is the purpose of the advertisement.
Advertisements are sponsored and financed by the producer, who essentially dictates what they should say.
This fact is known to everybody, so it is even fair to do some overtstating within limits.
Of course there are consumer protection laws in all western countries. These laws discourage an advertiser from making outright false claims. So, realistically, outright lies are probably uncommon in advertisement.
However within this limitation, it is rather easy to make non verifiable statements or suggestions, which are neither true nor a lie. Anti-aging, cosmetic products are typical examples. Of course, nobody suggests that you can stop aging. But, most advertisements for such products do implictly suggest it as an undelying, implicit,  message, without explictly saying it, by the layout and setting of the advertisement etc.Cosmetic products` advertisements always show fresh, young characters who have no issue with aging....
Also, advertisers usually try to convey a dream, a feeling, and not a rationaly verifiable message. For instance advertisements for expensive cars, watches and generally luxury goods always advertise the quality and substance of the product, which is greatly overstated, but in the end, the customer buys it for intangible reasons, such as prestige and exclusivity associated with owning a luxury product. It is unrealistic that a expensive swiss manual watch is more reliable, precise, than a cheap chinese copy... But that is not the point.
