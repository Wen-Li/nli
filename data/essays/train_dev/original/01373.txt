I do not agree with the statement because of the following three reasons. The students will not have chance to confirm that what they know is true, and it might cause the decrease of the students' interest towards the subject. Also, they will not have ability to adjust their own knowledge to perform in the actual world which is the main reason why students learn. Therefore, it is not more important for studnets to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. 
	Understanding ideas and concepts are recieving informations from others who have already experienced, and by not being able to actually see how the ideas and concepts work, the students might not be able to have enough interest about the subject as they should be. If the students are not actively experiencing the facts on their own, they can easily doubt that if those ideas and concepts are true in real world. Lacking the ability to see how they actually work can cause the decrease of their interest, which brings negative affects on learning habits. 
	Students without skills to perform correct actions in the real world often do not have enough experience which comes from learning facts of their own experiences. As they grow up and prepare to play a important role in the society, it is required to have a lot of knowledge as well as enough experience to know how to adjust the knowledge for each specific situations. Students with only  ideas and concepts which other people have introduced will lack the ability to gather specific informations of their own and place them into a correct consequences. 
	It is more important for students to learn facts because it increases the willingness for students to learn as well as the ability to perform better in various situations in the real world.
