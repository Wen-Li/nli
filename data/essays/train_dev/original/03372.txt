To choose  between a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or a good specialization in only one specific subject is not easy, as both possibilities have advantages and disadvantages. Anyway I agree with the idea that it-s better to have a broad knowledge of several different subjects, and that for several reasons.

     First of all, a person with a variety of interests and knowledges in different fields is probably a person with an open mind  who shows a strong  intellectual curiosity. Famous intellectuals of the past, like Leonardo Da Vinci, just to name one of the most known,  had an incredible variety of knowledges and curiosities. Then, having a broad knowledge of the world in general might help people in their carreer and professional life. Also, having a good knowledge in a variety of subjcts doesn-t necessarily mean that a person can-t have a special field of interest in which he or she is more competent. 
An open mind and a broad culture can be a great advantage in a fast changing world as the one  we live in today.  In fact we must be ready and able to adapt to different situations and conditions. 

     On the contrary, if we are too rigid, if we are overspecialized in a very particular field, we might be unable to get the whole picture, so to speak, and  we might be less flexible, less able to cope with any change we can have to deal with in our lives. Of course there-s nothing wrong with being very good in a particular subject we like more. I think that only overspecialization is wrong. If someone is competent and interested only in a very special field, he or she might be very good in his or her job, but might not be able to adapt or to react to situations that require a more general approach. 

     Sometimes you read on papers of terrible mistakes doctors do in their work, as not understanding exactly a patient-s desease or simply confusing symptoms described by patients. That can be due to the fact that some doctors are extremely well prepared in their field, but are sometimes unable to analize the whole situation, and they might miss the fact that they are dealing with people and not just with sick kidneys or livers,  to give an exemple. 

     For all said reasons, I do believe that having a broad knowledge of many subjects and keeping the curiosity and passion for learning all our life is definitely better that limit our knowledges only to a specific field of study.
