Opinions might exists over whethe most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are. Personally, I agree with the above statement because advertisements are a method to maximize companies profits. As well, the time for advertisements is dramatically short.

To start with, the purpose of making advertisements is to attract their customers. Today's society, many companies exist, and many products are made by them. As a result, the companies tend to draw people to buy their goods. In this sense, advertisements are one of the best way to increase selling rates. to illustrate, everyday, people are surrounded by the numarable number of advertisement. To hold the people's attention, the functions of goods in advertisement are different with original functions of it. My mother is a case in point. She often suffers from bad flu and buy medicine after watching medical advertisements. However, she always failed to find effective medicine for her flu. This is because every goods in advertisements seems increasingly perfect for her, but they did not cure her pain. As a result, she has no choice but to buy new medicine. As illustrated above, most advertisements fake people in certain degree of functions for more profits.    

What is more, the time of adverisements is dramatically short and companies have to give people impressions about their products in the short time. Therefore, they have no choice but to make products seem much better than original.
