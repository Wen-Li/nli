I believe that is treue that the young people do not give enough time to helping their comunities but this is caused for the society and the parents. 

I am a young girl and I am totally agree with this statement. In my opinion the youngers are busy in their own things and don-t worry of the troubles that appear in their own comunity. They and I think that there are people that worry of the things of the society yet and they will look for some solution.
The youngers that have a good life are the less worried because their parents help them and will solve their problems and they don-t think that when they will be adults won-t stay their parents.
I know that this position is worse but this is that our parents teach our.
Some exemples are when we throw some paper at floor and we aren-t be able to take the paper and put in the rubbish. Or when somebody paint with a spray on the doors... This persons don-t think when they do that, they do that they like.

I wish that the youngers were more careful and that they think before to do anything. They have to know that whole the worse of the society is bad for they. I like that the politics would do more programes for the young people because this would help to envelope on the troubles of the society.
And believe that with the help of the whole our own comunity will became to be better!
