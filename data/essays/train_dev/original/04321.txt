According to risk taking there are two types of people; one of which hates taking any  kind of risky attempt and the other is ready in orderto  try new things and take risks.According to my oppinion people  should be enough  courages to  take risks so that they  could make inventions,innovations and businesses.

New foundations, inventions are born from the risk taking attemps. Today we are in the space era thanks to those risky ideas and doings. When we think about humanbeings first  space travel .The possiblity of returning alive is not much..Full of risk gave its result so that new space station s cqan  be establishedd. there can  not  be any  scientists  who could make  his invention  without trying  risky experiments.Edison could invent  electric after his unlimited  number of unsuccessful experiments.He sacrified much in terms of risks attemps

Additionally in the bussiness life  we  see that the firms could be established with a risk involment.Noione can predict whether or not his firm will make  money or not. But there are many examples of bussiness men who began the entreprise with bank credits or loans with higher interest  rates which means that  he must earn  with a higher  rate.this is also risk  taking.What  is done to  start and even to run a new firm . is  also  risk  taking. Without risktaking  nothing  new  can  not  be   founded. 

In brief  in order  to  achive  new thing like inventions and to make bussiness the very first need is risk taking ability.we are living in space era because of the risks taken.There exist firms thank to risk taking idea
