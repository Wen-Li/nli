Why do young people not give enough time to helping their communities nowadays? I presume there are several reasons for that. 

First of all, young people have increasing possibilities and money to spend their leisure time, so they might rather spend their time enjoying themselves with friends than to be helping the community.

Another reason might be the changing living conditions. People nowadays have to be and are more flexible. The number of young people leaving their hometown to study in a city far away has increased. Young people are changing jobs more frequently than before and thus have to move houses. The time a young person spends in one site has shortened and accordingly the feeling of being a part of a community. Helping a community means to be motivated as you feel responsible for it. Without having spent a certain time in a community your are less motivated to help, as you do not know a lot of people personally. The personal knowledge of people though increases your motivation to help strongly.

The strongest reason for the fact that young people nowadays help less in communities is the changed behaviour towards communities. People have become more individual, more focussed on themselves and their needs. Families as much as communities do not mean as much to people as they used to in the past. People are economically more independent so that they do not need support and help of the communities as much nas in the past. 

Taking all those factors into account I would agree that more and more young people tend not to give enough time to helping their communities.
