young or old  .. it's all about joy

There are differences between the thinking of old and young people due to several reasons, the most important of it is their life style and experience, and their methods to enjoy themseves,as the definitions of enjoying life and how to enjoy life can differ from young people to older people in a huge scale.

as a young woman, i believe that youth enjoy life for the sake of enjoying  it and not for the happiness that this joy can result. Young people think that there are many years left in life and we should enjoy it as much as possible before they have serious responsibilities such as career and family. unfortunatly, some times enjoying life for young people  means irresponsiblity and careless in life, this is not true for all young people, but many of them interprete it this way.

According to what i mentioned before, i dont agree with the statment that says "young people enjoy life more than older people", as i believe that older people do enjoy life, but in a different way than younger generation would understand, this is due in many reasons like the lack of communication between older and younger generations, and their different difinitions of enjoying life.

For example, i enjoy life by traveling around the world and by meeting new freiends and new contacts, and i always request my mother to do so, but she as an older generation tells me that her biggest joy now is to raise her children well, and to watch them get successful and happy, while years ago she used to enjoy her self differently.

Therefore, i believe that older people enjoy life as much as younger people, and sometimes even more, but the difference is about the thinking of older people, and their experiences after growing wise and mature, which are great things that the younger generation can learn from, and therefore enjoy life more.
