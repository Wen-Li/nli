As the economy and travelling ablities growing rapidly, more and more people are addicted in travelling  worldwide or natiionwide. Commonly, there are two ways of enjoying our tour, one is travel by ourselves with a tour guide, the other one is joining a group and to be led by a tour guide.

However, I have to pay the tour guide and the company a plenty of money, even if we know its not worth it, just because of our laziness. I can get through the visiting places's information online, I  can communicate with the house owner for renting, also I can bargan with the host, and from my prospensity, these are also the part of enjoyment of the tour. So, In a word, I can have more fun if i arrange the tourment with my self.

In addition, I like to travel with my lover together, so for this reason i will not choose go with a group beceause of lacking private time and space. 

From the arguemnt discussed above , I hold the negative attitude towrds that the best way to travel is on a group led by  atour guide, just for the reasons sta
