I strongly disagree with advertisement activities making products seems much better than they really do. This is a case of manepulating customers decision. Some times this concept might go further to demonstrate a staus of cheating when mentioning false information about products or giving unreliable guarantees. Companys and goods sellers should talk and descibe the actual advantages, features and services they have. Presenting these items to the customers in an attaractive way shall not be considered as a manner of cheating or telling lies. Ways of presenting goods and advertising to them in a proper and honest way is mentioning the components and items utelized to amnufacture these goods. Companys utelizing materials with quality might point out the how good are the materials used in manufacturing. Another way of fair advertising actitvities, is highlighting the efforts were required to get some good produced and pointing out the professional and continuous planning to tachieve this perfection. Marketing trends in some culture by attracting consumers with utelizing cultural concepts (e.g. cultural and traditional saying as a logo). Another example of fair advertising is studying the trends and behaviours of consumers (e.g. packing childrens' toys in a bright colored boxes), and we shall not consider this a manner of manepulation whereas no false information were mentioned about this product. By observing international markets, manufatures and goods sellers all over the world are now trying to giving glorious and attractive names to their products which isn't a sort of decision makers manepulating. Focusing also on the customers needs and making pruchoures pointing out the positive side and promise of fulfilling their requirements can be considered a way fair promoting to some goods. I do beleive that all advertising activeties should be carefully studied to give bright image about any products to the customers without mentoining false information or making them look much better than they really are.
