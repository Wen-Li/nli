I agree to the author's opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.The present generation faces various challenges ,works with too many responsibilities in a world of immense competition.They hardly have ample time to help their communities.

Man's life today has changed tremendously with the advancement in science and technology. The more the changes over the years,the higher their aims have become,the greater the responsibilities to be carried out and the greater are the accomplishments to be made.His needs have changed tremendously with advancement in technology and science.This change has not made  his life easier but  also challenging to succeed.

Man irrespective of his age is working harder than what he was doing a 20 years back.If we cosider a small kid,he too is busy with his academic schedule with  a change in his syllabus,amount of material to be studied.He hardly finds time for his  co-curricular activities.If a teenager is considered,he is busy making a career for himself.A middle aged man is quite occupied in improving his skills or standards of living.Its only a retired person who seemingly has time for activities but lacks enough energy .

The change in technology  over the past few years has brought a change not only in man's life making things easier for him but also in his way of thinking.Today even a small kid thinks about what advantages he can get for sacrificing something.Every individual is more focussed on what he or she can become,how much can he or she earn and how to make more profits.They lead a very mechanical life where they mainly believe in the famous saying " Time is Money".
They would not like to spend their time on something that doesnot benefit them in terms of money or luxury.As considered in management science theory that man's social needs come only after his financial needs.

In such a society people hardly think about their communities and take out some time to help their communities.Therfore the author's opinion about the young people not havin time to help their communities is very much agreeable.
