young peolple enjoy life more than older  people do, it;s a very important issue to discuse as every age get his point of advantage to enjoy and to what extend you belive that you are enjoying your life 
        firstly,young people get the energy and spirit of taking the risk to have fun or any kind of adventure but they donot have enough time to did that because they have to work to earn money to servive and to achive their goals . but the young people are very lucky because they have a lot of means toenjoy their life ,for  example the computer ,clubs,sports  and ..................... 
on the other hand the old people donot have enough power to practise any the need efort or energy.also they have a numerice kind of diseases . one of the most serious problems they have that they cannot deal with the new and modern equipment of entertaiment
second ,money is the most great factor to enjoy your life as a toll to use to fulfill your satisfaction.in spite of ,the old people had enough money from the previous working life,the young people can be more happy and enjoing their life with a veryb little amount of money.
young people means energ ,hope , happeness,succes and life wthout deformation
        to put in a nut shell ,i agree with the statment that young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people are very lucky and get a very good chance to do everything the like to feel happy 
the young people get everthing in the new civilization to serive them and offer a different ways to enjoy ther
