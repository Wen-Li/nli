It has been almost a century since the birth of the cars. And these species have made a tremendous impact into the lives of humans. They have made our lives faster, easier and have helped to spur the industrial growth. However, the technological advancement, the increasing reliance of people on other modes of transport and the more organized lifestyle that this new age is comming up with gives me an impression that over the years the number of automobiles will reduce.

The technology is advancing at a rapid pace. In recent years itself we have witnessed new modes of transport comming up. The howecrafts, the underground rails, the overhead rails, supersonic aircrafts are just a few of them. With such novel and efficient means of transport spriniging up by the minute and with people becoming increasingly reliable on these novel means of transport, we can say for sure that the cars on roads will reduce.

 We often read in the daily newspaper reports that new airlines companies are opening up. The Low-cost Airlines have been a big success in Europe and the same model is being tried out in countries like India. People have changed their preferences of travelling from one city to another or from a country to the neighbouring country due to the new form of airlines. This is because these low-cost airlines offer cheap rates, especially to the everyday business traveller and these travellers have such a plethora of options in choosing the cheapest deals. As a result, people have started abondoning car as their mode of transport for short routes. With the success of such airlines it is definite that in near future we will see many more such business models which will ultimately result in the number of cars being reduced.

The organization of society is fast changing. Two major forms establishments are comming up. One, in which the residential and business localities are under one roof and the other in which they will be independent. If such structures are adopted on a world wide basis, then people will have to resort to different modes of travel. In the first case, they will not need to travel and in the second case they will prefer public transport modes such as underground or overhead rails. This is because it will help them reach their workplace faster. This in turn will cause the reliance of people on automobiles.

Thus we see that with the times changing, people have come to rely on various other means of transport which assist them to reach their coveted destinations faster and in a much easier manner. These factors give us an indication that over the years cars will be replaced by many other means of transport. I only hope that like the dinosaurs, these four-wheeled species do not become extinct.
