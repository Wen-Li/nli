I quite agree with statement, that young people enjoy life more than older people do. 

Being young means lot of energy. Young people have more energy than as compared to any older person. More energy help them to take part in more activies. Though this could be only true if these energies are spend towards positive activies. 

When a person is young, he is always in learing stage. So many times they may come across new places and new things, they will enjoy knowing about it, because it would be their first interaction with it. E.g. simple driving, young people may find it more joyfull than older ones. Because driving would be relatively a new activity for them as compared with older ones, who could be frusted will daliy traffics and other issues related to it.

If you ask this same question to a school children during their exams, it can be expected what theirs answers could be. But during their vaction time, it may be opposite. This lets us know, how immature a humanbeing is when he is in his young ages. Immature humanbeing, mean don't understand reponsibilites towards their life than a older person could understand. In short a young person could have less responsibilites in his life compared wiht a older person, which puts a older person to in more stressed life. 

Said all these, life is great. Its better we understand our different stages of life and enjoy its each stage as it comes. Each stage of a life has its own beauty, to lead a happy life, one should understand this and should enjoy his or her life to most no matter in what age he or she is
