In my opinion, I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than the other. 
The reason why I prefer this one is that if someone is specialized in one specific subject, I think this person is quite boring person. 
Lets say he knows very wel about the animals in the sea and whenever you meet with them. He talks only about things that he is good at and nothingelse. As I am a listener of him, I would have very boring time. 
On the other hand, if you know broad knowledge of many academic subjects, people who talked with thinks that you are very smart. You dont have to talk that much but little bit of information about many things. Thats all you need. Usually listeners dont try to argue with you, unless they are professioners of what you are talking. 
Of course It is also good to specialize in one specific subject. Especially if you are teacher or doctor, anyone who teach or give advices. Then the one specific subject would be very valuable.
Actually both personalities are valuable and  better than knowing nothing because you know something at least. 
I had one friend who was usually quiet. But when I let him talk about cars, he didnt stop talking untill I changed the topic. He was so interested in cars and he likes to spent his time for cars.
