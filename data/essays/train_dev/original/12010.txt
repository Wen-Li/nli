I think the best way to travel is by alone, not in a group led by tour guide. In my country, there are a lot of tour agencies to different countries. However, traveling should definetly alone because there is not much time the guide gives, traveling alone is more flexible to control time and place to go, and tour information they five can be found indivisual.
 In my personal experience, tour guide gives not enough time to see something in one site. For example, I once had a travel to Northeastern United States. I went to New york first. one amazing place was Broadway. Those musical posters, commercials, and stores attracted me. However, the guide gave me only one hour. I wanted to visit the stores and see a musical, but in one hour, all I could do was take photoes and buy a suvenier. If someone is going to travel, He must have flexible time to stay and  do something they want to do. Musical, cup of cofee or shopping is their choice.
 If people travel alone or by their personal group, they are more flexible in time and deciding where to go. When I was in Cuba, I wanted to go to the beach, but the day, it was rainy, so I changed my plan to stay indoor. and at evening I enjoyed dinner on cool temperature beach. If someone travel in group with tour guide, you cannot change plans, You may go to beach on a rainy day.Also, you might go to somewhere you don't want to go and waste hours in a bus.
 People find tour guides because they are not good in that place. However, inventon of internet, and so much books about that place, tells everything about it. people can find maps, place where view is good, where to eat delicious food. Then people can choose place to go by themselves. My parents, once went to Italy, with only a book, and enjoyed everything without problems.
 For these reasons, it is fun and also very practical to travel alone or in a personal groups. Flexible scedules and indivisual preference is the most important thing when people travel indeed.
