I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.  I think success has a great deal to do with factor of adaptation to the new environment, improvement of their own methods and challenging spirits.  People who have these factor tend to new things and take risks.
	First, successful people try new things and take risks to adapt the new environment.  The environment around us has rapidly changed recently.  For example, the invention of Internet makes world borderless and email shortens the time to convey the information.  Under these circumstances, we have to adapt it to success.  In order to adapt it, we should try new things, or new environment, and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.  For example, most related to the IT industries are successful because they can adapt the new environment earlier that ordinary people.  This is because they try to launce new things which no one didn't.
	Second, successful people try new things and take risks to improve of their own methods.  I thinks that doing the same things such as doing what they already know how to do well provides only the same consequense.  There are no improvement and progress.  In such cases, we cannot be success because success has to do with something superior to otheres.  In other words, even if the methods are superior to others at one time, it is the same level or inferior to others for a while.  For instance, Ichiro Suzuki, who is a major league baseball player, continues to seek the new butting method to improve it every year.  Needless to say, he is one of the most successful people.
	Third, successful people tend to have challenging spirits.  I thinks that it is important to do new things.  Doing new things brings us new skills and discoveries.  Those lead to being success.
	In conclusion, I agree with the statement successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for the main three reasons stated above.
