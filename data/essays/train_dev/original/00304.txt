Everybody could tell you this : young people enjoy life whereas older people don't. To me, it can't be absolute, for several reasons.
First, we know that young people know how to have fun. They  always go out with friends, they always laugh ( most of time for nothing)...Older people don't know it. They used to know but now they are adults and adults have a lot of responsibilities, adults always think about their work, adults always worry about everything,,,and when they are older, they worry about death and always talk about when they were young, when they knew how to enjoy life!
We also could say that young people enjoy life because they don't think about the future, they seize the day..That's true but older people, if they like to plan everything can seize the day too. Don't we say that the better time of your life is when you don't work anymore?
What about these grandfathers and these grandmothers who travel a lot and begin to live the life they want?
That's why I think middle aged people are the ones who enjoy life the least. They have too much things not to forget, too much things to do, too much things to care about.. Young peole enjoy life because they have nothing to think about! They go to school, go out with their friends, have complicated relationships with their boyfriends and girlfriends and that's all..OK, they have to do some homeworks, but that's not a horrible life. They enjoy life because their life is perfect!
To finish, I would say that although they have a perfect life most of young people don't really enjoy life. Adolescents are always in a bad mood, they complain everytime, they always disagree with you, but what they do the best is "to not care".  But older people, even if they have a quite more difficult life, know the value of life.
