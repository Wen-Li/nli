Young people tend to do alot of activities and can perform alot of taskes and desires. In contrast to older people who can have difficulties to having their wishes and desires fulfilled. that is why, young people enjoy life more than older people do.


     Physically speacking, older people walked most of the roads in a life time, they are more weary and exhusted from thier trip. Minimal interest in trying new things is obvious on an elderly person. Contradicting young people who have the energy and stamina to preforme taskes, ambition and the lure of the exsotic takes over their minds,trying everything and tasting life in all of its colours, dicovering, learning, felling and performing more missions every day, every moment.

     Emotions do have a big effect on a human being. Old people understand that they aged, they know for a fact that their mission in life in almost over, some are sensitive about death and they dont want to loose their families and friends. But, younger people view life as a long trip, a horrizon of advantages they should grasp to sucseed.They have all their life to look forward to.

    The metal condition is huge wall to older people. They gradually start to lose their ability to think clearly and remember information, which is a big hussel to them, they know that thier organic computer (brain) in starting to disintegrate and deminish but they cant do anything about it .While young people are at their climax of intelligence,new ideas, new information to invent and learn and a future to look forward to. so why should a young person worry about his mental status?

    At the end, young humans are more lively and happy in their lifes, and old people tend to be more sorrow and sad about their current situation.So stay young and happy if you can.
