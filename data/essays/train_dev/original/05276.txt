I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than sticking to what they already know how to do well. there is risk involved in many the things people do. that doesn't stop successful people from doing them. an intelligent person takes calculated risks, which would make him/her successful.
imagine how the world would have been if bill gates hadn't dropped out of school to pursue his passion. we wouldn't have had the luxury of using the windows operating system! he took a risk that could ruin his life but he believed in his dreams.
all the missions to space are risky, there is a huge risk of money and more importantly life. since some brave people have risked their lives for their dreams, ambitions and for mankind to a large extent, we know lots of things about the planets, the satellites and the space. astronauts, inspite of having doubts of their return to earth have travelled into space. if it wasn't for their efforts, we would have remained ignorant of the universe and it's miracles.
business is a field in which a lot of risk is involved. nothing is guaranteed in business. there could be a huge loss incurred from the businesses which are undertaken. but still, risks are taken to achieve greater heights. it's the same with the stock market. the path to success in business is full of traps and they need to be avoided to reach success. that is what many successful people do.
be it any field, many successful persons have taken calculated risks to reach where they are today. the elegant cricket player kevin pitersen, who is originally from south africa has moved to england to keep his passion alive. the reason for this was stated to be discrimination and politics in sports. hadn't kevin pietersen taken the risk of leaving south africa inspite of being warned by the officials that he wouldn't be eligible to play for his country again, the cricket world would have missed a great sportsman. he was also honored by the british government. he is now addressed as kevin pietersen MBE.
the legendary mountaineer sir edumund hillary along with tenzing norgay climbed the mount everest. the risk involved in it is of the size of a mammoth. they risked their lives to climb the tallest peak in the world with sheer hard work and now they have a place in history. the information gathered by them is a giant leap in geological studies.
these few examples clearly indicate that success comes at a price and risks have to be taken calculatedly.
