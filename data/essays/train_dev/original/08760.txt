Today, I am going to talk about my opinion on the topic which is most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are. I agree with the topic. I have a experience that I bought a bag through the Internet. When I saw the bag though the Internet, I was eagering to have that big bag right away. So, I bought that bag with the credit card. When I recieve the bag, I was disappoint to the bag which is not as big as the photo. Then I swore not to buy any bags through the Internet anymore. My parents had bought a masage machine through the television. They said that it seems to be very comfortable and would make them feel relax. So, they determined to buy that. But they felt that machine is not as comfortable as they thought. They said the person who use it to masage seems really satisfied. How come they did not have the same feeling as that person? My older brother had bought through the Internet,too. He bought a T-shirt which size is XL and have a really cool design on it. But when he received that T-shirt, he have difficulty to wear it on. So, I agree with this statement.
