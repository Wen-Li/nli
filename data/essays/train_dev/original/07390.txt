Although the basic concept of advertising is itself to promote a product or a service, I do agree with the statement that Most Advertisements make products seem much better than they actually are.

Advertising for products is essentially the process used to convince potential buyers that the product in question is fit and suitable and the best in the market. However most advertisements blow this definition completely out of propotion by marketing a product which ends up being radically different when finally used. The degree of exaggeration used in advertisements to convince the buyer is at times ridiculous. Advertisements in the fast moving consumer goods domain especially strictly adhere to the policy of displaying a completely wrong image of the products which make them seem much better than they actually are. An example that comes to mind is a commercial for a leading shampoo product which claims to not only put hair back on the heads of of its balding users but also rejuvenate them to the extent that they will be able to compete with the best drivers in the world on a formula one car racing track.

Advertisements in various other sectors also mislead users to believe that the product will offer qualities that it was never designed to provide in the first place. Although one of the selling points of a good advertisement is in some cases to provide a tinge of humor to go with the product, certain advertisements and brands use this to the extent that make their products seem too good to be true. Various mail order catalogs for exercising systems are also another a clear example of how the end product differs vastly from the advertised one  

Especially in today's wolrd where common opinion has it that media over powers print, people look to advertisements especially on television, to help them make informed choices about which product suits their needs better. This dependency may not be large when it comes to everyday products, but in cases of products which are highly expensive and involve large investments, some advertisements can often mislead people's desicions. An example to illustrate this are the advertisements for real estate projects or finance and tax saving instruments and more recently even in job searching portals. Some of the advertisements have caused people to make incorrect decisions due to their assured but unrealistic claims.

All in all, my belief is that advertisements should help people make informed choices and should make people aware of the product. A certain degree of humor and make believe is alright but the core functionality of the product itself should not be made a fantasy as is the case with many of the advertisements in todays world. I therefore ardently agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
