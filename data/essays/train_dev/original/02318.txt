    The technology of having cars and vehicals on the road will be diffecult to find on the roads even if it is for the benifit of the creature ,      In other hand the increasing on the number of  people and even if there is a huge increasing in citizan the decreasing  number of cars for the goverment 
        The problem will be in fining more numbers of cars on the road without finding the roads to walk on it . To increase the pollution by increasing the cars 
   According to alimite number of cars in my opinion the cars will decrease instead of increasing .. it could be exchanged by big buses and transpotations ,it could be exchanged by trains.
     Which form the easier ,cheaper and fastest  transportation to the wokers even to the goverment ....
       For this it will be running in a certain way by buying tickets to use the train which will move from certain place to another place....
        And which will make it less traffic to us and to the roads, it will solve the huge problem of the universal (The Pollution)
  By using certain ways to move it will give us less pollution and it allows us to control the sort of pollution in away ..
      WER have to look for the good and brenifit of our
