I am  agree with this statement and there are several reasons in my opinion;

First, young people thinks differently than older because they don`t have the same way of thinking.
Young people are not self consencious, they often prefer playing instead of work at school... They don`t have the same p
More they often don`t have responsability like work to win money and to live in good conditions, keep their children....That`s why 

Then, young people are not responsable yet, contrary to their parents for exemple. Generally they don`t have children. So they often go in the club, go to the party with friends....

But we can say the contrary because sometimes , older people are enjoying life more than younger.
For exemple, when they finished to work, they often decide to make a trip, travel, do their garden, cooking... They profite to realize some hobbies.  Because they won money during her life
