The statements of quality of products is a complex and controversial issue. While some people argue that advertisments don't give the real quality of product, other people think that they know what they buy. So, advertisements cannot influenced their choice.
Both perspectives are importants, but overall, I desagree with the statement that advertising influences my choice.

My point of view is important because we overall know the differents products we use for ourselves. As an example, when you want to buy a car, you use specifics informations about the type of car you want and don't follow necessarily advertising provide by any car company.

Secondly, advertisements are not firstly directed to influence the choice of custommers. It is highly used by company for settle their leadership (best selling). This can be illustrated by the fact that when someone want a specific car, he has the choice between sometimes more than one company. 

Some people can object that, young boy are mostly influence by advertising. This objection can be countered by the fact that they are not responsible for their purchases. When they want something,  they ask their parents to buy it for them. And overall, the parents don't follow thre desire of their children because they know what is important for them or not.

While the issue of quality of products must be considered carefully, the fact that we know what we want compoumded with the object of the company to settle at a leadership place produce convincing why I desagree whith the following statemement : **Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are**
