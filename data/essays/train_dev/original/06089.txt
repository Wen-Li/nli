The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be splitted into two parts. One the one hand are people, which try new things and take risks to fullfil their target. On the other hand are people, which do what they already know to do well.
Such two different types how to handle with risk will reach the final success.
People have different kinds of meanings about their own apility of risk.
If I think about such difference, I will talk about two friends of mine. The one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examination with a grade of 1.2 during his school periode. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studing time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economic or in gereral with business had taken place for him with 26 years in a big company as an assistante for law specific questions for consoulting contracts. He was very resistent against risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experiences, but also without trying any higher risk, than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time. 


My second example is a boy, who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grad around 2.5, which hab been the middlefield in his final examination year. He started an own business idea after his examination. His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and middle sized companies. In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consoulting work of his company. He had have a lot of fixed costumers, which needed his help regularly. During such periode he had have the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria.
Banks helped him to fullfil such target by offering a lot of money. After two years he had have 4 office outside Germany and a sum of 4.500.000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank.
The concept failed by the crash of the new market and he lost all the life standart almost in 2 month and will not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his life time.

As a conclusion of my two examples, the level of risk can not be argued by the level of school education, meaning the final examination grade, and the university status.
Moreover people with a ability to try risks, will have a faster success and will be stay there, if they control themselves regularly. The risk of falling down, because of uncontrolled mistakes is more realistic in comparision to the risk resident people.
However, every human beeing have to know for themselves which goals and objectives he or she wants to reach and how fast to get there. In adition such factors will bring the level of risk ability and the success.
