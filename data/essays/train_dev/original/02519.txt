Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects prevents one's true learning, and therefore is not a reliable way to study, compared to specializing in one specific subject.
	When I was in middle school in Korea, students had much more subjects to learn than in New York, where I live in now.  We had to master Physics to Endineering, and had major tests each term.  Studying the twelve or more subjects that I was supposed to get as high score as possible, I wondered if that type of study really helped me to learn, and achieve what I needed to survive in society.  Many of the subjects, such as engineerng, cooking, or music in my case, were unatractive to me, and most of all, unnecessary for my future.  Many other students would have similar preoblem.  Also, it is very hard, or impossible, for a person to master such many subjects.  
	One may argue that in order to well adapted in our society, people need multiple numbers of field which one can do well.  For example, in typical companies, employees need to be good at claculating and annalyzing informattion, socializing with other people, which might require various kinds of skills.  However, if one tries to maste too many disciplines, it is more likely not to be helpful for one's career, because still, he/she needs to be professionally good at only one discipline, which the person will be working on through out the career.
	The most ultimate reason for studying many disciplines is that it prevets one from truely learning something, no matter what it is.  When a person have broad knowledge of many subjects, it means that he/she has no professional knowlegde abut anything.  What is the use of knowing so many things, when one knows nothing really useful, valuable, and professional?  Why should one struggle to have so many meaningless knowledge that everyone else can easily learn also?  
	There is no meaning nor fun to have broad and common  knowledge of many subjects.  The fun of learning, and concentrating on one discipline sincerely and truely is at consuming the subject which you love, and which fascinates you.
