I neither disagree or agree the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities for various reasons.

First of all in past times people especially youth has much more spare time compared to present times youth.Morever the obligations of the youth are much more than the former one, as an example in my country due to economical reasons almost 80 percent of collage undergraduates has  to have a lte night job to cover up for his or her collage fee and expenses. Therefore it is impossible to make a fair comparison betwwen generations.  


Secondly, in my country, Turkey, Although the sharing and helpful community of past turkish culture does not seem to exist as it was 15-20 years ago,there has been an significant increase in both quantity of charity unions and their member numbers with comparison. 

Moreover, according to my observations, 3 out of 5 people who joins this kind of organizations are mostly in a age range of 18-30. they help people with disabilities to adapt the society, arrange a support group for misbehaved children and women, give lectures for poor families children. Today the community services and charity work are done much more organized compared to way back then.

In conclusion, The conditions of today and past generations are very different than each other. Altough it may be seen that youth spend less time for helping their communities stillplays significant role 
to help it,
