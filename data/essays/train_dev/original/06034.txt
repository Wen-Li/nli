I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 

Due to advancements in technological and financial markets, access to money is easy.  Because of the excess liquidity in the current economies around the world many companies are expanding their businesses. There are a number of companies that are producing same kind of products. They themselves know that it is extremely difficult to produce something different every now and then.  But they all have realised one way of selling same products in different packaging to customers.
Advertisements!! Now technically they know that they can't differentiate their own product from other products available in the market. Let's take an example of a car advertisement. It's an entry level car Hyundai Santro. They have  Mr. Shahrukh Khan (Popular Filmstar) as their brand ambassador for India. In their advertisement it's shown that Mr. Shahrukh goes for a long drive with his girlfriend ( who is again a big filmstar). Now everyone in the world knows that Mr. Shahrukh sends a BMW to pick up his kids from school and drove santro in the advertisement for first and the last time in his life. But people are fascinated by this and buy cars just believing that if he uses it it has to be a good car. Having one myself, i know it is a good car but not because of the advertisement. They show that if you use this car then you may get good looking girl freinds but actually it has nothing to do with the car. 
I think it is appropriate to discuss example of an advertisement of Bournvita. It is a drink for growing children. They claim in advertisements that if children drink this they will grow faster and healthier. Now if that was the case then producer should be the richest person on planet earth. I agree with their claims regarding content of the drink mix, Calorie content and presence of proteins etc but I  can't believe this increase in height part. 
Let's take another example for a telecom service provider. In it's advertisement they claim that they provide hassle free and customer oriented service in their outlets. I fell into the trap and took the connection. For the first time when I went to the outlet for a complaint I was left there to wait for half an hour. Eventually after having a verbal argument I took a pledge not to believe advertisements.

I belive that to survive in this cut throat world companies will always invent ways to sell their products. Advertisements is one of them. Whatever you see on TV, you should not believe it as nothing in this world is as simple as it appears.
