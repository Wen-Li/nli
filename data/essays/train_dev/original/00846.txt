   Traveling is very interesting for me, but there is a controversy how to travel; going alone or in a group. I disagree with this theme and I raise four reasons for this.
   First of all, I'd like to go wherever I can go. It is very useful to go with a tour guide, specially to the place that I've never been to, because I have little knowledge of dangerous place to visit. But in guide tour, there are something that I don't want to go to. Also, planning for the place that I want to go is also precious time. ITime to traval is limited, and from planning to travel, it is a starting point!   
   Secondly, traveling  is expanding our eyes. I traveled Brazil a lot and I was capable of knowing foreign people. To know what they do, think and like was an very interesting chance. I like foreigners, including Brazilians, and also want to communicate with foreign people. Traveing is knowing and expanding friends, but this will happen only when going abroad alone, and I would have never had such an experience with travailing by myself.
   At last, travailing is a chance of thinking what I am and what I am going to be. In a place where we live, I can't be stimulated and there aren't good for my health, but  in a new place, I can be fresh in my mind, and I want to know about this.
   I know that travaling with a group, for example with friends, family, but it is not interesting largely because I can't see, think alone. It is a chance to go, think, enjoy by myself, not for others. 
   I want to go every year alone travailing wherever I want, and expand my ability.
