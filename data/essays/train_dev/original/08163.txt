"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well."

      I agree with the above statement that successful people should try and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.A person must first secure his position both financially and mentally by doing what he is skilled in.Then there is no point in doing the same thing again and again and produce the same results.For a person to grow in life,he must try innovative means to do the same work or try new things and take risks.

      As we know,doing the same work repeatedly will add nothing but boredom to one's life.To add spice to life,one must try something new.But this should be done carefully and responsibly so that it does not affect one's existing reputation and profession.Let us consider one of the giants in global economy,Mr.Dhirubhai Ambani who was the founder and Director of Reliance Industrial group in India.He initially entered the market in the final quarter of the 20th century by starting a textile firm which he struggled very hard to develop into a very big company.He was very successful and was financially very secure at that time.Yet,he was a true entrepreneur and tried out innovative things and took many risks by entering petroleum industry.Now Reliance petroleum is a very big name in Indian economy. 

        In addition to the above mentioned industries,he also started Reliance telecommunications which is the first CDMA mobile service in India.He reaped huge profits through this.Infact,Reliance group has entered Energy and Retail sectors also.Today, Reliance Group stands among the top 50 companies globally.All this would not have been possible if he had not taken the risks and entered into these businesses instead of holding on to the textile business.

         So I think it is always better to secure your position first both financially and mentally and then try out innovative things and take risks to develop your business.A successful man doesn't rest at any point of time but strives hard to be more successful.Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well.
