I agree, it is the best way to travell in a groups led by a tour guide because in groups the tour may be fulfilled with full of fun and joy.
One can always feel boring to travell as accompained. the tour in groups all together can fell like one family as brothers,sisters,uncles grandfathers  and grandmothers. So there we feel very happy by spending with all the group people and there is no worries as there is a guide who helps and shows all the locations all the way.
In groups there is no need of a security problem no feeling of lonelyness.In groups we may have many concessions in the fairs and some packages which were offered at low rates this was an advantage for travelling in groups.
  	The best example when i'm in high school we had a tour to NewDelhi in meanwhile we enjoyed all the way in the train by singing songs,dancing and commenting one another. After reaching there we in group visited all the tourist spots and spent very jolly.
            It was the time when I visited the same locations alone and i felt very bad , even not intrested to see all the places.
 	Another reason is the people with whom do we like to have the tour may is always busy or unable to have time to come with us. So we never feel missing them when we move in groups. We dont know the time spent with them it is like a magic me may forget all the things and move to the new  world of dreams.
Everyone likes to visit all the places, bu mostly they think about the travelling time and the expences.If we travell in single the expences will be more we should spent moreon the comodities for our needs. In the groups travellin expences for person to person may vary as the number of persons is incresaing cost for head to head may vary. So within the low budget ,with security ,with company we may have our tour sucessfully with lot of joy and happiness.
