In this essay I'll discuss if I agree or disagree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.
First of all , I want to say that  I don't agree completely with this statement because is too semplicistic say that young people now do not give enough time to helping their communities.
In fact , for sure, there are a lot of young people nowadays who think only about theirselves  and don't spend time for helping their communities but , on the contrary, there are a lot of young people involved in social activities.
In fact, I knew a lot of young people everyday involved in some different activities to helping their communities above all young people part of specific groups. For example, they help children with  family problems to do their homework after the school, they play guitar during church celebration on sunday and when I was younger and I attented the secondary school, in particular, I also did a lot of these kind of activities but unfortunately now I don't have enough time to do these and so I try to do something else.
As a lot of young people in fact, I'm part of the red cross and for this reason twice a year I go the hospital and I give for free my blood to help a lot of people who everyday need blood due to some different problems.  
In conclusion, I can say that I agree with the fact that there are a lot of people nowaday that do not give enought time to helping their communities but I want underline instead, that there are a lot of young people very sensible,acting in social activies and for these reasons that spend a lot of thei time for helping the others.
