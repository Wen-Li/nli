We all pass by difficult moments in our lives that will help us gain experience. I agree with the qoute that say's "Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well", for many different reasons.                                        A person who try's new things in his life, will gain experience and knowledge. Taking risks and learning new things will develop a person emotionally and physically. It is a good thing for a person to be adventurous, and go through different kind's of situation's, because it helps him learn new things and lessons in life. By learning these new lesson's, and by being more experienced, a person will suddenly see himself optimistic,and happy. His reason for living will increase, because he will love life more, and would like to do new stuff that will entertain, and teach him. I think that a risk taker is a very confident person, that know's what he want's in life, and he is lucky to have this characteristic.It is a positive action that each person must choose to sucsseed in live, unlike the peolpe that only do what they know. These people that are not risk taker's will eventually find themselves not capable of doing anything in life. They will regret not being risky, and not doing and trying everything new in life, and will hope and wish for time to go back, and do whatever they did not do. The difference between these two kinds of people is that one is ready and willing to learn new things and lesson's in live, while the other is being self-relient, scared, and lazy, and he will not sucsseed in live as much as  the confident, risk taker.                                                 In conclusion, taking risk will never affect a person in a negative way. It will help a person to have a great self-esteam,will make his confidence grow, and will make him successful in any situation he is going to face in life.
