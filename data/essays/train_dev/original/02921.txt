In my opinion in some cases it's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, instead, in another cases, it's better to specialize in only one or two specific subjects.
I think that at the primary, secondary and high school it's better to have a generical knowledge, like what is actually in use in the majour states of the world (I belive and I hope it is truth), than to specialize in only one specific subject. Here we have a thirteen generical years  knowledge and I think it is not bad!
I think that when we arrive at university it is right to specialize in only one or two specific subjects because actually we live in a world where everyone think to be able to do everythihg but this is not the truth!
I think it's important to be a very good professionist in one thing to be different from the mass.
In Italy ours university are not good able to prepare students for the work world and when we finish school, after EIGTHTEEN years, we are not able to work and we have to wait another two or three year to be consider by big agensy, compa
