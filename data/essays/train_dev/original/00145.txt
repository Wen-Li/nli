I would disagree with the given statement i.e. "The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide".

I strongly feel that the best way to travel would be alone or with a bunch of people sharing similar interests . The reason for this would be for the simple fact that the tour guide would take you to a set of places  which is the city is famous for and these places might not necessarily interest me in particular .

I would like to cite a simple example . Last year for  the new years i had to gone to Goa ( which happens to be a major tourist destination in India) . Goa is known for a lot of things . Great beaches , Brilliant Churches (Goa was under the Portugese control for over 200 years , so lots of european influence in the architechture) and a pretty rocking night life . 

I and my friends decided against having a tour guide as "Goan Music" , in other words "Psy Trance", interests us more than the churches or the beautiful beaches out there . The tour guide would have charged us a bomb for showing the churches , talking a bit about the local culture and walking us down the beaches ! We went to goa for the simple fact that it happens to be the hub for some great electronic music and since every one in my group was inclined to the same objective , all of us started exploring the city all by ourselves !

We bought some local maps , hired a couple of bikes , bugged people for directions and it all added to the experience ! I wouldnt have enjoyed it to this extent had i gone for a tour operator .

Guides are only out there to make money and in todays world , guides arent a neccessity while going on a trip because you have enough information available in the form of books , internet etc .

So i would strongly recommend to go alone and do away with a tour guide just beacuase it would add to the whole expereince of travel .
