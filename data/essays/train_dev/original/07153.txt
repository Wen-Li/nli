Someone might say that young people enjoy life more than older people do.
I personally agree with this statement.
I know that there are many examples that seem to prove the contrary but I think that they are absolutely not the norm.
A young person is far more athletic and healthy than an older one.
And, thing not to undervaluate, it has less responsibilities.
When you get rid of all the things you have to worry about,  life becomes instantaneously more enjoyable.
So less responsibilities, less things to worry.
Another reason is obviously the atletic stae of the body. At a certain age there are just a lot of movements you have difficulties to do, so even a simple action like, for example, riding a bike or running becomes hard to do.
And when you cannot do such basic movements you cannot accomplish more complicated tasks.
Health is another important factor. Who enjoys going to the pharmacy or, worse, to the hospital? Older people have to take care of their body continously, maybe taking pills or other medical treatments of some sort. And when you are not at that point, you know that sooner or later you will.
But the body is nothing without the mind. It's scientifically proved that at a certain age the mental abilities of an individuos start to decrease dramatically. This has consequences on the whole body activity but let's just concentrate on the mind aspect. Even those activities which don't involve physical activity are precluded.
A chess match, crosswords, and any other kind of that stuff.
This problems listed here are all problems that a normal person wouldn't have if he or she is young.
So the conclusions are that when you are in the middle of you youth (and don't have any serious problem of other sorts), you have all the doors open and that these doors keep closing while the years pass by.
