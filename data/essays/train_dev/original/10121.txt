In my opinion in order to have a better understanding of ideas, concepts must be supported by facts. 

First of all it is impossible to understand an idea without a complete evaluation of the facts that are the base structure of the concept. 
If you understand an idea without knowing the facts behind it, then you are only learning a "dogma".
An example of dogmatic understanding is the religious one that ignores fact, because is not looking for a deep understanding of things but only to a solution that will bring to its answer.
 This is why in religious learning, facts are generally avoided: they do prefer interpretations.

Second of all, to understand something you need to start learning the facts in order to start a critical analisys. The only way to start this process of understanding is starting from the knowledge of facts. 
In order to understand an idea you must know what was the historycal situation in which this idea was created. I'll make an example in order to make my opinion clearer : you can't understand the basic ideas of comunism or nazism without knowing the historycal situation and dynamics that brought to these different political, social and economical totalitarisms. 

At last, I would say that you don't really understand anything if you can't prove it and explain it with facts. Is with an empiric analisys of facts that you can prove what you have understood and why you believe so. Every scientist needs an experiment to clear his point, otherwise he will seem not credible and his idea not effective.

These are the three reasons why I believe that there is a strong link and connection between understanding an idea and learning the facts related to the concept .
