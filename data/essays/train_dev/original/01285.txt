The reasons of success are multiple. On one hand, many people think that to be successful we need to find new solutions, anticipate new trends and by the way take risks. On the other hand, people tend to think that experience prevails and that the best way to succeed is to focus on and master what you are already able to do. In my opinion, success is directly linked to the risks you are able to take.  

In the business world, one of the most usual word to explain the success of a company is "innovation". Nowadays, clients or shareholders are attrated by companies which take risks by offering really new products. The world is moving and changing, the company which will survive is the company which is able to aniticipate new social or economic trends. For example, easyJet is very successful because this firm understood and analysed the trends of "low-cost" before anyone else. It was risky compared to the traditional and expensive offer. But finally, easyJet or RyanAir are the most popular.

Indeed, it is quite important to focus on one speciality to be the best in what we do. Nonetheless, people who give the priority to experience are more static in their way of thinking, and have a weak ability of adaptation toward a changing environment. People who take risks, for example in an artistical activity, will be awarded because they go against a kind of conformism. This is exactly what we are looking for, in globalised economy. To be successful, we need to be "different", and take risks for that.

To conclude, exploring new fields brings new ideas of business. Risks are the basis of success. Simply, we can say that "who dares, wins", and even if your objective is not to succeed, risks are important in life because they spice up our daily life.
