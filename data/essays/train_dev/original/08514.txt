We all know that cars can represent ones status, and that is nothing about how the price it is or how convenient  the public transportations are. Thus, I disagree with this topic by following three reasons.

I do not agree with this topic because, first, cars will less polluted to the enviroments in twenty years. Teconology is going more and more advanced now. In the future, we will not use gas or petroleum to drive the car. We will use electicity to replace the gas or petroleum. Thus, the air will goes fresh, and the greenhouse effect will decline as well. This will make enviromental group to support people to drive. 

I do not agree with this topic because, second, when you drive a car, you can feel calm, save, and warm. You can drive to anywhere with your family, just wherever they want to arrive. You can have your own space that public transportations could not give you. You can also not be bothered from other people when on the way to your destination. This reason is really important to the person who has family or children.

I do not agree with this topic because, third, you can show the status you are. For instance, you can drive Benz to buy the fruits or vegetables, and that will make everyone know that you are rich. Also, when you meet your old friends, which means you are invited from old friends, you can let them know that you are not the one before! I know this sounds like arrogant, but it is practical right?

To sum up, many people might advocate another opinion. However, according to the three main reasons I said, I totally disagree with the topic that in twenty years the cars will less.
