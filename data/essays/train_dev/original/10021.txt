I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Having more knowledge could broaden ones horizon; serve as a parth to discover ones true passion; gain help with talking to other people and be capable of understanding the world around us. 
    Firstly, having more knowing of many academic subject areas could broden our horizons because we know different subjects in different fields. Each specific subject has its own uniquness, therefore it would be better to know a bit about each areas. 
    Secondly, understanding more knowledge could serve as a path for people to discover their 'real' passion. Sometimes if  we are always 'inside the box',  it would be hard for us to find other hobbies and have the oppurtunity to think whether it was truly their passion or not. When I was in Grade 11, I studied courses in different areas, such as Chemistry, Accounting, Physical Education, Business, History etc. I wans't sure of what I wanted to study in university, and I don't want to limit my area of study, therefore I decided to broaden my knowledg by taking many acdemic subjects. However my friend, whom desperately wanted to become a doctor, took all science courses, because she had discovered her passion. As a result,  I think it would be better to have a broad knowledge of many subjects before specializing one, unless you have found something that you really love doing.
    Moreover, by understanding more subjects, it would be easier for people to engage in conversations with new people. Everyone have different backgrounds, therefore if you have knowledge from different areas, it could be easier to socialize with people whom have different fields than you do. A way of knowing more subjects is to read every section of the newspaper such as Businss, World, Entertainment etc. This could help one to know more knowledge and therefore be more talkative when meeting new people. 
    Since the world changes everyday, everyday something new will happen. If we don't have the basic background towards a certain subject, we will not be able to understand it. Moreover, a lot of subjects are inter-related, therefore you will need knowledge from other areas in order to fully understand the material. For example, business ties with politics, political changes could affect the business environment, therefore it is essential for us to have a simple background of politics in order to understand business changes around the world. 
    In conclusion, with all the reasons stated above, I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadmic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects.
