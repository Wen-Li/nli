Advertisements  are really needed for products,but extravagant publicity is to be militated. I agree with the following statement that Most advertisements make products seem much better than they are.
firstly, advertiments should provide infomation that a product has.i mean the quality of the product(whether it has reliability and garuntee). The advertisors using some showy labels, packings etc.,
should stop. because they charge even for the packings which are expensive, ordinary people cant buy those things even they are daily
house hold products which are necessary. 
secondly they use some celebrites for canvassing the product, they offer even some royalty from commodity sales percentage. 
thirdly , the advertisor attract the consumers, using graphic design and animation by showing them more fascinating than they really are.These kind of things really going to work on  children for  and makes there parents to buy for them.And dazziling stickers also makes them more attracting. all these will definetly increase the cost of commodity
so i finally conclude these kind of avertisements , imean,  iagree  with the  quote that " most adertisments make products seem much better than they really are."
