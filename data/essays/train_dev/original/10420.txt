Traveling in a group and being led by a tour guide has both advantages and disadvantages and the consideration about whether it is a best way of traveling or not depends on many factors. 

Suppose you are a busy working man and you want to spend your vacation or annual leave. You have a week or two and you plan to go somewhere. First of all, most people wants comfort in such cases and they would want go to the major sightseeings. In such cases, organized tour led by a guide is the best option: the tourist company will arrange everything for you - all you have to do is enjoy. The guide will tell you what most travelers would like to know and you don't have refer to a book to find out about the sightseeing you're at. You are free of all the uncertainties and risks involved in traveling alone and being responsible for yourself. 

But traveling in a group led by a tour guide has several restrictions and they are even frustrating if you are seeking adventures or totally personal experiences. I felt it personally when I went to a turkic tombstone in rural Mongolia with a group of tourists. The tombstone was awsome at least for me for I was interested in Turkic history. It had inscription on it and I was badly wanting to try to read it on my own (I once spent some time trying to learn the old letters). But the group had only 2 hours to spend there and I had to leave the tombstone with them too because other members of the group did not share the same interest and the schedule said that we should be at the tourist camp by 4 o'clock. I felt so frustrated that I decided then that I will go there alone sometime afterwards. So this example of mine illustrates the bad point of guided travel - you're not free to decide where to go or where to stay for how long. You can't actually, if I can put it this way, "taste" the activity and the place because the experience is not all yours: it rather turns out to be a group experience and it does not give you that feeling when you find do something, think about something out, experience something on your own without being distracted.

Personally, therefore, I prefer to travel alone if I have enough time but at the same time, I agree that organized travel can be useful and enjoyable experience if you does not have enough time or if you are not really into the destination of your travel.
