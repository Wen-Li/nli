To be afraid to do something new is inerent to all hummans. Failing is a very unpleasent thing and the best way to avoid failing is not to do anything. But if history has teach us something is that the only way to improve and be successful is to try new things and take risks, no matter how hard or painful this might be.

The western world as we know it, came hand by hand  with the industralization. This period of the history is known to be time where steam and dreams made able massive productions, better goods and incrisse in quality of life. Without people taking risk and failling hundreds of times before finding solutions, none of these could happened.

Another good example of the results of risk taking actions is the development of the airplanes. Probably all of us have seen some old movies of the first plane prototypes. Crazy machines that look more like games than real planes. But after years of trail and error someone got it right. And thanks to that, it is possible to travel in hours to places that otherwise would be impossible to reach.

I have apersonal personal exaple, as a Brand Manager of a wine company. No one believed that we could develop a wine to be as fun as beer. "It is simply not wine essence to be fun" an important manager ones said. But me and my team strongly believed that it was possible to do it. So after a lot of mistakes we finally developed "FRESSCO" a new brand that combines wine with fresh fruit in a completelly innovative packaging. The results, FRESSCO is now one of top 3 wines sold in Chile and it has become a real competitor to beers.

So, concluding, even if been afraid to do something new is always a challenge for any person, is fundamental to know that innovation is the only way to progress. It is true, mistakes can really be painful, but the reguard of doing something new compensates all .
