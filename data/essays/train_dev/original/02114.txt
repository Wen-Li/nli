Different ways of learning can be taught by a professor or lecturer in order to make it easier for their students to memorize certain study matters. Some believe, that trying to help their students to understand ideas and concepts is more important than just learning facts.
	To begin with, encouraging students to develop their own ideas and concepts about a certain topic and in the end to draw a conclusion, is very likely to have a positive aspect on the student's memory. For example,  if a student in a history class has the task to think about the way the Geman people must have felt at the end of the Second World War, and s/he works out their feelings of desperation and hopelessness, s/he has learned through experience.
	Moreover, through having understood certain ideas and concepts, a student can basically transfer them to nowadays situations and as well to another subject or theme. For instance, having learned the concept of social behaviour on a specific example and having understood the idea of it, the student will be easily able to observe the social behaviour, its causes and consequences, in his/her own environment and to compare them to other unsocial behaviour and the way it differs in every country and continent.
	Learning facts surely has its disadvantages in specific exam situations. For example, if a student is beeing asked about when certain historical events took place. Especially in the subject of history, learning dates by heart is rather important, mostly in order to avoid getting mixed up with  situations that happened before another event and to recieve a basic overview of certain periods of time.
	All things considered, there are more benefits for students, not only in school but for the entire life, to beeing able to use learned ideas and concepts in a variety of fields than to learn facts that can be easily forgotten just after the exam has finished.
