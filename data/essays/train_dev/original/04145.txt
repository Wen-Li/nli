The one of  my favorite hobby is traveling.I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. I think,when I travel without any tour guide, I can go any place which I would like to go, and I can find my favorite places or things,and I can get more strong friendships.
	Fistly, without any tour guide, our travel will be more flexible for planning where to go or when to go.In my case, when I traveled with a tour guide, there was the place where I wanted to stay for more longer time,but he said "we must go to next." I felt unsatisfied.
	Secondly,it is possible for me to find a place or a thing which is not so famous.That is to say, I will get my own special place or thing.I do not like crowded place,so if I can find unfamous,but very good place or thing for me,I think I am happy.
	Finally, if there is no guide for our group, we will get togehter to make our travel more precious. I have a friend good at making a schedule,so with her I feel more happy,and our travel will become more valuable,moreover,our friendship will become more strong.
	For these reasons,I think the statement that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide is not so good. Traveling is very exciting,so I wish I could go everywhere.
