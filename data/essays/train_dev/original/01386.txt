I'm agree with the following statement : " Young people enjoy life more than older people do" .
I think that young people lives your life more attentment to old people.
they go to a party, disco, pub but also cinema, university, teatre, ecc. the young people loves travel and they visit all towns of Europa or Asia. 
The older people must think at their family and at their children or also their parents. they watch television or walk in the park .
they play at "tre sette" (tipycal italian's play)
Young people havent not too problems and too responsabilities that older people have.
young people are the future, they  must learn to older people's error.
I study and i have not more time for my obby. i don't like to disco but if i have freetime i prefer go in a pub  to drink few beers with my friends
