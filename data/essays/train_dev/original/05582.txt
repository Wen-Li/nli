I agree with this opinion. Ofcouse there is also chance to enjoy older age however it ups to younger age which people had spended. So I wanna point out three pointsto explain why young people enjoy life more than older people do. 
First of all, young people have power to gain what they want or to achieve some kind of goal. In the phisical, they are so young that they can work all of the day without sleeping, sometimes. Besides it, they are not too tired after working. It is one of the important things to achieve the goal. In the mentality, they don't feel responsibilities for society or family so they can cahllenge something important or need to hard work without thinking deeply. If people become having family or need to care their palents, there is some negative factor to challenge something.
Second, there are opporturnities to make them change or study or grow up. There are chances to take education and study abroad or something. Older people, mostly it's palents, give younger people to have time to concentrate on themselves, in ohter words, to think about themseoves. It is most important thihg to grow up and have identification on theirselves. 
Thirdly, younger people can have time to have comunication with many people who have different backgrounds. Older people mostly have jobs and it is limited to opportunity to comunicate with people in the office and people. On the other hand, younger people have the cahnces to have conversations and have time together with many kind of people. They have time to go all around the world, a 

mntality,there is nothing for them to lose. There is only to gain.so
