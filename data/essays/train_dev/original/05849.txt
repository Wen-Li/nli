I believe that a strong conclusion telling that having a broad knowledge of academic subjects are better than specializing in one specific subject would be faulty. There are both advantages and disadvantages of the two.

First, being an expert on a specialized field is unquestionably necessary. The development of science is based on using the knowledge gained by our ancestors. So. in order to make use of previously conducted researches on specific topics and to take them to further points, we need specialists. A man having a broad knowledge in many fields would not work in this kind of a situation.

Second, in our daily life, we can clearly observe the necessity for specialists. For example, think of a situation that you are sick and went to the doctor. The first doctor you went to would probably be a representative of a person that has a broader knowledge on human body. You would expect that doctor to direct you to a specialist for the specific health problem you have. Then you would need a doctor specialized on your problem. This situation also illustrates the necessity for both.

Finally, people that are specialized on a topic may sometimes become blinded by the long times of same kind of work they are dealing with. In such cases, a broader knowledge person could see the big picture and would be more beneficial to solve the problems. To illustrate, industrial engineering, which is my major field, requires seeing the big picture in a company as we try to solve the problems in it. When we deal with the problems stated by a department in the company, we observe that the department does not consider the possible causes of the problem which can actually be caused by any other department. So, this experience of me from summer internship indicates the possible disadvantages of working on the same topic all the time.

In conclusion, we need both specialists and people having broad knowledges since they are both needed for solving the problems of human beings in the real life. So, a clear conclusion that one of the positions is better than the other would be very misleading.
