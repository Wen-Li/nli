Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I disagree with this statement. When the first Nokia portable phone that was compatabile with a camera came out, advertisements all around showed that you could videotape scenes and take snapshots of friends. When people actually bought the product, what they actually saw was a reallity. Another example is when the iPod was released. Everyone was shocked about how a device smaller than a calculator could store more than a thousand songs. When people went and bought it, they saw how it could do it. It is not that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are, it is about the person that buys the product. Many people when they see advertisments of new electronic devices, they get so happy to see something that new and something that functions in a new way so when they buy the product and use it everyday, they get bored of it. So when the person remembers how the product looked on billboards and newspapers and compares it with him after owning it for two months, he will think that the advertisement made the product seem much better than it really is. The reallity is that the person has been using the product effectivley that lead to him getting bored of it. My opinion is that most advertisments show what the real product is and that they don't exaggerate on the product. Another problem is that many people understand the advertisment wrong. When the person goes to buy the product and the finds out that it doesn't function the way he thought it is, the individual then gets unsatisfied. I think that people should understand the advertisment and what they are trying to say and understanding the message that they are trying to send.
