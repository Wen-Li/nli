I am happy. I am young, and I am happy. I never been old in my life so I can not know if I agree or disagree whit the statement, basing myself on my own life experience. But I do can answer basing on what I live since this time and on what I seen around me during this time. And I will say that I agree. 

      Their is a lot of avantages in getting older. Older people have more freedom (they can do whatever they wanted to and do not have to ask anyone), they earn their life in their own so they are able to plan it better than a young people because they do not have to rely onto their parents... But I am still thinking that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Their is just much more things to do, things to enjoy, for young people. They do not have as much responsabilities than older people, so they do not have as much things to worry about. For example, I said that older people have more freedom, earning their own life. It is thrue. But what I did not say then, it is that their is more fun, to me, in enjoying life basicly, without any trouble in mind, or much less importants ones. 
         Furthemore, young people have often much more possibilities to meet new people and make new friends than older ones. Older people have to have a job to earn their life. And most of time, after the fisrt weeks im their compagny, they will see the same people, collegues, maybe for the rest of their life. A young people, doing his studies, meets a lot of new people each year when he comes to a new class. He could even meets more new people if he changes of university.

     So young people meet more people, make more friends, have more fun, and have less problems to worry about... Well, I am also exciting to getting older and have more freedom and responsability every day, but I think that I may regrets these years one day,
