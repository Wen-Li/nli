Do successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well? I don't agree with that. I think experience, time, and the higher possibility of success are the main points to support my opinions. 
	Firstly, experience helps people to be successful in doing one job. If a person has a lot of experience on doing one job, he can usually make the best decision when a problem comes out. Compare to a person who makes a decision when he does a new job, he is unexperienced and has no idea which way has more benefits for him. So he can easily make a wrong or worse decision. So successful people would do what they already know how to do well because they have experience. 
	Secondly, we need enough time to make our jobs successful. Working a job to be successful is a long process. A person who does a job which he already knows how to do well, saves a lot of time on understanding basic knowledge of the job. Then he can  spend more time to make the job perfect and and make himself to be successful. 
	Finally, a person does a job which he already knows how to to do well, he has a higher possibility of success than those who try new things and take risks. As we know, if we try a new job, we have no experience about that and have to spend plenty of time to understand the job. It is risky to do that because we might find out we are not able to make it successful after spending a long period time. On the contrary, if we already know a job well, of course we know what to do to make it successful directly efficiently. 
	I disagree that successful people try new things and take ricks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well, because they don't have experience, enough time and a higher possibility of success in doing the new job.
