there is no consensus among people as to the arguement that it is good for a group  to travel led by a guide. with an increasing number of people claim that it has lots of disadvantages , some people mor e sensible tend to consider the nature that traveling with a guide is amazing . and the latter point coincides with mine for my reason below:

firstly , we never remain suspicious of the point that traving with a tour guide has an extremely affect on the mood of the memebers of the group. for instance , statistics indicate that 70 percentage of people who has the experence of traveling with a guide will have a good mood. another example , i often travel with my parents and we always travel with a guide .because of the professional knowleges the guide obtained , he can arrange our activity schedule , and we should not worry any thing , what we should do is just watching and engoy the chaming view passing by. so easy is the travel , we never feel tirde because  we can focus our mood on the beatuty of view. so the trip become happy and easy without a thinking that where we should to go to, and where is the most famous place because we can obtain totally from the mouth of the guide . it is so cool. and the group member will have more time chating with each other .

furthermore, it is no exaggerating to say that traveling with a guide has huge influence not just on the mood we have , but on our money as well. for example , without a guide we are likely to buy some thing unuseful but attracting at that moment . however if a tour guide accompanies with your group , it will not be a matter. once our family went to qingdao which is a charming seashore town with chaming views that the seabirs are sing with sunshine. so we are attracted by it . when a men sell some sea food , we accept because at that moment we forget anything but the amazing view. at that time the guide stop us because he think the price of the seafood is too high . with his advice , we are awake. thus  , thanks to his help . we save lots of many to buy something useful.therefore, traveling with guide has lots of benefits that can infulence us fanancially .

as we have discussed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that traveling with a guide not only can help us obtain a good mood but can save our money as well.therefore, it is highly time that we should raise the public awareness of the significance of the guide , . just in this way can we get a wonderful journey with other group members.
