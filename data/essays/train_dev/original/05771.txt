The following essay describes why I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisments play a tremendous role in our lives. Let me first state my personal feelings about the situation in our society today. I am often irritated and confused when I see all the different advertisements. When I turn on the TV, read the daily newspaper or even when I go outside for a run in the park I am influenced by advertisements. Everywhere in the media and in the public are advertisments and people are oversupplied and do not recognize them anymore. Therefore in order to gain the attention of the consumers the companies have to exaggerate in the advertisements. They praise their products extremely in order to be recognized by the people. The competition is very hard due to the huge variety of products. The increasing significance of communication channels like the internet make the competition even harder because people are now penetrated even more with advertisements and commercials. Only if the advertisement is extraordinary and special people will eventually buy the product. However, in reality the product ist not as good as the advertisment has promised. I have also been dissapointed by a product that I bought for several times. One example is the new iPhone which promises to be much better than it really is. However that is a very subjective impression because other people like the product and are satisfied. As a conclusion one can say that the attitude of a product is a very personal feeling and differs a lot.
