I don' t think young people enjoy life more than old people. I tnink that they prefer to live their life in different ways.
Infact youn people love leisure time, love play togheter, they have to know the word and make new experience. For example the summer holidays are the weeks of the year more attended in which they don' t have to think to school and where the only think that they can do is to play every day or to go to the sea.
In my case, I am 22 years old, I enjoy life not only because i can stay with my friend an go to dance or to the pubs, I also love life because I have a lot of opportunities, I need to know more thinks that i can, i need to realise myselves. I want a good work and a good career, I want to marry and a family.
Old people enjoy life not less than young people, but i think that they have already left this important moment of their life and they prefer to stay togheter in quite and not busy place. 
An example is my grandmother. She is 78 years old. She likes to stay home to watch tv or to read lots of books. She likes to cook and to fill her leisure time with her friend to speak. On holiday she like to stay every day on the sun, she prefer to go out for a walking to look the landscapes or to eat the ice cream.
I think that youngh people and old people enjoy life, but they have different interests and different way experience of the life.
If young people need to realise themselves, old people need to live the rest of their life to know more that they know. I can define them the experts of life.
