Everybody is confronted with advertisements in his daily life. About 5000 different kinds of advertisements are influencing us day by day. But are the advertisements reflecting the reality, or are they just making the products seembetter than they are? I think that advert definitly shows the products in a better light , because it doesn't mentions the danger of product. Furhtermore, the real price is often not viewed.

Firstly, advertisment should change our consumer habits. Thus, the producted are displayed better than they really are. For instances, Mc Donald's tries to attract people by showing the consumers photos of their burgers. The burgers in the photo are made of plastic because they look fresher than the real burgers. 
What's more the advertisements don't show the dangers of these products. Let's take Mc Donald's again as an example. It is commonly known that the products of the fast food restaurant lead to overweight. Nevertheless the advertisement don't mention any of these disadvantages, because Mc Donald's wants , of course, the people to buy their product. Another example are toys for little children. As they are often produced in China, they contain material of low quality. In some cases, the toys are even toxic for the children. 
These are dangers, which are definitely not mentioned in the advertisement, an unacceptable way to distract from dangers in my opinion.
Thirdly, the real price is always hided in the advertisement. For instance, the big air lines try to attract people with cheap offers, e.g. one flight form Munich to Berlin for only 30 Euro. In fact, this offers doesn't represent the real price, because it doesn't contain the additonal fees of airports or the extra costs of the fuel. Actually, the flight costs about 55, Euro almost the double price of the advertisement. 

All in all, advertisements screw up the reality. Mc Donald's tries to offer its burgers with fotos which don't view the real burger. Additionally, the hazards of the products aren't mentioned. Hence, Mc Donald's and Co. distract from the problem of overweight by showing salads which seem to be good for the health. It is a fact that these salads even have more energy than normal burgers. Moreover, toy selling companies want to make their toxic products attractive to the consumer. Finally, false prices annoy the consumer. 
As far as I'm concerned, I think the development of the advert should be stopped. Products should be bought by people because they have a good quality, instead of consumed only because the advert makes it seem much better than they really are.
