Travelling is one of the most effective ways a family or an individual could spend quality time, relax or have fun. Therefore it is essential that tourists have their vacations orgainised so that they can  have the largest amount of fun possible. To have a perfectly a orgainised vacation, people should travel in a group led by a tour guide.

There are many benefits to travelling with a tour guide. Firstly, the tour guide is a trained professional in tourism. He would know which are the best attractions to visit, and what would be an appropriate length of time to spend at each one. He would be able to plan how to spend the whole day effeciently, unlike if a person was alone and has to spend hours deciding where to go next. Secondly, the tour guide would have tickets ready prior to the visit, and this would enable the group to go straight to the attraction without wasting time. For example, to go up the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, it would, on average, take a person 2 hours to get a ticket in the high season. However a tour guide would get you the ticket well before you arrive there, and then you wouldn't have to waist a lot of time waiting in line. Thirdly the tour guide would arrange all the transport in advance, and for example would make arrangment with bus companies to have busess present at the correct times, and tell them exactly where to go. If, on the other hand, a person is travelling alone, he would waste a lot of time trying to get from place to place.

There is also a social benefit to traveling with a group, as it would be likely that your group consists of people mainly from your home country, and therefore you would be to socialise with them and discuss the attractions you visit, along with the fact that you make new friends.

However, some people may argue that having a tour guide deprives them from making their own decisions, and their personal choises. Also, it would not allow them to do things that they have always wanted to do, if they visted a certain country, but this can always be easily solved by extending the vacation a day or two, or if that is not possible, missing the certain guided tours they are not particularly interested in.

All in all, I strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. It's advantages significantly overwiegh its disadvantages, and I beleive that most people would have more fun if they travelled in  group led by a guide.
