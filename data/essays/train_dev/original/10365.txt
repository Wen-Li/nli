Although many people tend to avoid trying new things and take risks, I oppose to that attitude because to me it seems to be boring doing always the same.
On the one hand, if you take risks, there is always the danger to fail. Depending on how great the risk is, you may loose nearly everything you possess. Admittedly, this is a even harder decision, if you are responsible for a family. I remember a time in my childhood, when my father thought of expanding his local drug store. Certainly it had been a great chance but after severel sleepless nights he decided not to take the risk due to his care about his family. In addition, trying something new always comes together with a lot of hard work. Why should you do it, if you can hold your status with a work you know to do well?
In my opininion, you do it, because you will get rewarded, if you try something new. I find, trying out new things is fun and interesting. In other words, when I try something new, I have the wonderful chance to broaden my horizons. If you never give it a try, you will never experience if there is something you would like better. I, for example, invested all my money during my studies to open a small copy shop for co-eds. What I received back from this little business was not only the money to finance my studies, but also the unvaluable experience of applying my theoretical knowledge from university to the real business world. This helped me a lot to succeed.
In a nutshell, I agree that it is more comfortable to do only the things you know well. However, risking something improves our experience and provokes innovation, the latter being one of the key factors that thrive our economy.
