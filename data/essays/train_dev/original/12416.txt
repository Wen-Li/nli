I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. As a matter of fact, people who are open-minded ,manage their time well and work hard, regardless of old or young, can enjoy their life without questions. 

A bright and vigrous young spirits may have more curioisties than older people to explore the world. They are bound to learn any information they are enthusiastic with. They may have lots of social activities they have to participate in such as parties, concerts and sports and make friends. However, a young people who grew up in a dysfuncitonal families with narrow-minded, may  not have moods to learn and play. They may fall in the depression and hateful environments and kill time by doping drugs or hook around. They drop out from schools and do not know what to do. They do not know how to manage themselves and their time as well, so there's no good life they can enjoy.

On the other hand, a great  deal of vivid older people may retire from their jobs and  they are veterans who save pensions and good at  how to lead a beautiful life. They manage their time carefully. They may get up in the morning to take a walk at the park, read newspaper on the bench and enjoy sunshine, arrange a nice trip and visit old friends sometimes; cultivate hobbies to make their child's dream come true. Some older people who do not manage well from their youth may suffer financilly difficulty to organize their life. They are sick and can not go anywhere. Illness brings hard and unhappiness life for them. 

Therefore, no matter young and old, people can enjoy life easily if they appreciate how precious life are and manage their times well and keep open-minded.
