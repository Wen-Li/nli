I clearly disagree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour.  I will explain you why around three mains points.

First of all, in my opinion, I trully think that trip preparation is a complete part of the travel experience. If you follow a group led by a tour guide, you will not be able to discover the country or city you will visit in advance. Reading, the Lonely Planet, spending hours on Google watching for some advises on the best places to go is a great time.

Secondly, in a group led by a tour guide, you have to follow. For me, it means that you are not free to do what you want, when you want. The worst thing is that they are telling you when you have free times! In a trip, I go through a lot of different moods. Sometimes I like moving quickly from one place to an other, but sometimes, and it happens quite often, it is real pleasure to relax , take time, and enjoy the moment. From my point of view it's essential to follow our rythm.

Last but not least, the departure and return flight are most of the time scheduled in the middle of the night and in unknown airport. We all know that tour guides want to reduce cost and get a better rentability. That is the reason why, they prefer to chose big airplane charter with small seats to put more people in it. In addition they use small airports which are clearly cheaper. The travel becomes painfull, and it affects your trip appreciation.

That is why, I disagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. There are many other ways to have a better time in a trip than this one.
