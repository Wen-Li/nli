Befor three years , i met with my frind who finished his university befror one month in that time and he was very sad because he didn't find a job in any company . When i aske him about the reason for that  and he had gotten an exellent marks , he answerd that all comany want diffrent of skills in the emploee who will work with them . It is better to have broad knowledge to get a good job , big salery and high postion in any comany .

         
           If you have diffrent major in you education or several of knowledge you'll have a big chanse to get agood job. For example , if you have engneering major withe some courses in coputer  , you'll get job faster then if you have just an engneering . Also, you'll work in a diffrent department and that wiil make your job more exciting .

            
          It's not hard to get a job , but to have a good salery is the hard thing . To improve your skills snd to get a nice salery you should diffrent then the outher eployee . Alot of people try to get one major in teir education and ther want to work , if you want to be diffrent then the outher you have to get5 broud of knowledge .


           Not every one can be a manager or importent one in his company . The manger has a special proparties then the outher ,   more education and strong behavior . We can get the diffrent education by having broad of knowledge . If you study difrrent major with diffrent of people you'll get the strong behavior .
            

           In cnclusion , you can be an Importent man with big salery in an exellent job if you have broad of knowledge and diffrent of education . My frivs also have knowen that .
