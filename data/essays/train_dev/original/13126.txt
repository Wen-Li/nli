most people have lost thier interest about thier communities day by day.people also don't want to involve in helping thier communities.So it seems to me that these people that i am accused not  of  helping their comminities are specailly youngsters.However, I can't accuse them directly since the sense of helping poeple around us should be taugth  in their early education such as in elemantary schools.Moreover families should be take care of this issue.

The first point that i would like to make is that if you are willingto help your community you shouldn't wait earning money.As a result  young people think that helping to other people or partipating in some charlty organization is waste of time.However thinking like that it is not their fault yet their families don't talk with their children about the importance of helping to people.Moreover teachers or school department don't encourage the youngster to help their comminities.For instance when I was in highschool ,our teacher encourage us to go to the house for elderly.Furhermore they were bringing us to the forest  in order to culture a tree in everymonths.But the school stopped doing this activities because of its cost.In addition I am conviced that young people can't understand the benefits of helping their communities.

Let us look  another reason why younsters don't help their communities.I believe that their circulum in the school is so busy.They have to study and they have to pass their classes.It is apparent that those responsibilities are stressing them out.However They can help their comminities in their spare times.I am convinced that most youngsters spend their time playing video games ,chatting internet or interesting in celebrities' lives.they can take a action in some helping organization instead of doing these activities.

To sum up, I agree with young people don't help their comminitiees as much as they should.But, the most importanly , it is not their fault.Some shoul teach them the importanceof participating to help their comminities such as their parents and their teachers.
