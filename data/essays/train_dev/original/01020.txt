In this era of immense competition, modern youngsters spend lesser and  lesser time towards 'giving back to the society'.  There is a downward trend in the number of hours spent doing community service these days. The sense of belonging has decreased over the years and we tend to take most things for granted. Community service is considered to be 'someone else's job'. 

Firstly, students are faced with more workload from schools and colleges so they have lesser leisure time. They feel so exhausted after classes that there is little or no motivation to take up some community work. Also, there is high competition, so the students tend to spend after-school hours  doing extra research or preparing for tests. Say a student is not doing as well as she expects. In such a case, she will obviously concentrate on making an extra effort and studying harder. Thus community service takes a backseat. 

Secondly, when a student does have some time to spare, he or she may have an option to take up a paid job. For example, when a one has an option to make money by working in the local cafetaria and earn a good chunk of money, the community service option does not seem lucrative. This is due to the tendency of seeking personal benefits before caring for others. In other cases, the leisure time is  spent 'hanging out' with friends, watching moveis, going for concerts , chatting on the internet etc. For instance, after a full day at college, two friends prefer to meet up at the mall rather then tire themselves out doing more work.

Usually, the the motivation to do community service arises from a desire to present a more 'attractive' resume or for college admissions. However, it would be incorrect to generalize this staement because there are a few individuals who genuinly like to do community service out of personal satisfaction. Some people enjoy interacting with elders at old age homes and get happiness when the old express their excitement over having someone to talk to! Sadly, such youngsters are fewer in number.

Hence, community service is declining these days.
