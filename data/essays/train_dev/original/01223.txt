I'm agree with the affirmation that says: young people enjoy life more than older people do.
I have twentythree years old therfore i am a young boy, in this period my life is very enjoy and for this i am happy. In this last years I have done some things, many of this was very important for my growth, many of this was very enjoy, but at the other hand there was some bad moments. Moreover I can say that in my life the good period are more present  than bad period.
I'm young and this thing is very beautiful, in this period of my life i can do some enjoyed things, for examples yestarday i  played with my friend at football, in other days I had played at baseball, cricket, basketball..
 Young old let me do this thing, becouse my body is ok, I don't have problem, I'm healtly. At the moment i think that i can do everything! it's a good sensation, the best i have never had. 
At the other hand this good period can't continue for all my life, in this case i could is an highlander! 
There is a period of our life that all things is more difficult than in youth. This difficult period is when the people come to be an older person. This is the ultimated state of our life, when our body come to be ill, old...  
I think that there are some good moment in this sad period, the close contact with our relative develops one strong rapport,  is important, in this manner we can be more happy than only.
In conclusion I think that young people are more enjoy than the older, but we must love our life, becouse in unique and indispensable.
