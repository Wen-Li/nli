I think that advertisements are the best ways to sell products. I think the selling and gaining money from a product has a very important and coherant chain. And advertisements pley a very important role in this chain because without an advertisement the product won't be known by lots of people, then you will not be able to sell your product to many people because your products is not well known and also because you didn't sell enough to get poeple's trust so your product is not enough trustfull and because of this you will not gain money. and because you dont have money you will be able to produce your goods. And finally your company will be closed. 

If you look to the big companies like Coca-cola, you might understand what I am talking about. Coca-cola today is a huge company and has lots of factories in lots of countries because it did introduced itself to the whole word by advertisements. Eventhough in our country, Turkey, they have a very big advertisements. In every mounth they produce a new "creative" advertisements to attract people to buy coca-cola. Because they know that advertisement is a very important and helpful way to introduce new products and also to show and make them remember their old products too. So thats why they put lots of money to advertisements to make people buy their products even though coke is a very unhealthy thing. 

For another example fast food advertisements. We all know that fast foods are very unhealty things for us. It has lots of chemical things which are not needed by our body, But when you watch Mc. Donalds tw advertisement and see a billboard advertisement of Burger King, you immediatelly think about eating a hamburger and drinking a coke and eating extremely unhealty French Fries. 

So advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Eventhough they are extremly unhealty and and not needed by humans you immediatelly want them. But this making much better seller advertisements are not just foods and drinks, it can be a car adv. or a game console adv. or clothing company adv. or every single think you think of. Adverti
