Today advertisement can convice consumers that every kind of product is the best one and that you can't live without it.
There are a lot of tecniques that make a  product  irresistible for consumers.
But is always true that all advertised products are so good like it seem to be?I think is not: they seem much better than they really are.
Last week I bought an apple pie that I saw on a television spot. In the images reported on tv it seems realy testy and healthy, but when I eat it, it was not  so good and I got sick . I couldn't sleep all night long.
In my opinion it would be better for  food or dress companies to spend their budjet  improving the quality of their products or decreasing the prices instead of invest it on advertisement.
The problem is that business  rules are different from what is better for the people. But something has to be done.I think that certification of qulity are a very good investment for the companies to show the real value of their product end in the same time a good way for consumers to verify the quality of what they are buying and choice better between different brands.
