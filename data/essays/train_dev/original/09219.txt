In order to answer to this question it may be useful to spread my idea from the definition of the concept of "community" to the concept of "responsability". But I think this will take me a lot of time and... space, in terms of words to be written. However, I think that the statement reported in the left frame of this window is to be validated as well as no generalization can be done about something, since what we state is just refered to our personal experience. \
Starting from this foundamental point that structures my idea on such a topic, I can clearly say that I do not (completely) agree with what is stated. As a matter of fact there are young people who give enough time - sometimes, TOO time - for helping community, and there are on the contrary young people who do not want to be involved in this fact. I think that nowadays the importance given to a generic "job" (not the one we referred to as the "money-bringer" process, but the one of something a person can do for a reason or for another) depends on the social, cultural and political environment in which that job is processed. As a matter of fact I think that it is true that young people have different aims in their life, but it is also true that in one way or another those people could be helping community even if they don't know they are. 
What I am stressing is the idea that no one can say with no doubt that a generic person P is making well for the community instead of a person Q who is not doing well. I think that this has to be referred from situation to situation and no generalization can be used, in any way. 
However I can see, from my personal experience within my family, that that thing years ago guided young people to help community, for example helping old people or people with some disease etc., is no longer present nowadays: I refer to a mind condition, i.e. SPIRITUAL SUPPORT, THINKING OF OTHERS (in Italian we call it ALTRUISMO)... but nowadays we look at CONVENIENCE, mainly (I underline another time, NOT ALWAYS). Convenience is probably the main disease oppressing humanity because convenience makes us do something just for the "do ut des" criterion, but this is not always the right thing to do. This can be found in every field: at work, at school, in sports (I live in Italy...). In conclusion I can remark what I just read in this few lines: no matter what you work for or you work in, no matter what people say to you and what people think about you (in a rational way, obviously), just do what you did for so long, and you will help your community as much as you can...
