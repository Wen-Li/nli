Students meet many kinds of information in their courses or lectures. It can be regarded as an information overload on students. The lectures usually include ideas, concepts and facts which students should learn and use. I assert that students should try to understand ideas and concepts instead of facts in the lessons in order to be successful. Understanding of ideas and concepts rather than facts offers knowledge which is  more lasting and provides students with deep and total understanding of topics.

First of all, a students has two choices, when he or she is studying on a lesson; memorizing the facts which are included in the subject or understanding the main concepts and ideas which are covered in the subject. If he or she prefers memorizing to understanding, his or her knowledge will be lost after some days later. Because of the reason, covering the ideas and concepts is more useful and helpful than learning the facts.

The other important advantageous of understanding ideas and concepts is deep and total understing of the subject. The ideas and concepts have more meaning than facts. In other words, they are more valuable in terms of the meaning. On the other hand, facts may be just case or specific situation. It is narrow and has generally meaning  about itself. It seems that ideas and concepts should taken interests than facts by the students.

To conclude, it is the students' preferences whether he or she pays more attention on ideas and concepts in the subject or not. The other choice is memorizing facts in the subjects. Understanding ideas and concepts is more lasting and provides students with deep and total understanding. After considering the two advantageous of ideas and concepts, which mentioned before, they are enough to prove its importance.
