This is a really common theme for these periods. Young people most of the time are not interested to help and to develop the community in which they live. Just a small part of them is really interested at the topic. Often  this new generation is selfish and it is worried to satisfy  their needs instead to open their mind to the community. I can say that many things are changed during these years, in the past the people s commitment was much more developed and felled compared to these days. My parents, my grandparents really believed in the possibility to create a better place to live, moreover they tried with a lot of efforts to improve activities that could let the community be a better place. There were the trust that something could change if you are really interested in what is around you. 
Nowadays i think that the reponsability to take care of the community is disappeared at all - young people think that is not their problems being worried about the community enhacement, thus the common believe is that just the governament has to promote and support it.Furthermore the young people are not interested in this aim because there is not for them a clear return in terms of money or materialistic benefits. This generation has lost the beuty in believing on the power of the ideas. They do not fight anymore for an idea but just for themselves. 
An example of the difference between the past and the current days could be provided by a short story told me by my granfather
In the 1940 my grandfather  was very interested to the problem of our town. He was a person that has tried to improve the economical condition of our city and to develop the spirit for the community. In that period in my small city thre were not a cinema. The citizens of that time complained most of the time for this kind of lack, even because in that period the cinema was something new and it appealed most of the people. My grandfather was the one who invested money and finally bought the first cinema odf my town. Everbody can remember him firstly as a good person a then as someone who did at least some efforts to take care of the community.
