I do not agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. The reason being specialized study in one subject provides an indepth understanding of the subject. It is critical for research and innovations. It  also helps to make a positive contribution towards societal development. 

Most modern day innovations can be attributed to indepth study and research. For example, the developments in telecommunications could not have happened but for the innovations in fibre optics. These developments have revolutionized modern communication. Distances no longer matter. Life has become more easy.

In depth studies in management are critical in finding solutions to an ever growing and complex world. So, by pursuing indepth studies in a specific subject one could contribute meaningfully and effectively to the development of the world. 

It is easy to dabble in many subjects. But serious study is critical for success. No doubt reading varied subjects helps broaden one's thinking. But, one could gather basic knowledge and information about other subjects without much efforts. In this age of information and technological revolution one can have easy access to information. Further, we do not live in isolation in a society. So social exchanges and interactions would help build our information and knowledge base on other subjects.

The modern world is driven by technology and science. In this modern world one could contribute more meaninfully if one is focused and does an indepth study. Even a social scientist needs to do more indepth study to contribute meaningfully.
