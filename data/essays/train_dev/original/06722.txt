I agree with the statement. There are three main reasons for that.
First, ideas and concepts are more various than facts. Facts have the tendensy, but all ideas and concept is defferent from each other by people who made them.
Second, to learn is easy, but to understand is difficult. Students should study hard and not get easy.
Finally, if students understand ideas and concepts, they apply thier knowledge to thier life in the future. Only to learn facts is not useful.
Therefore, I think that students should make the much effort to understnd ideas and concept, not to learn facts.
