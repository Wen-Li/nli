Advertisements are usually a particular kind of product developed form many people working together, each one with a different role and each one with different skills.
Those people are paied from companies and they have a great interest in improving companies' profits just because if they don-t they risk to loose their jobs.
I think this is enough for showing how advertisement presents products in better way then the one tey really are.

First when a company decide to spend money in advertisement it' s usually waiting a reward from that.An advertisement campaign is costly.For this reason they expects more people will buy the product in order to achieve an higher profict.
This is why people who produce advertise has to attract more buyers that their competitors and so will try to present their products as the best products people can desire to buy.They must convince people if they buy that they are doing the right chooise.

Second people who are payed to produce advertisement have a lot of different skills, they usually know a lot about marketing and they know who they are going to refear to sell the product.
For examples some days ago I was in the library and I was really surprised when some boys and girls near me began to talk about a marketing research project they were developing.
They didn't care at all about the quality of the product, they care just about how to sell it.They tried to find the best way of convincing people and didn't care at all about beeing honest in the way they had to do that.

Moreover I can surely add some personal experience.For example, I've got an eleven years hold sister  always asking my mom  for many products she sees in advertisements.Sometimes my mother buys her the product she wants and even if she spends a lot of money doing that often they are not hight quality  products.I noticed  this can happend easily for products they sell to kids or teen-agers just because this public usually care less about quality and more of how the product itself appears.

In conclusion my opinion is that advertisement is often a way of earning more proficts for companies or a way of creating a brand name.The market itself is cometitive.How can they reveal the weaknesses of their products?
