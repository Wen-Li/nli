My opinion about the topic that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities is ambuoules. On the one hand i think many of young people are egoistic today, on the other I know that it is not easy to manage social ambitions today, espacially for the youth. I can imagine the young pepole because Iam one of them.
I do not help in my community or neither I work in a social programm.
The reasons for that are my few time between the duty's wich filling my whole day. 
I think the possibilty to help without any pay in communities is better at a younger age of children, from eleven till fifteen. Many older young people are busy with their education and own future and too young children maybe are not in the confidence or have the responsibility to work for the community.
Many of the work wich is to do in a german communities is made by
so called young people who finished school. If thez don't want to go to the army, they can choose a social work in communities, hospitals, etc..
The truth is that young people don't help for free. They are always looking for a payment and don't do anz help benfitly. Iam sure that there are many things wich young people could do in a community
