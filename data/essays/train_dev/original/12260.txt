Youth represents a large percentage of the world population. Recently we had an increasing number of new formed organization, which are specialized in helping the community. most of these organization are constitute of young people. I do believe that young motivated people can serve and help there communities.

 Young poeple are usualy highly motivated. but due to many circumstances they might not find the time or the appopriate way for helping their communities. for example I am a lawyer and most of the time I have to work for 10 to 12 hours per day. and during the weekends I usualy have papers to study and review. therefore I do not have that much time to do any social work. But that does not mean that I don't want to, or that I find that helping my community is that not that important, it is just that the rythem of the fast world that we live in today, force us to fix some priorities first. But I do try my best to participate in any available community work that i can find. 

 During my college year I did a lot of charity and social work. I was a memeber of a social club, where we accomplished a lot of beneficial projects that I'm really pround for being a part of it. And we were not the only club, there where over 50 clubs in my university. We believe that the important thing is to help the people who needs a hand, try to make there world a better place. like for example in the summer of 2002, I participated in a project where we had to pant a primary school in a very poor district.The students of this school also helped us on this project, and it just felt great seeing these great smiles of happiness painted on there cute little faces.

I believe that the young people are a very important element of the society. But all they need is just to find the right directions. They are full of hope and faith and have alot to give. And that nowadays they do give there best to help improving there communities.
