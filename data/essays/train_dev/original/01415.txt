Traveling is an impotant part of life. rarely there is a person who does not travel or does not like to travel. I think that a person should travel in group, by this a person can have more security. If a person travelling in a group of his friends or family members and they are visiting to some new place they will need a guide. Guide can tells us the historical importance of the places we are visiting to. As the guide knows all the areas and places of interest so he can guide us well . Also if we are visiting to a place where there is different type of language used,guide can act as an interpreter. So I am fully agrre with the idea of travelling in a group led by guide.  
First reason that why I am in the favour of tour guide is that the guide can tell us the importance of that place in detail, which otherwise we cant get enough through other sources like books etc. for instance Last year me and my friends visited some historical places in India like Agra ,Delhi and Jaipur but we people don't think like hiring a guide , so v faced much problems over there.
Second reason in favour of hiring a tourist guide is that the guide is well known to the area where we are visting and he knows very well about the other places which we had not heard earliar. So he can make our travel experience more interesting by introducing us to the new places. 
Another important reason that I am in the favour of tour guide is that we can easily come over the language problem if we are visiting a place with different language. For example if we are visiting european countries than we might encounter with the language problem over there. And we can come across the difficulty of interacting with people. A tour guide can act as an interpreter between us and the people of the other region  we are visiting to.

To summarize ,the best way to travel is in group led by tourist guide , so that we can come to know in details about the places we are visiting to, we can enhance our experience by introduction of new places and we can handle the situation of language problem and last but not the least by travelling in a group we can have a sense of security .
