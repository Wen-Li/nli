    In my opinion it is better to have knowledge of one specific subject extensively, rather than having some knowledge in all the fields. There are a few reasons namely - accuracy, dangers of half knowledge and specialization is only after some general knowledge - that i venture to opine in favour of specialization.
    Firstly if a person is more widely knowledgable in the field of his own interest, he not only performs well but also is able to put in his own efforts in the form of information to be used more accurately.For  example a doctor, if he is specialized in heart and its related aspects he is capable of helping a patient more efficiently than a general physician would.
    Secondly like i said dangers of half knowledge are not unknown to us.If we have not mastered even one subject we cannot put in any effort to get something out of our knowledge.We do not have a sense of direction in which to proceed also we have to stop in the middle of an invention or discovery because we do not know what lies ahead.This can also be decisive for the growth of a society on the whole.
     Finally for any specialization to happen on any subject we start with a knowledge of various feilds related or unrelated which might help in the better understanding our field of interest so the knowledge of all academic subjects is in a way the foundation stone of any specializaion and is therefore a part of the learning process.Like i stated if it is a cardiologist in question then he would have some knowledge of the whole body functioning as that is evidently related.
    Thus i can safely say that specialization not only helps in developing our skills in our own field of interest, it also is the destination for some knowledge that we acquire in all the subjects. Eventually helping us to mature as an individual, as an adroit in our field and in the growth of society on the whole.
