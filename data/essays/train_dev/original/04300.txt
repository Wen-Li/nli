People get education because the knowledge serves as the background setting for young adults which means that those complex math questions or the dates for a historical events are not applied directly on the society. Thus, if I have to choose between understanding ideas and concepts on certain subject or learning facts, I would choose to understand ideas and concepts. There are two reasons for agreeing with the statement.
	The first reason is because if you focus on understanding ideas and concepts, you can obtain knowledge much easier and faster. This is because when you try to obtain ideas and concepts to yours, it is easier to concentrate as the process of learning them is fun and interesting. For example, when I get the report cards from school, I could divide them into two groups. The subjects with high grade were the subjects I understood the concepts and ideas very well. The other group is consist of low grades which I considered boring and waited the class to end. As you see from my experience, the quality of outcome differs whether you understand ideas or just try to learn facts. This shows why it understanding is more important than learning facts.
	The next reason is that the ideas and concepts you understand remains for longer time. This reason is conceivable among people. In my case, I still remember the math formulas I understand in my high school days. This is because if you understand the ideas or concepts as yours, it can be applied to other areas thereby the formulas or other facts can be used and remembered on and on even you become old.
	To sum up, the two reasons presented above shows why understanding facts is more curcial than just learning facts. Understanding facts helps your knowledge be installed in your brain in shorter amount of time with positive attitude towards it, and can be applied to other spheres as well. As I have experienced variety of cases related to this statement during my high school life, I strongly agree with the statement.
