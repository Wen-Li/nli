I agree with this speech young people nowadays do not give time to helping their communities.the life is changed from the past I mean every things became faster and faster in this life.everyone busy with his own life.
   first of all, the young people are busy wirh their study and their own life.the young people in the past,they do not warried about their study .however, now they worry alot for they study and they want to be something in their sociuty.
     Next,young people have alot of thing want to do.For example,they want to enjoy in their free time with their friends.They want to go to the mall or visit some best friends.On other hand, in the past they have alot of time to help their communities.
       Finally, the year after the year the young people will be more busy than now because of the technology  which develope year after year and the life will be more difficult.I think the young people should orginize their time in this cause they can do want they want .Also,they can help their communties.
