I don't agree with this statement because I think that having a deep knowledge in one specific subject is much better.

I think this because, even if a broad knowledge of many academic subjects could be important, in my opinion the world of our days require particular skills to the person. If a person had a knowledge of many subjects, he wouldn't be able to have a deep knowledge of every these subjects, and this could mean that he couldn't be able to solve determined problems which require a deep knowledge of a pattern. For example let us think about a manager who knows all the kinds of problems which could happen in an enterprise but who who hasn't a graet preparation in order to solve them because during his academic career he didn't specialized in one particular subject. In this case I think that even if this manager has a great preparation due to his enlarged studies, he wouldn't be able to give his contribute to the company. 

I also think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects automatically implies the fact that it can't be the result of a deep preparation in all these kinds of subjects. I think that this kind of knowledge could  be important to a person own satisfaction but if we assume that every subject could have been studied in deepth, it would have implied a lot of time spent (ten years or more) and I think that it wouldn'be of great importance becuse in my opinion the world requires our skills as soonest as we can! Beside I also think that the world  doesn't have the will to expect us completing our long studies in all the subjects, but it expects that we will able to provide it a quick solution its problems.
