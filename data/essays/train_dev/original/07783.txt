I do not agree with the statement, that there will be fewer cars in use then they are today in twenty years. 
The problem with cars is, that they need oil. Nowadays oil is very expensive. We also have to change something. New technologies are necessairy. A new generation of car technologie is a good start. It is called hybrid. This cars have two motors. One is the traditional otto-motor, the other one is an elctric one. This kind of cars are very economic. They run with oil when they are in a normal mode. In this mode they  load up the batteries for the electric mode. After a short ride, especially fast rides (they produce more energy), you can use the elctric motor. We have to support the technical research to improve inventions like this. In the future it will be more important to give money for research. 
Another point that underlines the theorie, that there are countries in the world, that now begin to have cars. In China for example it was not common to have a car. But this countrie is so increasing, that in future they will have millions o
