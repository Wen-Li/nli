I totally agree with the statement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are. I have three reasons to explain this.

First, the aim of the advertisment is to sale more products. No producer wants to decrease the functions of the products in the adversitiment. On the contray, the producer will try their best to show the positive aspects of the products and minimize the negative aspects. So, the products in the advertisement will only have the advantages. For example, the advertisement of the medicine will only tell the customs which disease it can curve and neglect the serious point of the medicine. Some customs will be extra-damaged by the medicine for the negative aspects of the medicine.

Second, in order to sale more products, the producers enlarge the  functions of the products in the advertisements. The products in the advertisement will be much better. For example, the mineralized water are good to the health of human body. Some producer take the mineralized water as penecean which can be used as medicine to some illness.  

Third, the advertisement is a goods too. The advertiser can sale it only when it can satisfied the producer of the products. That means the advertiser need to make sure the product in the advertisement should be excellent, even better than it actually it. 

From the above, we can draw a conclusion that the products in most advertisements are not the same as themselves. Their funcitions are been enlarge in the advertisement. So, the goverment should care about this problem to let the custom know the truth of the products.
