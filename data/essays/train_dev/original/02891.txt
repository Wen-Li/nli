I disagree, because population are increasing day by day in the world. It is connected with cars also. Car companys pruducting a new car every year. When I analyse the traffic every cars has one people transporting. Every family has two cars minimum. Because cars price also decreasing and peoples earns money moch more before. Government must solve this problem but nobody dont do anything. Government  investigate to Underground and bus systems.

For example Istanbul is a huge city. There are 15 million people live in istanbul.Also there are 5 million car in our city. But Istanbul has not a underground metro network. Also bus is very old to transportation. Also Taxi is not chipher. Because of all of this points  peoples choose to buy a car and use it daily woks. I think this is a general problem all of the world.

The another point that is old cars in the traffic. There are lots of old cars in the traffic that is more than 20 years old. These cars try to work successfully and try to transport peoples. In this case it is need to establish new laws for traffic on the counties. For using a car, It must be prohibit for more than 20 years old cars I think.

Also the scientist reserch that for trying to work a car with electricity ennergy or walther. If it will be possible, I think car population also grow up.In the world oil price very high right now. But electricity or wather is so free/
