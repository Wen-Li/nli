In my opinion, there is no general answer to the question whether or not new things and risks will lead to more success than sticking to old shoes. I think it highly depends on the character of a person.

People might be very successful in doing what they have done all their life. Usually, they are very experienced in what they do and with their knowledge and their background they are able to make the right decisions which eventually might lead to a great success. 

On the other hand, people who take risks and who are willing to learn new things, new theories and new perspectives, can generally be characterized as more open-minded. They have to arrange with new situations and be more flexible. They have to pay attention to the change of markets and change with their environment. It can also be assumed that people who seek new challenges are more motivated than people who do the same things every day, because they will not get bored by a daily stupidity.

Not only that new challenges lead to new opportunities for success, I also think that having and gaining knowledge in more than one field rather than being a specialist on one certain topic provides a lot more options for success. Being able to follow and take part in discussions on a variety of fields might earn the respect of other people. It is a lot easier to give an objective opinion, if one can verify this opinion through solid experiences in a variety of fields. I think having a wide range of basic knowledge is a lot more impressive than just being able to lecture on one specific topic. People with common sense and a variety of interests might more likely be employed by an employer than probably would be a specialist who has not ever looked beyond his narrow borderlines.

Although I can see situations, where experience in doing familiar things can lead to success, I, as to speak for myself, would prefer learning new things and according to that I would also be willing to take some risks. Despite all these arguments on success, I also think that life is a lot more worth living with the opportunity to face new challenges and learn new things.
