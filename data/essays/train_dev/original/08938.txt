I agree, because the advertisement exagerate the efficiency or quality of the product sounds like a salesman in the shop. The marketing in some many brands are aggresive that it is because, they want to compete with others and then show how are the brand is better than the others. Example of that is the Walt Disney's Company Over the year we saw many commercial announcements in television, internet, movies and mailing letters, they bombarding to us with this promotions over and over again but in some many ways they sellit a "dream may come true" but it is not true when you dedide to start a vacation in Walt Disney the don't tell you about the long lines in the sun waiting for the attractions or waiting for eat in restaurants. This is sort of a kind of huge mistake when the advertisement capture our attention and became more attractive that the reality.This is an example so how the people is enchanted for some advertisement and the reality is other when arrive to "Walt Disney". Other advertisements just like food or diets show the specific people achieve their goals when entering to this plan, but the reality is other, because they never tell you how much is cost when you became interested in that program, the reality is they manipulate the statistics and sold dreams and stole money for the customers, who failed to achieve that goal. In my opinion the people need to be more wisely when they attracted and impressed with an advertisement, just because they wants your money and not your needs or satisfaction that you want. That why they called marketing.
