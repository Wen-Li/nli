Nowadays, do you think young people give enough time to help their communities? I can surely answer you, NO! But why?

In my view, I think the young people spend all their time together with the computer, games, KARAOKE, something like that. 

I remember that when I was young, there haven't got any Gameboy, Playstation, Computer, my only entertament when I finished my homework is to see the television, swimming, running or play the basketball with my dad, very seldomly my faher will bring me to my cusion's home to play the TV-Games. But now, the only after school function of the young people is sit in front of the computer and chat with their friends, or somehow play the online games. Because there are too many funny things on the internet. Then how can they get extre time to help their communities?
