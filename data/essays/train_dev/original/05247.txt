I dont really agree with this statement that "most advertisements make products much better than they really are". Because  it aways happens in the other way, that they will not be much better than they really are or they really seem to be. Here comes the difference, they will advertise the product by showing its good qualities and the way it works or so on, but they wil not show its defects, they will not count on those. Perhaps they seem much better when they advertise them and they will convince us to buy it, its after that all happens that we will come to know about the actual performance of it, which is really worse.

But sometimes it happens that the products seem much better than they really are, but note it, sometimes only, it just very rare. I will give you live example which has been experienced by me in the past. Once i bought a video-cd player, convinced by the products advertisement in which it was shown all its good qualities and said its performs better than the remaining ones in the market. So i bought it thinking that it will be a better option to buy the product of that company. But i was completely wrong in my choice, because it was always subjecting to repairs and it was not working properly. I went wrong in selecting, by seeing the advertisement.

Another example is an experience of my friend with a cosmetic product which promises to glow your skin, bought it by seeing the advertisement and thinking it will make her skin glow, instead it left itching of the skin and allergy of skin. So, i strongly stick to my opinion that they are not as much better as they seem to be. I conclude by saying that i disagree with the statement.
