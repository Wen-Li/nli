     I  agree is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I think you have to know the source of the facts not only the answer. The how and why is important to understand the fact. I think is more important understand concepts and ideas for two reasons: You know the source of the fact and you learn more about one topic.

     First, when you understand ideas and concepts from the beginning you are able to understand the fact better. When you only know the fact you ignore how start. For example you know that a earthquake  is danger and the earth move, but if you know the concept and the idea you can take precaution and stay save, even you can move to some place where dont have earthquake.

     Second, this help you to study and learn about one materia. You can answer how  and why  and this is going to give you a deep knowledge about one area. For example you know if you put the hand in the fire you going to burn. If you know the concept and the idea you know what to to after the burn. Maybe you need go to the hospital or only put an antibacterial oinment.


     In others word know the concepts an ideas give you an extraordinary advantage over the students only learn facts.
You know how, why and
