I disagree with the statement 'the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide'. I would like to putforth examples and situations I personally have experiences to support my opinion.
   A person who travels alone I believe will have a lot more independency in making his own decisions rather travelling along with a tour guide. With a tour guide we see our desicion being influenced by the guide and we get to see places the guide wants us to see rather than what we want to see. It was in my school trip that my classmates and myself had a pretty bad exerience with the guide appointed to us. The guide would take us to places we didn't want to see and he being a localite got us into a hotel that was quite expensive, because by doing so he would get a commission from the hotel authorities for getting them customers. Other than that we had some other bad exeriences only because of the reason that the guide was a localite and was looking for grabbing commission wherever we went.
   The best advantage in travelling alone would be that we could find out about a place by interacting with the localites or getting a copy of the local travel guide to guide us to the best places of visit. In today's advanced world we get to have the information of a place on our fingertips through the internet. We also have amazing travel guide books that come in various languages and help us in getting a feel of the local culture. 
  I would like to end the topic on the point that I took this decision based on my personal experience and the other travel experiences that where great just because of the fact that we didn't take guide along.
