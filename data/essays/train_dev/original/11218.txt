I totally agree with the given statement beacause i've taken broad knowledge from my school till college. I think it is very important to have knowleged about the things around you. Studing or specializing on just one subject is not enough in today's world. For an example, to become a doctor a student must not only take science classes like bio, chemistry, physics and math, but they also have to take some elective classes aswell (politics,economis,humanities),  in order to understand how things work around them.
	I'm an engineering major studnet i've completed most of my science classes, but i've also taken classes like history, art , socialogy, which helped me to understand the importance of the other subjects. These classes developed the understanding of other topics like politics, history , socialogy and world religion in me. I was very suprise to know how important these other subjects are in order to understand the nature of our society. After taking all these classes my way of looking/thinking about the people around me or in other words the society that we are living in have changed a lot in a positive way.
	Someone who does't get a chance to learn about the other subjects find hard time to get a job, because his knowlege is just on specific subjects. In modern world companies are looking for people who have knowledge of all sorts of field,  rather than having knowleged on just one field. For example there is more chances for a computer programmer who also has some kind of background in the field of electronics than the other programmer who just knows about his own programming field.
	In my opinion it is really very important for all of us to have a knowledge of all aspects of life. If you go to universities it very common for a student to have double a major that means to have degree in two field. Becasue they know what companies are looking for once they graduate. Thats a kind of having another tool when other doens't work. We should defenately have knowledge of other fields aswell.
