The following essay deals with the question, wheater it is useful to have a broad knowledge or a smaller specific knowledge of many academic subjects or not.

Firstly, it is obvious that there is no general answer for this question, because our modern world of work is too diverse for that.
A wide knowledge of academic topics is needed for repsonsible jobs such as politicans or higher managers. In some situtations they do not have a lot of time to decide what would be right or wrong. In such cases they have to know things clearly and precisely to avoid a wrong decisions.
Another point is the educational sector of work.
People who work in this category have to know the majority of their subject and very detailed as well. Proffessors or just a regular teacher have the duty to have a broad knowledge, because they must answer questions immediatly and precise.   
Other jobs may not require a huge knowledge on academic subjects, because there are jobs, which need a vast background of knowing all details and all information existened on one specific issue. People working in labs do not need to know all about chemistry, when they do repatative work such as reproduce specific drugs.
Therefore easy or repatative work does not own the necessity to have wide knowledge.

In conclusion it is necessary to distinguish between the huge differences of our modern jobworld.
As I mentioned before, it is not possible to give an overall answer on this topic and it is useful to examine every case seperately.
