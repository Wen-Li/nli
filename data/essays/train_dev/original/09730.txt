The issue of whether one should have broad knowledge of many subjects or one should specialize in one specific subject has aroused heated debates in the modern era. Advocates for the broad knowledge concept say that this approach will help in widening the outlook of the person. Contary to this approcah, some people say that this is the world of specialization and it is very important to be a master in one subject to be successful in life. I personally feel that there should be a balance between the two approches. I would present the pros and cons of each of the approach and then illustrate why I emphasize on the balanced approach.

In today's dynamic world, it is imperative for a person to have a broad knowledge of various academic subjects. This will not only help to acquire a broader perspective but also increase the efficiency in decision making of a person.  Say for example a marketing manager of a Fast Moving Consumer Goods company deicdes to launch a promotional campaign for a product. The knowledge about the financial issues related to the campaign can be really helpful in the decision making. If he does not have knowlege about finance then he can make an expensive plan which can be finally rejected due to the financial constraints of the company. Knowledge about other subjects such as finance, strategy and human behaviour can help the manager in making better informed decisions. This example clearly shows the importance of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects.

On the other hand, there is no denial to the fact that this is a highly competitive world. The most prominent successful people today are the ones who are specialists in their respective fields. A very obvious example are the successful doctors. Not only these doctors have to specialize in fields such as dentistry , pathology etc. but also they have to acquire higher post graduate degrees in the specialist fields. Very few people today would prefer going to a general doctor  for their medical problems. 

I would support a balanced approach as I feel this can make a person a balanced individual who has enough broad perspective to make effective decisions and is specialist in his own field. If the marketing manager in the above example is a person with broad knowledge about many academic subjects then he might find it difficult to devise a marketing strategy, which needs core and in depth study about marketing related policies. Similarly if he is just a typical marketing specialist, he may ignore other vital information related to different subjects and end up giving a poor solution. If he takes a balanced approach where he is a specialist in his area but also knows about other subjects, he will make better decisions and will succeed in life.
