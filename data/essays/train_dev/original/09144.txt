We do not have any proof about this statement and so we can say many different things. When I talk to my father and we are involved in traffic he carries on saying that he when was  a teen there was not all this mess. Streets were not full of cars because there was only one car per family. Now everything has changed. First of all every year we hear about statistic investigations that give us a completely different point: the number of cars is increasing. This may be caused by the improving of our wealth conditions. When my father was young Italy was a poor country and it was just at the beginning of its transformation in a modern country. So the actual situation does not seem to sustain the statement. 
There is however some other considerations that we can do. Our development cannot be sustained by our planet. Our supplies of oil are getting fewer and fewer and we have not found valid alternative powers to substitute oil by now. There is hydrogen but it is more expensive. At the same time electrical engines do not have the same performances of the actual engines. So if for example hydrogen will be our only alterntive it will probably be impossible for   a family to have enough money to pay more than one car with hydrogen as propeller. 
The other thing that can influence the number of cars is the policy of our governments. As I have already mentioned, traffic is increasing more and more every year. But it will not be always possible to build new streets and new routes. There will be a limit.  This fact can be already seen in the choices of some important cities. To get in London with our car we must pay a ticket. Also Milan is going to adopte similar decisions. So perhaps there will be a strong development of public transports.
Instead some countries have already found different alternatives. Netherlands for example is the country where there is the highest number of bicicles in the world. If you walk around the streets of Amsterdam, you will see bicicles everywhere. Even in front of bars, megastores and fastfoods. But this result is related to the choice of the government of building streets for bicicles. So the politicians have encouraged people to lock their cars in their garage. 
In the end, I do not see the possibility of a spontaneus reduction of the number of cars. There are too many interests often related to the oil industry and to the factories that build cars. They are often important parts of our economy and the governments do not want to damage them. But they will be probably obliged with us  to change our life style when the situation will get unsustainable.
