There has been an argument about which is better; having broad understanding in many topics or specialized knowledge in one specific subject. When it comes to academic subjects, I think that specialization is essential because of following reasons.
Almost all areas of knowledge require professional specialists to handle and develope them because they are very complicated nowadays. It is true that our society needs generalists who have wide range of knowledge, but generalists' knowledge is based on the specialists' works in each area. It is specialists who make a new discovery and produce knowledge, having the ability to perform sound researchs on each specific subject. That's why I assert that specialists' role is primary.
Moreover, having broad knowledge is an easy job for everyone because sharing information is easier than ever before. We can easily search for the lastest knowledge in books and internet. This makes the generalists' role unsignificant to be a generalist especially in these days.
