 Well I would agree on that statement in some occasions or education levels in life, for example at school, but would usually disagree with it when it comes to studying in a University. 
  A student having general knowledge would have many basic information in many subjects, which seems to me as an advantage, but not all the information as a student specialized in a certain major or subject.
  Having broad knowledge in an academic is realy benificial i life and may help, but I would preffer to have a specialized major because it will, or I think it would, offer more jobs for me to choose than that of a person with general knowledge and I would or can specialize in that subject more implies I could gain the masters and then the doctorate degrees more easilly.
  Some people other than me would judge me as inccorect and would assign that having general knowledge might improve my life more than that of a specialized one, but nowadays people tend to get specialized or would rather have a major than having onformation on various subhjects that might have a negative impulse towards how that individual is beeing taught.
  Looking at people in many countries having many majors might make a variaty and help people do what or learn what they want instead of having to learn information he/she does not want to or have difficulties in and do not want to complete with
