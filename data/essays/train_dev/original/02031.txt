lots of poeple thinks that young people enjoy life more or better than older people. in one way they are right but in the other hand they are wrong .for a moment lets take the word enjoying life as having fun and doing lots of things.
 young people are active because of their age.the age is a big advantage.they have the energy for doing lots of things. for exeple,traveling,riding a bike,running,and sex of course,things most older people dont have much energy to do.and ofcourse they have kids maybe even grand kids to tie them in to the life they currently have.this is maybe their only satisfaction in life.to be able to achieve lots of things that younger people did not achieve yet.because of this satisfaction they maybe have no need to really experience different things.
 on the other hand i can not really say that young people can enjoy life much eihter.21st century really does not allow lots of us to explore. with the need of a succesful job;the need of a diploma appears.with the need of a diploma money comes in to the story.well we all know that we can not grow money on trees so we start working part or full time at an early age.on top of working we have to study in order to graduate.even after all of this the only time we will enjoy life seems like retirement.well again when we retire we are considered older people.so tell me who are the people that really have fun.younger or older people?
 having fun is not about age or activity. it is about being able to enjoy life at its most.we are the ones who determine the term"enjoying life" for our selfes.at any age if we are satisfied with what we are doing and who we are and how we interract with people then we are the ones who choses to enjor or not to enjoy.
 lets ask this question to our self:TO ENJOY OR NOT TO ENJOY?
