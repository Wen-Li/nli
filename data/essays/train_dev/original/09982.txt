	I'm totaly agree with the statement because if  the products seller make advertisements for their products it will effect of the product's sells. For example , in my country some companies make cheap product but they advertises it like no one can make this product like us , we are  the best. After that , they sell like a millions of it. Then some people get poision of that product because they use cheap things.

	Also , In the US , some companies give an advertisement to a telvision channel like 10 times a day. They are making their product in Asia , because there is no handwork in there. So , they can make whatever they can't in US. Most countries do that , even though a person can make his or her product  by himself or herself. Because they just print where the product made in. 

	However , people know advertisement is a way to intorduce to sell . So , people could decide either buy it or not. If the producters make their advertisement well , everybody will be agree that the product sell very well. A person can recognize that  a product  is most powerful or harmful . People should get the idea of the advertisement , if they don't  they can feel like "What was that advertisement all about?". So the person will be complicated. 

	Finally , If producters want to sell  too much , they should make them good. Also they shouldn't use cheap things. sda  asd   as asd asd as fsdag ntr   rngkj uiy  h  bby  ni ulk
