I totally agree with the statement which states "it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts" . According to me, To understand ideas and concepts are more important for a student than to learn facts. firstly, to understand the topic for example any topic related to physical science like light. We should know the basic concepts to deal with it and basic ideas like to think ourselves from where actually it is coming i think thats enough to understand the topic.concepts should be more clear like various laws of reflection and rarefraction to use them for further study not about the facts that from where it is orignated etc etc.
  After seeing the student prospective we should be clear with the concepts first and the basic ideas like for example taking the 'brain where its never been before about the topic'.These genrated thought called as ideas. Generating ideas are really brain storming technique which help to increase the morale of a student.
   Similarly if a student go in search of a fact there are 9 out of 10 times he will fail. This failure will lead to lower in the morale of a student through which feeling of negativity can comes in his/her mind. This will lead to build up of negative attitude which can hamper his/her future also. Facts are those which we go and try to find after completing our bachelor's or even after masters. Therefore, at a student age we should only learn the concepts involved.
   One more thing i would like to add to make my assumption stronger is that when we appear in any subjective class at school/college level.what our teacher main aim or where they more stress. They stress more on concepts building system then to go in search of a fact.i agree that facts are also required we should know but major focussig point should be concepts and develope student to think beyond the limit.
 At the end in a nut shell i would like to say that concepts are the one which makes student more clear about the topic able to judge it properly. these concepts are the major supported element in a student life which help him/her to think more, to create/generate ideas, to be able to get the thing done in more fruitfull way which are basically needed academically and in professional life to.
