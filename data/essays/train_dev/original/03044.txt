Some people believe that succesful people take risks and try new things in order to acomplish their goals, others believe that doing what they know to do well will get them where they want to be. I believe believe that successful people always have to take risks and not just do what they know to do well. 
I will explain why I agree with the statement using an example on an specifical career like engineering. 
Risks can take you to fields of your carrer that you did not even know exists, because you are always too busy doing what you already know. For example the devlopment of a new technology or the expansion of one that already exist. If you don;'t take the risk to explore new things, this new technology might never be developed because you as an engineer are doing the same thing over and over again.
Another advantage ot taking risks is that if you fail you can always go back to what you where doing before. Let's think of a new product we want to develop. If the engineers have an specifical product for example deodrants in roll-on plastic containers, and they never try to invent another way to apply the product, they probably would not be able to create the spray applicattions. But let's say they formulate this new application using aerosols and they find out that it is affecting the ozone layer on the planet because of the gases expelled. They can always go back to the roll-on aplication and help the environment. They took the risk with the new technology but it brought a lot of problems so they can go back to the old way to apply the product and solve the problem.
These main two reasons explained why people have to take risks in their professional environment. However this apply to other things in your life. Like for example, in a personal field let's talk about marriage. When you get married you are taking a lot of risk. You are signing a contract that last forever, not knowing what is going to happen in your life. But as I mentoined, this contract can be voided and if things are rough you can get divorced and go back to your single life. You took the risk looking for success but it did not work so you can go back and star all over again.
