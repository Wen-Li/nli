Personally, I agree with the statement 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do'. There will be many people disagreeing with this, but there are three major reason to convince. Those three are health, knowledge, and transportation.

	First reason I think this way is because younger people have better health than older people. I was playing in the beach with my relatives. My cousins and I were running, splashing, swimming, and surfing. It was a lot fun for us, as everyone agree. Suddenly, My aunt called us to come out. It was big surprise for us. She called us because my grandfather has fainted. As a result, old people has bad health to enjoy their life. 

	Second one is that younger people has different knowledge than that of older people. Most of my age(14) people know a lot of entertaining place, and fun place. Eventually, olders can't go out broadly, because they don't know many place to go. This was my friend's grandparents story. It was hot sunny day, and they were retired from their work so they ahve a lot of time to go out. So, they wanted to go out some where, but they couldn't. They phoned my friend, and asked her where to go, I was little bit surprised at first, but I understand that they had different lifestyle than us back where they were young like us.

	Last reason that I agreed with the statement is because we have better transportation. Altough, grandparents have lots of time, some of them can not drive, because they had totally different lives compare to us. Nowadays, most of the university student can drive because it's widely used, but old people didn't have chance to learn the driving. Also, younger ones can ride buses, subways, and skytrains. Unfortunantely, olders can't go by standing, they have to sit down some where, but sometimes public transportation doesn't have enough spot for them to sit down. 

	In conclusion, youngs can enjoy life better than olders.  It doesn't mean that every elders all like these, but a lot of proportion of them are like this. I think enjoy life when we are young, and enjoy more quieter and relaxing life is better for elders.
