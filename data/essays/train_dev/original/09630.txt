I agree with the statement that "Most advertisment products seem much better than they really are". For two main reasons, first the main goal of advertisent is to sell and the seller would try to show their product the best they can. On the other hand advertisement campains can make the consumer think that owning the product can make them fell or be a certain way.

	As said in th introduction the main goal of advertisment is to sell, and make the likeable and atractive to the consumer. These may result in distortioning the real product, for example food products, to be able to transmit a flavor, which is a sensation, on visual images, the advertiser needs to over show all the visual characteristis of a the product, this may result on a distortion of the real sizes and aparence of a food product.

	As a second argument the advertisement can make consumer understand that by adquiring the product they can fell or be a certain way, for example women shampoo campains always show a prototipe of woman's hair. The consumer may asume that the type of hair that the person on the advertisment has would be the same as that she would adquire if she uses the product. That does not necesarily means that the product seem much better than it is, just that the consumer is making assumptions over the product but this is a direct consecuence of the advertisment.

	The wish of the producers to sell their product to te consumer may end up on a distortioning on the product by making them seem much better that they are, basicaly because of assumptions of the consumers is drawn to by the visual images of the advertisment.
