I have a quite open opinion about the statement that "In twenty yearsthere will be fewer cars in use than there are today". On the one hand I would totally agree this. Each day you can read somewhere in the newspapers, how the prices if petroil increase from day to day. Petroil reached  his highest price and there might be no decrease in the next years. As well as the limited oil reserves which begin to reduce every hours, it will be difficult to drice a car. Perhaps people will wake up and use the public transports, like the bus or train. That would lead to a better environment, because pollution and noise would reduce. As we could also see with the transrapid the public transportation development is great. 

On the other hand we all see that there is no ending of new car producing. Nearly each inhabitant over 18- years has once drove a car. Unfortunately for a lot of people, cars are a symbol of standard and lifestyle. They like to express their positon in the society. Some also dont want to give up driving a car, because it is a comfortable way of getting somewhere quick and easily. for a lot of people, especially men, cars are more than only a thing to transport them. It is a playing thing, which they like to show and compare with others.

Conclusively, I think there will be fewer cars in twenty years because some people in future have to stop driving their own cars. Insurance and petroil will become too expensive, when the prices will further increase.
