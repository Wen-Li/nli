Learning concepts and ideas are important because; you can remember the facts by the brainstorming about the concepts and ideas, and you can be familiar to learn new facts about a different topic.
	First of all, it must be accepted that, memorising the facts can be a fast way to learn. It can be work in small period of time. You can pass the next examination, for instance. On the other hand, When you forget the fact, it will be very hard to remember if you dont know the ideas belong them and concepts. if you learn the ideas and concepts, you can guess how the fact is provided. So, learning the ideas and concepts can be work on keeping in mind the data for a long time. 
	Furthermore, once you get used to learn how a fact can be provided from an idea, you can easily learn an unfamiliar topic. Every lecture has facts and the ideas' and the relationship between facts and ideas are the same.  Firstly, you will try to understood the ideas. According to the ideas in the concept, you can learn the facts as stable as you provided these facts.  You can use exactly the same method on learning the new lectures.
	As a result, learning the ideas is better than memorising the facts even though it needs larger time to understand. The datas will be more stable and to remember will be easy and learning new topics will be easier than memorising every fact of every lecture.
