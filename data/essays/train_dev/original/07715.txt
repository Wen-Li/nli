 According to many people, there will be fewer cars in use in the future than today.  
Environmental problems are linked with the huge number of cars in the world. Pollution has become a central problem in our societies. In order to respond to this problem, governements focus on many possible solutions such as limitation of cars in the cities. As an example, the mayor of London has introduced a congestion charge in the center of London in order to limit the number of cars. As far as I am concerned,  I think that this solution is very convicing as it has been proved that the number of car has been reduced in the city.
Moreover, public transports are supported by many governements. The cost of undergroud is very cheap in some countries such as France. I would rather take the bus or the tube instead of driving my car. On the other hand, the cost of driving licences has considerely increased during the last years. As a result people are more likely to take the bus, or to use the underground than before.
However, emergent countries such as India or China are not ready to reduce there production of cars. Most of the economy is based on this production. Therefore, environmental issues are not the priority of governements. Although these countries are aware of cars' pollution they don't take preventive measures in order to solve this problem.
But many measures have been taken in order to face with this problem. The Kyoto's Protocol illustrates the capacity to deal with the huge problem of pollution in the world. The problem is that many industrial countries didn't sign this protocol. 
To conclude, I think that we can hope that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, because governements make us aware that cars represents a huge scourge for our societies. As a consequence, many measures have been taken and will be taken in order to reduce car's activity. However, even though many things have been done, the number of cars will increase because many poors countries need of this economy in order to survive.
