Although young peolpe are more outgoing than older people, I do not agree with this statement. Older people are mostly retired and have much more time and money to go on trips and travel to other countrys. Younger people on the other hand have to learn often and do not have that much money to travel a lot. But they are more interested in discovering new countrys and make new experiences.   In comparison,older people already have a lot of experience and they often, just want to visite places where they have been before rather than go on exiting trips. 
However, older peole often have problems with their health and therefore they are not as flexible as young people are. 
Young people can do whatever they want, whithout thinking about their health. Older people therefore are more interested in their own family, which is often the most important topic in their lifes. And to my opinion it is far better to see your own grantchildren growing up than going into discos and stay up all night, what a lot of younger people do.
To sum up the main points, I do not think that younger people enjoy their life more than older people do, because there are so many things that older people can do which younger can not do. To my opinion older people enjoy their lifes different than younger people do, but there is no better way.
