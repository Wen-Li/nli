Nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping communities.

I desagree about that. There are many reasons why i desagree.
First, it shouln't say a generality. There are lot of young people who help our communities.
For example, when Katrina destroyed Louisina and Alabama, young peolpe helped this citys, they had organized a basketball game of charity, with the NBA players.

An other example, young people help old person and give enough time instead of to play football or go to the shopping.
Nowadays ,young people give enough  time for their communities, they organiz party for the children, take time in the hospital to give their help.They create association to beat the A.I.S.D, poverty and the childrens in the hospital who had not money.

Often youngs stars back to do a show for bring money for asscociation and for to build house, park, stadium .

Finally i think young people work enough for thier cmmu
