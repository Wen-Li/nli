	I agree with the statement, mainly because I think  that it is imperative for students to understand ideas and concepts and knowing  how to act upon them is more important than just knowing facts.
	From my experience in highschool, I think students in general find it much easier to just learn facts rather than understanding concepts and ideas. One simple example is when I used to love "labelling the heart diagram" in biology class but just despise explaning Newton's First principle law of motion in physics class. On the contrary when there is a written response question on a test it would be much easier for students to respond when they actually understand what they are talking about rather than just knowing the fact. 
 Another broader example is when we had to make a student commitee with the job of spreding out the word in school of aiding with recycling and cleaning up. Many of us did it but I highly doubt that everyone understood why they where doing. 
	So in the end I believe for a student to get through his life experience as being a student with a degree of some sort, he has to understand idaes and concepts and act upon them .
