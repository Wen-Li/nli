I agree with this idea that charenging new things and don't care about fault. There are two reasons: trying are profitable and newtings have usually fault and it needs to growth.
     Firstly, charenging can proceed tecnology and deveropment.For example, the history of devepropping supace tecnology were faced to many faults.In order to bing out human to the speace, many fault roket lunching were happend. The space deveropping are typical of try new things and overecome risks.
     Secondary, If you do the same thing ordinary, it is impossible to growth. For example,although you learned something in the school, you don't take for the imformation,  the imformation became an invain. People have desire to know new things by nature and they use the fommer imformation. If they don't try newthings, the life area would be narrow by now.
     Threfore, I believe worth activities that people chanenge new things and don't worry fault.
