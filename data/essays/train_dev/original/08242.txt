I don't really agree with the statement which says that learning ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts, because I believe both of them are important skills students need to learn to possess during their learning periods, and they both are crucial for those who wish to become a person who can think critically and creatively. 

First, I believe that learning ideas and concepts from previous scholars and great thinkers is important for students who haven't possess a fixed thinking style yet. Since they are still young and changeable, they can learn things from others' ideas and beliefs and find out what kind of ideas they would prefer more in and try to adopt those ideas in their own daily experince. For example, a student can try to examine whether the idea that cooperating with others is always better than working on one's own is true or not, while he or she uses different techniques working on a preject.  If this student finds out that working together is more efficient, he or she might want to try this method again in the future.

Secondly, I think that there are a lot of different angles we can look at one thing or even an objects, which means that there are a lot of aspects for us to examine a fact when using different ideas and concepts. When students learn a fact, they can try to use their previosly-learned different ideas and concepts to look at it. After examining things from numorous aspects, through different ideas and concepts, students will start to understand the diversity of every single fact, and eventually, learn to think critically and flexibly. For eample, s tudent might find out that working with others is sometimes more efficient, but there are also a lot of risks he or she might encounter.

Finally, it is always important for everyone of us to have our own set of ideas and concepts towards this great universe; we need to try to come up with our own thinking system and develop our unique ways to examine different facts. We learn from others' ideas and concepts; we examine these through our daily experience; we match them with facts to see if they are correct; and finally, we will develop our own way of thinking. There are the reasons which make me believe that both learning ideas and facts
