In my view, while one may say that people in general do not give enought time to help their communities, I do not think that young people do not help enought.
The first reason for my view is simply that I know many young people who care a lot. Some of them would help directly  their communities, by spending time with olders, or taking care of adults' children. Some others would even make bigger things to help people in the world. For example, I have a friend who left France last year, to work as a benevol to build a school in a certain country in Africa.
The second reason for my view is that we had never seen young people caring and participating this much before. In the last presidential election in France in 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen, who is known to have racists and seggregated opinions, reached the second phase of the election, the first group who demonstrated in the street to show its reluctance of seeing such a man becoming the president was a group of students and some teenagers from highschool. I believe this would have never happened before.
Finally, I think it is important to say that young people do not have always the possibility to show that they care. Indeed, young people do not win much money, if any at all. They are at an age where they have to give priority to theirs studies, or have just started a job which can be a very difficult period. Because of all this reasons, I think that even if some people think it is too low, the young people are helping communities largely enought.
To sum up, I believe that while it is sometimes difficult for young people to find the time and the money to help communities, they are caring enought, specially compared with the past. According to me, young people more and more understand that they are crucial actors of the community.
