      I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following reaons.
      First, I believe that the governments of many countries in the world are recently beginning to restrict the use of cars because of their several serious problems.  For example, cars emit carbon monoxide when they burn gasoline, which is poisonous to people, animals and plants.  In addition, cars also emit caron dioxide which is responsible for the greenhouse effect.
      Second, the governments also restrict the use of vehicles due to fear to depletion of natural resources, especially petroleum.  That valuable natural resource is necessary for vehicles to move -- i.e., to burn gasoline.  In addition, it is necessary to manufacture vehicles.  For example, the process of manufacturing cars needs high temperature which is given by petroleum.  Moreover, cars use plastics as parts thereof, and needless to say, plastics are produced from petroleum.
      In addition, according to medias and recent official reports by United Nations, the governments of many countries in the world are not only beginning to restrict the use of cars, but also trying to find alternative transportaions which do not have problems which cars have.  For example, in my nation, Japan, the govenment has been investing in the research for commercializing of the "linear motor car".  It moves by energy of magnetts, so that does not emit any poisonous gas.  Experts estimate that the linear motor car will be used more popurarly in 15 years.   
      Therefore, I agree the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in used than there are today for there reasons.
