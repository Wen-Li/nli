Most people think that enjoyment comes from experience, but in my opinion, when we first experience something we enjoy it more. There is a saying that a thing is attractive untill you get it, in other words, when you wish for something and do not get it easily, you are more keen to get it. After getting that thing, you loose your interest in it. This is the human nature. So the meaning is that younger people enjoy their life more than older, because they experience things for very first time. I also agree with this opinion that young persons enjoy life more than older people. 

To support my opinion, firstly, I would like to disscuss the tendency or the nature of youngers. First of all, they are very curious about new things. They want to explore everything regardless of danger associated with it.
For example, when I was a kid, I was always curious about parachute, and one day what happened, I just jumped from my roof top with an umbrella. At that time I did not know, what is fear. So meaning is that, you can not expect this kind of absurd behavior from an older person. Even, if an old  person does not know the harm associated with the task, he/she might not take risk.

Secondly, youth do not care for moral values, whereas old people do follow them strictly. From their experience of life, senior people know the value of ethics and would like to follow always.On the other hand, teenagers are unlikely to follow the moral values, or they follow reluctantly.

Thirdly, In my opinion, you can enjoy the life if you don't have restriction on you activities. Old people have resposibilities towards society, as well as towards their own family. While youngers are free to do whatever they want. For an instance, I like to dance publically,  and I do whenever I get chance to do it . But I know some older people can not do it because first they think about others opinion such as ,what would the society think, or what would be the impact on children.

Last but not the least, young people are always open to new ideas or cultures, while older people have narrow mind. It is easy for a younger to adapt a new culture in order to learn it . On the other hand, senior persons are rigid to their own culture in order to preserve it.

Conclusion is that, although it is true that older people enjoy life based on their own life time experiences, I strongly hold the view that youngers enjoy the life more than them. The main reasons are, will to explore new things, no responsibility, less regard for values or ethics, and more energy to enjoy life.
