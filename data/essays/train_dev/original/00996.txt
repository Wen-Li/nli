	For a centuries, there are many inventions that change our life a lot. One of those inventions is automobile that we use almost everday. Some people consider that car use might decrease little by little, and I agree with this idea. These days, many people, including me, worry about that population might reduce in the future, and because of that, car use might decrease, too. Also, thanks to developing technology, public transportaiton becomes much more convenient now, so this could be one of reasons that people use car less in the future.
	Nowadays, many people concern that population might decrease in the future. According to investigation, population rate is focused in elder class people. One of reasons is developed medical technology. Moreover, more women go out to work, recently, they usually refuse to have baby because they will not be able to avoid to quit their work. Because of that, in the future, there might be less population in the world, and car use might be down, too.
	As technology develop, public transportation is now much more convenient than when it began. In Korea, there is almost no facilities, such as elevator to support injured people like Japan. However, this year, when I went there, there are many elevators to support those people. Now, still there are many cars in the street, but people might use more public transportation in the future because it is pretty cheap despite of convenience.
	As I mentioned, in the future, less people use cars. Of course, still many people use their own car because it is convenient, too. However, less population helps to be down less use of car, and more people will use public transportation, which become more convenient.
