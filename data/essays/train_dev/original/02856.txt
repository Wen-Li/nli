I agree that it is better to have broad knowlenge or many academic subject because this give you that experienres to talk with deferent types of people also can be help you in looking for a good job. 
	One of the good thing about having a good broad knowlenge is that you have the change to talk with different types of people.  Knowing or having expirence or be specialize different topic gives you the possibility of talk and dicusts with different people of different knowlenge and ideas. A good example can be you are in one convesion about Organic Chemestry adn you know about this topic you can ask question or get in to the big diccution with the other specialist on the case.  This will give a good impresion to the other poeple and make more friend or nowing more. 
	Another that is good to have a broad knowledge is that you can get a very good and well pay job.  Today in our society big institucion and companies are looking for people who are very smart or have good undertending of something.  If you can have good understanding and know what that things that good company ask you to do you can have a very good fundametal job.  For example, today is really exencial to use a computer.  Well, if you now who to work the computer and who to work many programs in the computer you can have  a good pay job and secury. 
	Today is really good to know about different topic or different issues because this new society is changing really quit.  To have broad knolenge in htis new sociaty can help a lot to survive or even to have got undertanting in what all this new vocabulary is about becaue many people who study only what thing can sometime they do not nothing about other topic.
