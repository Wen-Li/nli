This is a very important issue with respect to the community and the youngsters who are part of this community. The issue which does need the attention and analysis. Although it is not that whole young crowd has become indifferent to helping the communities but i certainly believe that looking upon it wholly, the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping the communities.
There are several reasons for my acceptance of the statement and i would like to state them in the following paragraphs.

The main reason i feel this is because todays youngsters have become too narcissists. They are all self-centered and bothered about their personal progress. This is due to the ever increasing competitiveness. In this competitive world, to catch up with the pace each youngster is busy polishing himself/herself for the contend. And in this course he remisses the community. He is too worried about his own progress and achievements to look into the community matters. Each of them wants to be the best and they dont want to afford wasting time on others.

The other reason which makes me accept the statement is the prevalence of the corruption, violence, robbery, murder etc and whole lot of crimes taking place. If the youngsters gave enough time to the well being of the community, would n`t be the scenario different? All those murderers, robbers, rapists constitute of whom? Aren`t the major chunk of them the youths of the community. Instead of being helpful to their community they are becoming the cause of all sorts of sufferings and traumas to the community, i must say.

Further, i feel that youngsters are not contributing to help the community because they are getting away from moral values and disciplines of the society. Todays youngster want to be more independent and does not want to be taught all those lessons of helping others. What he learns from the todays growing technological world is how to make himself modernize and how to cope up with rest of the competitors. Admist this, he does not cares for the community. For example, today most of the young people spend half of their time on internet. Now, by exploiting internet what are the possibilities of them using it for other`s sake or to help someone compared to the possibilities of chatting, browsing, looking for job opportunities, searching for institutes for further education etc. Certainly, the probablities of utilizing it for personal benefits is quite higher. 

All these reasons and examples make me accept the statement that nowadays, youngsters are not much interested and hence not devoting much time to help the community. This can be attributed to their ignorance about the well being of others and zeal for personal holistic development.
