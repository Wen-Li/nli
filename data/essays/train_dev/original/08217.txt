When I was 16 years old I traveled with my mother all around Europe. She paid to a travel agency to have a guide in our trip. That adventure was amazing!if I would have the chance to experiment the same situation, I would not have second thoghts about paying a tour guide again. So I am completely agree with the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide.
First of all, I am agree with paying someone to show me around because it is the best way to visit everything in a city, in which I do not know anything about it. Furthermore, this guide can show me the history, the monuments, the anegdotes, traditional restaurants and places to party, and all of these for the same price! For instance, in the trip that I mencionated at the begining, the one that I did with my mother, this guide showed us every single place of France; actually my mother went by her self three years before we did and thank this guide she learnt new more things about Paris.
Second of all, If I travel with a guide tour I am going to be save because this person supposes to know the right ways at the best times to visit the city so I do not have to worry about which rout should I take to not surprise my self with any problem.
To summarize I prefer to travel with a tour guide because I think that it is the best way to learn things about a new place. In addition, a person is better than a book, because any question you have she or he can answer it at the moment and also the personal experiences of a tour guide are more interesting that the onces that you can find in a book.
