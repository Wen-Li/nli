                                 The big exchange

through the huge use of planes now adays I start to feel that the cars will be history.

in spite of the large number of cars, the planes numbers in growing.
since the first flight over the ocian people began to love the plane speed and to save times in travels.

in planes the people don't get tired of driving or even make an accedent which usually found in cars.

also planes can transport a large quantity of things and in no time,and that we really miss in cars.

and the big reason that in the air there are no traffic jams (at least until now).

all of the reasons above will make the people think of travel in planes, or even own thier private plane which is ussually smaller then the ordinary planes .

with all these benefits,the people still feeling worried about traveling in plans instead of cars.Since 11/9 people began to think of the worst thing can happen to them which is kidnapping,but this feeling begins to be history in now adays.

the planes accedents are much smaller in number than accedents with cars which make the people feeling comfortable.

I thing in 20 years the airports will be more and more the planes on the other hand will develop and  pilots schools will be opened to ordinary peoples.many shapes and models of planes will appear,many companies will exchange thier prouduction of ars into planes for example: i think we will see a nice GMC plane or even a toyota plane ....
there will be also small airfield near almost every street.

the use of car will be like riding horses now !
and the most exiting thing is to have your own plane, airport and passengers.

there will be a taxi planes

and that what i call it :
