I  do agree with the statement,and i would substaniate my stance in the succeeding paragraphs.Primarily the rate at which environment is getting polluted its tough to imagine people having an oppurtunity in using an automobile leave alone a car.Ofcourse many eminent people and reformers have joined forces to save environment from pollution it can be jus regarded as a beginning. or a rennaissance in twenty first century going by the no of dramatic reforms,protests going on inorder to save "MOTHER EARTH"

  Basically in  day-to-day activities in the modern day scenario a vehicle has become a basic amenity.By vehicle i meant a car because on an average every 2 people to 8 people use a car in developed,developing nations.A car was a necessity earlier or a mark of an  aristocrat or his associate.But these days it has become the order of the day to use a plush car even tough thier's no impending need for it.Going by the designs that are introduced in the market "at the drop of a hat" by  the manufacturers in many  nations its indeed tough to imagine a pollution free environment. They are reaping rich profits and soaring unparalleled heights as far as their bank balance is concerned.

I do not mean that pollution is caused only by uncontrolled  vehicle usage,but this  definetly plays  the most significant role in contributing to enivronmetal degradation.It was given  in an article of 'National Geographic channel's magazine' regarding the hazardous effects of the increase in the no of cars in this century and their subsequent contribution to the degradation cycle.And uts astonishing to note down that a staggering 42 percent  of pollution is contributed by vehicular pollution.So in the wake of so many facts coming to light and few developed nations,superpowers like China amending laws to protect the environment and more importantly making their citizens abide by the laws it just might be a tough going for car manufacturers in the future.Actually people do not use vehicles in venice which is supposed to be the pollution free state in the world

But there's a possibility of some one coming out with a break through like say an eco friendly car,probably we might to turn to that car.Goin by the theory of uncertainity its highly unlikely that cars can be operated with same regularity in future owing to laws of nature,demanding circumstances like environmental degradation and spread of various health hazards there's a bleak future for various car manufacturers who have earned money tht'l cushion future generations.I feel that there's an urgent need to address the problems of pollution,health hazards resulting from the harmful gases an automobile may emanate.As they say 
"PREVENTION IS ALWAYS BETTER THEN CURE".we should take note of these problems and strive o find a fitting solution to the already dilapidated environment
