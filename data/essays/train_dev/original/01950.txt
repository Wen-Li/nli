I disagree with the statement that today, Young people are becoming reluctant in helping their communities. I agree that these days, youngsters have started staying aloof, and they have begun to increasingly value their privacy, but this does not mean that they are showing indifference to their communities. 

First of all, i believe that it is very important to have faith in the community which the individual has to adhere to, and make contributions to. If a person is fully convinced about the ideals and goals of the community, then he would show full support and cooperation to it. 

Recently, i heard a news that a former student of my college was suffering from brain cancer. As soon as this news hit the campus, many student bodies became actively involved in collection funds to succor the patient. Thus, the young students showed great enthusiasm inorder to further a cause which they believed strongly.

Also, in my country, many political parties have special divisions called " Yuva Shakti" which are entirely comprised of youth, and which have come into existence only exploit the strength which rests in the young generation. These young men actively support the party principles, and do their every bit to publicise their ideals and objectives. They spend their precious time and effort, to help their community.

Many youth also associate themselves with non profit organizations, in order to help the poor people to get acess to various facilities. For Example, i am a member of a community which aims at increasing awareness among unpriveleged and uneducated people about diseases, their prevention and symptoms etc. We go from village to village in order to spread this valuable information. In the last few years, that i have been a part of this organisation, i have seen a great increase in the number of youngsters willing to join hands for this cause.

There are numerous other instances in which youngsters have been promising, in showing support to the communities they are affiliated to, and so, i believe that they are standing up to the expectations of the society and are still fulfilling their responsibilities very well.
