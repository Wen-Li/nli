Many students at some point of their lives wonder if they should choose a specialization in their studies or if they should go into a general university to choose classes in many different fields. I think both can be good, but everything depends on what you want to do.
First of all, I believe that it is important that students don't specilize too early. In high schools for instance, it is important that students learn about many different fields before being allowed to choose which major they want to study. It can thus make students discover fields of knowledge they didn't know before, but some fields that can also attract them a lot.
Besides, I think that choosing to specialize or not depends on what kind of job you want to do later. Some jobs requiere good knowledge in many academic fields. This is for instance the case of journalism. Some of the journalists do decide to specialize, but the majority are able to write about every topics, whether it concerns a pension reform or a football match.
On a personal point of view, this attitude - to make the choice of not choosing a specialization - can be very interesting. Somebody who decides not to choose a major field of interests will be interested in much more numerous things than somebody only interested in history or philosophy.  
But I also think that there is a danger for people knowing lots of things, in many fields. The society also needs specialists who deeply know some aspects of the society. For instance, teaching biology requires to be a specialist in biology. And it is the same for all the teachers. In some countries, teachers are teaching two subjects, but I think it is not such a good idea since they can't know very well two fields of knowledge.
To conclude, we can say that societies need both - specialists and people that stay in general knowledge. But personaly, I like having learnt many different subjects before specializing myself. Thanks to this, I discovered what was biology, physics and many other fields that I would not have discovered without my high school classes.
