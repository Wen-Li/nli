I disagree with that article. It is imagine that there is some subject what i have to solve, i have to explain with several reason of supporting detail. And those reason are help the explaining. For instance, i would like to deal with microwave. First, i should judge about the subject.  i should have gradually motion if iwant to use the microwave. So i can think about motion how can i use the microwave. Also, i have to deal with specific step. when i make the solution, i have to explain hte way more easily. For example, first step is what to do, second step is what to do...ect
Inconclusion, All these reason are appear that the one specialize specific subject are good. So it is better  to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects
