How would you react if an adult tells you that he was more happy when he was a child?Does it mean that becoming an adult, dissipate happiness and good times? According to my own experience , i think that people were getting happier when they were children.They just live how there mind guide them trough without thinking about consequences.

Firstly ,I think that young people are happier than adults because they do not care about anything materials.They live their life without thinking about the consequences.Indeed, everything they wanted to do is possible, so they just have to realise what their hearts tell them to do.People are used to say that mankind are lead by money and interest,contrary to children who are only guide trough life by happiness and pleasure.For example a young boy does not care about what his mum is doing.But her mum must take care of her baby,and she has to safe ihim and protect him from dangers.

we can also say that young people are in good heealth that able them to live their life without money problems, job problems and more....They spend most of their time playing with their friends without being disturbing.

According to my own experience , i can say that being a child is the best period of your life.You do not have to care about anything than just playing outside.You are not stress by your destiny and by the world around you.But saying that adults do not enjoy their life is wrong but it is a question of priority, yopu hqve less think to count of.
