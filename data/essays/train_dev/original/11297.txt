The definition of enjoyment, the very feeling that brings you joy and happiness may defer from one individual to another. Even though most people enjoy their life in their own way i agree with the claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do.
There are various reasons for the opinion i share.
Firstly yound people are  much more healthier and energetic in contrast to older people. A lot of activities that an individual may enjoy require physical energy.This physical energy  diminishes with age in most people. They have to worry about their health at all times since it deterioates with age. They might have a particular activity that the enjoy but it may be restricted due to different reasons. For example an older person who enjoys listening to good music may have a problem with his hearing due to age. Such people are highly dependent on medication which has its share of side effects of drowsiness etc. On the contrary, young people have all the energy in the world to enjoy. They do not get tired easily. They are very enthusiastic and  in the best of health at most times. Their lifestyle is at a faster pace as compared to the older generation.
Youngsters can indulge in adventure sports, travelling, partying, eating and drinking without any restrictions which would be troublesome for the aged.
Seconly young people are far more independent than older people.
They are not dependent on somebody to take care of them. Nor are they dependent to ask someone to drive them to somplace. 
Moreover the older generation spend a lot of time on worriying about trival issues and  restrict themselves experimenting. They are more orthodox in comparison to the younger generation and consider a lot of thing that youngsters refer to as enjoyment as taboo. The older generation by far has more value for money and they believe it in saving it for a later day. Youngsters on the other hand may use up that money for luxury, or for a pleasure activity that will assure him a feeling of fun and happiness.
I conclude the essay by restating my opinion that young people enjoy more in life, and i'm sure most older people would also claim to having enjoyed more in their youth.
