It depends on the situation, but there are a lot of situations that people should learn facts not just understand them. There are two examples that support may opinion.
 One situation is when you play soccer. How well you study soccer rules or techniques, you can't play it very well because you need experience of real games. Many pro soccer player especially from Brazil played soccer without reading text books in their childhood. They just played soccer for fun. Many of them didn't study phycics around the boll.  
 The other is when you drive a car. In my case, I studied about car engineering for one month and I thougt I had enough knowlegde of car. However, when I drove a car first time, I coudn't drive it well. I think that to understand idea is not enough.   
 So the most important thing is to learn something by using their bodies not only using brains. Indeed there are some cases that you need to understand ideas and concepts, but you can get that kind of knowledge when you learn it.
