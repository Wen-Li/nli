I think that successful people try new things and take risks is a good working to do. I will write about reason why. I will give some experience.
   in my case when i was young, I can't to do everything. my parent help to me everything. But when I growing up, I want to try something to do. because I have wonderring that problem. So I had to do. I found that problem. I mean that I solutuion problem by myself. also my father is samething. my father have been failed business, but he doesn't  forgiven. He was tried other things, keep going work. finally he succesed his business. I want to say don't forgive, keep trying to work. 
   I will write another story. eveybody know about Tomas Edison. when he was childhood, everybody said ," stupid,foolish". also his parent worry about him. someday bring an eggs. He said," i can do chichen mom, comes baby". He was kept to wonder something, and try to do. eventually, He successed his work. we know about light. he was discovered by himself. Anybody can try to do  or don't scared new things. 
    In conclution, I think that successful people has exactly reason. Thoes things are that they are not scare new thing and take risk. keep try to experience and challenge. we need to learn about their life or life style.
