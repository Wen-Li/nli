Today, many advertisements are making much products. And they are making profits more than what they suppose to have. And there is couple reason for it.
	First reason is, most advertisements has some kinds of bubble. The bubble what am I talking about is, the bubble which make advertisements look more fency and more valuable. For example, they are entertaining themselves so they can show their appearance to people so they can make people think those advertisements are really good and support those advertisements. Another example is, they are using the commer show. Many people are spending time for watch the commer shows when they are watcing the television. And most advertisements are using commer show and entertaintment. So,  most advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are.
	Second, they are helping each other and make more profits by information or some of helping. And they are entertaining each other to the other people who do not know about those advertisements really much. So they got more people and they get more profit and products more than what they suppose to have.
	Many advertisements are making products much better than what they suppose to make. However, I think it is one of the skill for them. And advertisements are one of member for cycle of economy. So, I think those are not that bad except some of the other things that so many bubbles.
