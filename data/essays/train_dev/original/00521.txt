I disagree.I have three opinion to support this reason. First is the way to travel with a group led by a tour guide is not free to active.they made me unhappy to put me just one couse where we have to go and even scasuling when we should go there. In everywhere ,maybe we could find impresst on the specific place, but i can not stay more the place such a hard scasule or with the group.  
Second is it seems inexpensive on the surfece,but they let me spend mony little by little, as adittional praice. if i traveld alone, prohaps i can more economicaly to staty the city in oder to make fraiends. 
Threrdly,We can not to make many local friends in the trip, if i led a such group. if traveled up to alone ,i can more closs to the local tradison.
therefore, i disagree the way that led by a tour guide.
