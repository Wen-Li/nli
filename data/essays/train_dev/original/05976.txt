In my opinion, young and older people enjoy life equally but in different ways. Being young or older have advantages but also disadvantages. 
	First of all, when you are young, you do not have the same pleasures as you are old. On one hand, when you are young, you enjoy your life at the current moment.  Indeed, during your studies, you prefer to go out with friends, to do sport, to discover new things by travelling... However, on the other hand, when you are older you enjoy different things of the life. Indeed, you want to get married, to have children, to buy a nice house, to go on hollidays with all your family, to succeed at work... 
	Secondly, responsabilities of a student are totally different comparing to an older person. Indeed, as a student, you do not have many reponsabilities because most of cases, you do not have a child to take care of and you depend a little bit of your parents who help you financially. The main responsability of a student is to have good marks and to succeed in his studies. When you are older, you have much more responsabilities. If you have a family you have to take care of by working, buying food, paying bills... Having responsabilities as an adult enable them maybe to enjoy less life. However, having reponsabilities can be a good thing for some adults because thus they think they are usefull .
	Finally, young people can enjoy less life than older people do because they generally have less money. If you are a student, it is more difficult for you to go on hollidays or to go regularly to the cinema. In most of cases, students have to work and go to the university at the same time in order to pay their distractions and their university. Contrary, older people does not have to work and study at the same time and generally they have a better salary.   
To conclude, when you are a student or when you are an adult, you enjoy life differently because their situation of the life is different
