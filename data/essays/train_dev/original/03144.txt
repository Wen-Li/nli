The author says that young people enjoy life more than older people do.
        Yes i will agree to these statement because older people came from younger generation only, hence it is possible to agree the statement.
                  Firstly , young people will enjoy more than older people because from the early age of the born baby  he dont know about life after some years child will go to school which is institution and from there he knows some things and after when he will become to a certain position h e will be enjoying  with his friends and as well as they will be close to each other aswell as they help each other and it is important for every person.

                                              Hence it is must because when he will be in problem  friends will only help some times parents will not do that  time and hence it happens when it is true friend ship . when there will be any occasions all the friends will meet they will enjoy with party and all will celebrate and enjoy and that is the age to  enjoy the life and do whatever he wants because the past never comes and such a way that all should enjoy.
                                      Whenever there is a holiday people will go to cinema that it will be full entertainment as well as games like cricket all will play if they  have holidays it is nice and interesting game and going to picture with friends is a nice enjoyment , all will be happy at that movement,and they will dance in theatres and it is a nice enjoyment and hence  in every festival all the friends will meet and they will spend there day at that place .
                                                While in a college there will be a competitions , sports,entertainment  and we can participate and enjoy  and we can go to tours with college or with  our own way for a week  there fore we can enjoy the climate in the same while enjoying we should also study .
                                  While exam date will come near we should  preapare for exams and also we should prepare well for the exams if we dont know any thing our friends will be helpful in such a way that we can write exams succesfully.
                                                    Whereas older people cannot do this which means while come to an older age they should not eat every item and they should take medicine daily it is a problem   and also for them there will be tensions and they will be in hurry in each field .hence atlast i says that older people also come from younger age and they also enjoyed, but it is fact every person should enjoy his life in a successful way.
