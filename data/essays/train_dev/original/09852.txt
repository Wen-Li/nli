The density of cars in the world is increasing dramatically each year. As far as I know, there are no reasons to think that this tendency is going to change in the next twenty years. Specially, if we have in consideration different factors such as: the  economic growth of countries like China or India that will allow its population to buy more cars, the general reduction of car prices (specially  due to competition existing betwen american and asian manufacturers) or the quality of the existing cars (that will allow its use during a longer period). Finally, we can't ignore the fact that more infrastructures are being built all around the world in order to absorve the expected increase of the number of cars.

Althoug it is true that the number cars existing in western markests will increase softly, the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) are undeveloped markets, where the number of cars will increase dramatically. 

On the other hand, prices of the cars are being reduced because of the tremendous effort done by American and Asian producers in order to lead the world market.

All the above supported by the effort done by all the governments on building new and faster higways.

In conclusion, for the above mentioned reasons, the number of cars existing in the world will be increase in the next generations, despite environmental an oil problems.

it uilt in order to absorve an important increase in the number of cars  provide better hicars will be safer, more economic and more population
