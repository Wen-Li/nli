In the  everchaging world new products are devloped and with new features that customers demand that their products should accomplish and due to increase in the companies  and their produts  each one want to increse their share and want to dominate the market, advertisements seem to play key role in sale of the  product

                   I agree with the fact  that the advertisements make products  seem better that actually they are . In order to trap the customers the comapny show the produts in a great manner they give great publicity and employ celebrities in publicing them ultimatly  when customer  buys the product and then what happens?
         the customer feels cheated and he  becomes red on the comapny for  example ,it was  told buy a company  in the part of their publicity stunt  to have an upper hand over thier commpetiotors they have  produced a bike that would give a mailage of 120km /liter of petrol to attract the customers they have hidden the truth that they have overstated the  mileage many of the customers bought the the bike they practically  experince it by riddng the bike what they have felt that that the product is  under perfoming, they went to the comapny and asked for the fact but the comapny officials seemed that they responce was not upto the mark what the customers expected the went to the customer court and thay got their money back .
         In the above stated example the case gives a vey good lime light into the topic,that is right  that the comapny lost lot of money in paying thier money and in insted it got a bad fame and any person   doesnt even think having  that  comapnys product
                    The comany feel that publicity is every thing , they think that seeing is beliving , they are in that   vision  and  advertise hugely on the qualities and standards that the product doesent accomplish , but in reality seeing is not everythging we might belive , usually we should not belive in every thing we see. 
          comanys should be transparent and shoul advertise what the product does really have in order to have long term good relatiopn with the customer and maintining a good name of the company .
