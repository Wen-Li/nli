The statement contents that in twenty years the number of cars in use will decline. I do not agree with the claim. According to me, the number of cars will continue to increase thouh there might be a change in the technology which they use.

As the population continues to grow, so are the needs. And, car is emerging as a basic need of the world today. Technological advances have made the dream of a common man, to own a personal car, true. The rates of the car have never been so low, and this sharp decline of prices will continue as the technology progresses. This would further encourage their sale in the near future, as more and more people will be able to afford one.

In earlier times, cars were meant only for the main member of the family, the earning heads. While today, even children and other family members use cars for their personal needs. 

Moreover, nowadays, the two-seater sedans are in vogue. This means that if a family of four members use a single car today, they may go on to use two 2-seaters in future. 

Futhermore, the other modes of conveyance like the buses or the three wheelers generally cause more pollution than that generated by the cars. Nowadays, cars have been manufactured which use electricity or solar energy to run. The availibility of such cars at affordable prices will help, to some extent, check the, so called, never-ending pollution problem, and hence will be supported by the government of any nation.

However, the increase in the number of cars will accelerate the problem of traffic.

Thus, I strongly feel that in future, the number of cars being used will continue to rise and so will the problem of traffic, but with a decline in the pollution.
