"Life is just one, and we have to substract from it all as we can", I mentioned and used that phrase all my life. Since I was a kid, I understood that I have goals, the ones that made me work and continue through school and college.  I experienced a lot of things, which made me the man I am today. I took risks during that time, like moving from my town to get a better education, but at the same time I continue with the same goals and doing what I did best, maths and sciences.
	I understand that people do both, they take risks, while they do what they know how to do well. For example, a story about a guy that knows how to sell TV's to people. After doing that for a long-time period for a "X" company, he realized that he could do that kind of job with his own company, and he quit the job.  Then he started his own company named with his son's name. Thats was the huge risk he took but he understood that people like him had choices, and that he will be success because he knows how to do the job.
	With that story, an integrationg of risks and experiences can be observed.  He do know where he is good at, and he use that to try new things. My experience tell me, that I should integrate both, while they are acceptable.  My life is made about experiences, and each day I take risks to keep living.
	Overall, I do not agree with the statement "Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well". People are the owners of your actions, and the success will depend on it.  A person can be success by just doing what they know how to do, or by trying new things, which will take them again to the point of doing what they know how to do.
	I know that my future is around scieces, but I do know that I have to take risks to achieve my proffesional goal, be a Meteorologist.  I have to move from my home-country, knowing that is for my own good. Thats the bigest risk I will experience next year, while at the same time I know how to talk to people, make new friends, and take the best from every opportunities I encounter.  Success is around the courner and should experience it with new things or by just doing what they do best.
