I strongly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Whether the advertisement one sees is through a television or a magazine, this particular individual is bound to receive some sort of effect upon the immediate exposure. This exposure can be explained in two interesting ways. One is explained via visual effect and the other is through the means of incorporating one's psychological effect. 

As we all know, in order to advertise a certain product, excessive visual luring is to be expected from the viewers. The makers of these advertisements will try in every conceivable way to present their products at its finest. This is where the visual effect comes in. There will be many trial and error and thorough, various steps will also be required in order to complete one final advertisement before they are presented in the buyers' eyes. When that item is then advertised, the viewers will  inevitably  be tricked and allusioned to see beyond the actual practicality and state of that particular item. 

The second effect, the psychological one derives from the audience's point of view. Sometimes the products being advertised in the media just looks nice, glamorous and even useful simply because they are unattainable.  At times that particular item may be too costly that it is one's out of budget. This explains our natural human instinct to need and want what we cannot have. Therefore, the hope to be able to possess a certain product - perhaps in the near future or never at all - will push your desire to purchse that product even more. Hence, when a buyer does not conveniently have the item at hand while seeing the advertisement, it is only natural to make that particular item  seem much better than they really are.

To conclude, the reasons whether they are external or internal, bring the same result to the viewers of these advertisement. They are not necessarily good or bad but the need to control one's perception is important in deciding if that reason is valid. The viewers, the buyers must therefore reason and fight for what is real and what is not. Sometime it is simply our mind that tricks us into buying. This is when you realize you've made the wrong decision.
