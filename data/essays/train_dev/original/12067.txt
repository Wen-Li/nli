Someone think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to sprcialize in one specific subject. In my opinion, But  I disagree it. I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject. To have broad knowledge of many academic will cause many negetive results.

firstly, if you want to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, you must spend much more time to work hard. You will hvat to give up many other important things. You will not have enough time to play sports and your health will be worse. Otherwise, you will not have enough time to communicate with your family and friends. You will fell lonely after a long period. 

Secondly, even you have spend so many time to work hard and you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects finally. But probably, you only know some common informations of many academic subjedts and are not good at one special subject. For example, a physician  who know many knowledge of history, computer, plants and so on. He must have not enough time to study his medical knowledge, so he will not a good physician. Otherwise, if everyone all have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. In the result, they can do all kinds of job but they can not do them very well.

In a conclusion, I think people should have special knowledge in one specific subject and review broad knowledge of many academic subjects but not spend too much time on them. Because broad knowledge can give you more idea of your special subject.
