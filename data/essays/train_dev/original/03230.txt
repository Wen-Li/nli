People do not always reach success by trying new things and taking risks, even though sometimes it is necessary. If someone has the formula for success, whether he/she found it or is given by the environment, he/she should not change it unless wanting or pushed to do so. 
	Carlo Ancelotti, coach of AC Milan, an italian soccer team that has won several tournament and awards under his guide, declared on the day before the final of the Champions League "a team that wins never changes (set up)." The next day, using the same players as the previous game, AC Milan won the Champions League, the most prestigious tournament in soccer. Just like Carlo Ancelotti suggested, something successful should often remain uncorrupted to succeed again. 
	Not everyone, though, already has this oppurtinity in his/her life. This is the case when a person should shold try new things and take risks. For instance, considering a large and profitable factory, the son of the boss will not have trouble in order to reach working success (considering this is the kind of success he is looking for) as his eritage includes a business already started and well run, but one of the workers in the factory has great manual skills, but in the factory he does not gain much profit and does not fully use the resources he has. If he never took a risk and never tried anything new, he would always work in the same factory and hardly reach success. Instead, if he decided to start his own activity, taking the risks that such a choice bring, he would have a much larger chance to succeed. 
	Nevertheless, looking at the society in a bigger scale, risks might be necessary to succeed and develop. In fact there is one important factor to consider: competition. The pushing force for many people is often other candidates, who try to reach success by doing something innovative. Unfortnately, there are times where the success of one is the unsuccess of others. This cycle infact is infinite. The positive aspect of this situation is that the society will always offer newer and more innovative things.
	Therefore success is not always found by doing something new and taking risks, bet there are times where the situation requires it.
