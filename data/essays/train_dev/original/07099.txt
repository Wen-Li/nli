Advertisements are very effective way to create convincing thoughts about something. Every research about advertisements or advertised products indicated that advertisemments has power to manipulate the people's thoughts regarding products.

	In our Tv or Show Business times, many celebreties or popular people have been created by our Media, and it should be acceptted that we love this popular people and grant importance their ideas. So  the  company use  and benefits from this situation.

	Secondly, Advertisements introduces the products withhout presting their pejorative sepeciliaties. For instance if  buy the microwave oven, you cannot nuke something it near the baby or radition sensitive people. But it is impoosible to see any warning regarding microwave radition in the advertisements.

Sellers and companies use celebries in order to affect people and they avoid to state the negative realities about product.
