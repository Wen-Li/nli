My opinion about the having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better tahn the speciallizing i one specific subject is that broad knowledge is much better for our study than the one specific subject, which reasons include that broad knowledge could open our horizen about the whole study and we could have wider rangesfor us to choose our majors through studying broad knowledge.

In morden time, many jobs need various knowlege because the matters require complete abilities and broad knowledge which contents many academic sujects, such as math, physics and chemsitry could provide a broader knowledge for us which one specific subject could not. For example, If we are a lawyer, we not only use the knowledge about the law, we still need the knowledge about the ecnormy and humannity. We would benifity from broader knowlwdge in our work. It provides us more information when we should solve a problem.

Furthermore, we would choose our major from what we learned in the school and studying broad subjects widern the range for us to choose. What I meet now is that which major I should choose. Though I have already studied some subjects, I still do not figure out which major suits me best. This is an important aspect because I should use the knowlege about my major after graduation and I would earn money by working this field. If I choose the wrong major because of lacking interests and  unabble to study, I could not rasies myself in the future. Broad knowledge makes me confortable to chosse the one I like best and study my major well.

To sum up,though one specific subject is a skill for cerntain people to use like painte, I still draw the conclution that broad knowledge is better than one specific subject.

Time to sleep, bye.
