Many people prefer to take a trip alone without tour guide. They say that they do like it because they want to avoid people, planned moving and take a break with self-time. Although it is suitable reaons, traveling in a group with a tour guide has many advantages that deserves we should do it. Not only group touring can reduce danger in abborad nations, but also it is really convinient and make us visit essential points.

	First of all, group touring with tour guide includes less danger of tripping foreign countries than tripping alone. Since people are not familiar with foreign nations, there are much danger of frauding or any accidents. For example, many Koreans are frauded by foriegners during East Asia trip. It includes muders, robbing and so on. Moreover if there are accidents in foreign countries, people usually embrassed so they cannot do properly. However, since guides are usually people of that country, they well know about country's conditions and situations so dangers decrease much.

	Next, group touing is really comfortable and help us to see essential places. Since tour companies already make plans and reservate completely, people can enjoy journey with only following schedules. For instance, It is needless to say that there are no danger to lack of hotel rooms because companies already booked them. Moreover, as stated above, guides knows well about that country, so he can bring us to most famous and beautiful places. 

	As I mentioned above, group tour led by a tour guide has many advantages. It contains less dangers because we doing group and led by tour guide. Also, it is convinient since companies already make a schedule about trip, only we should do it is following plans. Therefore I agree with that the statement, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.
