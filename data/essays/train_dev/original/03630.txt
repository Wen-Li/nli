It has been an argument  regarding with the issue that, the best
way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.
Some people prefer to travel alone.Because they don't need to adjust their time for the other people and they can decide everything by themselves. However, on my perspective, I think it is better to travel by a group led by a tour guide rather than traveling alone.

First, If we travel to the place that we are not familiare,
everything is so srange. So in this case we need somewone who are well known about the place, like a tour guide. It is certain that tour guide is an expert of the travel place, He or she will make a great scedule and adjust the time.The only thing that we have to do is following  the schedule. I think It is convinient and we don't need to waste the time.

Second, we can have more great experience with the group of people. People can  exchange theire own opinion and also they can
take a remarkable picture together.
They can also enjoy more pleasure time rather than feeling alon.
As people are living the social sociaty, travelling by a group could help to develope theire relationship 

Finally, because of two reason, I think better and efficient way to travel is tarvelling in a group of people together led by a tour guide.
