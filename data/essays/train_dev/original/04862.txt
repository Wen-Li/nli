Nowadays there is a discussion about the youngsters.It is that recently, do young people give enough time to helping their comunities?In my opinion, young people do not give enough time to helping to their communities, as it was at past.At our time, there are lots of things that youngsters can waste their time with.
 Firstly, most of the young people are wasting time with computers.Computers were made for people's goods at first but then it starts to become a toy or a game machine and no one tried to stop it,because games are a seriously large echonomic resource for the people working in this sector.For example,young people can try using computer and internet for searching for the informations about their country's place in the world and feature predictions about their country.Further more this interest would make the young people more interested in their communities.
 Secondly, I think that younng people are not taking the lessons at their schools so seriously.There are important lessons given to the student at school about their communities like history and geography.In my opinion, every person, related to a community , should know his country's history.Also geography is an important factor for a person to help his/her community.These are just two factors for a person to help his/her community that the educations of them are given at school.Moreover school gives the education of loving your country, after your family.These are all well known by people,but, however, still people are not taking seriously and thinking schools as gamefields.
 Young people are like diamonds.You should shape them, otherwise you can not expect anything from them.They have to be shaped,if they are wanted to be the savers of the community.So if a youngster doesn't give enough time to help his/her community,it is also his/her family's fault.
