I agree with the statement "successful people  try new things and take  risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well." In other words, successful people  are never give up when they have bad situation and big problmes. They are try to sovle the problmes. Also they has lots of passion and encoourage. They are try to acheive thier goal and dream. They are always looking for new thing and they are never take a rest. They are always running for their goal. Successful people are different from the another people. Maybe, thier envriomnet is not good from another people and situtaion is not good. They have to spend time to achieve their goal. They have to read and read the book and have  lots of knowledge. They can learn from another people's experiences. Another people's experience make them to try new thing beside the risk. Also another people's experience give new oppunity try new things. It is not easy to try to new thing becuase they have to adopt the situtation and have to conquer the problems. Therefore, successful people never give up the dangerous situation and spend time to acheive the thier dream and goal.
