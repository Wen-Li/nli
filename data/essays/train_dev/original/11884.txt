I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and takes risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

  For one example, when you think about business, a company has to make new products or explore new techiniqe to make difference from other companies. If the company can do this, it can apeal cutomer the difference of there producuts or sevices from other's and it can profit itself monopolicaly.

  For other example, when you think about a baseball team, every player shoud try new things, because we don't need same player so much. It makes no sence to have nine powerful hitter. It makes nosence to have fast runner. To consitute a strong team, the important point is the balance that can infer best outcome.So every player have to get skill that are diferrent from other's and new.

  For last example, if you are an investor, it makes no sence to invest like others. Iif you want to have an advantage, you hav to invest differently. Ofcause I have to admit  it is a risky action. You may get a loss sometime. So you have to recognize that there is a risk in investing differently from others. 

  From these reasons, I conclude that as long as recognizing the risk of an action, we have to try new things and teke risks.
