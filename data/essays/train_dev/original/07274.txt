I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

In my high school in California, lots of students form the small tutoring groups in order to help those students who have questio in perticular subjects or who live in pool families. They meet everyday after schools in the library, not only studying their homework but also helping other students. Yet there are some students who couldn't pay the money to the test-prep schools or the college-prep program in community college; those who formed the tutoring groups would answer almost all the question those helpless students have. I was one of those helpless students because I just arrived from foreign country; however, they helped me improving my English ability. Now I participate in the group and teach other students in Math and Chinese. As young people, I think my classmates and my friend all did a good job in helping the communities. I believe that there are other students groups in other schools that are doing the same job.

In summer time, most of my friends would participate to take care of the children or old people. Some of those children have no parents, some of them were abandoned. Once a time I participate in the service, I read stories to them. At first I was thinking of practicing my English reading ability; however, I cry after I went home because I feel I want to do more for them but I couldn't. I asked more of my friend to join this service, and we all learn different thing from it. One of my friend she had once participate in a service in a hospital. She talked to the old people,and then she read the books and newspapers to them. She told me that, participating in a community service was a really different expericence, and it would lead you to lear more about life, about helping other people but not asking the reward of it.
Young people do participate to help their community without speaking of it loudly; they chose to help the society silently. Once they join it, they would continue the service.
