Of course, students have to learn facts from teachers and memolize them. However, it is only a first step to proceed their study. They should spend most of time to figure out ideas and concepts. By doing this, they can acquire appication skills. Moreover, they can enjoy their studies.
     To begin with, they can get highly developed appication skills if they try to understand matters. You will agree with this idea: person who knows the nature of matter can perform well when he works on new problems, rather than person who only memolized surface of the matter. They can applicate their ideas if they know the matter deeply. Now, it is often said that Japanese lack the appication skill. We are ranked in a lower position when the research is out. In contrast, countries, like US, are ranked higly every time. We know the cause of this situation. The education of Japan higly emphasizes memolizing. We must take hard entrance examination when we enroll in high school and university. So, although we often memolize the facts, we seldom have opportunity to think the matter deeply. So, students can raise their appication skill by understanding the concept itself.
     Second, understanding the nature of problems is much more attractive for students. They can get pleasure when they find out the solution or they could understand the concept. Therefore, they can continue studying with joyful. We want to do what we like rather than dislike. It also helps raising their accademic skills. In contrast, in case of learing all things, they will stop studying. For me personally, I didn't like studying at all until I entered university. I could not find joy in studying because I had to memolize many facts. However, almost all studies in universities assign us to think by ourselves. Now, studying is not disconfort.
     Because of the application skills and joyment, I believe students should concentrate on understanding. They can raise their ability and become interested in studying more.
