SUCCESFUL PERSON
     I agree that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because they have creative, not hesitate personality, adn they don't afraid.
     People who try unique things and take risks can be creative because they are openmind and old things which are known are not enough for them, they are hungry new things. For example, in my country which still has been developing, a person started to sell a new kind mp3 player and he spent considerably huge money. While he was doing this, he took a risk because while he was doing it, there were many mp3 player and generally people do not want change their habbitant in my country. But he did not care it and he entered the almost evfery shops and people have started to buy this new kind of mp3 player and it has been common.
     However people who take risks do not hesitate because they have challenging personality. Do a person hesitate while make a decision, he cannot be succesful. Succesful person can make their decisions in every cicumstance. For example, my friend has a shop and it is almost 25 years old. There were a problem about economy in my country and many shop owners closed their shops because they could not stood agains it. Even though my friend suffered from it, he did not closed because he made some important decisions in this cicumstance, and he did not hesitate. Now, he is working in same place.
     Also succesful people do not afraid from anything such try to do new thing. Some owners afraid from doing new thing, they think that if I cannot sell it, I will lose my company. Even they who are company owner think like this, if they did it, they would earn more money and they would be big.
     In conclusion one who take risks and do unexample thing, he or she will be succesful.
