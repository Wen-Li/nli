I disagree with this statement. First, we can approuve this kind of opinions because we often heard about successful people whose success was a response to an new idea. For instance, people who develop the chain-work in the industry of automobile used to take a lot of risks. They didn't know if the demand was big enough to develop this kind of mass production, but they choose to take the risk and they were successful. That's why the statement we discuss is not totaly wrong, but I think that it's not true.
My point is that I think that trying new things and taking risks are two of the keys factors to be successful, but are not caracteristics of successful people. There are other factors to run well a business, like good opportunities. Sometimes, you have a real good opportunitie and you choose to try, and that's the key of your success. Moreover, there are a lot of successful people who had a good idea at the beginnig, but who don't take new risks for years. For instance, Bill Gates is a realy successful person, but he doesn't take risks nor than he tries new things. He had develop the most famous firm in computer engineering, but he didn't try to diversify his activities.
Moreover, a lot of successful people based their success in a very particular fields. They choose to become the best in what they do, and they don't want to change their image by trying new activities. So, they don't try new things, they don't take risks but they are successful because they know exactly how to do well what they do. This is exactly the opposite of the statement we have to discuss. And I don't think it's wrong.
To conclude, I think that there are not only one way to act when you are successful, and that's why it's really difficult to run a successful business. Every successful business manager is different, and take different decision than an other manager in a same situation.
