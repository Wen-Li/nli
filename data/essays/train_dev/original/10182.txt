Parents always say that you have to work very hard at your younger age, so as to enjoy your older age. I don't think that this is a valid deal cause I dont think that I will be able to enjoy more in my older days than when I am young. Cause at older age you would like to settle down in a calm village and enjoy the peaceful and pleasant climate rather than living in a crowded city, with lot of things happening around you and that interests you. 

At your younger age, you will have the energy to go around different places and view some of the beautiful creations in the world. But  when you become old, maybe your health will not allow you to do adventures. At your younger age, you have many things to enjoy because of less responsibilities and  more energy. At young age you can also have a great enjoyment with your romantic life too. Enjoying to the highest at your younger age and also working hard to get settled in the future is my moto of life. Normally people think that they will enjoy there life after they are old and they only work . But this can be harmfull if they dont get a chance to enjoy at thier older stage after so many years of hardwork. 

Normally youngsters do enjoy a lot by arranging disco parties and trips to different locations with friends. They get in touch with the latest technologies and gadgets like ipods, mobile phones, games  and many more. They do spend a luxurious life. Youngsters also enjoy sports and have a abilitiy to take part in it. 

So finally I can say that, young people enjoy more than older people with respect to health, responsibilties, technology and much more. So, I prefer enjoying my younger age and getting settled in my older age.
