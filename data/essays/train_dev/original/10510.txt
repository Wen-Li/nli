In our studies, we often have the choice between learning many academic subjects and specialize in one in particular. It can be quite a dillema. In my opinion, specializing, at least in the end of our studies, is more interresting. I will explain the advantage and disadvantage of each solution and explicit my feelings.

Broad knowledge of academic subjects is appealing at first. You don't have to make the choice between the themes you like, and learning from one can improve our understanding of another. For instance, learning the living of species in biology class can help in ecology class. Swithing between subjects often also help on not getting bored. On the contrary you don't have enough time to each class, and that can be really frustrating to learn only basics in the one you enjoy the most.

The other choice that is offered to us is specializing. The great thing about it is learning more and more information about a subject you like (or at least you should like) and getting more and more confident about it. Furtheremore you make less mistakes. The major drawback is when you need knowledge (even basic) on other academic subjects you don't have them, and probably don't have the time to learn them, and need to ask for help. This will result in a huge loss of time. An other negative aspect about specializing is that sometimes you are to much concentrate on your subject you can't see by yourself the mistake you are doing.

Finally, i prefer to specialize in a topic than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The main reason is that you can be good in a topic only if you practice often, and i don't mind asking for help if i need knowledge about another subject in order to fullfil my work. Moreover, in order to begin in profesional life you need to be good at least one thing.
