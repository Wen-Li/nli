Today is an era of compititons and  for surviving in this competitive age man has found various trends .Publicity is one of the trends man uses to increase the popularity of his products.So i m kind of disagree with the statement that "most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."
                 Now a days we get to see  big celebrities like tv  and film actors and  actresses and even sport persons  flashing every now and then on the television endorsing a product  or in a news papers..Pepole  may fall for these traps and can end up havin a product which is actually not worth of those huge amounts if not inspected properly .i cant deny the fact that ,sometimes in competing with the similar brands these advertisements do show some false  statements and just because people trust  these  brand ambassedors blindly , end up buying that product .so thats why i dont completely disagree with the above statement .
                   But at the same time in my opinion, viewer should see these advertisements vigilantly and  before buying them they shuld examine the product and check out the validity of the statements and claims made in those commercials.It is the duty of the customer  to keep in  mind that there are some agencies who overrate their own products to improve the sales.
                Also , in a country like india there is a governing body called "ISO" which checks the authenticity of products and after   series of close inspections give them the authority to be sold in the market.So with such authorities  lik" ISO"overrating a product and advertising  is not easily possible.
             Advertisemnts help the viewer to discriminate the good and bad qualities of the product by comparing it with other similar brands. It also creates awareness in the minds of customers about the newer and  technologically advanced products.
          So in conclusion, keeping in mind the advantages of advertising we cant make a generalised statement that products are made to seem better than they really are.It is as a "customer" our job to check the authenticity of such products.
