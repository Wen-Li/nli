It is age what make our lives, and that  is why it is so important to enjoy life. But it is not so easy as it sounds because there are different stages in our lives that come with different things we have to face. And that's why  I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. 
When people are jung there are three main aspects that make them enjoy more than when people are old.The first one is the responsabilities they have in their lives. When life is beginning people don't really have to worry about many things, they normally have their parents or someone that takes care about important aspects of life.  And if they have  to take responsabilities they have the energy to do it.For example, paying the bills, being responsable for the hause and many others things that need responsability and can cause stress. Another and very important aspect that shows that jung people enjoy more ist health. The jung people normally have no big problems with their health and body in general, they can move by themselves and are able to do things without any physical help. This is very important for us as human beings. The last point is the mentality, or also mental health. This Psycologic aspect also make the jung people enjoy more life because they normally think positively, have dreams, have things to accomplish in their future. And that is also something important, the jung people have expectations and so they can do things to get what they want of their lives, or at least try. 
For old people things are not just that easy. They have already been jung and made a lot of things.They have had a lot of responsabilities and now they are tired and need to rest and this aspect makes them have a negative attitude towards life and so they can not see other things to enjoy. At this time of their lives, they do not really have much more energy to continue with all this responsabilities. The second aspect and more important is the physical health. Normally when people reach the old stage of life, they have some kind of limitation that does not permit them enjoy as like when they were jung. Thisngs take more time to be done and maybe thay can not even do them. Finally the mental health, as said befor a positiv mentallity is very difficult to find.Things have changed and being old is not easy.That is why I say that jung people enjoy more than old people, because everything is easier and physically, mentally and in term of responsabilities it is better being jung, you have more thing to enjoy life. Energy ends, and attitude is also a matter
