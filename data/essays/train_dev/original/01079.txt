I agree with this idea.

There is four reasons.

At first, it is more appropriate to play sports because some of the hard sports such kind of succer, basketball and baseball, it is difficult to play for older people. In fact, there are only young star player in professional league of above sports. In addition, It is not only the number of sports they can do but also the risk of injuly when they play the sports. The possility to get injuly is higher in older people case. 

Secondly, young people can travel easilly than older people especially foreign country case. When we trip to somewhere, we sometimes face culture difference with other peoples who live in that place and should have flexible mind to accept such kind of culture difference to have good relationship with them. Moreover, sometimes it is necessary to communicate with them by their own language. In that case, we have to learn another language to communicate. It is easier for young people to learn because of the flexible and fresh thinking way.

Thirdly, young people have enough time to do what they would like to realize. Basically older people have more social responsibility especially they have sons or daughters. It is quite difficult to make timing to do in quite tight situation of older people.

Forthly, there are a lot of chances for young people to change situation according to their preferance. For example, it is easy to get new job for young people rather than older people because they have a lot of potential to learn more about new job. Main reason is they can work more time due to law. Currently it is difficult to have jobs for over 60. Some of the people who would like to work cannot get jobs because of there reasons. In young people case, it fully depends on themselves.
