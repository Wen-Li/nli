The lack of social commitment among youngs has been a common perception since always. It is very common to listen on media or simply when old people are chatting, that yougsters don-t participate or that they are not interested on the community problems. However, I disagree completely with this opinion, not only because I think that it is only a prejudice, but also because from my own experience I can state the oposite.

On one hand, the base in with the opinion that yougnsters don-t give enough time to helping their communities lays is the comparison with the behaviours of older people nowadays and in the past, when they were young. In the first case, it seems to me that there is no data to support any different behaviour between the different generations. In my opinion, what creates this perception is the recall or past days, which never is accurate. In the second case, I think that the great demonstrations that happened during the 60s and 70s related with the wars that took place and the stress between the Eastern and Western blocks helps in a large extent to magnificy the false impression that youngsters used to be more commited.

On the other hand, I can say from my own experience that young people dedicate time to helping their communities. I collaborate as a volunteer in a local ONG and there, the great majority of the volunteers are as young as me or even younger. But young people are also commited with their communities in many other ways that perhaps are no so visible as struggles in demonstrations. I have friends who form part of political parties and who are very active in any action that is carried out into the community.

In conclusion, young people is as commited with their communities as they used to be. The reason why it is believed that their commitment has changed is that the ways of participating helping the community are less visible, as can be an ONG.
