In the fast growing world job opportunities are growing. All the subjects have sub-subject to work on it or new working areas.Succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to well because of; earning money and reputation, peoples attention and being imaginative.

First, earning money and reputation is the base of all kind of work and success. People always want money and reputation,at least one of them. Trying something new will always bring you the money or the raeputation.For example if whe think about a good car mechanic,and known by his own neighbourhood stats working on luxury boats engines. A while later his customers will start to want his help in boat subject or something else about mechanics because they will think that he is gifted about mechanical things.So trying new things brings you both money and reputation and these two courages to try more new things again.

Secondly, people`s attention makes you happy bacause everbody ask you something about the thing you have done or invented, wants something about it or  come near to you and say `congratulations`. The point is that you are the center of the world at that moment, you think that everything happening is about you everyone loves you everyone needs you, this is the food of the human soul and the key for t the success so peoples attention is one of the most important points of trying or doing new things.

Last, only imaginative people may try new things because they are the ones who try the not-tried things before. Their brains are succesfull until their birth, may be they are really gifted or the `one`.  They can assemble a world only for theirselves and kive in it. When they imagine something they can also imagine the result. What does that change? If they do not see the succes at the end, they do not go in to the new things, their brain is working in a different way, they are smart.

In conlusion, trying new things and the success related to it is about money,attention and being imaginative. People trying new things can be succesful but sometimes only succesful people can try new thing because they already have enough courage and brain for that. This is a two directed road, someone in this road will be olways successful or always try new things. And it will end with the other one.
