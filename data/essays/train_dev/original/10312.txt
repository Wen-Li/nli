Young peple nowadyas do not give enough time helping their communites , because they are busy with other things although these other things can help society.	

Students can help their society in many diffrent ways like when they study and graduate they will take a job to work for their society,also all the parties and celebtrating fistival for the nautre and for the annivrsary of the city they are living in in a usefull things to society.

On the other hand alot of young people really help their society in very obvoius way ,many students like to visit kids or old people in the hospital and help them, this is a very wonderful job from the students.

As I'm a student I can see that this statments is not true and u can make it general to all students there is some students who is lazy and do not help ,although there is students who like to help and have a helpfull and friendly manner.
