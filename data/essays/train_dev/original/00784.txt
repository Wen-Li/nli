Travelling  plays a predominent role in the  lives  of all the middle class  families .There are two major issues involved while travelling,
one is by travalling along with other people initiated by a tour guide,in other words he is the person lead by a travelling agency.Another issue deals  with the  people taking their own way  to travel to a particular place.According to my view i stongly beleive in going along with a tour guide because,he knows about the cultures and traditions prevailing in that place ,he also knows about the history beyond each and every monument present in that place.
As far as the place is concerned there may be dangerous places where their is prohibition for the tourists and without getting initiated by a proper guide ,we may fall in to problems by entrying in to that place.


The main reason in going along with a tour guide is that we can know about the place in depth i.e what are the cultures and traditions of the people living in yhat place ,and we can really enjoy our journey.
.We can know about the cultures,rituals,symbols of religions an so on.So i think it is better to go along with tour guide.

Another reason i want to make is about the monuments present in the place.When we are  moving along with our tour guide we could know about the monument.For example,when we want to visit ."The statue of liberty at manhatan",we have to know the basic purpose or the history beyond statue of liberty.However,without a proper guide also we can the visit the place ,but we cannot know about the beauty of the place as we are missing the thesis of the place. 
 

In conclusion,the main reason for us going  to a particular place is completely fulfilled if , we are accompanied by a tour guide .Moreover,by going to these places we can improve our knowledge about the culture and traditions.As a result we can increase " International cooperation amomg the people "and this will lead  to a world of peace and gratitude.
