I agree with the statement that most advertise show more facts of the products than they really have and make it much more easy to be saled. This phonomenen are showed almost all over the world and I think it is reasonable to be accept.
       The first reason is that, the advertise is mean to show the good effects of the products and appeals people to buy them.It is the use of the advertizing.People who make advertise always study the merchanes carefully and make it more useful and more worthful to buy.They of cause will show a lot of unconvince facts to be convinced. Just even a piece of papper can be discribed to have the capability to make user more healthy than use other kind of pappers. You may think it is rediculers, but the advertise offen make those problems.
       Second, the company pay for the advertisement is focus on the profits of it. The company do this things just because it want to increase its sales and make more money back. Input and output is the first thing to a company. So the manerge people want to make the products more attractable to the market.And the advertise will be as better as it could be. No concern about the facts.There are many illigle advertises in China that misleading people and make terrible effects to the society.
       The last reason is, sometimes, people are like to see some amazing things in the advertisement though they do not believe it. For example, a women who is not so fit may want to see some medicines that can help people to lose weight.And she may dream that she could be as beautiful as the ficture shown at the advertisement. She dose not want a really product ,but just a dream.
So the advertisement offen seem much better than they really are and accepteble to the society.
