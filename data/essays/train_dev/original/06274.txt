I agree with this statement.In my opinion being successul requires you to be uncommon.You need to have some unique qualities in order to be recognised and acknowledged by public.Repeating the same things you in which you have acquired perfection might earn you attractive results initially but in the long run they aren't much fruitful.The competion in all fields of life is very tough these days.So to overtake others you need to possess some distinguishing charecteristics.Working on a same project again and again is not going to solve your purpose.Because gradually other people also acquire mastery over them and may even surpass you.Though trying to do new things,say,for example starting a new business may ultimately turn out to be a disaster and in that context the other view appears to be more appropriate but as we all know 'failures are the stepping stones to success'.History is full of instances that support the idea of endeavouring new things.One common example is of scientists.Its well known that only those who have tried to innovate have been able to register their names in the books and are remembered even after hundreds of years.What if Einstein had accepted the already running theories?The concept of relativity would have never arose and of course Einstein couldn't have been able to get the noble prize.There are numerous other examples of various leaders,businessmen,researchers who became successful only because they tried to introduce new concepts.To name a few,Mahatma Gandhi who pioneered Indian freedom movement,businessmen like Bill Gates who intoduced windows and revolutionised the computer industry and now he stands as the richest man on earth.So based on above mentioned examples and facts i am of the opinion that only those succeed who do new things and take risk
