It seems that young people nowadays don't give enough time to help their communities, I agree with this statement. 
But  I have to say that it only seems that. I have twenty years old, so I'm young, and then I'm part of young people.
Since my point of view I believe to things about this fact.
At first I would want to focus on the fact that young people help, young people want to help,  they want the society to ask help to them, they have the necessity of knowing that they are part of something and that this part is useful and that society needs a lot of parts, society and their communities needs every young for running a better society and that they are needed. Young people want the society to ask for them!
And that is where I want to arrive, nowadays society shows an image of the young people as if they are lazy people, as if they only want to have fun and to be with their friends. And at least, as if society doesn't expect no positive reaction of them.

A lot of young people travel abroad to underdeveloped countries to help as voluntieers. The fact that is, they can be voluntieers on their own countries, they can take care of people around them, they can help in projects of beneficency in their countries,...
But what happens? Most of the times their own communities don't ask them help, they don't know they can help in their own communities and built a better society.

In conclusion, I can state that society doesn't encourage young people to help and that is because young people act in these two ways: They get relaxed because they believe socitey doesn't expect anything of them; or they travel abroad, to underdeveloped countries where young people believe that they really need their help.  

Since my point of view, and apart of what I have say, there are people that are responsible with their communities and have the necessity and the aim to help in their own community and also, they view their community necessities and want to help and satisfy them as far as they can do it.
