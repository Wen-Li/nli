I do not agree with this statement.
In my opinion it is not possible to do such a statement and to make clear what I mean, I'm going to explain my point of view with some examples.
Befor I started studying medicin I worked as a Rettungsassistentin. I met a few pepole, old and young ones and I often had the time to talk with them for a while. Everyone had his own live-story and many of them really liked to tell me about their positions to live and their experience. Now I would like to describe two really sicnificant conversations I had.
The first conversation I had was with an older woman. She was about 80 years old and lived in a pension for olds. She was very sick but always with a smile on her month. We met a several times and we always talk a lot. She told me great stories about her and her husband Karl who died 2 years ago. All the time she felt absolutely fine with herself and the world around and that' s why I asked her one day what her miracle is like. She laught and answered me> Young lady, do not belief that I do not know how crule life can be, I have seen it. But this is the reason why I am so lucky. I thank good for what I have and I enjoy everyday in my life. It is a question of position.>
The other situation I would like to describe was with a girl in my age. She wanted to kill herself becaus her boyfriend left her two days ago and she thougt life would be over know. For her there were no more sense in life. 
I think this statement made at the beginning is not right. It is important to look individually at everyone!
It is a question of view!
