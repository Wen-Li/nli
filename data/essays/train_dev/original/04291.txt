If the "success" means economical or scientifical success (big money or new deveropment),  I agree with the statement.  Recently,  the people's life becomes more convinient because of the development of industry, and more homogenius in the means of infomation because of the progress of communication technology like internet.  So relatively comfortable life can be achieved by the routine task, or work.  It means new chalanges are not necessory for common life,  so many people seem not to like trying new matters.  The chalanges is more impotant now!  In the field of science, new result only derived from new chalanges or ideas.  Already known works only make already known results.  In the economical sense, also new chalange sometimes makes big success. But economical chalanges always bring some risks and  easily become gamble, so we should manage our total risk.  
  But l think it is also important to keep the traditional matters, theorys and caltures.  They can be the basis of new one.  And we can avoid some failures and  accidents from previous one.  So in the means of "importance", or "Important people", I cannot choose one from these two.
