I agree with the statement as it is true that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.The producers are using the latest trends of marketting,advertising and promoting their products.Some of the common methods used are - Promotions,Product Launch Offers,Door to Door selling,Discounts etc.allt hese methods motivate the consumer to purchase these goods without even knowing what the good is actually made out of or what is the goods actual function.
Advertisements make the product look really appealing and user friendly.For example an add for a car would usually include the car speeding away really fast and about the interior technology and luxury of the car.But what the add does not tell the consumers is that speeding away causes accidents,Technology advances everyday,etc.
A good add should be planned in a manner to show the use of the car that is how can it help not only you but other people aswell or even the environment.If the add for the car displayed the comfort,the space available in the car,etc it would be more usefull for the people.
  Advertising is taking over the marketting sector tremendously.Adds in forms of banners,flyers,stalls etc are providing all the information to the people and these methods make sure that the consumer looks at the product ina apositive manner.
Usually the quality,functioning and looks of a product are quite different from what they appear on an add and this makes the consumer suffer.
Some of the adds provide  us with the information we dont need and some of them diplay material which offend people culturaly,religiously or make them feel at a low status in the society.Example - An add for an underwear would display the man wearing it and running behind a horse which is not true.
I conclude this essay in regard to ensure people that they are aware of what they consume and how is it gonna affect them or others or wether it would still be of any help for the consumer in the future.
