Advertisement is invading our life. Wherever people drive their eyes either on the Tv or in the streets, the advertising campaigns are overwhelming our landscape making them full of expectations for the products they admire on the screen or in the newspaper. But, unfortunatelly, most advertisements promise more than they can really deliver to the final customers. The strenght of the marketing system of the multinational companies brands make people dreaming too much and the final customers are not very aware of the image technicity comapnies uses for making their produtcs more beautiful. 

The message an advertisement wants to convey to the final consumer is delicately composed by the marketing system of the multinational brands. The marketing allows the companies to sell dreams through their products campaigns. For example, the consumer does not feel guilty to buy and dring too much Diet Coke because it is said to be produced with less sugar than the original one. Similarly, the ones who buy electronics machine to do sport at home in order to get slimmer dream of being fit by using the machine promoted by the ad. 
Moreover, people neglect too much the capacity of the computerizing of the image. This occurs especially in the cosmetics industry where the brands show off the merits of their products. They build beutiful advertisement campaigns with top models who display a beautiful skin quality, which is the result of computer works.
