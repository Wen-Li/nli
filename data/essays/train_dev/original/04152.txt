In these days a lot of people especially old people claims young people do not heve enough time to helping their communuties .The old people around me are complaining the same problem.However, i do not share their idea.In my opinion young people tries to give time to help the charity but they haven't got enough time because of the rush oh the twentieth century,
  Young people heve a lot of work to do but not enough time to spent in this century.However they spent a lot of time to their communities,For instance they are visiting their familiy in every celebration.If they have they gave it to the poof people.For example last night in a  television show  a lot of people gave money to a charity to plant trees and most of people who gave money to charity were young people.Actually There wasn't any old people there,This an remarkable point,a lot of people say young people are guilty about this topic but may be old people are guilty 
   There is an adage which comes from hitits,In a hitit paper an old people was complaining about young peoples. it shows that complaining from young people has never changed,The people living in twenty second century may be complain from ypung peoples too,However  it doesn't mean young peoples are not gining enough time,
   In conclusion, the young people living in twentieth century gives enough time to their comunity, even they have got a lot of jobs to do,we can see the from the television shows or if we look at histoery we will see the same complainings,this is typicall thing so the old people has to get r'd of the'r complainings,
