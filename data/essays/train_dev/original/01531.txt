Nowadays, purchasing behavior is more and more influenced by the advertisements. There are advertisements on TV, newspaper, radio, internet and street. These advertisements may guide us on how to buy a product. It is hard to imagine a life without advertisements. Does these advertisements always play a positive role on us? I am afraid that I can not agree. There are too many advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

The advertisements will make the product very attractive, so people will buy more and more products under this motive; however after purchasing, people find that the product is not as effective as it is advertised. The reason is that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.  For example, there are many medicine advertisements state that the medicine will soothe pains and cure disease very quickly. People suffering from pains and disease will buy the medicine becuase they believe what is promoted in the advertisements. These medicine advertisements have exaggerated the fact. Even though you follow the rules, the medicine will not solve your problems as easily as it is stated.

Further more, in order to attract more and more audiences to buy the product, the advertisements may even provide false information to make products seem better. I have heard too many stories from my friends that they purchase high price cosmetics after seeing advertisements. When they try on the cosmetic, it does not improve the situation at all, some may even harm their skin.  I have to say that these advertisements are not responsible at all. They only show us the best examples, but do not explain the product in a moderate and correct way.

I do not deny the fact that there may be some advertisements truly show and promote the product, but I think the number is pretty less. Most of the advertisements appear not as good as they really are.
