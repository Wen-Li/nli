I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to merely learn facts. The following points can be reasonably made to support the above statment.

To begin with, understanding of ideas and concepts enables one to really appreciate the mechanics of it and to possibly put the idea or concept into application. Take the example of an electric motor. Without proper understanding of how an electric motor really works, it is impossible for one to create motors of various sizes and for various utilities. If one mearly learnt the facts about a motor, we wouldn't have all the pleasures in life made possible by all the miniature motors! Look at the cars power windows, whose operation is facilitated by small motors, or at many of useful the robots whose motion is made possible by various sizes/types of motors, or at many of the precision tools that use something called stepper motors to precisely control various operations.  

Further, understanding of a concept enables one to look for ways the concept can be extended to other applications, or to find ways two or more concepts can be combined to come up with new ideas that make exciting things possible.  Take the example of a device that scans printed material and converts it into typed matter on a computer. This device is the result of a lot of different concepts put together. The scanning technology - which scans the printed material, which is then combined with pattern matching technology - that can look at the scanned picture and recognize the letters based on their shapes. Simple learning of facts doesn't really allow for this kind of innovations.

However, no one can deny the role facts play in helping people visualize things and in putting things in perspective.  Take for example the Saturn rocket that took man to the Moon. Unless one knows the size of the rocket, the amoount of fuel used, how many inventions were required to make the flight possible, one may not really appreciate the scale of the device and the project.  But one can still see that the facts help one gain a perspective of things, but the really usefulness comes only when one understand the concepts that make it possible for the device to work.

In summary, it is clear that it is far more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn just facts, despite the important role played by the facts.
