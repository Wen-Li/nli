I agreed with the statement, because when the student understand  the ideas and concepts with clear examples in class more information the student retaint in time, and then the student can use this ideas and concepts in the near future and in the far future. I thinks this because I use this principle all time during my studing life, and in my profesional life, in fact many time I use information adquired in my first years of university in special topics of biology and chemestry, matters that I not use normally in my work. Another point is when a student understand ideas and concepts, the studet can use this ideas and concept in relation with others, to understad new know, or made theory about unknow topics, and this is very important in the creation of new concept or the developmewnt of the science and ingeniery. Is more, is the base of the evolution of the society, when more ideas or concept understand the studen best development have in the studies and in the futre work. 

For another hand, if the student learn facts is more difficult to the student made relationship between different facts, because is possibilite they don-t have a clear relation, and normally to find a relationship between fact is necesarie ideas and concetp to help to find the relation.
