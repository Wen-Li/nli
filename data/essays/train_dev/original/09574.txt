As you know, some people are so busy because their lives especially young people. There are a lot of things to do in their lives. Sometimes they work long time and they can't take their time. Some of them work hardly depends on their jobs. These days, people work hard because time is very important for them. They want to use exact time in their jobs. During this period they can forget to help their communities. I  agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

First of all, young people has a lot of things to do. Business is very important in their lives. They want to get perfect life and to be a good family person. They work in a hard or an easy job and time is limited for them. Their community is a second thing because of their own job lives. 

Secondly, young people want to give time for own their time. They do something to relax. For instance, they go to somewhere during their free time. they have some kinds of hobbies and some young people want to be alone. They can help themsleves. There is no time for their communities. 

Finally, young people's rythm is vey different or changeable. This situation depends on their own personal properties. some of them are very workholic, some of them are very lasy. Furthermore, environmental changes effect them. They can change easily about thier behaviour. Indeed, something is not important for them. They have not a good relationship between they and their family or friends. Most of works or jobs can effect them easily. They can forget what they have one family or friends. 

In briefly, time can found hard because of some specific reasons to give enough time to helping someone. Indeed, giving a time to help someone depends on our hand. These days, everybody want to get a good life or a job.
