While there may be some people who disagree, I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons why I take this position are elaborated on in the next paragraphs.

Firstly, for example, when I was looking for a used car about 6 years ago, what I did first was to read thoroughly the car magazines. These were full of advertisements actually. There were so much car information in the magazine that I was next to impossible to sellect 3 or 4 candidates. One day, after I managed to do so, went to the car dealer in person to see on of the cars itself. At the sight of the car itself, I was a little confused because the car didn't look as good as in the magazine.

Secondly, when I made uniforms for the baseball team in my company, I again checked the catalogue in depth. In the catalogue, almost every uniform desigh looked cool, but when we ordered one type in the catalogue and finally saw the real uniforms, Iwe were a little dissapointed to see the difference between ones in the catalogue and the real ones.

Furthermore, I have made a company recruiting website for college/university students. This was like a advertisement of our company, our workplaces. We tried hard so that our company would seem excellent. Of course, we didn't made false statements or images using pictures and CGs. But what we tried to do was to collect best pictures of our company and workplaces. So, in this sense, our company's website should have been the very best image of our company.

In conclusion, for the reasons stated above, I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. On the other hand, I seem to have to learn that products in the advertisement are not as good as they really are when I do the shopping.
