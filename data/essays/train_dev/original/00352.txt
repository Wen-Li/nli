      The development of the car is an uncertain issue. Actually, people used to live without cars but since it has been created, there have been more and more cars all around the world. Yet, I trully believe that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years.
       First of all, considering all the new technology and the constant evolution of the world, I'm convinced that the car will finally disappeared. Actually, people change their mind very fastly nowadays and they will soon be bored by the car, they'll need something new. For instance, I hope we'll soon be able to move just by thinking about the place we want to go, it will be easier and will save energy and time. Besides, even if the teleportation isn't created, it's obvious that the car will disappear as fastly as it came. Thus, a new mean of transport will be created, more powerful and more useful.
      Furthermore, all the country are getting engaged for the reduction of toxic gas on earth and Kyoto agreement is the perfect example of the world we all want to fight for. Even if some countries don't really apply the rules at the moment, I'm sure they will finally realize what the emergency is and they won't have any other choice than making efforts. Moreover, people are more and more aware that we are acting for the future and for the next generations. Therefore, if we want the future humans to be able to live on earth in the future, we have to stop using the car and then stop polluting.
      In a nutshell, even if I'm not sure that there will be more and more pedestrians, I'm trully convinced that cars don't belong to future but to past and that we'll find solutions to be able to move as we wish without polluting too much.
