Do youing people enjoy more than older epole, that is a very diffivult question, taking in accoubt that most peole would think that young people might have more fun than older peole, just because they think that they are healthier, faster, stronger, as my mom used to tell me, teenagers think they are suoperman, they take risks that older peole normally wouldnt takem, thety stay up all nioght, go to parties, drive fast carsm, and maybe even do illegal drugs, but that does not mean that young people has more fun, i once read a very good book "Tuesdays with Morrie". its a book about life, it shows the experiences of a young man, interacting with an elder, the elder has gone through various experiences, and the youngster wants to learn from thoe sxperiences, and eventually, the teacher tells him one thing, "you first need to learn how to die, thenm you can learn how to live..." that tells the student that he has to absorb all that he canm from his experiences, and then let go of some of his emotions and then, he can know how it feels to taste succes, or love, and even pride. Morrie, who is the teacher on the book tells the main caharcter that once you know how if feels how to die, yopu know how to live because you learn how to enjoy life even more. the point i am trying to make is that older people know how to take more and more from each new experience, and they probably enjoy life even more, although there are a few exceptions, some young people are evry mature and find a way to have fun even in the worst cituatuions, like people that dont have as many economic resources, they learn how to take advantage from the few oportunities they have to go out, or party as we say nowadays. i honestly think that older people have mopre fun, because they have learned how to enjoy life, and young people are just living at a hundred miles an hour, trying to do too many things to have fun, and not getting a lot out of the experinces that they6 go through in their daily lifes.
