I disagree with the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today even besides in all over the world now, we are considering about the enviroment, and oil is decreasing now.

I know that there were some agreements about the gas producing by cars. Cars are very bad for enviroment because they run with gas which pollutes earth's air. Many countries promise that they are going to reduce gas which is from cars in present days. My country, Japan also did and now we are trying to do this plan. However, I never see this successful and people who are using cars do not care about it at all.

I also hear that oil is not  going to take anymore. Now, most of cars in this world run with oil. Actually there are electrinic cars, but it is unuseful to use because it takes time to make cars run so we still use a car running with oil. I think that there still will be some oil in twenty years.

Cars are absolutly usefull. We can go to anywhere in anytime by cars. People living in metolopolis might not need cars, but people living in rural area have to use car to live in. They live in far away from grocely stores, malls, and places they work at. Needless to say, we need indivisual cars. We cannot use public system such as buses, trains because it may be faster to transport than we use public transportation. In addition, most of us will keep using indivisual cars.

I think that there are not things which we can reduce car using because we do not care enviroment, we care only ourselves, electronic car are not useful, I do not think electronic car is becoming useful, and actually people really need car.
