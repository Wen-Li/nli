In today's world, people should know everthing for a better life. For instance a manager have to know advertising and also has knowledge of account in order to be an effective one.
As far as I'm concerned, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.There are many advantages and disadvantages of having broad knowledge of many subjects. However, I want to explain its advantages because it is more heavier than other.
First of all, knowledge does not make a damage to brain. It is always usefull for example I am a math teacher nonetheless, I have many hobbies like painting. I went courses on this topic drawing or colors. My friend meets me to an exebition a result of this this knowledge about painting gets me an advantage such as having entellectual knowledge. 
Secondly, life is so complex and full of tasks as a result of this, every time in our life we need kinds of knowledge. Consequently, it makes our life easier.I want to explain this with an example. For instance, I am a student and in my daily life I don't need the knowledge of economy suh as interest rates but on the other hand when I want to be a cashier in a bank, the manager of the bank ask me while I apply for the job that do you know what the interest rate and how it is counted and how it changes the amount of money. Thus, I have no cahnce, I have to know that if I want this job. Consequently, it makes my life easier such as so as to attend a job for earning money.
Most important of all, people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are always acheivers. For instance, I read Einstein's life one week ago and understood that Einstein was one of these kinds of people. He had wide range of knowledge about everthing such as science and also maths. This knowledge made him in order to establish new scientifical research.
All in all, having knowledge of many subjects make our life easier and also make us happier at the same time making succesfull.
