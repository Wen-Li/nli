 People have to study lots of things in  their life. Some of them want  to interest  many things and others prefer specific things. Although having lots of information releated to anything, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.

 If you want to have broad knowledge, you have to work hard on everything. This way is very difficult for people. In addition, you can not achive something properly  if you chose broad knowledge. Furthermore you can not know everything about your subjects, because you have to study for every subjects.
 
 On the other hand, specialize in one specific subject  is not difficult as another because, they have to work on only one topic. This event provide some adventages for you. For example; because you work on only one topic, you can do your researches broadly and you know everything about this subject.  

 As a result,  to specialize in one specific subject is better than to have broad knowledge of many academi subjects. I think people use this way to be successful.
