     Recently, there are a lot of cars in the world. In some countries,  one people have some cars. Car is very convinient, but there are many problems. I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for 3 reasons.
     First, if people who use cars a lot of time will decrease, it will be able to slove the environmental problems in the world easily. Cars use a lot of fuel and cars emit bat gas. It is very serious problem. Bat gas damage to people. If people have a lot of gas of cars, they might be sick. Especially, little children are very weak. If children have a lot of gas on the road, they might be become very bad sick. Today, fuel prices is very expensive and many people worry about money. However, many people use cars a lot of time. People must think about environment. The earth is ours.
     Second, if people don't  use cars a lot of time, there will be no area of heavy traffic jams. In the world, there are many city where there occur traffic jams especially developed countries. For example, in Japan, there occur heavy traffic jams every morning in capital of Tokyo. It is very serious problem. Japanese government made a lot of new high way and road, but there didn't decrease a lot of cars. I think that the biggest reason about it is that price of cars have been decreased and many people can buy many cars easily. The best way to decrese a lot of cars I think is that Japanese government tries to make tax of using cars. If Japanese government will do it, cars will decrease.
     Third, if many people don't use cars, there will not be in danger. Driver's license is able to get easily. Of course, all the people don't have good skills and sometime, there occur traffic accident. If the test of driver's license will be difficult, there will be decrease people who can drive, and traffic accidents will be decrease.
     In conclusion, if many people don't drive cars, we can solve many problems, so I hope that many people use train or bus, and there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
