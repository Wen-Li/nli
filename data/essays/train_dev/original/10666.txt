I disagree with the argument that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject. Actually, it might be helpful to have many knowledge but objectively, that is unnccessary than to specialize in one specific subject. anybody have many other knowledges by useing some times. but if to specialize in one specific subject. than you will get more specific knowledge that other people do not know about it. it is more useful to have the knowledge. for example,let say you are the owner of the company and you want to hire some one for marketing section and there are two people who went just a university and aother went a specific business college. who do you going to hire for your business? I am not saying that the just university person is bad but, objectively, I will hire the specific business college. because I want the person who have a idea of a specific section, which is business and who have lots of knowledge at the field. and not only my question but also the real world is like that. There are lots of people who are achieve at their field such as CEO of Microsoft, not only he was good at but also he was ti soecializ in one specific subject. may be to have broad knowledgeof many academic subjects will helps you to decide your field but  if you have your goal alraedy than i suggest that to have knowledge in one thing. and eventhought  you think it is waste fo time but do not stop. because no body will going to have that your effort and  you will get the golden age for your appreciate.
