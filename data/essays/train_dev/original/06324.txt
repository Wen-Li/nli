	Nowadays, cars are major means of transport. They have been used for over 100 years. Somehow, people are now addicted to cars. It has become an essential thing in our everyday life. 
	Besides, it's unlikely that people get rid of that mean of transport. There is always something new to learn, to discover. Cars might be technologically advanced in twenty years, but i hardly think there will be fewer cars in use. In saudi arabia, people tend to use more and more cars, as every single family has, in average, 2 cars. 
	 Actually, cars need maintenance, energy, fuel. The only reason that could lead to the decreasing use of cars are the unsuffiecient quantity of petroleum. As we all know, that ressource is limited on the Earth, and we could run out of fuel in 50 years. 
	However, the human being is known to be solution finder: we could probably invent new cars that work on another energy, for example the sun energy. Actually, some of these cars are being tested all over the world. That suggests the fact that there is always a solution for every problem. 
	In my opinion, i think cars are very useful, even though they make air pollution. It has served the man for centuries. But, eventually, if there is no more petroleum, cars are useless. That natural factor could be the major reason of the usingless of that mean of transport. 
	In conclusion, that statemnet is wrong if there is not that natural factor that stops us from providing energy to make our cars work.
