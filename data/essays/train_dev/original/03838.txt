One could wonder if, in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. I personally think, that because of a lot of factors we will explore, this statement is not ag
On my way to this test this morning I was able to read a copy of the 'Le Monde' newspaper. Inside it, an article stated that the State of California has decided to cut down on CO2 gas emissions by taking car manifacturers to court. The reason I mention this article, is that it stated that there are about 36 million cars in California for about 35 million housholds. In my opinion California is one of the best example of a region in which the use of the car is essential in order to be able to move around its vast territory. But California is also the most prosperous of all american states and therefore can demonstate to us the type of situation that could arise if a country developped to such a scale and therefore had this type of need for cars. It has become common knowlege, or fear, or indeed both for many people, that in twenty years, China will be a lot more prosperous that it is today. If we just considered the fact that its GDP grows of 7% a year, we could say that by 2026, China would have equaled California's prosperity. What makes me tend to refute the proposed statement, is the fact that China has a population of about 1 billion, this would probably equate to about 400 million households and therefore potentially about 350 million cars needed by a new prosperous population to wonder through their vast country and cities. I am of course not stating that China is a car free environement at the moment but the increase with the volume of car the country experiences today would be monumental.
Furthermore, one would have to consider other growning economies such as India. Europe is saturated with cars and efforts are made in order to diminish pollution by increasing alternative means of transport. But this is possible because the territories are relatively small in comparison to immensities such as India or China. 
One could also say that, as demographics are increasing, there will always be more people on earth, until we finally destroy it, and therefore more potential car drivers and buyers as a whole. 
It must also be pointed out that, since the apparition of the Ford T model in the 1920s, the first affordable and mass produced car, the car has become an object that simbolizes liberty. No indication seem to show that, in a near future, men will invente a new symbol and vector of liberty to replace the car. If they do, the psychological aspect gone, and only the practical aspect of owning and driving a car remaining, we might witness an increase in alternative transportations methods and therefore car usage would slowlz decrease. However, it is very ulikely that this will happen during the next twenty years, and even if it did, that twenty years will be enough to witness a drop in car usage. A change of peoples' psychology takes time.
Finally, one has to point out that the arguement that petrol will not be available in a couple of decades is not valid. Firstly, this theory has been enounced many times and new petrol reserves are being found day after day. Secondly, new energy supplies are being developped, such as the biometric fuel or the eletric car. 
The car may be cleaner and even potentially out of date in twenty years, but, as far as the proposed statement is concerned, there will not be fewer of them on a global scale, as long as there will be more humans and more economic groath on this planet.
