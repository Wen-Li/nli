Car has became a part of life in the modern life .car is very much essential today to do the things in the right time.I disagree with the given statement that "in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use  than there are today".

       In the  olden days man used to travel from place to another by walking .the invention of the wheel chaged the evolution greatly.
after the invention of wheel man introduced many new vechicles for transportation.he initially used bullock carts,tongas which were pulled by animals .
   In the later life  he introduced bicycle ,which served him in travelling later he introduced motor cycle inorder to reach quickly with less effort,inthis process man thought for luxirious way of travelling and he started to introduced vechicles run by fuel.he designed some of them for transportation of goods ,and some for human,such as trucks ,buses respectively.

And he later thought about the luxory and privacy ,then brought the cars .cars were luxirious means of transportation in the earlier.
but it is  a compulsory now .this change had occured because of globalisation and neccesities.
 in the intial stages there very less number of cars  ,people used  to see it very intrestingly.but now days in the developed countries many are having more than one car.

    The main problem with the cars is they create alot of traffic problems and also pollution. for this reason many  governments are trying to decrease cars by demanding for more tax, parkingamounts.
 
 But  pepole are ready to pay that because they very much edicted to it. the  question is that there will be less cars with in 20 years than now but ithink it will not happen.the people possessing cars will not throw them out.
There will be many technologies come which will reduce pollution
already some are using cars run by solar power.
The other reason is that popullation is increasing day -day.

And  iconclude from the above reasons that after twenty years the number of will not be decreased instead the go on increase.
