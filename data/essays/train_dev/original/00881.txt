I agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do.There are several reasons for supporting this position.

The first reason is that young people have much ability than older people. They can do anything they want to do.Their power is stronger than older people.They hardly get tired. If they dont do  things that they want to do until they are young, they can do nothing after getting old.Especially sports like surfin,running,soccer,squba diving,and so on.My hobby is traveling abroad.Taking planes is so tired that I cant endure for a long time.Last winter I went to Orlando,Florida alone.I have to change the plane for two times.Totally,it took thirty hours to get there!I think order people cant endure no longer.

The second reason is that young people can return soon.When they make a mistake,young people can take other way.But once older people make a mistake,even though such a small mistake,they cant do again.They cant have another chance.For exsample,young people made mistake and they quit their job,they are able to hire another company soon.Because they are young.But older people cant do so.Maybe they are not able to hire a company.Because of their age."Too much older!"

For these reasons,I agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do.
