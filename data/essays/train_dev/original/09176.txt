I'm agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people.The young are happier,have more energy,and don't think to much in the consecuenses of an action.
Young people like to enjoy life,going to the movies,beaches,parties,
going to ride bike,traveling,listening to the music,dancing and a lot of more activities.They want to be happy.
Old people usually have less energy to do a lot of things than the young peolple can do.When you are old may be your healt is not the same and you has to expend time going to the doctors,therapy,
going to the farmacy for medicines and be at home for more time
whith responsabilities to do,work,grandchildrens to take care.You
think more is you want to going to a place.
Young people and old people have a different way to think about live,resposabilitis and having fun.Old people are more conservatives.
Most of young people just think in having fun whith their friends and most of the old people just think about work or rest.
