I agree with this statement. Basically, travel should be enjoyable and fun to talk many people on during tour group, not only people local cevilians. On a group tour have more chance to talk people than travel alone. First, traveler will be a friend with tour guide, that is a first oppotunity. There is many advantage that travel in a group led by a tour guide. First of all, travelers just follow tour guide. It is neccesary to make any tour plan or sightsee schedule. Just listen and see what tour guide explains and sightseeing spot. Travelers concentrate what ever they want to see or whatever they want to learn or listen. Secondly, travel with group led by a tour guide is safer. Tour guide have a responsibility to be in safe with travelers that means travelers do not go to any unpeace place. Even travelers doesn't know sightseeing place is safe or not, definitely safe during tour. In case travel alone or no local friend, nobody know if travelers in unpeace place or not. It is danger. Thirdly, travel with group led by  a tour guide will be convenience. Which means, travelers don't wast a time as lost in place, don't wast a money by cheat. As I mentioned above, sightseeing place and time schedule were scheduled by tour guide. So travelers going on schedule that means there is no way to wast time and see anything travelers want, and travelers going in safe place to buy such as in shopping mall or meal. There is no way to anyone cheat them.  Those reasons are not only domestic travel. I can say it internatinal travel as well. I recommend to go to travel with group led by a tour guide especially internetinal travel. Without saying, people in foreign country speaks different lunguage than travelers and there is not peacefull place. Those are reasons why I agree with statement.
