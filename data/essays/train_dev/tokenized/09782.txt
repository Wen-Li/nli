I agree only partially with the statement that broad knowledge in many academic subjects is better than to specialize on one specific subject .
In my opinion it is not enough to have a vast knowledge in one subject .
People tend to be narrow-minded if they do not know about any subject but their specific one .
A mathematic for example can make up a theoretic statistic about the spread of a disease for example but he will have to conclude certain irregularities to show the real process .

Furthermore , a certain amount of basic knowledge is important to everyone to participate in daily discussions or to built up a political attitude for instance .
And every employer expects basic knowledge from his potential employees .
For example about the current political and economic situations .

Therefore it is definetly important to be familiar with more than one single topic .
Nevertheless , it is obvious that students have to concentrate on one academic topic if they want to compete with others in a job .
They have to know as much as possible about this one specific subject and they have to pay attention to learn about the newest changes and innovations in this subject .

And apart from the competitiveness it some situation it could also be very dangerous if someone has only broad knowledge of a subject .
A doctor with broad knowledge of medicine for example is the worst imaginable danger .

Apart from that the whole service sector is based on the fact that people know about one single topic in detail while others know about another .
Nobody can learn enough about every subject for professionals would be superfluent .

To draw a conclusion , students should specialize on one specific subject and apart from that they should learn as much as possible about other subjects .
Everybody should use his talent to the greatest extention .
