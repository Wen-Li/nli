In today 's world , it is highly debated that if a person have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one subject .
That is , `` specialization and all in one '' concepts are argued to determine which is better .
In this essay , I will try to explain my opininos about the issue which I wrote above .
Before from writing details of my opinion , I would like to say that I believe the power of specialization and disagree with the statement which is given in the question .

That is , the people and yourself will easily be able to know what are you doing and what you are specialized for .
For example if the doctors are not specialized in any type of specializition , they will not have any specialized topic , and again a Turkish sentence `` they will say I can do any thing ( job ) that you want me to do '' .
