I strongly agree because I believe that if you manage to understand the main idea of an event , it will last in your mind and you will be able to remember it for a long time , and that if you just learn the facts of the events they wo n't last in your mind that much .

An example that I believe can be given is when high schools students learn about hystorical events , if they just memorize dates , names and places they will be able to remember them just in order to aply them in a test , unless it 's a super important subject of history .

But if they analize the situation , analize the events that ocurred and comprehend why did that event ocurred in the first place , they will like the subject more , they will feel a little bit smartter and the dates , the names and the places will be left in a second place , so this will even help them when they will have to memorize dates and such , because they will be able to associate the purposes and reasons of the events with the numbers and the names .

I believe that is not necessary for learning to be boring , if you just memorize everything and study just because you want to get a good grade , you are not doing the real purpose of learning , you 're just dealing with a lot of problems and getting yourself tired and bored .

Studying can be fun , if you understand everything you will feel smart , if you just learn the facts without actually understanding what they mean you will feel bad and less intelligent , so I think that teachers should encourage students to exceed themselves and to develop their intelligence and not to memorize a thousand books without understanding anything or withouth even learning things that will truly be helpful in your life .

People that are truly smart can solve a problem without the necessity of consulting someone else who 's supossed to be more intelligent , and if you need to read something a thousand times to actually get ahold of the idea you 're just a mere puppet and is pointless to live as a puppet because at the end of your life you will feel bad for having restricted your true intelligence .
