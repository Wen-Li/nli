I think that actually it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects ; because in this way a person will have a great knowledge of it 's own campus and will be able to investigate more about it , get deep into it , and dedicate enough time to get a complete management of this subject .

Our world is specialized , everything is divided and classified .
Everything is organized and put in a way that every little thing is different to the other .
The perfect examaple of this is a carreer in College .
The programs are divided into faculties and the careers that a person can pick of , like : Engineering , business , teaching , music , medicine , etc .
Every single one of the mentioned before is specialized in a field of studie , and deals with different aspects of knowledge , maths , biology , languages , politics , etc .
A world of possibilities .

It is not possible to a human being know all about something ; just a little bit of everything .
If a persons dedicates it 's entire life to study astronomy ; investigate , make studies , ask questions , promote projects , etc. , surely will get far and will adquire a huge knowledege in this field .
That person will go beyond than someone who studies a little bit of many academic subjects .
This takes time and effort , and there is not enough time in a human being 's life to get knowledge in many many different subjects and get as far as if there is specializing in one specific subject .

In the school , the kids get all the basic knowledges they need to start .
Then is their decision to go for the subject that they are more interested on .
This does not mean that a person has to specialize in one and only one subject and can not know anyhting about anything else .
This just means that that person will be more wise in that specific field and will contribute more to society and the world .
Specialize in one specific subject is equal to a better and deepest understading of it .
