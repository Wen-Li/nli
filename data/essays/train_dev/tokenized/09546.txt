I completely agree with the point that it is always best to travel in a group led by a guide .
Guide is a person who is especially appointed by the govt .
for the benefits of the visitors .
He is capable of providing explicit information about the tourist places .
So why not to take the benefits of the service provided when one is in a group .

Suppose you are travelling down in India with a group of friends .
Here the inscriptions giving tourist place 's technical details are very limited .
So a guide will thoroughly relish one with the date 's , histroy and all its related matters .
Moreover if the guide is not hired it might happen that some of your friends may go to other directions as per their interest , loose the fun of being together , acknowledge less information .

It 's always greater fun to be together while visiting places .
Else one may get bored .
So if a group has hired a guide it will be rather involutary that the group will stay bonded .
So there 's no risk of loosing someone behind on the trip .

The process of seeing new things will be extrememly sequential and meaningful because the guide will proceed step by step giving out inrtrigue infromation .
The group members might have some doubts regarding the monuments .
So it might happen that one might be able to understand the history better based on other 's doubts .
They could even discuss more things if they have come on a school assignment trip for the history class .
Also the guide will not dare to skip things inorder to save time and get more money as he fears the number of people .
It usaually happens in India though .
But more the people , greater the interest and this directly affects the enthusiasm of the guide .

A group could even share the tour guide 's expense so they could hire better guide than an individual .

It 's more a harmless option giving all the group members equal benefits with all the fun combined with travelling .
