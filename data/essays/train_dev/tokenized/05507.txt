We often hear people saying that young people should enjoy life as long as they still can .
Therefore , it is sort of commonly accepted that older people are not enjoying their lives , or at least less than the younger people .
We will discuss both sides of this statement , and will express our final point of view as a conclusion .

Young people have less responsibilities than older ones : older people are responsible of younger ones !
As an example , it is rare to see parents buying firecrackers to make a joke to their neighbour whereas it is cliche for youngsters to do so .
Young people do n't have to work as to make their family live ; they attend classes and have a lot of activities ; they are young and they enjoy themselves , because they simply have less responsibilities .
But this is a youngsters point of view .
Do older people really enjoy their life less than younger people ?

Obviously not .
For example , having a family and giving birth to an offspring is enjoyable , perhaps the most enjoyable thing in the world !
If older people enjoyed their lives less than younger ones , our world would be a very sad world . ..
Thus , some young people do not enjoy there life , and some old people obviously do .
The statement ca n't be true because of this simple fact .
Honestly , if older people did n't enjoy themselves as much as younger ones , would it be worth to live this ?
Obviously if life is not enjoyable , then life loses its primary purpose , and living this life would be purposeless .

I think the statement is a young people point of view , and is not really well thought .
At first , we feel it is true , but in fact it is because what we think is enjoyable or not changes when we get older !
Loving to read poetry at the age of 13 is rare , but at the age of 65 it can be fully appreciated and understood , because the person has more experience and can catch the sense of it .
I think that how we enjoy ourselves is different , but no one enjoys him or herself more than someone , based on his age .
Enjoying life is universal , and has no age .
Young people enjoy life as much as older people do , and vice-versa .
