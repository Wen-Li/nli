Students understand ideas and concepts .
Students also understand form learn facts .
In my opinion it is important students understand ideas and concepts before going to learning from facts because there are somany reasons in that some explanation with examples is given bellow .

Student learn ideas and concept of some topic is very important before going to learing facts .
For example take an experiment from a Chemistry lab , Without knowing idea and concept of the experiment what would do in the lab .
If possible someone do the experiment without knowing the ideas and concepts definetly some explosions go in lab because in the chemical lab we do the experiments whith carefully .
With out care , If we do the experiment in the lab definetly will going wrong .
For example H2so4 is highy acid , I remember in my class room in my college stadies some student without knowing the experiment details and ideas he want to do the lab .
He put some water into the H2so4 a big explosion took then my teacher scold that boy that is another matter .
Without knowing the knowldge and details he do the experment will give some bad conclusions .

Take another example some neclier experiments are down there in some country .
If we do the some wrong with knowing or without knowing there will go a big explosion .
In that place definetly we know the ideas and concepts , without knowing the concept and idea we can not do anything such places because nucclear wepones give big energy than any other .
Even Son also gives the energy based on the neclear energy .

Forthermore gives the safty and full detailed information about what student want to learn .
If student learn abouts concepts and ideas , He knows the entaire point about what student want to learn from facts .
This gives no loss of any thing around the place where the application do .

moreover some facts know by without knowing the idea and concepts that is another matters .
In my opinion we must know the ideas and concepts before attempting to learn the facts .
