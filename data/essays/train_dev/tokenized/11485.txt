Yes , I agree the Statement `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
Willing to travel along with a group of people is a good option rather than travelling alone .
There were many factors which will benfit us while we are travelling in a group led by a tour guide .

Firstly , by considering the security factor which is a big task in tours especially to forgien countries , we can feel more security while we are along with a group of people rather than alone .
Even in case of some tough situations we will get the support of everybody in a group .

Secondly , travelling in a group is economically more recomended than travelling alone .
We can share the experiences and joy while we are travelling in a group and we can benfit from most of the expenditures we will face .
Many tourism departments in various countries are offering good tourism packages for the people who are coming for forgien tours .
They are providing discounts and valid packages especially people travelling in a group rather than travelling alone .

Thirdly , we can have a planned timetable and we can have lot of fun all along the tour along with our group members , we can plan more programmes and events which will entertain us along with our fellow members and even we can had a large .
Even imagine if our group consist of various talented persons , the we can organise seminars on research oriented topics in a forgine land .

Lastly apart from the above factors i.e ; security , reducing expenditures , presenting individual talents and joy we get while travelling in a group .
We can also plan some industrial tours or join in a training programmes which will enhance our skills in our job and all and travelling in a group will always shows up the identity where ever we tour .
