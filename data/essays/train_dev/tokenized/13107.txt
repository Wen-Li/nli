I agree with the statement because being successful has to do more with attitud rather with aptitude .
From my former experiences as a Student and as a worker I would like to support my point of view .

Through studying International Relations at a top Mexican University I was able to understand the global context in which we live , nevertheless arly in my studies I realized that to enhgance my criterion regarding interational dealings I would have to delve into the area of sociology .

In depth personal resarch on this subjet has not only refined my capacity to understand but also my capacity to negotiate and go beyond the evident specially when dealing with different cultures and perspectives .
Among my favorite authors is Dr , Kevin Skandia who in his work `` the clash of civilizations '' he strongly bears , in one of his chapters , on the subjetc of leaderships and how to be successful .
He states that in order to become a leader and a pioneer you have to get out of the conventional , you and I have to go beyond the `` establishment '' to break the way things are done so as to create a best way to carry on things .
Obviously people have to take risks and have to be aware of failure , so successful people will go after their goal knowing in advance that they probably will fail , knowing that this is the best way to succeed .

My work as a specialized purchaser for Wal Mart , one of the largest retailers worldwide , has faced me with enormous challenges that have demanded full efectiveness to work well under pressure and competition , this experince has helped me to realized that innovation and imagination are two important tools to succed anywhere you are , and again in order to be successful we have to go beyond and to try new ways to do out duties .

Since it is company policy to upgrade the expertise of employees we are consistently enrolled in conferences and meetings , many international in nature , that have given me many an oportunity to exchange ideas and share decisions that helped us in our everyday jobs .
While exchanging ideas or having conversations from people around the world our conversations often drift to more casual topics like the everyday decisions we have to take in our lives , and we remark ourselves the importance to be sure of yourself and sure about the things you are to carry on in order to be successful .

At the end , I have always thought that only few people have the courage to do something else in order to break their `` satatus quo '' and those kind of persons are the ones who change and succed in what they are after , so I do think that successful people try new things and take risk .
