Advertisements often tease the pospective customer with the newest , most advanced and simply coolest goods or services .
To be unique in a diverse market environment it is literally inevitable to cheat the buyer .

Advertisements have to have a short and stong message .
Due to this briefness it is impossible to present the product in an appropriate and honest way .
Consumers who bought a product which was advertised as reliable or easy to use often are unsatisfied with what they finally hold in their hands .
But who is to blame ?
Of course the companies are presenting the products in the best possible way , that 's what I would do too .
On the other hand we , the customers , do n't want to hear lenghty advertisements in which products are explained in detail .

The phenomenon of wrongly advertised products is not a new one .
In my opinion people should be clever enough to know that companies say whatever it takes to sell a product .

For example when a cellphone is advertised the commercial could say : The best cellphone ever built .
This statement , of course , can not be prooved by anyone .
Therefore we have an exageration and probably even a false statement .

Another example is food and drinks .
How can a commercial seriously say : The most delicious burger ever .
A customer who buys and tries it ultimately has the expectation of a great burger .
But what if he does n't like it .
This means the advertisement industry is neither able to shape our taste nor to advertise products in a proper way .

So far I have been describing the black sheeps among the advertising companies .
Nonetheless there are companies who present their products honestly without exaggerations or even lies .
Especially when comparisons are made the customer can be sure to watch a good advertising .

In the end it 's all up the the prospective custome whether a commercial is believed or not .
