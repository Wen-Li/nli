The life is very beautiful if you know the way that you can enjoy for it .
Every one should enjoy in this life befor he/she die .
I agree that young people enjoy the life more than older people do because they are healthy , they have a lot of time , and they likes to go out always even they are busy .

The young people are healthy than the older people .
The people when they go out they only see young people play outside and they are enjoying when they play .
For example , everyday I go outside with my friends to play football and other games if we do not have a lot of works to do for school .

The older people are always busy with their works so they do not have a lot of time to enjoy in this life like a younger people .
The older people they have to put time for enjoying .
Always I ask my father to put time for us to have fun and go out to enjoy but he always say yes but he did not do it until now .

The older people when they busy they do not take a break for them to have a rest , but the younger people they give themself time when they feel angry or tired .
For example , I give my self time when I am tired but my father not and I asked him why but he did not give me an answer .

In short , everyone are younger will enjoy the life more than older people .
In my opinion , everyon have to enjoy in their life every moment .
