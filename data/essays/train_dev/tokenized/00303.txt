In my opinion , I do not agree the statement , for I believe there are three major point that can help to increase the number of car : new resources , growing populations , and new technolgies .
These elements will continue to push up demamds for cars .

First , we are now developong new energy resources substitute fossil fuels ; for example , solar energy and hydrogen energy .
These energies have two fascinating points ; they are safe to environment without producing any chemical substances causing pollution problems .
And , they are obtaind almost infinitely .
By refining these new technoligies can be applied in twenty years and we can use car without harming our planet .
That can be a strong element for the favor of cars .

Second , the convenient systems in cars are enhancing its ability .
For example , today we can reach destinations without losing our ways thanks to the navigation system supported by satelite communication .
Moreover , the safety of the car is improving ; the physical strength of the car body is becoming incredibly strong these days saving many drivers lives .
These new supporting systems or technologies provide more confort to the car users , which means the consumption for the cars will keep strong in future .

Third , the rapid growth of population in the world is going on for at least twenty years .
This means there will be growing demand for the cars continously .
Although we are also tryng to create new type of trains such as renior motored car that is moved by magnetic power , I think people tend to buy cars that can provide safe energy and fabulous convenience .
Actually , I experienced the subway newly constructed was not so used by citizens in New Delhi , India .

As stated above , there are three aspects supporting the stromg demands for cars : the development and applications of new resources , new technologies and systems gives drives more relaxing atmosphere , and the exposion of number of people who need cars in the world .
In twenty years , it is quite sure .
