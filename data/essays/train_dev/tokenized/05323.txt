I partially agree with this statement if we talk about the young people living in the developed countries , say , Taiwan .
As I see it , young people in today 's society like technology more than people .
Thus they may not pay enough attention to their own communities .
But on the other hand , young people nowadays have more opportunities to help other people , because we lead a richer and knowlegeable life than before .

We can say that young people born after 1985 are the generation of information technology .
They 've got familiar with usaing computers since they were very little , even at the age of 3 or 4 .
Growing up in this kind of background , they seem rather to pay more and more attention to `` machines '' such as person computers MP3 players and game players than to people .
In other words , they may spend much more time getting along with these devices of high technology instead of other people , including their communities .

Yet young people , who have grown up in such conditions , have more opportunities to help their communities .
Why ?
By using their outstanding computer skills , they can help their communities do a variety of things .
For example , they can teach elder people how to use computers and surf the Internet .
The things like that is very simple for young people yet is quite meaningful for older people who can not use such technology devices .
Connecting with the world through computers , and these older people 's life will change a lot .
In my neiborhood , there is a young people liking to teach older people in my community .
He said , `` by doing so makes his life more meaningful , and he is very happy to use the computer skill to help people .
It 's easier for him to do so
