Young people now-a-days do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I agree with the above statement that young people do not give enough time to help their communities .
There are many reasons to support this .

Firstly , in this competetive world young people are much concerned with their carreer , goals and their aims so , they are more involved in their studies .
As a purpose they go to college regularly and study their day to day lessons regularly .
The subject has become so vast that they have to refer many books and it takes much time for them .
So , they do not have much time on other activities such as , helping their communities .

Secondly , the people now a days show much interest in enjoying themselves with their friends .
They either go to movie or restaurants or pubs or to the play grounds with their friends .
They are always in a mood to enjoy themselves .
They do not help the communities because they do not spare their time to work on good things and helping their communities .

Thirdly , the people these days became very selfish and they do their own work which is helpful to that particular individual .
They does not want to help his communities which is beneficial to all .
That is why he concentrates mainly on his work rather than helping the community .

Finally , now-a-days people are more attracted to media such as television , newspapers , magazines , weeklys etc . , .
People are more concentrating on these knowing about the world through news papers and news on televisions and other means .
There is also a rapid growth of importance for computers and internet and it draws the attention of young people towards it .
Young people are much attracted to find the new things and they browse the internet spending most of their time finding out the information that is useful to them .

Due to these above stated reasons , now - a-days people , mainly youngsters do not spend enough time to help their communities .
