We are facing thousands of advertisements in our life .
They are easy to say `` nothing is better than this '' .
However are they all true ?
I do n't think so .
They do ` over-advertising ' the product than the real ability of it .

First , i declare most advertisements make goods seem much better than they are because of my experiences .
Last year , i had really long black hair but my hair condition was not good so that i decided to make my hair healthier .
At that time , a ran into some advertisment with a very attracitive woman and her hair looked like silk .
What i felt that time was , if i use that product i would have facinating hair like that woman 's !
I used it for a long time but i could n't have had a silky hair like that woman .
First i was depressed , but than i began to think , that 's what advertisers do .
` Over-advertising ' .

Moreover , in my opinion there is resonable reason that the company has to over-advertising .
From my experience that i mentioned above , i was wandering why they are doing it ?
Why could n't be just honest so that no one would expect which would be never happend .
Then , i got the idea .
There 's hundreds of different shampoo in the market .
To take attention from people , they have to be attractve to survive from the compete with others .

in short
