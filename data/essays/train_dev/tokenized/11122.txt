As a young person myself , I often feel guilty for spending so little time with the community .
I had often noticed that the social bonds between neighbors have diminished in recent years , and people are becoming less caring than before .
That 's why I think we should definitely spend more time helping our communities .

But how ?
The main reason nowadays that young people does n't spend much time with their communities is that they are crammed with homework , extracurricular activities , entertainment , ...
etc .
They are simply not spending a lot of time strolling about the neighborhood .
Without any interactions with their neighbors , young people will easily neglect their role as a member of their community .
Although they read about community service in their textbooks , few actually participate in it .
And when you ask them why , they simply reply : ` I do n't have time . '

So if we wish to solve this problem , the first thing to do is to decrease the amount of burden on young people .
Schools should end earlier so that young people can spend more time inside the community .
Teachers should give their students less work on weekends so they could have adequate time to conduct effective community service .
Parents should relieve their child of to much activity and they should not force them to go to cramschools .
Without these corrections to our education system , schools would end up to actually teach young people not to spend time with the community .

Of course , one might contend that young people will end up spending the extra time playing computers and not doing community service at all .
That might be the case for some kids , but in my opinion , if people felt they are involved in their community , they would try their best to make it better .
This sentiment can be further enhanced by government propaganda and social education .

It is everyone 's responsibillity to bring young people back to community service .
They should not simply put their blame on laziness manifested by the younger generation .
I pray for a day when the old bonds between neighbors can be re-established .
