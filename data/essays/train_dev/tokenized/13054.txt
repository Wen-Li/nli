I disagree with this statement .
It is true that enviromental problems around oils are risen nowadays and lots of car companies , for example Toyota Motors in Japan , hasten the speed to develop the new system of transportation which can be replaced from the transportation using cars .
Some people , especially ones who live in the metropolitan areas , may use such way of transportation .
As a result , the number of cars may decrease in those area .

But there is a condition to be such an area .
Those area should be developed well in its inflastructures and economics .
In other words , the area which is developing now can not afford to buy or develop that kind of system .
On the other hand , the demand for cars is thoght to be increasing as its economy grows bigger .
And cars are available for less amount of money than that costs to adopt the new kind of the transportation system .

Globally thinking , the population in the developing countries is higher than that of the developed .
If so , the speed of increasing the number of cars in the developing countries exceeds the speed of decreasing the number of cars in the developed countries .
This is the first reason for my opinion .

The second reason is that the demand of the cars would not be disappeared .
Car manias exist
