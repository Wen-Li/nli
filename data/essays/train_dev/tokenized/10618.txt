In my opinion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because facts make students bored while the ideas and concepts seemed as interesting .
First , from the beginning of my education in my school teachers always gave me some facts and everytime I asked myself what would I do with them .
I think learning facts would not improve students because we can not change these facts we can not deny them or we can not develop them .
The reason for this is that they are all about the past .
They have already proved and the last thing we can do is admitting them and living according to these facts .
On the other hand , bringing some ideas and understanding concepts is very important since you are thinking and creating your own values .

Second , when making a career , it is necessary to define what is happenning around the world .
You can not defend yourself according the facts but ideas or concepts .
You should make logical comments about global events not only about their obvious features but also what is hidden so that you should understand ideas and concepts to make sensible sentences .

Finally , I agree that it is important to understand ideas and concepts to be creative and sensible .
