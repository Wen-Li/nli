Although some may believe young people nowadays give plenty of time helping out their communities , I believe they do not .
There are two main reasons : their attitude and lack of time .

First of all , young people nowadays do not have the attitude or motivation to help out their community as they believe it has no benefit on them .
These young people believe they do not need to help out their community as they believe other people will do it instead of them or its simply a waste of time .
I believe they do not understand the moral of helping the community in need .
Furthermore , young people nowadays are a lot lazier than they used to be and so they lack the motive as they consider helping the community will be '' work '' , and as we all know , young people tend to dislike work as it is not enjoyable .
This motive is probably influenced from school work which is more of a requirement rather than a choice .

Secondly , the fact the world is becoming more competitive and also a lot more interesting , youngsters are becoming more involved in other activities and their studies rather than contributing towards their communities .
These young people may have objectives such as going to the best universities or simply enjoying life by relaxing , and in my personal experience , I have never come across a young individual who actually wants to give their time to help their communities .
As a result , as young people prefer to spend their time in a different way , there are very little that feels they should help out their communities .

In conclusion , as young people are not tempted to help the community as it is not enjoyable and the fact they have better , perhaps more important things that must be done , young people nowadays do not give enough time nor effort to helping their communities .
