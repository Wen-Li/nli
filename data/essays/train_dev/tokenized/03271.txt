If your goo what you already know your not successful you are just precise .
Their are a bunch of people that are good in what they already know but one makes successful people outstand is their ability to do things that they do not know .

Successful people try new things and take risks because this is what makes them successful persons .
If your good at something and you keep doing what you know you are not opening your horizons , you just stay in your comfort zone .
To be successful is to take risk , to be something more than ordinary .
Successful people try new things because if not they would not be successful persons they would be precise .
To be precise is not a bad thing because you are good at what your doing , that is part of being a successful person , but it does not make you a successful person because you can not do more ore simply do not know more , and that is why being precise is not being a successful person .

I agrre that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
People who are successful are good at everything the aim to be good at
