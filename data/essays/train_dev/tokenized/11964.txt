Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I completely agree with the statement above .
Albert Einstein quotes , `` Try to be a man of value and not a man of success . ''
Success follows people who are innovative in their ideas and are expressive to present them freely .
Albert Einstein never set out to come up with the `` Theory of relativity '' .
It was his desire to explore and question every aspect of everyday life which brought him the fame to be the inventor of `` Theory of relativity '' .

Constant change is the human nature .
And the people who bring about this change in an evident manner are the ones who are ready to think out-of-the-box .
Centuries ago , everything was done on paper , stories to accounts , medicine to religion etc .
Today , everything is written on tape drives and stored electronically .
Thanks to mankind , who was constantly looking for options to change .
We went from pen to typewriter and then to computer and to super computers today .
The numerous inventions made in every field of life are all because some one somewhere was thinking beyond the ways which they know how to do well .
It was the quest to do things better and add value to what is being done today , which led to new discoveries .

Take an example of Bill Gates , he is successful today because he started Microsoft , a Windows operating System which sits in almost every household today .
His desire to do something new brought him this fame .
And his quest to constantly bring about the change to the world is keeping his success intact .

In summary , it is seen all around , people who have taken the risk to do something new are the ones who got success and fame .
