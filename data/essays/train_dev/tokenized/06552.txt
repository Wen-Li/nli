For many decades professors , politicians , employers , intellectualls and students in Germany have been discussing the question what an academic education should be like : Is it better to educate the student to generalists or specilists ?
Some people say that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Although this idea is supported by good arguments , I prefer to specialize in one specific subject .

First , it is better to take a study course in which you are really interested in instead of taking coures in many different academic subjects , because the student can focus on one single topic .
If he concentrates on one specific subject , he will finish his study course right in time and will pass his exam with good marks .
Taking too many subject courses is very confusing , and a student does not have the time to deal with each single subject in the way he is supossed to be .
For example it is very complicated to combine a literary .
cultural or media study course with mathematics or ingeneering .

Second , companies nowadays are not interested in generalist , because they need specialist .
There are only a few branches where generalists can get a job .
Advertisement for jobs in newspaper always give a detailed description of the skills an employee should have .
And mostly only a specialist satisfies the companies ' needs .

Therefor specializing on one subject is the best way to get a good job .
Finally , being specailized in one specific subject does not prevent you from getting in touch with other academic topics and study courses .
If you are good in one topic , you might also deal with other academic subjects that are interesting .
But it is vital that you still focus on `` your '' study course .

Taking all this into consideration , I arrive at the conclusion that it is very important to specialize in one specific subject instead of having knowledge of many academic aspects .
In some way , we are all generalists .
But being a specialist is a unique characteristic that improves your chances to get a good job .
