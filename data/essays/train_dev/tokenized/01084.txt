I myself am considered a young person and live in a community compromising of both young and old .
It is a common perception that young people enjoy themselves more than older people do .
However , I think this perception is faulty .
In fact it is the older generation who enjoy life more .

Youth has many advantages .
It is perceived that young people enjoy more because they have more energy , enthusiasm and time .
However , what they do not account is the society and its demands .
With time our society has been evolving , It has become more demanding , more particular and much younger , Even though the younger generation does have more energy , enthusiasm etc. etc. it does not have then TIME to enjoy .

`` I wish the week had eight days '' - this is a common phrase heard from all young people across the globe .
Younsters are pushing themselves to become responsible and successful citizens everday .
They are always wanting to do more in less time .
Their life has peer pressure , study pressure , exam pressure , job pressure , personal pressure .
Added to this are various family , friends and other social obligations .
There is too much to achieve in such less time .
Thus the attributes which should have assisted them in enjoying life more become reason for them to work and achieve more .
Time is always short .
In this rush of things when does one get time to even breathe ?

In contrast , the older generation is at a stage where they have undergone all pschylogical , communal , religious , physical metamorphisis .
Thanks to various state and public policies they are no longer financially dependant in old age .
Thus they are free to experince life as it is .
Though they lack in the attributes favouring the younger generation they compensate by maturity , patience and motivation to truly enjoy life .

It is commonly said `` Life begins at Sixty '' .
This is true , because by this age one is free of all responsiblities and obligation and can enjoy life at their own pace .
There is true enjoyment only when one has TIME to experience every minute particle .
