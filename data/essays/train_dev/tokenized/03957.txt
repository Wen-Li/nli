I completely aggree with the statement .
Success is attained by forcing yourself to the limits , out of your confort zone , and conquering the challenge , whatever it may be .
Through preparation and acumen , and utilizing what you have learned in your past experiences , stepping out of the confort zone and facing a challege directly , is the best way to increase stamina and tolerance that will help make you become stronger .

For example , being a martial art student and observing the successful moves of my mentor and chief instructor , I can confidently state that he practices for success .
I met my instructor when he was merely a senior student , once he became the chief instructor and owner of the school , he revolutionized the curriculum to do things that had not been done before-this is getting out of your confort zone , knowing that you are doing well , but that you know you are capable of further success .
The chief instructor decided to expand the curriculum and incorporate social activities that will benefit the people in the community .
In order to do this he was forced to expand his staff on contract - this means that he committed to employ this staff for at least a year - , regardless of the outcome from the changes in the curriculum .
To make the story short , the exposure to community activity increased the popularity of our school , and the respect , reputation , and profits that came along with .
It would have been financially challenging for the school to have staff that would have not been needed , had the social activities addtion to the curriculom not succeeded-he would have thought of something though .
The chief instructor was looking to be more successful through innovation and thinking out of the box , and in my opinion , he attained his goal .

Another example , and a more common one , is the introduction of Microsoft Windows as an operating system in 1990 's .
Before , Windows came all about , most operating systems were based on prompt and response and peole were used to it .
Systems like DOS and Lunix that were monotonous , but worked well .
Mr. Gates took a tremendous risk in creating a whole new interface to use in the computer , an interface that was more expensive and complex , but turned out to be more effective and entertaining for most users .
Nowadays , Windows is the most popular operating system .
Taking risks means thinking out of the box , moreover , it takes courage and confidence , to materialize the idea .
Mr. Gates , thought Windows would work , took steps to attain his goal , and succeeded .

In conclusion , trying new things , while risky , can improve the individual and the outcome through challenging out endurance and tolerance .
No one says it will be easy , but if you are persistent enough , you will eventually succeed .
