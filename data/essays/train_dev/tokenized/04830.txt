There are young people and older people who were enjoying their life .
People who are young , they can go to school and learn subjects and skills that is fun and importance to do .
and they can make school friends ( classmates ) they can play or eating lunch together .
So Young people can go to school .
they can do any you want .
If they graduated university , they can have a job .

But older people were difficult to find jobs , so they ca n't do job anything they want .
for example if old person who wants to work at slary , but this job have a limit of ages .
or if old person take sporty job , like deliver to things .
Older people not have enough power than younger people .
But older people can living peacefuly , and young people have to working hard and they have no enough to spent time to reading novels at home , or watching TV .
But older people can do .

My grandmother is doing house jobs .
She often goes to shopping and she likes to cook at home .
She living peacefuly and enjoying her life .
But sometimes she thinks it 's boring because , it 's like she doing same thing every day .
So , she saids that if she change to young people she can do jobs in actively .
I thought it 's agree to her opinion .

One day I ask to grandmother to go Germanycome and enjoy with me. but she said she does n't want to go , because maybe she going to be very tired and she doe n't have power to go German .
So , I decide to go many overseas when I was on young age .
