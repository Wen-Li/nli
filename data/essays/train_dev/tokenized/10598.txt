Nowadays , there is a hot topic about whether young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Some people think that old people have more time to enjoy the life .
Others may disagree and contend that young people are more energetic and more likely to enjoy the life .
If I were faced this issue , I will definitely support the latter point .
there are numerous reasons to support this point and I would only explore some of them and describe as follows : The first and foremost reson to support my point is just as someone said , young people are more energetic than older people .
This is essily seen in the entertainment fields .
For example , young people are more concering on the entertainment events like movie , music , entertaining stars .
They will spend lots of their leisure time talking and watching them .
Their physical conditions also allow them to do so for a long time .
You seldom see the old people in a disco bar .
In a word , since young people have more power , they are more likely to enjoy the life .

The sencond and significant reason for my view is that young people are more creative than older people .
It is obvious in teenagers .
A scientific research show that since young people 's brain in the formative period , they conuld accept new things easily .
For instance , the Internet is widely used in the recent decades .
The user of them are mostly young people .
No wonder someone represent young people as the rising sun at about eight or nine o'clock .
their creativity enable them to enjoy the life most .

In conclusion , it is not hard to find that young people can enjoy life most than any other age people because of their energy and creativity .
But we also encourage the older people learn from the young and never give up the life .
