One thing history teaches manking is that extremes are never the best solution .
They might serve ones purposes for a short term , but on the longer run they usually reveal their shortcomings .

The very same rule can be applied in this case .

At a first glance , the advantages of a specified knowledge seem to be overwhelming .
Nearly every modern companie or even scientists in universities serve as good examples .
To be successful in your part of busines , you have to know everything about it , and additional knowledge only serves as distraction .
Since the times of big breaktrough-inventions are all gone , everybody specializes on a very narrow field .
On a small subject , we now have an absolute expert , knowing nearly everything about it .
To a certain extend this is absolutely necessary .
Who else can deal with nano-composites , for example , exept someone who has studied this subject for many years ?
But as soon as an wider overview is needed , this type of scientist very often fails How can he know about new methods in medicine , that might well be adopted within the field of nano composites , if all they ever studied are nano-composites ?
It is therefore possible , that lacking interdisciplinary skills often result in disadvantages .
Furthermore , a person with a tremendous amount of knowledge on only one field most definitely lacks interest in other things , and therefore misses so many things in life .

The other extreme would be people who know something about everything , but nothing of importance about any specific field .
While these scientists might have the interdisciplinary skills , they would certainly lack the knowledge they need to combine anything of real use and importance .
There is simply no need for these persons in academia , since a certain understanding of specific problems is always needed .

I therefore strongly support the idea of a combination of these two types .
Of course I am aware of the fact , that we can never gain specific knowledge on all academic subjects .
This will remain an illusion .

I favor the humanistic approach .
Specialize on one or two subjects , but never loose your abilitie to overview a wider field .
If you are a mechanical engineer , do n't loose your interest for theatre .
