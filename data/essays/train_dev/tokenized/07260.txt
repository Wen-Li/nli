By the end of our schooling we will have some knowledge about what each subjects describe and we will be left out to choose few subjects to continue our studies .

It is better to have knowledge about all the academic subjects than to specialize in one subject .
It is essential to know about each and every subject as we implement all the subjects in our lives and we should have some basic knowledge about them .

After reaching to certain level of learning in all the subjects with our own interest we can emphasize on learning one particular subject .
This will build self confidence in us and improve our skills as we try to learn things on self preparation .

We can take the theories provided by people who worked in the subject which we are interested and study them to give solutions to the problems which were not given by them .
This will make us learn new things related to the subject and improve our skills in a better manner .

Working in a single field is often said as research work .
This needs dedication towards the work and patience in doing the work .
Its takes much time to present a thesis on a particular topic , even few years .
This can be acheived only after passing certain stages of learning so in begging its better to have comprehended knowledge on all the subjects and as we move on in our life we can learn and dedicate ourself to a single subject .
