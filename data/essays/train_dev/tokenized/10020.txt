I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There are two reasons as follow .

First of all , most people would agree that the products in the advertisement are presented under the best circumstances since the purpose of advertisement is to sell the products .
For example , clothing manufacturers and designers put their clothes on good looking models which makes clothes more attractive .
Another example can be food advertisement .
Food is presented in the best dishes with picture perfect lightening and everything .
I remember that I had to return some of the products I bought because they were different from what I had seen on the Ads .

Secondly , advertisement is one of the most powerful ways for producers to communnicate and convince people that their products are benefitial to cutomers , Therefore , people tend to emphasize the strengths of the products rather than showing their shortcomings unless they are legally asked to do .
For example , when we listen to TV or radio commercial such as cosmetic items , we feel like that items can be solution to all of our skin problem .
The ad does not say how time or money consuming the products can be .
That is , I think , one of the reasons that certain products such as cigarettes or sleeping pills are required to state the possible side effects .
Unless the law requires , companies would not want to show their shortcomings .

As I stated above , advertisements are used to promote the slaes and communicate with cumstomers and viewers in favor of the products .
Consequently , I am truly convinced that products are better projected in advertisements than they are in reality in most cases .
