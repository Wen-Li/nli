Probably in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are now .
Today in particulary in Italy there are a very big problem about traffic , smog , parking , because the mostly of the people has a car .
In fact in a normal family there is minimum one car for each , while in a rich family you can find also more cars than the persons , who stay in the family .

In nowdays you can have and drive a car when you are fortheen , the youth don-t drive any more motorcicle , a little special car .
For these reasons in many cities you could-t drive all days of week , for exsample on monday in bologna from 8.30a.m. to 6.30p.m. it-s not apermitted to drive .
It-s a very huge problem also drive in particulary time , because you spend a lot of time in traffic jum , for exsample when you go to work , and maybe after a long time spends in your car you have to spend more time leave it , because you don-t find parking .

I hope for all these reasons , that in twenty years everything will change .
Perhaps in the futere in each town there will be a metro station a good train and bus station , so all the people can may use not their car but the pubblic trasports .
In the big cities there is now a pubblic trasport , but every often is not
