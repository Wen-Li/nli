People are always tending to pursue the most that they may obtain .
When it comes to the aspect of knowledge obtaining , the situation is similar .
However , sometimes they have to choose whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjets than to specialize in one specific subject .
For myself , I will choose the latter , but will try to get some balance as well .

Nowdays , knowledge is exploding everyday , as a result , it is rather difficult for one to learn broadly and deeply at the same time .
Having broad knowledge seems attractive , but actually , it is not practical after the second thought .
In the academic circle , there are experts and authorities in almost every field , all of whom hold some specific research interests and accompishment of their own .
If one just spend most of the time on learning knowledge of many subjects , he or she may not have the time to do related research .
Besides , since it is quite easy to gain information currently , it is not necessary to know all , for if you want , you can look the needed information soon .

However , if one specialize in one specific subject , things will be quite different , especially when he or she choose a valuable but rarely-touched field .
Under this situation , he or she will become the expert in this field and it is possible to do some quite profound research on it , which will be more benifitable if one knows about a lot but really knows little on each subject .
As long as the researchers are willing to share their results , communicat to each other , and do teamwork when it is necessary , it does not matter whether all these researchers are able to have broad knowledge .

At the same time , to keep some balance , it is also important for a researcher to know some basic knowledge on related subjects , which could broaden the eyesight and inspire him or her fresh ideas .
Besides , this will not waste too much time .

To sum up , generally , I think it is better for one to specialize in cetain subject , but it will be good to know some concerning knowledge at the same time , which can make the work most effectively .
