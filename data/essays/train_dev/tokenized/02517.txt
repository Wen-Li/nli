In todays world of cut throat competition , advertising plays a major role in increasing the sale of any product .
There is a large variety of products available in the market today .
Similar products are manufactured by many companies .
Hence customer today has a variety of chooice .

The differences in these similar products may be very minute .
The advertising helps in exaggerating this diffeences .
Take cars for example .
One car manufacturer may exaggerate about the spaciousness in the car by comparing it to a lounge ambience in its advertisement .
Another car manufacurer in the same category may emphasize on the outer design of the car comparing it with the aerodynamics of a spaceship .
Thus both the manufacturers have a selling point to be amphasized .

But as the saying goes looks can be decieving because all that glitters is not gold .
There are so many instances in which the customer is fooled into buying a product because of the galmour created around it through advertising .
These instances are coming to life almost everyday .
There are many letters in the ` letter to the Editor ' columns of newspapers that highlight this point .
Let us consider a simple example of buying an apartment .
One of my close friends wanted to buy a new apartment .
He collected many brochures and visited many incomplete sites of construction .
He decided to finalize on the basis of the brochure comparison .
The brochure of the apartment he zeroed on spoke about the spacious rooms , facilities like gym , sauna , play park and many more amenities .
After actually shifting to the apartment he was surprised to see big spacious rooms accompanied with lot of plumbing problems , no gym , the sauna without water in the pipes and so on .
But if the advertisement hoardings were to be followed , this was a dream apartment .
This is a common case for a large variety of products .

Going from the advertising point of view , the advertisers are paid to make the products look good even if they actually arent .
Take an example of a popular razor which shows leading sports personalities using it .
This razor actually caused skin problems to a customer according to a news paper .
But the company that made this ad made profit and successfully helped in selling the product .

There are many more instances which help in supporting the statement that advertisements do make products look much better than they actually are and I completely agree with this notion .
