First of all , I strongly disagree the idea of young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I am thinking that older people could enjoy their life .

Evidently , young people are busy to prepare their future life .
Specially , after starting school , they spend the most of time to study and learn skills .
Also , they have a lot of questions of real life as they are growing and try to figure out the problelm through talk with friends or parents .
They could enjoy life to spend time with friends but this is not enjoying .
I would like to say that is one of learning how to stand between people in our society .

Some young people are not like that I mention in above .
They are just spend time for fun .
They do not thinking about their future .
However , in this case is not only for all of young generation .

On the other hand , older people could enjoy their life .
They have comfortable time and money .
Older people who have a career on their job and good health , of caurse they can do .
Also , it cuold be good model to young gerneration .
Even my parents usually have a short trip together on weekend .
When I see them , I am very envy them and I could have a chance to think about my life .

There are many kind of way to enjoy life and everyone do .
I support that many older people do comfortably enjoy life .
