There are discussion that in the future , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Although some people thinks that using the car increase than nowadays .
Because they think that the car is the most thing to not improve and they do n't have side-effects .
But I think that there will be decrease in using the car in the future .
There are several reasons .

First , Nowadays , there is problem that oil , gas is reduce because of unplanned excavation .
So it cause to lack of oil to move .
It means that although we have a lot of cars , we can not drive because there is no oil to move .
Therefore we need to other substitute oil or alternating method for movements .
I think that find alternating methods for movements outweigh to find other oil .

Second , The car cause pollution of air .
Actually the car produce CO2 , NOx .
It increase earth 's temperature .
So , the height of sea is increase .
Maybe our lands will be under the water .
Imagine that condition you do n't have land to plant and to live in .
From these problem , many human is studying to find other method to move that it is not cause to pollute the air .

Third , the car is unconvenient .
Because it can not only out of order frequently but also ca n't cross the other continent .
Nowadays , there is global world .
So to increase the power of nation , we should invent free-cross continents like ship and planes to trade easily .

For these above mentioned reasons , there is no doubt in my mind that there will be fewer cars in use , in the future .
Because it cause air pollution and gradually the oil is reduced .
