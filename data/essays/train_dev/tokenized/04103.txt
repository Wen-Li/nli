Yes I do agree with that young people nowadays do not giving enough time to helping communities .
Bcause nowadays young people very much intersted in enjoyment and they don n't care what is happening in their community .
what is a community ? .
community is group of people living place with similar custooms , and helpling each other in need .

Even though if you are busy with your work , studies or somthing else as member of your community you need to help in the development of your community .
But the present youth not helping thier community rather they are wasting thier time by spending time in internet cafe , watching movies , or romonig around the city .
They could help thier community by doing some volunteer work .

Mainely the youth is getting distracted into unnessasory thing , like wasting tmie on browsing , chatting rubbish with somebody .
What the youth thinking is enjoyment , for that they are drinking in the pubs .
spending the whole evening in the pubs or roads .
Rather they could do some thin in the evening or at any time when ever they are free , by participating in progarmmes which were planned for community development .

In addition they don n't luistening to their parent about thier involvement in development of their community .

On the whole , I can conclude one main thing is that as a part of your community youth should help their community by spending soome daily you could do some thing which ids usel to your community .
