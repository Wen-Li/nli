I agree with the atatement that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years .
There will be three points to support my idea .
Then , I will list these three points as follows :

First of all , the governments of today put more investment to improve the public traffic mass , and there will be less need to purchase a private car .
Most of the people in our city buy cars because there are so few public bus and subways , and It always make them be late to work or school .
So if the government gives its buget more to build the public traffic system , fewer citizens will buy cars .
And since the Traffic mass Action began progress in our city , the number of the cars has already declined .

Another thing that will due to the reduction of the car 's number is that the less amount and the large expense of the crude oil resources .
Nowadays , fewer oil field can be entract enough crude oils for people to use .
In order to explore new oil resources , we put our eye to the sea floor .
You know , to drill an oil well on the sea floor need much more expences and more modern techniques .
In addition to the war began in the Middle East , the expense of the oil raised far more repaid than we could expected .
If we want to run a car , we should spend more money on the expense of fuel then ever before .
And I think this situation will not be change in the next twenty years .
As a result , it will make us reduce to use car than nowadays .

Last but not the least is that the people 's conception to protect the environment and reduce the pollution .
By using car , it will cause a lot of environment problems such as air pollution , noise pollution .
All these will be harm to human 's body .
However , people now concerntrate more on the health problem than ever before .
So they will reduce the use of cars to decline the pollution it caused .
For this reason , the number of cars will of course be delined in next 20 years .

All in all , the governments ' action , the limited natural resources , and the mind of people to decline the pollution all put functions in the reducted number of cars .
And I also think fewer cars will make our life better and will also do good to the whole society .
