Indeed , many succeful people in the history were willing try new things and take risks , but do all the succeful people try new things and take risks ?
I do n't think so .
I think successful people are the ones who are topest in thier field .
If he or she can do one thing best , he or she will be a succeeful person .
For this point of view , successful people do not always have to try new things and take risks .

We see some one who do somethings new and succeeds , so that we say succed people `` always '' try new thing and take risk .
I thinK it 's too abrupt .
We will say that , because we only see the succeful ones .
We have little chances to the failed one .
Trying new things and taking risks also means high prossibilty of failure .
Therefore , many people prefer to spend their time on what is already known .
and they work hard so that they can outbeat their rivals .

Also , only the `` try '' is not enough .
We have to spend more time and energy to improve the invitation .
And the improvement part are more annoying and complicate .
If he or she are one who are only willing to spend their time to find or invite somethhimg new , but too lazy to improve it , he or she will not succeed .
On the other hand , if there is a one who are willing to work hard to find the imporving ways , one is more likely to succed that the original invitor or finder .

Take Janpan for example .
TheAmerican invite cars , but they do n't spemd time to improve cars .
And Janpanese spend a lot of time and money to improve cars .
Now , Janpan becomes the biggest contry producing cars .

Therefore , I think the keypoint of success is not trying new things , but willing to work hard or not .
