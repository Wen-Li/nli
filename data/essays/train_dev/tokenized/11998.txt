Some people might say that its better to a ` Master of one than being a Jack of All ' .
But in my personal opinion , its better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in just one .
Life is made up of not just thing , but a variety of things and subjects .
It is important for any individual to know atleast the basics of almost all , if not all , subjects .
Life is integrated with various issues .

The main reason for me to support that experience and knowledge is needed in various aspects of life is to survive in this constant-changing world .
World can take up any turn in any time of life .
It is hard to predict the twists in the market .
Market in one field can drop down suddenly one day , and all businesses in that field will close .
So its better to have knowledge of other fields , atleast the preliminary knowledge and skills so that the person can think of starting up of new business if one does n't work .

Second point is recreation .
If a person knows few more things to do life other than his regular routine work , it will be like a change for him , which he can enjoy and have fun .
You get to know more people around you when to interact , and will help to build relationships between them .

Its a part of our duty to maintain a balance of everything in life .
Let us consider one example , currently its the trend of computers and technology , and many people will only take up subjects in Computer science and neglect other aspects like Ecology , Sociology and Economics .
Who should care for the betterment and preservation of nature and nation , if no person is knowlegeable about the least the basics of ecology .
Everyone should be aware of things taking place in and around his place , his society and nation as a whole .

General knowledge is required to be successfull in life .
Every business tycoon in this country has a varied fields of experience and knowledge .
If we consider the owner of McDonald 's , who is not just a hotelier but a realtor too .
Only because of this , he is able to start up millions of McDonald 's centers in every busy commercial corner of the World .
He integrated his knowledge of marketing and real-estates into the knowledge of food-industry .

Thus to conclude , in my views I feel that to lead an independent and successful life , its necessary to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and strongly agree with the statement .
