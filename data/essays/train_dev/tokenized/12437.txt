Everyone has one day dreamt of inventing something new which would make him rich and successful .
I must say I believe in people 's intelligence .
I mean that we are all capable of inventing something which will make us rich .
So I do agree with this statememt because being successful is only the last thing you get when you try new things .

When you try new things you do it because you think that what you are trying worth the energy you are spending to do it .
You are ready to do whatever it takes to accomplish what you began .
You are over motivated and that 's why you succeed in you attempt .
This motivation shows your ambition and that 's how you are going to make it .
For example the film Beatrix Potter shows why she became famous , that 's because she knew her idea was good and she had enough motivation to get refusals and to be desapproved by her father .

And once you have succeed you always want to have this feeling again .
The feeling that nothing can stop you , like Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic , you think you are the king of the world .
If you try something new or to invent something it is because you do n't like to do always the same thing even you can do it very well .
It is a lot more exciting to invent something , to think day and night on how you can develop an idea and make it real .

Finally , you try new things because it makes you successful .
You do n't like to be like everyone else , you want to be apart of the others .
And even if you are doing something very well you have to try new things or a new way to do it because it will show that you do n't rely on your knowledge .
It will show that you really want to improve yoursel .
Mozart is considered as a genius because he not only knew how to play an instrument very young but also because he created symphonies at a very young age .

As a conclusion I would say that everyone should try new things , it is not interessant to rely on what someone else crated for us .
We have the try something new as well .
