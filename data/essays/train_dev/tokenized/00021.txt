I disagree that the trip which is led by a tour guide in a group is a best way to travel .

Surely , if we travel with a tour gude , we can enjoy a trip even if we can not speal english well because if we have a problem , a tour guide will help us to solve the problem .
In addition , we can go to famous place in a good way .
It means that we can go many place without waste time .
At the same time , we will be able to get a lot of knowledges about the place which we go from a tour guide .
If we travel with tour guide , we will enjoy and we will be safe .

However , if we travel with a tour guide in a group , we have to mind time anytime .
If we have free time , we have to come back on time which a tour giude says .
If we want to look more , we can not do that if we travel with a tour guide .
If we have a place which we want to go , we can not go there if the place is not the place of course even if the place is very near the way of course .
If we travel by ourselves , we do n't need mind time .
we can stay the place as we want .
Furthermore , we can make a plan the travel as we want .
Therefore , we do n't need got to the place which we are not interested in and we can go to the place only we are interested in .

In my opinion , planning the trip is one of the enjoyments of trip .
If we make a plan from first to finish , we may have some ploblem .
However , if the trip is finish , we can get a lot of happiness .
Therefore , Idisagree
