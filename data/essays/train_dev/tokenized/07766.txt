Most people thing that is more to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because you can know more things of everything , I thing is more more important to know and specialiced in one specifict subject bescause , do you really get to know a specific thing , you get the oportunity to work in what you have learn and do it well .

Knowing a specific thing or subject do you really have the oportunity to became a profecional because you have the time to study a specific subject , because is what you really whant to learn more about and is what you like , if for an example a people whant to study many academic subject this persond have to study all the life to really get to know and learn many things .

Olso you get the oportunity to work in what you are really interest of and what you really like and whant to do the rest of you life , because if you like what you do and what you have learn you have the chace to be the best in what yo do , for example if you do something that you are not really interes in doing it and you just do it because you have to you could not doing that well and its going to be a waist of time .

In conclution i think that is more important that a persond specialize in what they really care about and what they really whant so in this way they can gift the best of their self and not to missed their time studyind things that are not really important or dont have interest for them , for me this would be a waist of timeand the life is to shot to waisted .
