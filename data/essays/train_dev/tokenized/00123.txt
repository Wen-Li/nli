I disagree with the opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because I know a lot of young people do help their communities .

I have friends who are engaged in the group of comedians .
They are all from 20 to around 30 years old .
Whereas they perform at theaters to make money , they also perform for children and elderly people at daycare centers .
They says that they just really like to see the audiences laughing .

I know a group which is called `` Guardian Angels . ''
The group is consisted of about 50 young people .
The members of the group patroll around downtown and if they find someone who needs help , they help or advise him/her .
For example , when they find girls who are under 18 or younger after midnight in the street , they convinced them to go home earlier .

Another example is that a young woman help her community develop their sight-seeing industry .
She works at a travel agency in her small town .
Because she wanted to make her town well-known , she decided to appeal her town .
She planned to have a festival and carried it out .
People in the town cooperated with her and brought a lot of food , crafts and suvenirs to the festival .
As a result , a lot of people came to visit her town and the town has improved their sight-seeing industry .

Thus , a lot of young people are assosiated with their communities and contribute to them .
They simply enjoy helping their communities .
