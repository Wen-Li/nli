Have you ever experience it ?
Helping ohteres often gives you a special feeling of joy and confidence .
But I think nowadays only a few young people have experienced it .
Many young people do not give enough time to helping their comunities .

Let us begin with an example in my own community .
When I take a look at the group sise of our local Red Cross facility , I could see a continually decreasing of members .
Sometimes we did n't know how to fill the sceduals .
One reason for this is maybe the little time many students and peoples have nowadays .
If you want to compete for a good job or a high education you have to work hard and so you have less time for other things .

But when we take a closer look , everybody should have more free time than it used to be .
Many new inventions let us complete everyday routines much quicker , for example computers and telecomunications .

I think the real problem today is the change of lifestyle .
It seems like every day we get a new possibility how to use our free time , for instance waching the lates movie or getting to the newly opend bar in the city .
Young people do help in their comunities because they think they have to try all these posibilities .

But all these new things does n't improve your feeling of confidence .
When some people would get acive in their community they would experience how much fun it is to help .
In conclusion I agree to the statement but I think helping in communities could be easily improved if people try it .

you are often more often give you more happiness than do thomet
