In modern societies people are confrontated with all kinds of advertisements daily .
Commercials on TV , huge wall papers and other kinds of advertisments influence and manipulate people to make them buy products .
Are these advertisements really truthful though ?
Or do they promise som things that do n't even exsist ?

I personally think that most advertisements make products seem a lot better than they really are .
We just have to look at TV commercials to realize that they often promise more than the products actually offer .

Let 's look at the pharmaceutical industry for example .
Every day we get to hear about new cosmetic products for beutiful skin or pills that help to lose weight .
I tried many of these products and I was never pleased with them .

Another example for false advertising are food commercials .
Specific products we see on TV do often seem to be a lot larger than they actually are .
With help of computer programs people are able to make their products look better on TV or on a paper .
They use specific technical methods to convince their costumers of their items .

A third example for the lacking of truth on advertisements are the methods of politicians to get more votes .
They often promise great achievements and advertise with big headlines on wallpapers that they are going to improve the country 's situation .
I have gained the experience that they usually do n't keep their promisses .

I come to the conclusion that we should be really careful about believing what advertisements promise us .
Many of them do n't tell the truth about their products .
I personally think that these false promises are even the essential element of advertisements .
We know that their only purpose is to convince people .
Therefor advertisements do always only show positive aspects of their products .
Besides our economy puts a great amount of pressure on firms who try to sell products .
There is a huge competition between companies and everyone has to sell as many products as possible in order to survive .
This forces people to create advertisements that are convincing and persuasive , even if that means that they have to hide the truth and to be unrealistic .
