The older generation sometimes says that the younger generation does not play an active role in helping their communities anymore .
They think that the younger generation is selfish and only wants to earn a lot of money .
There are a few points supporting this opinion but there are also a few against it .

The first thing to say is that the traditional bonds between the younger and older generation have dissolved nearly completely .
E.g. it is not common anymore that both generations live together in one house .
Therefore the younger generation can not feel this strong sense of community that once existed .
From this on I think that the younger generation is involved in several other activitites to help their communities .
First , there are a lot of teenagers who help the church or the local administration , e.g. during elections .
I have some friends doing that and I can say that the work they do there is really admirable .
Second , there are many teenagers who are involved fighting against environmental problems .
These activities are really beneficial to the local community because they help to achive a sustainable lifestyle .
The last point is that many students are working hard for school or university .
That does not only mean that they want to achive professional success but they also want to improve life at school or university for theirselves and for all other students .

Now let me talk about a point I 've just mentioned : the hard work for school or university .
Of course this means that they have to spend a lot of time learning and not directly helping their community .
But I think that learning is the best way to achive a good life for the whole community .
The young generation knows that without working hard they wo n't be able to achive a good life for their community , e.g. if there are no skilled workers in town economy and finally the whole community will suffer a lot .

Finally you could say that it 's not true that young people today do not spend enough time to help their community .
As we 've seen , young people engage in a lot of activities in order to help their community but they do this differently than the generations before .
