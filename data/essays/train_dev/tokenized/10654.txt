First of all , I agree with the statement given here that `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a fow guide ''

My first reason is , as we go to a new palce , we may not be knowing how the place will be , how will be the behaviour of the people , what their culture is , what their custumes are , whta their tradition is etc .
If we go to some american countires , we may find some difficulty , understanding their language and aslo we can not understand their accent eventhough their speak english .
For example suppose you planned to go France .
The language the people speak there is French .
You may not understand French .
Here you need a guide .

My second reason is , if the palce you planned to tour a historic place without a guide , you finally end up with the rockey structures you saw there .
As each historic place has a history behind in the main purpose of visi is to know its history .
As we are not familiar with the palce and its history , a guide it is right person to expalin it .
Fot example , take an instance os vising mahabalipuram , a famous historic site in India .
It 's all filled with temples made ofrock , carring on stone etc .
We need a guide to expalin what rocky strutures are .

And lastly the important thing is fullfilling the purpose for which have spent the money , lets suppose you have palnned an Europe tour .
But you did not have a proper person with you to expalin their what is the purpose of visiting is not knowing any thing .
