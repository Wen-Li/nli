I agree with this satement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are , because of following reason .

There are many accidents concerned with over advertisemnts in recently .
Because of development of internet , people can buy goods any time they want .
this convenience cause many troubles .
People depend on information provided by others who people not know at all .
But , they have confident information includeing advertisnements on not only internet but also magazines and CMs , because people have not other informetion .
So , not only I but also many people feel It is not as wellas the advertisement said .

In fact , I have an experience .
I like to read books and I found an article in internet about a book to find grest book .
The book was wriiten about history in which I am imterested .
I found , bought , and read it .
However , all I found is this book is boring .
the reason I want to read this is the words : this book make a big change on your life , becasue storys i theis book were written interestly .
I do not like study history but read about history .
I excited it must be written like novels , but the book like a textbook I used in class .
So , since this time , I do not buy any books which I can not see the surface .

Because of the reasons , I agree with that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .
Additionally , compernyes try to make products seems much better .
This is also the reasons to make people feel that this is good product .
