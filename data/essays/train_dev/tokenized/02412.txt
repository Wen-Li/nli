In our century , advertising is everywhere .
We have to deal with and to be aware of adverstisement 's tricks .
To my mind , most advertisements make products seems much better than they really are .

Indeed , the aim of an advertisement is to sell a product .
That is why they are ready to say everythings which can convince you to buy it .
People who do advertisement have not the due to say the truth , their goal is only commercial , not educative .
So how can we trust adversting ?
To illustrate this fact , we can take the example of Mc Donalds .
If we look an adverstisement for this restaurant , we can learn that meals are usually very dietetic , they are not bad for the health and pictures of meals are really teasing .
But according to the experience make on Mc Donalds ' food in Supersize me , we can see that , this food is not good for the health .

To give another example , we can considerate make up advertisement .
Women who plays in these advertisments are models and if we put this make up , we will not looking at the model .
Moreover , on her rimmel seems to be something very efficient but on we it does not have the same effect !
So the product work better on TV or on adverstisement than on the real life .
It is usually the same for washing products which wash our clothes more white than white .

We have to keep in mind that : advertising world is an i ; aginary world where everything is perfect .
That is not supposed to reflect the reality .
That sells we dream and that is what we buy when we buy a product after have seen it advertisement .
Indeed all is facke on an advertisement , people on are retouching , they always seem happy , and think everything is delicious or amazing .

To conclude we can say that , yes adverstisement makes usually products better than they really are because there main stake is to sell something and not to be true .
