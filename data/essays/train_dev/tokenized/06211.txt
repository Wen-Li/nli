I think , the main point of inventing is curiosity .
I absolutaly agree with this statement .
Succesful people try new things and take risks rather tahn only ding what they already know how to do well .
There are many charecteristics that make a person successful .
Tenecity and intellenge are only two of these .

F ?
rstly , if a person has tenacity , he/she never gives up , never accepts ` no ' for an answer .
He/she studies hard to succeeds his/her goal .
He is curious about his target .
He does his best to achieve his goal for this target .
He is so willing to learn new informations and making new inventions .
For example , one of the great genious of our worlds is Einstein .
He was a big inventor .
And we are still using his theories in our classes .
I think he gather his ambitions , intellegence and tenecity and form a person who will not be forget at any time of the world .

Secondly , intellegence is a vey important factor that makes a person successful .
If a person is intellegent , He/she can understand the problems easyly and does his/her best to cope with it .
If people in our worlds do not be curious about new inventions , nothing could be found .
For example , tecnology can not be improved widely , beneficial investigations about our era 's diseas cancer can not be found .
These are all beneficial to human beings .

To sum up , nothing can be done without risking anything .
The world is improving rapidly .
People must always learn something to cope with these changes .
They mustnot be frighten of the new improvement and new tecnology .
Also , they must think ` what must I do to improve myself ' instead of doing well what they already know .
They have to do this not only for theirselves , also for the beneficial of all people around world .
