I completely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Enjoyment in itself is symbolic for freshness .
Age certainly is a big factor in determining the freshness at heart to enjoy life at the fullest .

The most important factor that supports this idea is that young people are away from responsibilities and day-to-day life woes .
They are either dependent on their parents or have some support for themselves .
This kind of independence enthuses them to feel free thereby adding on to the fun in their life .
Older people are experienced and have families to look upon .
Their domain starts and finishes with their families .
So their enjoyment is limited to families , colleagues and near-ones .
Moreover with the passage of time , the feeling of being satisfied with life increases .
The needs shrink to bare minimum and emotional support dominates over feelings of enjoyment .
Especially those who enjoyed a lot at a younger age tend to get away from enjoyment in older age .
Take for instance , in countries like India and Sri Lanka , older people find pleasure in spiritual activities and become more inclined towards leading an ascetic life refraining themselves from enjoyment altogether .

Other factor that helps young people to enjoy life more is the state of their health , which certainly is better than older people .
As age advances , the body does not allow all activities to be done they could be done during young age .
For example young people can have no limits on eating , say , chocolates , but older people ca n't do so .

Young people , being adventurous at heart , tend to take challenges , make new friends and thus expand their social circle and broaden their horizon .
On the other hand , older ones do not mix up so easily and rely on already built up relations .
Another argument that favours the statement is that since older people have already enjoyed at some point of time in their lives , so they feel filled and complete in themselves and are left practically with no desire to enjoy .
Thus it is quite convincing to believe that young people enjoy more than older ones .
