I mainly agree with the statement that people enjoy life more when they are young than when they get older .
But some details need to be analysed to proove this idea .

The first point is related to brithday anniversaries .
It is common that children and teenagers are often very happy when they get one year older .
This is often related to presents , parties , and lots of friends wishing a happy birthday .
But old people , are very often sad and ashamed of getting older , and they anniversary remind them of those feelings .

The way people enjoy life depends on their age .
It is different if we consider children , or teenagers , or adults .

Children seem to be happy very often .
They can enjoy any little trick during hours and keep smiling and laughing without any relevant reason .
Children do not have to worry about important things , indeed , they even do not know about them thanks to their parents that try to keep them apart of any troubles .

The way of enjoying life changes as the children become teenagers .
The main reason of teenagers enjoying life is freedom .
Even this often goes along with little fights with their parents , teenagers have the will to create their freedom by prooving that they can be independant .
As they feel free , teenagers have new hobbies , sometimes forbidden , but they enjoy the risks they take .

In opposition with the happyness of children and teenagers , adults can not enjoy life as easily .
Being an adults means having reponsabilities .
Adults have to work to earn money and have lots of bonds which keep them out or entertaining and enjoying life .
Moreover , when adults have children , they manage to offer their children the happiest life they can .
So they do not hesitate to sacrifice their own happyness to the benefit of their family .
But even if that is difficult , parents enjoy every little moment of happyness they can share with their children .
