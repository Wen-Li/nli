That is right that some people think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I will explain in this writing which is my opinion .

I am 18 years old and then I am just an adult .
That means that I heard this statement there is not a long time .
In fact , all grandparents or parents said that their children do not do all they must do for the community .
Then they think that young people nowadays do not give enought time to helping their communities .
They always said that their childhood was more difficult than it is for us .
It is very boring when all the time parents are against you do or have done .
That is why , I am disagree with this statement .
I will explain much better the reasons in a second paragraph .

This statement is for my opinion wrong .
In fact a lot of people help old age people when they need some help .
They often help their parents at home and they do a lot of activities .
I think that help the community do not you ?
Going to school is not really helping the community at the begining .
But if young people do not do studies the community will fall down because we need people who have done a lot of studies to manage the other .

For my point of view old people think that because they do things which do not do .
Like to go to see old people in their house , doing activities for their town like organize the next party . ..
That are activities that we do not have any time to do .
Because between the courses , the sport and generally social activities it is difficult to find a moment to do what they do .

As a conclusion , like you have seen I am really disagree with this statement .
And I do not like when my grandmother said me that !!!!!!!!
