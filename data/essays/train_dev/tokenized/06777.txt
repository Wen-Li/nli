In my opinion is better to have a knowledge specialize in one specific subject because this is better to know a thing as well as you can .
This is true in all the experiences of the life : refered to the university ( the italian university ) we can take the example of the of the two years of specialization .

An other example we can find in a great company , infact each people that there are in this have a specific work to do and this bring to an excellent final operation .

A person that are magnifically prepare on one thing will arrive at a sicure result because that `` is your bred '' ; we can also observe that the most good professors , scientists , nobels , athlets are all specialize on that they work and do not specialize on many works .

We can also saw that the colloboration of great brains , each of them specialized on a thing , is important in many ways of the our life .
