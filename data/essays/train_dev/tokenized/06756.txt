In my opinion , this is a very strong statement and I can not totally agree with it in the way in which it is currently phrased .
As a first general point , I think that similar statements can never hold absolutely true or false , so before discussing the merit of my opinion , I would like to narrow down the reach of the statement by specifying a particular geographical or cultural setting that we are referring to when talking about young people and their communities .
I will therefore take my home country as a reference .

Communities face constant changes as society as a whole change , and most of these changes result into challenges and demands imposed over individuals of all ages .
In particular , the beginning of the 21st century has seen a macroconomy revolution in terms of the labour market - in particular highly specialised and trained labour - and information technology resources .
Extensive outsourcing of certain services to Asian countries and moving big parts of the manufacturing industries to the Far East caused many young people to be unemployed in Europe , and in my home country too , as a result .
Where once communities used to be wealthy and secure employment could guarantee social welfare and enough free time for everyone to spend with their families or in social activities , now the younger generations face difficulties in earning enough to mantain thei usual standards of living .
I agree that they spend less time helping out their communities , and Therefore , it is understandable that they will have to dedicate a lot of time to job hunting or even engage into a second and a third occupation , and will have no time or energy to spend on helping the community they live in .
Well organised activities such as participation into charities work , or more spontaneous and ` private ' ones such as caring for an elderly member of the family or a disabled neighbour will eventually have to be put aside by those young who face economic difficulties , and will only be pursued by the luckiest individuals who do not have to worry about earning enough to feed themselves and their children .
