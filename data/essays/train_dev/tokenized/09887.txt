Going outside more , playing some games or living life little bit faster than other people does n't make life to more enjoying .

Go to the disco or playing to the computer maybe able to make life enoying for some young people but the same time it cound be very boring for older people .

Usually older people like to quite place .
They enyoj to do reading book or newspaper , gardening or that kind of relaxing and enjoying works .
Some times Grandparents and grandchildren go to vacation at summer time together .
Usually grandchildren go to pool or beach and swim all day or play something with their friends .
Grandparents usually stay at home or hotel and they spent their time relaxing .
It doens't mean they are not enyoj .
It is not just about they like or not like .
the other side their body need to be relaxing .
so they chose these way and when they relax they could be happy .
When the young people see old people relaxing or doing nothing they think older people are not enyoj life like them .
But it is not true .

There is a different examples .
These days teenagers spend most of their time on computer , internet or tv .
They sitting all they in the same room and they just looking some unreal vision on the screen .
And older people said that it is boring to spent all their they in fornt of the screen but if you ask the young people it is lot of fun .

Everybody like to do different things .

Doens't matter what the other poeple thing about that or how it is seen .
The important thing is you like it .
