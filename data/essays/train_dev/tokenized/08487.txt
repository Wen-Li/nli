Many people have the opportinity to change the wold .
Meanwhile others keep in the same way in theirs lives .
I agree with the statement that says `` successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . ''

Innovation is the key for succes .
According to the news times , everything is changed quickly .
For example , the technology .
We can find from simple calculators to moder satellites in the space .
The new technology is given us the opportunity to learn faster and better .
If you do not have new things the life will be dull .
Thomas Alba Edison the great inventor for example invented more the fifty devices and gives the ligth .
He changed the world forever .

Innovation give us better quality of life .
For example computers , you can use the media for many purposes , you can shopping , banking , learn and take TOEFLtest in the internet .
It is becuause admirable people have innnovation and creativity .
Not only in the technology area but also in the medicine field we have improving our lives .
Innovations permit that diseases that killed many people in the past be cure with the new technology and knowledge .

In conclusion , i believe that innovation and risk improve the chances to have a bettre life .
