Athough people enjoyment differs from stage to stage , youth enjoys more as compared with the older people is definitely reasonable to agree with the statement .
I observed in my life at part , that young people enjoys more .

In modern world , due to the development of technology , they are more fascinated to new kind of objects , such as mobiles , computer , internet , etc. , and by using them that were available enjoying life .

Youngers are more affectionated to the day to day development of technology , by using those things they enjoying more .
Older people are not that much aware of these technologies .
Because technology is developing rapidly in these day to day life .
Younger ones are more energetic than older people , they can go and do whatever they want .
They make their friends as a part to enjoy in most of the public places , they usually attends party and meetings , and have capability to think and improve by adapting new technologies they enjoys more .

Older people are mostly feels that they enjoyed in their younger stages , let us allow their children who are in younger stages would allow them to enjoy , because most of the life has come to end .
While coming to oldage , people thinks that they can not enjoy because they usually suffers with most of the health problems like heart attack , blood pressure , sugar , bone problems .
Today , the development of industries and factories as well as increasing pollution with people making them to live life upto an extinct , get affected to many diseases makes most of the older people think to that they can not enjoy their rest of life .

In most of my experience , older people allows them to enjoy more as well as to get awareness of the social life .
