In my opinion fact is more important than the others .
Because ideas and concepts can change easily but facts can not change because it is real thing .
Somebody lived or something like that .

If we look all the history book that written about the world : We can see a lot of different idea and concept .
For example : In World War II some country said that their country did the right thing and on the other hand their enemy said that they just defense their country so there were right .
I can give more examples but i want to try to explain this example ; if you want to do something you have to have reason so it can not change person to person so it is real .
But everybody have angle to look at the situation everbody can say i am right and this is ihe idea but no body change the facts .

If i want to learn something i really have to know facts .
Of course we should learn the concept and understand the ideas but these are not the main things .
Because i want to have my own opinion about something .
However concept is important to create an idea but if you learn facts you can imagine the concept and you make your own trues .

Unfortunatelly this is really difficult , a lot of people choose the accept another peoples right .
But not me .

If live in a democracy we have to decide our own way : We can choose our idea and concept .
If we really want to do this we should have knowledge to say something which we have an idea .
The last thing is i read a lot of thing about U.S. but when i went their i saw the real U.S. it was not the same as my past opinion .
Thats why i can not totally believe all the ideas that some peoples has and i can not accept all the concept that somebody tell me .
