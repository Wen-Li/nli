I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because of many things .
First and the most important thing is that the advertisements are made to sell products so it only talks or shows the adventages of the products and they never mention the disadventages or the side effects of the products so people can only see the good site of this product and buy it .
second there are products that are developed by more than one company which starts a competition between them and ofcource since advertisements have a great role in the selling process of the products , these companies tries to make their products looks better than the other companies so they starts to show some non major adventages that do n't really exist in the product to win the competion although big companies with big names wo n't do this because it will effect their reputition but sometimes it may happens .
Third companies wo n't pay to advertise its products except if they are sure that it will get them more profits so if the advertisement does n't make the product fits with the customers needs , the companies wo n't make advertisement to its products .
Last thing is that the art of advertisement has a concept to make a product looks much better than they really are and here is an example .

The film trailers and game trailers they are always made in a way so that people go watch this film or game after seeing the trailer but when they watch the film or buy the game they do n't find them as they expected
