In our childhood , we try to omit other 's behavior and handle new things .
We learn how to stand up properly .
Sometimes we would fail and cry , but soon we would try again until we succeed .
Then , we soon try another new things and get more and more ablility .
To me , I believe learning new ablility is a life-long proccess for successful people .
We should take risks to try new things in order to succeed because it provides us opportunities to benefit of life , improvement and correction .

Trying new things benefit people 's life because people could gain many usable skills that would be useful in the future .
For instance , Bill Gates gathered the valuable knowledge of computing in his early life .
He then used this knowledge to establish a unique computing system - Windows .
The new ablity allows BIll Gates to be richest man in the world in his later life .
Trying new things always let people to gain wealthy .
Thus , the people would always pursue in studies even after they have been working for a long time .

When people try new things , they would get improvement that they could not get from doing things already familar .
For example , if I read the book which I already read it before , I would probably learn very little or nothing .
The book is no use for me .
In contrast , if I read a new book about `` How to Straigten Your Personality , '' I may alter my old way of doing things .
I could improve my way of

Last but not least , people could make correction while they try the new things .
The reason for that is , people can make comparision .
The new things would let people to rethink the way they do old things .
They thought they do things pretty well , but actually they did not do it right .
Therefore , successful people always try the new things in order to correct the mistake that they did not realize before .

In order to be successful , people should always not hestitate to try new things .
They can therefore enhance their life both intensively and extensively .
