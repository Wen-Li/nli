I agree with this statement because I think that a person who has a different specializations can be help in his / he professional carrer .
In fact we can understand how difficult is to found a job and for this reason I think that a person who is able to do a lot of things has some facilitations .
Economy and work want that a person is a good worker , with different experiences .

As the matter of fact my opinion is n't correct , in fact I undestand that it is important also that a person is able to do his/her work in a good way and this is possible also if that person is specialized in a particular field .

For all these reasons I think that it is important to have different specializations when a person is looking for a job , but , when he/she found it , she/he must specialize in his/her own work .

Sometimes it is not requested a licence in a particular field .
A simple course can help you to found a job .
So I think that it is important to know different subjects , but this knowing has importance if it is specialized .
