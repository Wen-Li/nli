I am agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
It is true that youth of today is not much concerned about the well being of his society and is busy in pursuing his own individual interests but they are not wholly to be blamed for this because there are various other factors which prevent them from contributing to their society and community .

To start with take the example of cut throat competition all around the world in every field due to technological advancement , where every individual , every firm is striving hard to achieve maximum efficiency and hence maximum benefit out of limited available resources in their hand .

Right from the point child take admission in the primary school , he has to cater to the expectations of his parents , friends etc .
Then with population increasing and resources decreasing , their are limited vacancy in higher school , colleges and good universities for the students so there also they have to compete in entrance examinations for the limited seats .
Then even once in , there is not much relief since the academic curriculam is so hectic that one does not have enough time to look after other peoples who need help .
and we alsoo in this situation we can not expect from someone to take out time from his busy schedule and devote it to the community .

Then coming to the time one gets job and starts working in some business or firm , there also the young man are expected to do hard work , if they want a better and secure future .

However despite these points , i will not deny the careless attitude of the youth towards their community .
Due to globalisation and mixing of culture , young people are more attracted towards the materialistic pleasures and are not ready to understand the responsibility they have on their shoulders for the society and community , which has given so much to him to make the person , he today is , and now it is his obligation from the ethical considerations , that he gives some payback to the same community .
