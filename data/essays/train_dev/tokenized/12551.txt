Some peple like indivisual travels , others like to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
In my opinion , I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
I would like to show three points referring rationals and examples .

First of all , a group trip makes us easy to go unfamilier spots in the famous sight seeing places .
Since tour a guide has professional knowledge on the place , they can advise us to see unknown but good spots .
In my experience , when I went to China in a school trip , I could find beautiul scene of forest and rivers from unknown spots .
If I had not travel in a group , it mutst have been impossibe since I was unfamilier with China .

Also , a tour guide can help us to communicate efficiently with foeigners in a foeign travel .
In general , a tour guide , especially who often goes to foegin countries , has a good command of the ingenious languages .
Therefore , we can communicate with ingenious people through their language help .
If we do not have tour guides , especially in foreign countries which we have not learned the languages , we can not directly communicate with them .
Since one of big advantages to go abroad is to communicate with native people , and to learn the life and culture , no language support does not bring beneficial time .

Lastly , referring to an advangage of a travel in the form of group , it ensures to communicate with other people who are in the same tour .
It is a good opportunity to see other people , because , in my case , I do not have much opportunity to meet other unfamilier Japanese .
Since I am a university student , I always meet same people such as classmates or friends who belong to the same club activity .
If I could meet someone who have same the tasts , I would be able to have eternal relationship with them .

Thus , due to three points : going to unfamilier spots , communication with ingenious people , and having relationship with people in the same travel , I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
