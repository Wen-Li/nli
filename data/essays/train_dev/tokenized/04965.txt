in the world there are people with different behaviour , traditions and ways of think .
Moreover there are people more or less rich and the statement young people enjoy life more than older people is not always true above all for the african , asian and south american people where young people are like older people because they are in a difficult situation and they must work .
I live in Italy and I see that in Europe the situation is different because youg people have parets with a secure work so boys like me can live a beutiful life while older people like my parents can work for me .
I think that older people live in different ways respect youg people so they enjoy life in other things .
