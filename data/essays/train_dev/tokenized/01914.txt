Some people , especially sciologists , often discuss whether we will use less cars than today .
Although some people may agree with the statement , I disagree with the statement because we have invented useful and high-tech cars , such as hybrid-cars that are not occur air pollution .
And during twenty years it is hard to invent new one such as flying cars .

We have invented useful and high-tech cars .
It prove the ability of car industy .
So , we will be able to drive more useful and high-tech cars .
As everyone knows , cars are not always advantageous because they can cause air pollution .
However .
cars are one of the efficient transportation .
For example , now we can buy and drive hybrid cars .
It does not make air pollution seriously .
I agree with the opinion that it is expensive .
However , companys will derease hybrid cars ' price as soon as possible .
Because the goverment help them by supporting moneys .
In twenty years there will be more cars on the road , also , these cars are definitely hybrid-cars .
Or someday we do not have to worry about paying for gas or insurance .

It is hard to invent new one , such as flying cars .
We usually watch flying cars in the movies .
Hower , it is just movie .
We should distingh from fantasy and realty .
Twenty years are too short to invent new one .
When I was seven years old , I dreamed about trip to the Moon and I believed that I will be able to trip to the Moon after twenty years .
Of course , today we can go to the Moon and I heard about news that an American woman visited the Moon recently .
I also heard that the expense that astonishing me .
In this way , someday there are probably fewer cars than today but not after twenty year .
I think that it will takes almost 100years later .

Taking all of things into account , we need more attention and inventory when we want get rid of car on the road .
