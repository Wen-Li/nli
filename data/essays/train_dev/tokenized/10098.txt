Some people like trying new things and take risks .
By contrast , other people always do what they already know well .
there are some advantages and disadvantages to both ways .
However , I believe the saying : `` No pain , no gain '' .
Trying new things and taking risks are worth doing .

First of all , succes comes from innovaton and risk .
History shows that only brave and creative people have made impact on human life .
For instance , Thomas Edison invented light bulbs .
During his work , he tried thounsand kinds of materials .
He did not succeed until he found last one .
In fact , he was not sure if he would find the right material all the way throgh .
He took more risks than others could bear to .
As a result , his courage and perseverance has changed our life .

Secondly , people are scared to try is because they are afraid to fail .
Nevertheless , failure is the mother of success .
Even though after all the hard work they may fail , the experience they acquire is valueless .
The new gained precious experience will in turn lead them toward to their destiny .
This is a common process to success .
Without trying , this process will never happen .

Thirdly , staying where one is will eventually make him fall behind .
In the 21st Century , everyone is trying to overcome any adversary to achieve their goals .
If someone stops progress and does what he already knows how to do , he will be left behind .
Therefore , taking risks and breaknig the mold is the only way to survive in this competitive society .

Overall , in one 's success and victory , trying new things and taking risks are the two vital factors .
As people try to advance , the ones who stays the same are determined to be the last ones of the race in life .
Only improvement brings a eternal success to a person .
