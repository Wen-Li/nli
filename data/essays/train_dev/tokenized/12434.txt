Learning facts is undeniably a necessity for all students of all ages .
That is even the fist thing that a child is asked when he enters school .
He learns rules , such as standing straight and in line before entering a class , or not walking around while the teacher is giving a lesson .
Those rules are transferred to him before the notion of good and bad , he understands the consequence of his ations earlier than the reasons for their necessity , and acts consequenty .
In our school systems , learning prevails upon assimilating , at least at the beginning .

The expectations necessarily evolve with the age of the students .
In higher grades , it becomes almost impossible to learn by heart without understanding .
Assimilating a concept is likely to develop the cleverness of a student while learning will only fil his memory .
As school is supposed to learn children how to think , learning becomes of lesser importance from a certain age .

Yet , learning is still necessary for exams , for proving one 's ability to memorize combined with one 's intelligence .
Also , as it is the only mean by hich one can assess a student motivation at work and ability to memorize , learning can not be neglected as a key factor in a student 's success and in a whole school system .

For a student 's personal development , understanding concepts and ideas is obviously more important and almost necessary , but it does n't supress the learning part , which is much more easily assessed on a copy for example .

This raises the question of the role of school .
Indeed , if it is only supposed to insert people in their future professions , the ability to learn fast and a lot prevails innevitably .
But school is also supposed to be the fundametal pillar of a nation , as it strutures people 's mind and is therefore essential in a democracy for example .
