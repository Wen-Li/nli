In thenty years from now it does n't look possible , in my view , to have fewer cars in used in our societies .

Indeed the car market is very important in countries ' economies .
it has been important almost in the past century , but it seems like it 's becoming even more important today .
the resaon for this developement is that developing countries , or new developped ones are developing their industries .
And it 's well known that one of the major sector of the industry is the car industry .

Therefore more and more cars are getting built every day in the world , and they will be in use in our streets sooner or latter .
For example asian countries are becoming very powerfull in this area .
We all know brands like Toyota , Honda . ..
And if we pay attention to the cars around us we 'll nottice how usual it becomes to see people with those cars .

Besides this developement does n't mean that the other developped countries stopped making cars .
They actualy try to catch up with those countries and are making new cars too .
For example , we have wolkswagen ans BMW in Germany , chevrolet , general motor in the United-States . ..
And much more .

They are all trying to be more competitive so they are all deveoping new cars and saling more cars too .

Cars industry is an important economic area for every country today , that 's why I personaly think that a huge amount of car is coming , and in twenty years it wo n't be solved at all .

But , today we can also see the developement of environementals concerned .
More and more organisations are opening in order to protect our planet : Greenpeace was the first one but definately not the last one created .

And in my opinion it 's also becoming a political strategy , so me may have a `` solution '' to this environement damage : a new kind of cars that wo n't polute as much .

for example cars using electricity .

To conclude I would say that economics strategies wo n't let the car industry disapear but they might find new techniques in order to combine strong economy and protection of our environement .
