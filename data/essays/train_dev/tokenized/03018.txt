Cars are of vital importance for everyone 's life .
Today , we can not imagine a situation without cars .
Even if we do not have one ourselves , other people utilize them to make our lives easier - be it a transporter bringing food to the supermarket or the car that brings us to the hospital in case of a severe accident .

In my opinion , we need cars and the populatoin in our country knows that .
This is the reason why I think that the number of cars will not diminish in the next 20 years .

There are a myriad of arguments for and against the use of cars :
The major argument against cars is certainly the pollution of our environment .
And it is true - cars , as we know them today , need certain natural resources and do pollute our environment to a certain degree .
If this is always true , there will probably be fewer cars in use in 20 years that there are today .
At some point in time , people would recognize the harm of cars and would definitely try to reduce the number of cars to protect the environment .

But this may not be a realistic case : I am of the opinion , that our scientists get smarter and smarter .
Until today , they already invented hybrid engines and engines that are only run by solar energy or plant oils .
Today , those inventions can not replace cars that need gaz to produce power , because scientists are still trying to get more out of the new foundings .
But consider the time the gaz engine needed to be as perfect as we know today : It took long years for the car industry to be able to produce those engines .

Given this evolution , it is possible and very realistic that our scientists will make a huge contribution to the improvement of the ` new ' engines in the next 20 years .
Even if 20 years might be too short to develop a car that does not pollute the environment at all , I think that the scientists are on a good way to find an engine that drastically reduces the pollution .
And after another 20 years , we might already use cars that do not need any natural resources like gaz .
If this is the case , everyone will recognize the outstanding advantages of cars , so that the number of cars will rather increase .
