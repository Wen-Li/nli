Some people might says that learning lots of facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts .
However , I think understanding ideas and concepts are more essential .
There are two major reasons : to be confident and to be logical .

To begin with , students could get confidence through understanding ideas and consepts .
You might say that learning many things can make people more confident .
However , you may not deny that without understanding them , nobody can use it confidently .
Moreover facts are usually so common .
By contrast , although ideas and concepsts are notperfect , people can get deeper knowledge by flowing the idea and conpet .
As society is getting more complex , the competition is getting fiercer , Therefore , the meaning of export has changed .
It was to know many facts , now it is to understanding whole ideas and concepts .

Moreover , as far as thinking logically is concerned , understanding ideas and concepts are more important .
I took the history class when I was a freshmam .
I learned many important facts in the class and I got a great score on it .
However , I forgot most of them immedietly after a final exam .
In comparison , when I took a physics class , although it was chalenging to me to understand the idea and concept , but through that proccess I could learn the way of thinking logicaly .
This logical approach helped me to get better grades in other courses , too .

In summary , to understand ideas and concepts is necessary for students to get confident and a way of logical thinking .
