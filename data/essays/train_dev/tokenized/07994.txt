In my opinion , young people actually enjoy life more than older people do .
I hold this opinion because young people are less weak , less afraid , and less fragile than older people tend to be .

First of all , the majority of young people have alot of energy they can disperse without becoming tired easily .
While most aged people get tired after just one activity , young people , like students , can do many activities in just one day .
Even after long hours of work in school , they can easily take part in an afterschool activity , and then come home to do homework and chores .
On the other hand , older people get tired quickly even after one activity , such as cleaning the house .
Being able to do many activities in one day promotes the sense of accomplishment and happiness , and thus young people who have more energy enjoy life more than older people .

In addition , young people tend to be more brave than older people , and take more risks .
Risks , because no outcome can be predicted , add excitement to the lives of young people .
However , most older people prefer being stable and assured , and do not take risks .
For example , alot of young people will travel to distant countries , and gain more experience .
However older people prefer remaining where they are .
Thus in the lives of older people things are monotonuous and predictable , whereas in the lives of young people , nothing can be predicted and everything is exciting .

Furthermore , young people are also more mentally capable than older people .
As people grow old , they lose their ability to concentrate for long periods of time , or to learn new things .
In contrast , young people are full of potential and can learn new things , like another language or a new recipe .
Learning new things is very enjoyable , and younger people who have the advantage of better mental capabilities , enjoy life more than older people .

Older people are restrained by various factors , such as fragility and inability to continue activities for long period of time .
However , because young people are stronger physically , mentally , and also have less fear , their lives are filled with excitement and fun , enabling them to enjoy life more than older people do .
