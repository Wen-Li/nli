I agree with the statement but i think it will depend on different reasons .
It will be difficult to live without cars , especially here in Italy where most of the trade and travelling is made by cars .
I believe that we will all benefit from the lack of cars but we need to get used to other means of transport .
First of all , people should start using public transports .
In this way , companies will improve their means and they will be ready to sustain the changed habit in twenty years .

Secondly , we should invest more in research and development for alternatives means of transports and to lower the prices of transportations , such as those of airplanes , trains and ferries .
Government should also improve infrastructures for there means of transports as often airports , railway stations and harbours are not enough efficient .

As nowadays cars are the biggest source of pollution , it will be positive for the environment and for all of us .
Scientists are already working to find alternative sources to make our car running , as in twenty years time , we might run out of petroleum , and this will probably be the main cause for fewer cars .
Despite this , we will need to discover alternative sources to make our car running .
New cars are already on the market which work with hydrogen , electricity or solar pannels .
However , they are just prototypes and we are not sure about their benefits to private transports .

Finally , it will cause less accidents on the roads as most of the deads in the western emisphere are cause by road crashes
