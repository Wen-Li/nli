Travilling is sometimes for holiday and seeing new places but sometimes it is for job .
For the first , you can travel yourself or travel with a group led by a tour guide .
Sometimes you need the first one , sometimes the second one .
I disagree the statement ; The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
It change according to the your physchology or your destination , that can be abroad or inside of your conutry .
I prefer travel my own becuse of several reasons .

Firstly , when you travel with a group led by tour guide you must fallow them all your travel .
It sounds do not come me good .
It seems very resricted and boring .
Before you travel to some places sometimes you make some search about this place anda you imagine something also you plan something .
When you travel with a group if a tour guide will plan to see places , where you plan to see , it is a problem .
Addtion to this , you can be bored the place but because of the group you must be in there .
So it is not a good situtaion .

Secondly , tour guides generally take you historical places .
Sometimes it is a good but for person who is not interested with history or art it is also bad situtaion .

In conclusion there are many reason like these to prefer travel my own .
Tour may not be good as you espected .
The hotel may not be clear or comfortable .
Altough there are some advantages of travalling with a group led by a tour guide ,
