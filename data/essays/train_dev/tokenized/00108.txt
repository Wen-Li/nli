Today , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I agree partly with the previous statement .
The first point , I wuold like to make is that the young people nowadays are very busy with own engangement , that do not have enough spare time .
I think , that this is the main motive because young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .

As regards me , I am a student at University , I do not ever have time spare .
I am always busy to work to university .
Many time I do not have time to see my boyfriend and my friend , also I have feel to to helping my communities , I do not have time to make it .

Therefore , last years I suceed to organize a big party , in my country , to gather money to helping the poor childern .
In addiction , sometimes I helping the children of my country to make homework .

These events seldom happen , because I do not enough spare time .
My situation is similar with the situation of my friends .
In conclusion , I think that today , yuong people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
In addition , I think that the main reason of this type of bahavior is that yuong people do not have enough time .
