I agress that it is more important for students to understand idras and concepts than itis for them to learn facts .
First , If students can understand ideas and concepts , they will utilize them .
Understanding them make students more better .
For example , students understanding them can make thier opinion useful .
In addition to , understanding ideas and concepts is more eassier than learning facts .
Because , If students were able to understand them , maybe , They can not forget them .
But learning is not .

Secondly , To larn facts is difficult .
For example , if students try to remember facts , they might spend more time than understanding the ideas and concepts .
We should save our life 's time .

If students learn facts , they might forget them .
This is poor activies .
Third , learning facts is not cheeper than understanding ideas and concepts .
If we try to learn facts we pay the fees .
And if we choose to understand ideas and concepts , we can understand alone .
For example we can read books .
Reading books is useful in understanding ideas and concepts .

Learning facts is unuseful ways to gain knowleges .
we should gain knowleges .
So , we can get a job .
Getting jobs is very difficult .
The world economic is unclearly because of high oil prices , weaken dolloar and so on .

Therefore , possibly , I recommend understanding ideas and concepts .
If I could back to the past , I would understand ideas and concepts .
I never could learn facts .
Because I do not have little time .
Time is money .

Remember my word .
so your children will be happy .
