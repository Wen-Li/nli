I believe that one that wants to be succesful and that wants to achieve many goals is the one that tries new ways , ideas , and things in life .
Without trying or experiencing new ways , one will not learn or be successful in life , because one will not have the ability to achieve new things , and technology would n't have been so great as it is now a days .

For example , without scientists we would n't have ways to study , and experiments to learn about in school .
Scientists would n't have learned and invented all those theories without trying and experimenting .

Another example would be if one wants to achieve good business , one would n't achieve it without trying new ways and ideas to make his business grow bigger and better .

Another reason for this statement would be that without experiencing and trying new things , technology would n't have been as great as it it these days , and people would just be doing things they are use to , and would n't have the chance to experience new things in life .
Technology is getting bigger and better everyday , with the help of scientists and all other people that try to make new things and more developed things from things that were nothing .

I completely agree with the statement , because as i said above without experiencing , trying , and learnig .
nothing would have been invented , learned , or used now a days , and people would just be doing what they are used
