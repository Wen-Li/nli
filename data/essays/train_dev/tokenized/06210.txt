I agree and disagree at the same time .
Some of these product are good and some of them are no good .

For example cars .
Most of cars adverting are really so nice and good .
Half of these cars I do not like .
Like Korean cars and french cars .
They do not live long .
When driving them you do not have a lot of control in case of any dengoures thing happen .
And most importantly they are too expensive to buy one of these cars .
In the other half there are German and America cars .
I love driving one of these types of cars .
They have a lot of nice options .
A lot of computer that involves .
In the high ways you can go as fast as you can and you have almost a total control of it ( I wrote almost becuse nothing is totally a hundred persent ) .
One thing I want to montion that most of the German cars are too expensive .
So the advertisments for these cars are worth it and truthful .

Let us see some other products that advertisements make them look better on TV than the real life .
And that is food .
I like most kinds of food .
From cold food to hot food .
Wither it is spicey or not I do not care .
I will eat it .
I like Italian food .
I am in love with Chineas food .
I do not mind Mixecan food .
I mentiond that becuse if I see a comercail on a TV about any type of food or a big picure of a hamburger on the wall that says come and taste it .
I have to try it then I deside weather the advertisements of this type of food is good or not .

In the end Advertissing aggences are really smart doing what they do .
