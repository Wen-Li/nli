It is true that the youth of today are much different than they used to be in the past .
Technological advancements leading to a more rapid pace of life has indeed brought about a revolutoinary change in young people nowadays .
This has lead to the fact that they do not give enough time to helping their communities .

One of the most important reasons is the lack of time available to the young people for such activities .
They are more involved in their career , family , social and sports activities .
Hence , they seldom find it possible to take time out of their busy schedules .

Secondly , people are much more competitive nowadays .
There is competiton in each and every field today .
It is the time where only the fittest of people survive .
Everyone wants to build a good career so that they can provide for their family as well as to ensure a bright and prosperous future .
In this rat race , they are left with no time to think about those outside their family .
Hence , they choose to turn a blind eye to their responsibilities towards their communities .

Lastly , they are not aware of their responsibilities and duties as individuals towards others .
It is sad that few choose of them to remain so still .
There is a need for awakening the youth so they become more aware .

There are few young people who have still managed to contribute largely to their community .
There are many examples of television actors and other famous personalities who have made their mark by carrying out their responsibilities to the fullest .
Such people are considered as role models by the common public and they inspire the youth of today to continue with their good work .

Thus , it is true that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
However , it is necessary that they should be reminded of their duties as responsible and mature people who hold the key to the future of our nation .
