In the past years , we have seen a growing conflict between older and younger people .
In many countries , the gap between generations is growing , due to demographic as well as sociological developments .

Unemployment of young people is a hughe problem in many european countries .
In many cases , young people are not able to get a good education because of their immigration-background or their social environment .
Also , many young people are not able to find proper jobs although they have good education because after massive job cuts in many multinatinal companies , no youngsters are hired at the moment due to slow economic growth and the consequences of globalisation , which often causes outsorcing and transfering of jobs from expensive first world countries to areas , where production is cheaper .

On the other hand , also older people are affected by these job cuts .
At the same time , european welfare-states have to raise the retirement age in order to keep their social systems functioning and financeable .

Of course , this development sometimes causes frustration on both sides .
When older people who either have the will to work but do n't find a job or who have worked for decades and are now retired see young people in the streets , hanging out , doing nothing ( except skateboarding , listening to music , playing computer games and shopping ) they might get the impression , that young people enjoy life more than they do or than they did when they were their age .
And that impression , in my opinion , is probably correct .
When todays old generations were young , in the fourties and fifties , there was not a lot of fun stuff to do in Europe .
They experienced the cruelty of the World War II and the hard work that was necessary to rebuild the countries afterwards .

Young people in Europe are lucky , to grow up in a safe and often wealthy environment .
They have the chance to do things , older people were not able to : they can travel , they can communicate with strangers and friends around the world , they can get to know the world in a totally different way their parents , grand parents and grand grand parents were able to .
They have the time and possibility to do sports and ofther fun activities and to enjoy their life - maybe more , or at least in a different way , than many older people do .

Maybe this way of lifestyle many young people have , containing travelling , extreme sports and other ways to test their personal limits , are a way to cope with their `` Zukunftsangst '' , with the scary feeling many youngsters have , that they have to be flexible all the time , they often do n't know , what tomorrow brings them and they are not sure , if and how long they will have a job ( and if they are lucky to have a job , they have to pay for the older people 's retirement , probalby without beeing ever able to profit from this system themselves ) .

I think , young people have all rights to enjoy their live as long as they can - sooner or later it will get tough anyway .
Older people should n't complain about this but rather try to understand the situation , teenagers and twens are in .
And sometimes they should even talk to their grand children and tell them : `` It 's alright , enjoy your life .
Go and have some fun ! ''
