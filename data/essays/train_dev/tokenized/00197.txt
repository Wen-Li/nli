I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help the communities .
In many organizations and foundations , there are a lot of young people working to help the communities .
A lot of schools also require students to do community service .
Sometimes doing community service is a relax for us .
We young people do want to get involve in the communities .

Community service is required by most of the schools in United States .
Students are required to do amount of hours whether they like it or not .
By doing community service , students help in theirt communities and make time for the communities because they need to finish their community service requirement in order to pass the grade .
Some school will also give out honors to those who work over the requirement .
We students will work harder and give out more hours to the communities to gain those honors .
Even though some studnets are not willing to do the community service , they still give out a lot of time to the communities because of the requirement .

A lot of young people give out their time to the communities to relax and get way from their school work .
A lot of time students , including me , are tired of the school work and materials and want relax .
I found helping the communities allows me to relax and not think about my work .
At the same time , I 'm using my relaxing time to help my commuity and the people who need my help .
It is benefitial to both my community and myself .

In conclusion , Young people nowadays do give enough time to help their communities in many way .
Whether we young people do communities service for the school requirement or to relax from school work , we are giving time and energy to our communities and to get involve in the communities .
