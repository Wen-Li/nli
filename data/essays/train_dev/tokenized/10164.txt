Very often , people who managed to succeed in life like to discover new things , new areas in which they can try to succeed or master as well , all for the purpose of always aiming higher .
The problem with this approche , is that it involves taking many risks , and at the end these people could end up loosing evrything , while they could have stick to what they already knew .
This creates the problem of knowing if it is worth taking the risk to try new things or if instead people should stay with what they already posesse .

In my opinion , life is all about taking risks , and discovering new things , so that our knowledge does n't stay confined to what we already are good at , but that insted , these limits extand and allow us to learn and to succeed at new things .
For example , if there were n't people willing to try to undertsand the anatomy of the human body , the progress in medecine would not have been so advanced as it is today .
This shows that even if there are risks involved with gaining knowledge and mastering an area , it is still something that has to be done in order to evolve .

However , there are some times when people who take risks end up regretting it , wether because they did n't succeed in the other things they tried to learn and lost what they already possessed , or because they did n't like what they learn while exploring new areas .
If we take for example a man who owns a show company , and he decides to invest his money in a new parfume company , or in another random business that does n't relate to his are of expertise , he may end up lossing money if this business doe n't work well , or he may end up giving up because this business is not fit for him .
Either way , this man would have lost money and this could even affect the business in which he succeeded .
Therefore , taking these risks could definitly end up causing these people a lot of harm , if they werent prepared for it .

In the end , it is all about beeing lucky and hoping for the best , because there is a lot of good things that can come out of discovering new things , but there are also bad things .
But if i had to choose , i would probably decide to take the risks , because the world would n't be were it is today without our will to discover and to master .
