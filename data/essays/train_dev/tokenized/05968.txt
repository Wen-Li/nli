It is undoubtedly true that in twenty years the number of circulating cars will be strongly reduced .
Although many people may believe that this statement is simply ludicrous , It is possible to provide some good reasons to support it .
Two main aspects of this explanation are the consequences of the environmental problems caused by cars and the problems caused by the constantly rising oil price .

As everybody knows , cars produce toxic smoke that pollutes the air in big cities .
For this reason many governments and city administrations are restricting the number of cars that are allowed to circulate in city centres .
In the long term this will led to a change in citizen 's preferencies , i.e. they will prefer using public transportation to using their cars because it will become simply too difficult to drive a car in a big city .
To support this opinion I could quote a research study on this topic carried out at my university that shows that people are becoming more and more unwilling to drive their cars in big cities .

Another point that could be made is that having a car is becoming more and more expensive .
The first reason for this phenomenon is that oil prices has become very prone to rise consistently at any threatened decrease in production .
Grassroots people have already many economical problems and this one will become too awkward for them .
Another thing that influence the cost of having a car is the fact that governments are discouraging cars buying by imposing taxes on some ecologically dangerous cars .
For example the Italian government is willing to pass a law that imposes a tax on big cars .

These two reasons given , itis not difficult to understand why I think that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than
