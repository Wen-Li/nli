Everyone wants to enjoy life and live happily .
We are all different and can not be same in appearances and preferences .
As industry develops , people get more chances to enjoy their life in various ways .
For example , before invention of airplane , taking travel around the world was not easy as nowdays .
But we have a lot of things to do in our free time .
Therefore , some people might say that young people in these days enjoy life more than older people do .
It is true in some aspects because young people have more alternations for enjoying life and many leisure equitment have been inventing gradually .

I thinks that enjoyment of life does not mean the physiclal aspects always .
Of coure , youth itself is a beautiful one .
In other hands , we should plan our future life and plan to prepare for that in our young days .
Older people enjoy their life with a sound wisdom of living .
They have experienced many things through life and have a wise sight for life and world .

Being young is not a critical fact for enjoying one 's life .
Older people can enjoy their life in more various ways with their experiences of life and open eyes for others .
