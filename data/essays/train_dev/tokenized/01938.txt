Do you want to live successful life ?
If you want to make it possible , I think you 'd better try new things than old things that are too common and oldfashioned .
In my opinion , most people who live successfully tried new things and took risks .
There are two reasons to express my opinion .

Firstly , it is true that nomal people do nomal things , live nomal lives and love nomal things .
According to speaking of successful people , however , they were willing to take risks to succeed .
People should not copy and repeat something because sometimes the something need to be changed .
We should create new things that will make us live new lives and better lives .
Secondly , maybe all of us know ` life is venture ' .
It is so famouse sentence that we could hear before .
But the case that it comes true is very rare because people are afraid that they could make a mistake in trying new ventures .
But I think avoiding venture to keep them from failling is the worst things in your whole lives .
You do n't have to be frustrated even though you fail to try something new .
It will give you an experience .
This envaluable experience will help you to succeed other things .
It is so envaluable that you may not want to change to other things .

In conclusion , there are a number of opportunities in the world .
Some people can see and cach these possiblities , but others ca n't see that they would miss these things .
You have to take these opportunities in your life .
In this morden society , it is so important to be a creative person .
Society wants that kind of people , so we should have courages and keep going to the new thinsd
