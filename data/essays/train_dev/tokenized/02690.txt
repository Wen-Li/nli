I agree with the statement .
It is more important to understand the ideas and concepts .
Learning the facts without understanding the bottom line of it does n't make sense .
It does n't help people to improve themselves and derive the point from the facts .
For example learnin about science , if we do n't know the basic idea behind the fact we never get the connection between the releated facts .

Besides if we dont teach our students the concepts behind the facts we would just developed a banch of encylopedias for future not an efficient and smart generation .
They have to know reasons , factors , consequences and developments about the facts .
Only knowing the fact does n't stand for much .
There is some before the fact and there is some after the fact .
If they know both part , it makes sense and draw a picture in their mind .
It will fly and never stable in mind without it .

Also it is really necessary for students to know concepts behind the facts to make it easier them to understand easily .
Think about it .
When they are learning gravity , if you dont explain the factors , reasons and just tell them the ground pulling us through what they would understand .
Probably nothing .

In conclusion , humans always look for reasons , results and factors .
They want to know why ?
So for students it s important to know ideas and concepts .
