The life change more confortable and easy to live , and also the price of car decrease .
The people prefer to buy and use their own car then to use bus or subway .

So , some people can think the car will be more and more in the future , but I disagree that `` In the twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .

First of all , the peple will rethink the pollution , so they will decrease to use the their car .
As you know that the car is reson of the pollution , and people use the more and more then pollution also getting worse and worse , because of carbon dioxide which is from the car , and other bad gas .
So people will decrese to use the car .

Secondry , when all people use the car , this things will make trafic jam problems , so people always live in the road , and they can not do what they want to do on time .
So they will prefer other trafic such as bus and subway , because those go faster than the car .

Thirdly , it will be obvious anyway the people always die even the medical is developing .
And the future there are too many people that do not get married and have the baby , so there is just few increasing people .
Hence it is not different from the now .

Hence , people will not use more the car in the future than rutine .
because people always think their enviroment than their confortable .
And also they do not want to late all their appointment .
As someone said that `` Time is the money . ''
