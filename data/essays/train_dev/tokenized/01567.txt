So different are the personal experiences and emotional among people with diverse culture that thousand individuals might hold thousand opinions .
As far as I am concerned , I generally agree with the assertion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

First of all , one of the central reasons that can be presented my position is the things have been done by the successful people take long time experiences to make it better .
Examples can easily be found to support my view .
The most famous inventor , Edison , he invented light in very early period .
However , he did n't spend time on how to improve his invention well .
After long time of life experiences , others improved the light better , such as the clour and the used time .
Under the circumstance , successfull people try new things and take risks is much better

In addition , another equally crucial aspect is that a new thing 's come out can increase the possibility of others related new products ' inventions .
This example can tell it right .
The light came out soon after the discover of electrcity , because these two inventions have something in common or relation .
As a result , the siccessful people always succeeded in making lists of new things after they made one .
This can demonstrate beyond any doubt that successful people should keep on going , but staying behind .

However , I dont want to overstate the advantage of my agreement , since it also still suffers from some comparative merits in some sperical cases .
Firstly , when people try to invent new things , it takes long time to reach the achivement .
Seconly ,

To sum up , according to above mentioned reasons and examples , successful people should try new things and take risks becomes more convincing to me , although it has some own negative aspects which we can not deny .
