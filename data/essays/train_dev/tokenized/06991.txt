Well , i opine in consense with the statement given .
Yes , i actually prefer to be assisted by a tour guide when i am travelling as a group .
The reasons that support my argument are disclosed as under ! .

Firstly it would be of great advantage to be accompanied by a guide because it proves to be beneficial to be directed in a place which a group is not well acquainted with .
It is better to be guided in a place which is new to us because it prevents the group of tourists being split up in case of any misshappening ! .
Therefore the group is led in a unison preventing the chaos of losing some members .
Hence it saves a lot of time to concentrate on the purpose oftravel .
Secondly employing a guide provides us the detail of all the important places to be visited .
Therefore it provides us with a good review of all the important places without missing any .
This again saves us time in searching out for places to be visited ! .

Third pont of advantage of employing a guide is that of the awareness of the places visited .
A guide really provides us with very valuable information as of how , why , when and other related questions of the places visited .
Therefore it is of great advantage as the knowledge regarding the places is complete .

Another advantage is that of the communication with the people of that habitat ! .
This is really very important because the right way of communication with the local people might be really very difficult in most of the cases .
This might mislead a group in knowing certain things for example the whereabouts or a route to a monument for that matter .
Therefore if a guide is accompanying us we need not really face the communication problems as he translates the dialect of the local people and speaks out that is really understood by us .

Another important advantage is that a guide might really help us to sort out our accomodation at an economical place in case we are paying more for the stay than we are actually meant to pay .
This again proves us an economic advantage of employing a guide ! .

Therefore from the reasons which i have disclosed i really favour employing a guide although it is a bit expensive .
