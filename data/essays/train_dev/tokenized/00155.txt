When a product is developed , there must be a way to introduce it to the public , and once it 's on the market , a way to increase its popularity and therefore its sales .

This is where advertisement comes in , to make the most sales and profits out of any kind of product , of any quality , and of any actual functionability , and I strongly emphasize `` of any quality , and of any actual functionability '' since most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .

I believe it has happened to all of us that we see a commercial on T.V. about a product that interests us , mainly because the function it will perform helps us in some way , or makes us more comfortable and happy , but when the product is purchased , it stands far from what we thought it would be or it would do .
Many people try to look at this as a scam has been portrayed against them , but the truth is that advertisement was mainly doing its job , which is attrack potential buyers .

The advertisement 's purpose is to make you believe that this product is the best in quality , the best in price , and the best in its performance , in other words , its the best of the bests in its kind .

In order for marketing professionals to reach this goal they must study the behavior of the public this product is being intended for , its interests , its likes and dislikes , and even its dreams and routines , so that the product can be addressed in the most proper way and in the most proper time , presenting it as something that the potential buyer could never live without .

The truth is , that some products do live up to its advertisements and to the buyers expectations , but those are surely not the majority ; and in the rest of the cases I believe we just have to look out , and pay very close attention to the real message that its being sent when this advertisements are played and displayed anywhere thay are , because even if the marketing proffesional understands what my desires are and whay my behavior might be in front of a certain situation , he or she can not dictate what I will actually do , only I am in control of myself .
