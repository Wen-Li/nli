Intd :
new things create success
reach goals
leads invention i agree with the statement successful people try new things .
Because if they try the new things then only they will success in life oterwise their life is stationary .

In my openion trying new things is the mother of invention .
So many scientists trying differently and facing so many problems creates wonderful life for us .
For ex thomas edison invented florescent light bulb change our lives alot .
after that several changes occur due to trying of new things If we want success and growth in our life or in job definitely we need to try new things and then only we will overcross other competetors and succeed in life .

so i storngly agree with the statement all people succeed by trying new things in
