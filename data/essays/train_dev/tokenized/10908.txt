I disagree with the statement .
It mat be true that the group tour is a most convinient way to travel because a tour guide know a lot about the place and there seems no waste time thanks to the all well prepered plan .
However I think that to travel by ourselves is more enjoyable than group tour and there are three reasons that support my idea .

First , by traveling individually , you can go anywhere at anytime .
For example , if you go to one tourrist attraction in a group and you find the place attracting , you have to just pass through and can not see the place well because of the time limit .

Next , you can meet local people .
If you are in a group tour , local people are not interested in them because you already have a lot of conpany and the local people see you as one of them .
However , if you go to the sight alone , it draw local people 's attention and they might talk to you or at least nice to you .
Moreover since they live there , they knows where to go better than guides or guidebooks .
In addition , you can know what the tradition and cultures of the region , which the guidebooks do not tell you .

Finally , you can be independent .
To travel alone is not always just a fun .
There are a lot of danger around you .
However you can learn how to protect yourself when you are in danger .
what you learned from the dangerous situation will be helpful for your latter life .
