When it come to traveling in a group some people may say that the best way to do so is led by a tour guide ; I personally disagree with that oppinion .
It 's true that having a tour guide has its advantages such as being taken to all the typical local turist attractions , you will be almost sertain that you wo n't be missing out on any must see places .
Yet , in the other had , having a tour guide limits your freetime .
When traveling in a group you want to spend time with your friends , and spending it as you wish ; not having to be tied to a schedule as it is when using a tour guide .
It could also be said that when traveling in big groups , people always want to see different things , and arguments may occur .
Although having a tour guide could prevent this disagreements by simply following the itinerary set for that day , theres a better way to solve the problem .
The group could just simply seperate , each person goes to where they want , and at the end of the day meet again .
The advantage of this solution is that when a big number of people are together for a period of time , usually arguments happen ; by sending each person on their different way it gives them time to refresh from the enviroment of the group .
Most important of all , of why is better to travel without a tour guide , it that having a tour guide babysitting you around the city take away a great part of the social and cultural interaction .
The experience that you earn when you explore an unknown city on your own is something that can not be showed by a tour guide .
In conclusion , for all the reasons named above , my suggestion when it comes to travaling in a group is to not hire a tour guide and explore the city on your own along with your friends .
