The fact that the number of cars in use in the world has increased a lot since their invention is of course not discussed .
But one can really ask himself if there will be more of fewer automobiles in twenty years .
Despite the fact that we can truly believe , for several reasons , there will be fewer cars , I personally think there will exist more cars in use in twenty years than there is today .
The main reasons of this theory are , first , that people had , have , and will always love cars .
Second , an automobile is too useful for disappering from the surface of the planet .
Third , the laws against pollution are not very effective .

First of all , people have deeply loved cars since the beginning , and there is no real reason why it will suddenly stop .
Cars carry an image of wealth and happiness .
It could also be part of certain dreams and fantasies since they were often use in movies , for example .

Moreover , a car is fondamentally very helpful .
It is a convenient way of transportation , a very flexible one .
My opinion is that there is not any other invention , to date , that allow people to decide to leave a spot for another one and go off immediately .
I bet there will not be one either in the next decades .
Another example of the usefulness of the automobiles is that you can put more personal stuff in it than when you travel by plane or by train for instance .

Finally , the political battles led against car pollution did not permit the number of cars to dicrease .
Thus , I think this uneffectiveness will continue in the future .
For example , if it is true that people driving cars in Mexico have to pay more taxes , it is still the most polluted city in the world , because of number of cars in use in this town is still the same .
I think this will also continue in twenty years .

To sum up , there will be probably not be fewer cars in use in twenty years because of the three major reasons I expressed .
But , of course , it is only a guess , since nobody , can really predict future
