Within the following essay I discuss if people trying new things and taking more risks are more succesful than people using well established practices .

For the beginning I give an principal definition of succes , because it is a question of perspective wether someone is succesful or not .
Secondly I highlight several arguments on the topic before concluding with my own opinion on it .

Succes is within a society normally a well conscructed and established value .
Every value consists normally of an imagination of distinctive goals .
Instead succes itself is not adequate to a constructed goal but needs to be constructed by each community of people .
Within Western countries who share the same principles of economy and society succes can be defined as earning a lot of money , having a family or simply being happy , whatever this would say .
Now my perspective focusses on the economic perspective by earning a lot of money and therefore I definite succes by it .

By stretching the economic face of succes I need to differentiate between new products and well established products .
New products are normally accompagnied by a bigger amount of risks and also by a larger scale of innovativity than established products are .
The example of franchising worked on earlier this TOEFL fits quite well .
It is relatively easy to buy the right of a huge company like Burger King and to produce its products but it also highlights the limitations of own freedom to establish something own .
While starting his proper buisness is relatively costly for oneself and is followed by the incertainity of acceptance of the product , it lets some room for creativity and personality .
Additionally new innovative products could be sold for higher price .

Nevertheless it could n't be denied that you can earn money with both possibilities .
Perhaps it 's not really a question of succes in this case , but of making it a special way .

For my conclusion I emphasize on the hope of everyone to have succes that leads people to start something new and innovative against all odds .
This hope might be imaginative but leads researchers to new inventions and at all humanity to progress .
So it would be necessary for humanity but not for economic succes at a short range .
By using well established practices you can suceed too and by stretching on the example of new products you need an etablished name to sell products better .

Therefore it 's the mixture of both , risk and new ways as well as well established ways that leads to overall success , for individuals , enterprises and humanity .
