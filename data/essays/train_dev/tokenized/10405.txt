I definitely think that is very good and essential for an individual to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
By knowing about many subjects one is more comfartable in interacting with all kinds of people because it will not be difficult to have a healthy conversation as we will not be totally unaware of what the other person is talking to us about .

Another important reason why we should have knowledge about different subjects is that we never know what bad phase in life we might go through .
To be able to stay put in all situations and to be able to work our way through all difficult times we should have at least the bare minimal knowledge required in every field .
This broadens our horizon to work and not be stranded in various situations in life .

If we have only specific knowledge about one field it is not always necessary that we may have enough luck in our fate to make it big in that field .
To keep that door of opportunity open for us at all times we should have knowledge about a variety of things in life .
Lets take the example of a simple clerk who has been used to entering data into a register manually all his life .
With the development of science and technology there will come a time in his professional life where his company might install computers to manage the data .
The clerk would now be required to work on this new marvelous invention .
If the clerk had always been satisfied throughout his life with his manual labour and would not have updated himself in this new technology he would have been blank as the the knowledge of computers and this would in turn lead to him losing his job where someone who is computer savvy might get the job ; but having been update with happening in different fields the clerk would find it simple to navigate throught the system in turn making his work easier for himself .

This was a very small but ver effective example as to why we should be in touch with things that are goin on around us .
As they say ` little knowledge maybe dangerous ' .
Keeping this in mind i firmly believe and state that it would be in our best interest if we knew more things about other fields as well rather than just knowning everything about one .
