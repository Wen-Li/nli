As the knowledge about science is expanding , specialization is the result of this expanding .
A man can read a lot about a subject but this will be his habbits about an topic .
This is the Filling of spare time , A man can only do on thing or job well but has lot of habbits .

Spesification about medicine could be the example .
The medical knowledge we have reached today is enormous .
A medic can not have all the subjects about medicine experienced .
As it is so , it will be superficial and will have less benefit for his or her patients .
Thats why medics try to graduate on paediatrics , oncology or cardiovascular surgery .
As you uppergraduate on any subgroup , you should know that subject more deeply .

But as stated in the first passage , A man can only do one job well , the habbits of him also has supporting effects on his job .
As a result , a man also needs habbits , that will support his job .
As a result , for this century , spesification is highly required for benefit .
