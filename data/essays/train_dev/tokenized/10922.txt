In rapidly chaing world , it is clear that those who are not unerstand ideas and concept are unlikely to succeed .
some arguee that it is ideal to learn facts .
however , i agree that it is unrealistic to learn fact .

because , doing so prevent them developing thier knowledge and finding more rational facts .

First .
learning facts do not increase thier knowledge .
this is because if people learn facts .
they become weary of the facts .
which makes it difficult to develop thier ceative knowledge .
for example , recent study shows that students who learn facts produce knowledge 30 percent less than students who understand ideas and concepts .

this is because students become fed up with simply facts .
it make them dull .
as a result , learning facts prevent students from develping their knowledge .

Second , understanding ideas and concepts help students find more rational facts .
this is because they can find more rational facts from experience to understand .
for instance my son has learned from learning facts to understanding ideas .
I disappointed whenever he do not understand principle of something .
however , after he change the method of learning to understading ideas .
he finding more rational facts .
if he had chosen to learn facts .
he would not have been able to find more rationl facts .

In short .
it is impractical to learn facts fot students .
since it lead to lower knowledge .
furthermore , experiece to understand ideas and concepts help them find rational facts .
although it 's easy to learn facts .
it prevent them growing thier professional lives .
