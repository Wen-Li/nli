I would have to agree by the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

As more and more cars are rapidly produced today , the government especially has been doing all its best to provide necessary public transportations throughout a nation .
The space allocated for the vehicles will soon be not enough .
Population growths directly contributes to the increase in the number of drivers on the road .
Highways of hundred of metres tall will anyway be fully congested with drivers .
With limited spaces or lands throughout a country , any single government would surely take the step into reducing the number of cars on road , which also could cause pollutions .

As do the government here in Malaysia , they are trying their best to reduce the number of cars on the road .
One move that was made to the Malaysian government on to reduce the number of cars is by imposing taxes .
By imposing heavy percentage of taxes on imported as welllas the local cars , it was believed to be an incentive for drivers to find an alternative mode of transport .
But this has obviously been proved less effective .
This automatically brought them about to reducing the number of drivers instead .
For example of an action that has taken by the government is by setting an older age line for wannabe drivers to be competant on the road .

This delay of upcoming drivers is also supported by another wise move which like any other country , which is by improving the country 's public transportation .
Public transportation is the one and only solution that can help curb future congestions on the road .
Take for example , the train .
Easy accessibility , low and flat priced ticket and large-sized public transportation is the perfect charactheristic of a highly effective mode of vehicle which many government are vying to achieve .
The most obvious example of a highly effective public transport is none other than the bullet train located in Japan .
Another example is the country , Australia that I have visited .
The sight of seeing only small number of cars in the roads of Australia has clearly shown to me , as a Malaysian what my country should ought to be like .
If in Austrialia , every now and then you can only hear a honk or the screeches of the tyres , I 'm sure in twenty years down the road the roadway will be an empty one !
