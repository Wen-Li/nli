I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements ( ads . )
make products seem much better that they in fact are .
In my opinion many times ads .
fail to meet the spectations created when you finally get or check what advertised .
Ads .
have many times very few to do with reality because of several reasons .
I will discuss about some of them from my point of view .

First of all , the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes the companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products .
Every company shows their products in the ads .
as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors .
When I was a child many times I got dissapointed with most ot the toys I received as gifts at birthdays , those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV that in my hands .

Another point has to do with quality .
Many times the quality you get is much worst that what is offered or suggested in ads .
For example the sport shoes never last me so longer than I expect from the ads .
I see and the price I pay for them .

Moreover another issue is customer service of service given to customer once he or she bought something .
In ads .
most of the companies focusses on their quality and responsibility .
Unfortunately most of the times you can not get easily a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised .
I faced bad experiences with the call centers of the telecom companies wasting a lot of time and money in uselless reclamations .

Another trick used by ads .
is the way those ads .
are showed .
Normally on TV you can see gorgeous people or aggressive music , so you rather pay attention to the person or musich announcing the item than the annonced item itself .
Linked to this is when famous people as actors , actresses , film makers , sportmen or sportwoman are used in the ads .

To sum up , I do not believe what is showed in the ads .
since they make the producs be more attractive than they really are .
Ads .
are not factual most of the times .
