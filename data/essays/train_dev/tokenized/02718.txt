Facts can be research by student in order to improve their knoledge about an idea .
There is several ways to support the statement that is more important understan ideas and concepts than acquire knoledge of facts .
Science requiere student to think constantly and develope a critic way to think .
For example , for a lawyer it is more importante to learn how to think logically than learn a set of laws in order to be sucesfull in his carrier .
A set of laws can change withing one period of Congress ; this will leave the given lawyer who just learn a set of laws obsolet .
He will need to go to university to learn again the set of laws to be usefull in his field .
Fortunately , this is not the way that lawyer learn about their carrier , most of the knoledge adquired at a law school is to think logically .
Even with a cange of legislation a lawyer still been a lawyer .
However , there is allways the requirement to be updated with tecnology and new researchs to be succesffull in any given carrier .
For a historian there is no discution that is require to learn facts .
The same concep does not apply for a doctor .

There is allways the necesity of improve proceces to evolve with socity .
This is the reason that universities develop research departments .
If socity does not make research there will be no progress in many industries .
In order to achive progress stdents make research to understand ideas and concepts .
If their noledge is based just on facts they would be no able to discover new theories .
For example , all the improvement in telecomunications .
Thanks to the understanding of ideas and concepts student has improve the internet telephony making ship to call long distance .

Finally , will be imposible to socity to progress if we just waste time to learning facts .
Like in a picture , socity will be static with no improvement , like the Menonites that like to live in the past ignoring the new opportunities that ideas brings .
