An anecient Arabic says `` take whole things from a particular thing , and take something from all things . ''
Having a broad knowledge of many acadimic subject is better than stay on one speclizie subject for many reasons that strict scinces , provied another scinctist and expand personal awareing .

First , sinces are complacated and crossed .
By way of example , there is a crossed between Law and Political , so any specilist who interest in Law needs to study a little about political .
And there are many scinces which concrated from many scinecs , such as , Piochimestry , Economy law ,

Furthermore , specilist needs to know some information about board scinces to biuld bridges with another specilist , he and another people need each other to provide thier knowlodge , experinces , resaerches .
For example , pofessor of Physics will get a lot of benifit from professor of Math , that will encourge thier ideas and theoris , so

Moreover , a broad knowlodge expand awareing of mind , it gives a lot of information that can not be in a similar labs which specilist stay in .
As example , professor of Law can not know any things about periods of arabic poets if he does net deal with Arabic Letrituer professor .
Also he can enjoy in peoples inventions , and he gets more angles view to life .

As a result , I agree to having broad knowledge because it has a lot of advanteges , change realtionship between scinctist , and expand awaing .
