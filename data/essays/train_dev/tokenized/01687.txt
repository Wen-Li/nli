I mainly agree with that statement .
But it is important in which relationship this statement has to bee seen .
I think for example that it is correct if it is related to languages .
It is obvious better to speak a little bit of english , french , german and italian than only one of them perfectly .
Concerning the profession I have to disagree with the statement .
In today 's economic situation it is better to be specified .
The unemployment is so high that it is possible to be well educated but yet unemployed if you are not specialized enough .
On the other hand a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects can be better , if you have to manage for example your own firm and can not rely on other specialists .

It is important to notice that a broad knowledge is the base for further knowledge in these areas .
So if you do not have any variety of knowledge it is much harder to gain experiences in those unrevealed areas .
Especially in the actual situation it is important to be flexible and to be willing to keep on learning during your whole lifetime .
If you were a specialist in one certain subject you probably would not be willing to listen to more actual information because of your status as specialist .

It clearly depends on one 's character but my oppinion is , that specialization is minor in contrast to a broad knowledge of many subjets .
As I stated above the base is the most important thing .
Afterwards there is still time to specialize certain subjects in which you are interested in .
If you do not know all the possibilities you can not be sure having chosen the right way .

I would prefer a broad knowledge because then I stil have all possibilities .
If I specialized and chose wrong , I would be dissapointed .
You do not know how the future will be that is why specialization is such a dangerous thing .
It is better to be eventually less qualified in a lot of subjects than to be specialized in one which no one needs .

So in general I would agree with the statement .
Specialization comes after the broad base of many academic subjects .
