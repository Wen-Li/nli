Whenever we are discussing about the study , one thing we should always take into the consideration is that there should not be any conflict , on the matter In my point of veiw person 's academic backgruond make that person more strong in his future so as in the student life they should never deni or refuse for the further education , because it may give them somewhere less status int he society which might in future lead him in the depression .

In my opionion , i feel it is alway better to have specialize in one subject than having only the broad knowledge of the many academic subjects , Because l feel lots may things might make student puzzle as dont have the enough complete knowledge of any subject , but if a student is Master in a subject he can definately make a successful life he will definately have the all detail information of the subject and no one will challenge him at any point of his subject and he can do much progress in his carriar

Not only in the knowlege but Economically also that student became more confident , independent and able carry his life with all leisure , and he will grow up in his life .
Many other professional will promote him and as his experience will keep him onthe highest peak of sucess , and satisfaction , his income , respect , and the position where he is working will definaltely keep on increase .

And , all these things finally relax him in the end of his life , he will have the satisfaction about the professional victory he has gain in his life , Every specialisation will differ each one from the other and he or she became a specific knowledegable person and will gain all the importance in himself .

Finally , i want to conclude BE SPECIALIZE WITH A SPECIFIC SUBJECT it will complete circle of education .
