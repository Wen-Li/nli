I really agree with the statement .
In Italy , the place where I live there are a lot of advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are , I hope these advertisements will disappear because I think that the the way how people spend money it 's not a joke .

I could write a lot of examples about these stuffs .
I have a friend , Kate , she bought a shower gel that ensure her body skin to become smooth just like silk , but it is n't the truth !
Another example could be the lcd televisions that clerks encourage you to buy with the promise of a great view and a lot of light , but then you discover that you need to submit a new pay-per-view frequence to see it .

In past I had a lot of argues with people who sold these kind of stuffs .
I do n't want to say that is always the same , sometimes there are a lot of things that seem to be great trought advertisement and after you buy them you discover they are really pretty good .

In my life I do n't like lies , and I do n't like liar people , and I really hate who promise you something and then you discover it was just a bad lie , and I think that these people deserve law judgment and to go in jail especially when they handle other people 's money .

I think that in the time that we live with a lot of diffusion it 's important for economies to be clear , because having a clear economy is the first step for people to trust in their own governments and make world works in the right direction .

In my opinion it 's important to have laws that allow people to trust in advertising and made advertisements clear and sure for people who buy someting without bad surprices .
