I agree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

First , student must learn what it is meaning .
They totally understand the definitions , concepts and the ideas .
For example , if a student does not know the definition , he or she could not prove the theorem .
He or she could not combine the two different problems to solve .
If it is not known what the plus mean , it can not be said one plus one equals two .

Second , knowing the reason or reasons , shows the paths that goes the facts .
Students always seek the reasons beyond what they see .
Only the learning the results does n't enough .
They have to ask where is this coming from ?

I think , to do something important we expand our vision and dig deeper than ever .
We would expose undiscovered things only when we do n't limited ourselves with the given facts .
