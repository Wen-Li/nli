I do not believe that the given statement is true .
Indeed , I understand the logic which lies under that assumption but personally , I do n't have the impression that it is a veracity .

First of all , it is important to analyse why someone who only meets success is more likely to take risks than somebody else .
As a matter of fact , when you succeed a project , you feel satisfied .
The more you achieve what you want , the more you become confident .
Then , it is like a spiral : the more you get , the more you want to get .
In fact , when you plan to start a business and it works well , you think about expanding your activities .
If it works and you are already at the head of a big company , you may diversify your business .
That is why big companies like Bouygues are in building , mobile phones and so on .
Virgin makes discs but also develops its own mobile phones programs .
Those companies take risks , while entering new markets .
They believe in their success because they are supported by their customers .

However , new things are not always done by successful people .
Creativity , for instance , has nothing to do with sucess ; it is about personality .
So an artists does not always meet success .
Nonetheless , his or her desire to create will still go on .
That explains why a lot of painters did a lot of breakthroughs after many failures .
Another example is Alain Baraton , a famous gardner in Versailles .
He has failed during his school years but then , while he worked in Versailles he developed a passion for gardening and created new arrangements around the castle .
Besides , you can not be successful all the time but it does not means that you are less willing to do new things .
In addition to that , someone , who really wants to be recognised by the society and has never achieved that goal , will probably try everything he or she can .

As a conclusion , success is not so closely tied to ` boldness ' as the statement suggests .
