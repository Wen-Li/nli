Some people prefer to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Others believe that elders enjoy life more .
when faced with the decison of who enjoys more , quite a few would claim that young people have more energy to enjoy life more and that is my point .
there are numerous reasons why young people enjoy life more .
I will explore a few of the most important ones here .

The main reason for my opinion is that young people are at the begining of the life and they have more advantages .
Take my father and my brother as example , my father has a lot of responsibility while my brother does n't have any .
when my father want to do something new , he should think himself and his family .
my brother , in contrast , goes out at night and comes back whenever he wants and he is n't bread earner .

There is another factor that deserves some mention here .
People are different .
They have different traits , customs , belief and life style .
some pfrefer to stay at home when they get older , others go out more than they did when they are young .

Similirly these reason also apply for young people .
when we consider that some young people have a lot of responsibility , while other do n't .
young people have opportunity to choose what they want .
when they have opportunity , they can go for it and they can make the most of it .

it seems very difficult for us to prefer one to another because some people are very emotional others very strict and small problems do n't usually get to them .
in short , even tough young people have some problems choosing their career , they have more advantages to enjoy life .
but that does n't means older people do n't have fun .
they do .
sometimes more than young people .
