traviling is a very nice thing , it hepls you see new coultcurs and to meet new poeplo , there are alot of ways for traviling and i believe that the best way is to travil with a group led by a tour guide , becuse when you go to a new country u will need someone to gide u aroud u will never know where to go or what to do alone only if u had someone to guide u to show you the best and the most important parts of the city you are in the guide will have a plan to show you every thing in the city so u wont miss a thing and also if u needed a help he can help u or if u dont speck the languej of that country you are in he can help u with that to for exaple if u were in paris and u dont speck french what can u do if u were alone ??
at that time a guide would help you alot , and to be with a gruop is so much fun than beeing alone thats where u can meet new people make new friendes and enjoy your time and its also much cheeper to travel with a group rather than traviling alone so it would save you alot of monye to for example if wanted to go anywere u will have to take a cab but if u were with a group u can go on the bus it would be much cheeper , thats why i agree that traviling with a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travil .
