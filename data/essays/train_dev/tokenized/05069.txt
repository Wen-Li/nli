In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do .
There are several reasons to explain my opinion .

Young people can enjoy life because they dont have responsibilities .
They have more freedoom .
They must go to school , do their homeworks and clean their rooms .
But they have a lot of free time .
They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun .
They can meet many other friends to have fun together .

Old people have important responsibilities and they must work for their families or themself .
They spend most of time at work .
They can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening .
Old people are more mature than young people because they had many experencies during their life .

In conclusion i think that young people can enjoy life more than older people do .
