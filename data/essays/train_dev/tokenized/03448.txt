I agree with the people now is very busy to think about to offer some help .
It is very important to understand that today the world is very competitive , and young people have to be dedicated on his learning , developing their skills and improving their capacity to answer the demand of new professionals .
However is truth that exist another kind of people that are very comprometive with the situation of the others and the mayority of this persons are young people .

This world is very complicated and is very difficult to achieve the individuals goals .
People have to work very hard , they do not have any time to breath , to stop and to think in another situation .
The life is taugh and they have to give an answer about what is their role today .
People try to have success , try to demostrate their worth and work to be the best .

They have to study , next to find a good job and to survive into this competitive world .
Them they have very tired to spend their time in another task .
They do not have too much time and they know it .

However today the things have been changed .
Actually young people , start to be more compromited with helping their communities .
They use to take part in different events , and participate in various associations .
There are alot of people developing jobs that have very relation with voluntaries activities .
The reality of this time is that there are people who want to colaborate and serve .

I think that today beging to be a new kind of people , vey responsible with the social situation and very identified with teh situation of another people .
