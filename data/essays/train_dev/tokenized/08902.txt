Very few people in France think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic than to specialise in one specifice subject .
Indead , they think that you need to go through all the details of a specific field if you want to be efficient .
Is that true or not ?

I do n't agree with such a prejudice .
On the contrary , I think the more you know , the more efficient you are .
For example , if someone wants to work in a library , will he be more efficient if he knows everything about books , publishing and printing ?
I do n't think so .
I think he will be more efficient if he knows about different things such as history , anthropology , philosophy , litterature or science .
Practice can give you all technical knowledge but it will never replace broad knowledge provided by schools and universities .

The second reason why I think a broad knowledge is important in our society is that people who have broad knowledge are more flexible .
They are able to switch from one field to another .
In other words , they are what I would call ` complete persons ' .
The can adapt themselves to every change .
For example , you can be a banker today and become a manager tomorrow .

My last point is about my political vision of a modern society : I think that a good citizen needs to have a broad knowledge of all academic subjects in order to make good choices .
Reality is complex : if you want to understand what is happening in your contry and in the whole world you need to have a solid knowledge in different fields such as geography , economy or technology .

To conclude about this subject , I would say that the british ideal of the ` gentleman ' who knows about all aspects of human things continues to be important in our modern world .
