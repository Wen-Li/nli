I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I belive that a lack of altruistic and selfless acts are directly spurred from economic and social reasons .

In today 's world , many youths do not see a valid social reason to immerse themselves in community service .
Although the majority of the world 's population lives in abject poverty , those who are capable of giving to their communities are often segregated from those who are in need .
Hence , the lack of awareness prevents today 's youth from helping out .

Speaking from personal experience , I find that there is a gradual decline in my own community of youths that refuse to give or help out their communities in any manner .
As the president of Key Club , an international community service organization in my high school , I find it more and more difficult every year to recruit new members to replace the ones that have departed .
I remember when there were about 40 members in the group - now I find that it is even difficult to gather 20 members for the meetings .
The only sense of giving that can be felt in my school 's atmosphere is purely caused from the need to `` look good '' on transcripts for college .
Of course , I 'm sure not all of them feel this way , but I truly think it 's safe to say that the majority feels this way .

Every year , monetary donations rise in Key Club as the number of members decline .
This is an economic reason why I belive that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Inevitably , most of us in the world have been brought up be capitalists - when we give , we expect something back in return .
However , when youths help out with their communities , they do not receive something tangible as rewards .
Hence , today 's youth neglects to help their communities .
Due to this fact , those who can help and give find it extremely annoying to invest their time in helping others .
Thus , their only token of help is through monetary means , which they believe is compensation for not giving time to their communities .
Nonetheless , society 's greed can even prevent the giving of money .

It 's truly a shame to look around and see that today 's youth , or tomorrow 's leaders , refuse to invest their time when they are perfectly capable of doing so .
It is time that society creates more awareness in young people to be willing to invest their times for others .
Once youths overcome their laziness , fear of helping out , and learn that the greatest reward ( as cliched as it may sound ) is the fuzzy feeling they get from giving time and helping others , it will be the massive stepping stone in getting the world 's youth more involved .
