although facts provide a clear and better opinion for a particular subject but personally i think that to understand the basic concepts and the main idea behind the subject is much better as compared to simply knowing the facts .
so i agree with the statement that it is more important to understnd ideas and concepts then merely learning the facts .

as we see that students in their schools or colleges perform much better when they understand the concepts well and have a clear idea of the subject that is being taught .
they never have to cram the things when the basic concept is clear in their mind .
also they never forget that thing for the entire life .
knowing the facts may fetch them good marks but they forget the subject within a short span of time .

secondly , the workers in an office show much better performance when they understand the basic concept and the main idea behind the project they are working on .
simply knowing the facts would not generate an effective result .
so in order to get a better promotion they have to learn the concepts well so that they perform well .
like in todays world one must have the idea and concept of a computer to perform well in office or in his or her job .

thirdly , it is very important for a player of any game to know the basic concept of the game rather then the facts .
when i learened to play football my coach told me the main concept behind the game and hence i play the game well .
simply knowing the facts about football can not make me a good player .

thus we saw that how knowing the concepts and the basic ideas behind a subject is much better than by simply knowing the facts .
