Nowadays it 's very important to have a good academic formation to get an interesting job and realize yourself , but this should be reached in two ways : a broad knowledge and a specific knowledge .

I 'm italian , so I 'm influenced by the italian typical school system based on a big knowledge of many subjects .
In fact when I was at school I studied a lot of subject , including Latin and ancient Greek , and when I was at the university I took twentyfive exames on different aspects of economics .

I think that it 's important to have a broad knowledge of many subjects because today when you work you need to be more flessible than before ; a lot of things are changed and it 's quite different from the beginning of the twentieth century when Ford teorized the `` work specialization '' .

But , probably in some case it should be different ; for example an ingeneer needs to know a lot of things in a specific subject and he must specialize in a specific construction sector , and , I think , it 's similar for medicians .

On the other hand , my preparation is general because I would become a manager , and it 's konw that a manager must be resolve a lot of different problems in different ways , you may use your ability to find new solution to the problems .

For example , if you have a problem selling a product because the market does n't like it , you have two choises : the first is to retire the product from the market and second one , which is more creative , is to find a good marketing solution to make the product `` pulled '' by the market .

In conclusion , I think that you must choos your formation depending on your interests and your future job .
