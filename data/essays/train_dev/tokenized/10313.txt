I completely agree with the idea that successful people are those who are more curious than other to do and learn new things .
People that are still and do not feel the need of keep improving their abilities and are not ready to change and adapt to different situation and environments will hardly become important .
For instance people that think that they can keep living in today 's world withough

Successful people in everyday 's life are those who are innovative , take risks and as soon as they have learnt something they are already oriented to another thing .

Capable managers in the field of industry consider research and development as a priority activity and a tremendous key factor in order to make a business successful .
Let 's considere a very typical Italian example , a person that reached in his life a lot of success : Silvio Berlusconi .
He started his carrer in the real estate , he was constructing and selling residential buildings , even though this market was successul he invested his first money buying a small television network .
Year after year this business grew and he managed to buy other networks in Italy and in other countries as well .
It was still not enough .
With the money he gained from this business he bought a football team that was completely unknown , ac milan .
He became president and in 15 years of presidency he made it one of the most popular team of the world .
But he did not stop even at this point !
He started getting interested in politics and in 1994 he became the italian prime minister .

I think that this is one of the best example to understand how curiousity , capabilities , and inclination to try new things can make someone very successful .
