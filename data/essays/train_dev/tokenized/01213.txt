Education is the cornerstone in our society , It 's the main path that leads a person into the large , endless world of knowledge .
Knowledge can be broad , as well as narrow .
But which one is better to have ?

To be able to answer this question properly , this topic will be divided into two parts : the undergraduate and the graduate students .

The undergradutate students will take a diversity of courses .
This will provide them with a large opportunity that allows them to choose in which field to go later on .

For example , in the first two years of the pre-pharmacy degree , we used to take , for instance , cultural study courses , arts courses , which are not related to pharmacy .
And many students shifted their major after taking these courses .
They found themselves brilliant in other fields .
This diversity in courses , gave them the chance to choose the major that suits them the best .
Imagine that the students take only major pharmacy courses from the first year .
This could lead to the failure of many students , because they were not given the chance to study other courses .
It 's a serious situation , especially in the academic majors that are related to the public health and safety , such as medicine , pharmacy , engineering , etc . ..

However , the graduate students do n't have this problem .
They decided to go through a specific field , after taking this diversity of courses , when they used to be undergraduate students .

So , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will not last forever .
And it 's a complementary of the narrow knowledge .
