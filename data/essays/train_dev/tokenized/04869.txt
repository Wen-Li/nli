Do young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
perhaps it is diffecult to answer because every one of them have their method to enjoy their own life .
But in my opinion , old people enjoy life more than young ones because of several reasons so I disagree with this statement .

First , old people have a long experience in life so they know exactly how they enjoy .
In contrast , young people do't have enough experiences .

For an example , mybe an young person tried to enjoy by something which is harmful but he did n't know , and after some time he enjured him self .
But an old one may have an experience with that thing so he will not try it again .

Second , even though that young persons have a lot of choises to enjoy but in the sane time they have several things to worry about .
For example , their jobs , their business , their family , their healthy and other things that the life now required to worry about .

On the other hand , old persons do n't have any thing to worry about except thei healthy .

For example , young person go to the gym to enjoy and whil he excersices he remember something that make him go out from the gym and lose that enjoy time .
But the old one will not care about any other thing than his enjoy and his health .

finally , every one has his own enjoyable .
