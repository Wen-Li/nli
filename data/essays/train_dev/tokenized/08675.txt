Evolution has prooven that , specialized organisms as well as organisms that have refraind form specializing have endured .
Specialists were able to ensure their survival by fitting into a single vacant ecological gap in which they flourished .
Unspecialized organism have to rely on their flexibility ; and that is exactly their advantage .
Because , they are not specialized and are dependent of their flexibility , they are more capable of adapting to a new situation .
Oraganism that do n't adapt die and eventually their entire species will become extinct .
One can easily project that image on human fields of knowledge .
Being able to build life decisions on a great base of knowledge is more profitable then being specialized in only one field be it an academic subject or set of ideas and values .

Being able to adapt is of greatest necessity .
It is part of everyone 's everyday life , you adapt to the people you talk to , you adapt to the people you work with , and you even adapt to your own family .
If you have been specialized in one field it would probably be the one of greatest interrest to you , this does not mean though that all the people around you shre your enthusiasm about the same subject , which means that one has to be able to talk about other mayor topics in life .
Granted , being a professional specialized in something vital does serve one well in the modern world in sense of economical seccurity , but what good does it do when you posess omnipotet knowledge of one field but are incapable of seeing the conections to another ?
When the company , in which someone was the specialist for that and only that specific company 's computer network , goes bankrupt , he is jobless .

I belive that broadening one 's own horrizon , be it intellectually or emotionally , more likely grants a secure and fullfilled duture
