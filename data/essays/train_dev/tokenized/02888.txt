I agree with this statement which is that , `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
I feel this way because if we go for the products by just looking at the advertisements then we can not really judge a product just by sitting at home and looking at an advertisement .

First reason that think that advertisements do n't at all make products better than what they are , is that , what we see can not be true or a right thing most of the times .
For example an adverisement on tv showing about a new car launched by some xyz company .
Well to buy a car we really need to go out to a showroom and have a look at it as well as test drive it .
But just by looking at an ad we ca n't predict the way in which a car would be handling at severe turns and bends .
Well

Secondly nowadays a lot of advertisemnt endorsing is done by popular faces like the actors sportsmen and so on .
Well i saw an advertisement of a bike recently on tv .
This bike was endorsed by rising sportstar .
In my hometown a lot of people by seeing this advertisement went to the showroom and bought that bike .
Well i certainly know from the response from which iam hearing about the bike from my fellow friends is that the bike was n't even worth a penny .

It was so poorly designed .
The electronics the engine was the major problem concerning that bike .
Now my friends are complaining to the dealer about their sorry state .
So i do feel that by just following an advertisement one should not loose his normal senses and end up buying false products .

Additionally people who are making these advertisements about the products as well as those endorsing these products do they really use these products ?
Well it seems to be an interesting question .
For example an actor in my hometown is endorsing a product of personal computer and laptops .
But recently at a film production unit my friends did see him using a laptop of another brand .
This means that he is sure that the product which he is endorsing is unreliable .
Mostly we would not find all of the above people who make these advertisements , using these products .
They would be using products from more famous brands and reputed ones .
Hence we should not always look at an advertisement an buy the product .

In conlusion to the above mentioned points i firmly believe that todays advertisements are no more than a fake piece of information that is shown on television to make money out of the innocent people .
Thus i believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
