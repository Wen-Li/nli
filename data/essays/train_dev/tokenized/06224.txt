Let me introduce first .
I am from Japan and have grown up there .
I totally agreed with that yong people recently do not give enough time to helping their communities .
The some reasons why young people does not are that in Japanese society , there are more interests , such as playing video games and interuption like busy for studying .
Or the young people tend to not have any interests to others .

Most of elderly people said `` a long time ago of young people have sufficient time for helping their communities . ''
However , time is always changing , therefore , youth does not want to help or not like their communities at all .
Even if their parents may be not care of those communities , so they might not to push their sons or daughters going to communities .

On the other hand , because Japanese are studying so harder than playing , and some of youth has to focus on studying instead of helping the communities , so they do not have time to go communities .
Not only Japanese study so hard , but also does Asian study very hard if we compare between Asia and North America .

Americans may have enough time to helping their communities because I saw young Americans by using my eyes .
Also , I heard from my friends who are Americans that Japanese are studying hard than Americans .
It means that Japanese do not have time to helping their communities .

In Japan , there are one of the worst booms for young people .
We called the boom : `` Hikikomori Phenominon . ''
Young Japanese ( young adults too ! )
tends to stay at their houses , especirooms , and spend time there in a whole day .
It means that they do not have any interests outside of the world .
They never work for job , go to school , and never going out .

In conclusion , the reasons why in recent years young people do not have time to spend are changing period , busy for studying , and bad phenominon .
