In one hand , i 'm not agree with this following statement .
As we can see , there is more and more people who living on this earth .
Progress of medecine , which make us our life being longer , the multiplication of the population let me think that we will be more humans in 2026 than in 2006 .
And due to this multiplication , the number of cars sold out each year makes me feel that cars will develop in the same way like the population .
Moreover , no governments have for the moment took postion in order to discover a new means of transport .
They are elaborating composed fuel ( with ethanol ) or other kinds of fuel , in order to reduce gas emission in the atmosphere but not in the way to reduce numbers of cars .

But on the other hand , many things make me think it to the contrary .
Fisrtly , i have talked about progress made by the medecine , in the first section , but it 's also all progresses made in science in general .
Something let me think that some utopists had the right key .
I 'm attend to wait for a replacement of cars by planes .
It 's in my logic .
And why do the teletransportation can not be created in the nearest future .
Teletransportation can replace cars .

Secondly , i 'm sur that the lack of petroleum which must happen in further years , will be the key of the substitution .
Even if we find solutions . ..
but today , it is not going in that way .
We can also try to limit the numbers of car by instauring mass means of transport , like buses or trains .

Finally , the lack of petroleum is not the only reason of a whispered decline in the numbers of cars .
Even if we are still to discover new materials , added to the numbers of cars made by year , we can suggest a lack in metals , plastic , as far as the consumptiom of all habitants of this Earth is so fast .

To me , it is difficult to forecast such a statement , even if i hope there will be less and less cars , and what i hope the most , is that a genius must created the teletransportation , it will be very efficient for all people in all the World .
But who knows what our future is made of . ..
