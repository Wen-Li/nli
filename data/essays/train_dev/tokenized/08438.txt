I agree totaly with this statement , actualy the most richer people in the world and the biggest managers are persons who has taken risks in their lives to become what they are today .
Often people are afraid to do things that goes out of ordinary because that may be does not work and they can find their selves with no jobs any more , no money , they con become a person who is out of the socity and rejected .
Sometimes i think it is better to listen to our heart and to belives in our self and in our capacities and in our imagination and ability to create because we can be able to succeed even if there are risks to take , who 's knows we may be able to do so much extraordinary things if only we were more bravious !
In a other side i think that a person who is always doing the same things at work all his life is not happy , it is such borring to repeat the same things more and more , why ca n't we just blow all thease ennoying works away and realising our dreams ?
We most not forgive that we have just one life in this earth so we mos I take the exemple of bill gates who is very famous .
Bill gates when he was at the bigining of his cereer took the risk to put a new conception of way to use computer on the market of PC , a totaly new project .
Others thought he was a fool but he succeded and today every body use his logiciel , every one knows microsoft 's logiciels , he is every where !
