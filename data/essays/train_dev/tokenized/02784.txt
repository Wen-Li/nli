I totally agree with the statement given above .

First of all , advertisements only show the advantages of a product and not the possible disadvantages .
I made this experience for my own for quite a several times .
I remember the first advertisements of the IPod from Apple .
The customers really got the feeling , that the IPod was not only a simple music player in a good looking design , but even that it is the most handiest player on the market .
I was one of the first people who bought an IPod but after a short period of time I was a little bit depressed about my decision .
The advertisements did not show , that for example it was only possible to change the recorded music with one single software program and only one computer at once .
I have still got the IPod , but in fututre I will be better informed about the features of a product , before I buy it .

Furthermore , quite a lot of products do not aim the characteristics in the way the advertisements show .
A good friend of mine is working in the marketing business unit of a company , which is doing the advertising for different companies .
It is allways very intersting and funny when we are getting together for a drink and talk about our jobs .
Everytime it is the same that he tells me about new of his customers and their products .
My friend and his collegues sometimes do not even see one advantage of a product which should be advertized by them , but it is their job to present the product in a kind of way that people have the desire to buy it .

As I have shown above , advertisements do not allways shows the truth about a product and put much better light on it than it is .
I made these experiences for several times and I learned from this .
I think everybody should be aware of , that the product she/he buys is perhaps not as perfect as the advertisment of the product showed .
