When it comes to learning facts , some people argue that it is easy way to understand some methods .
Personally , I think that students are needed to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
This is because understanding ideas and concepts widen peoples intellectuals and people can use these ideas more practical ways .

First of all , students can broaden their intellectuals horizons by understanding ideas and conceps .
In the case of learning facts , it is obvious that help people recognize some physical thing .
However , these facial and physical thing only allows students to learn those facts .
This would limites people 's imagination that they can not undertand above thing such as using other fields .
For example , one of the most famous scientist in Korean , Ho Jin Moon , once said that when he was young , he had toughted by teachers who just conveyed fact information to students .
His parents thought that these methods would restricts thier son 's understanding so that they moved America .
At there , he could take more idea based education and when he grows up , he returned to mother nations and have eagared to disffutes ideas and concept based educations .
He argues that by taking this education students can undertants more in-depts knowleges .

On top of that , people can use thier knowledges in practical ways .
In today 's society , people are bound and driven hectic schedules , this hectic atmosphere make people only focus on the facts so that they can not use thier knowleges only in few fields .
However , the basic ideas and concepts in education are liked each other .
Especially in science , if they undertand this basic concepts , learning scientific concept is more easy .
To demonstrate , according to a study released by the Korean National Research Center , more than two thirds of surveyed scientists responsed that understanding ideas and concepts more important because by doing this , students can like thier knowledge not only thier major fields , but also the other silimal scientific fields .
They said that electronic science can be useful in manufactualing engineering so that studnets who majoring engineering are needed to understand electronic sciendce basically .

In conclusion , I strongly believe that students should focus on understanding ideas and concepts dut to they can widen their intelectuals horizons and
