When it comes to students learning , the discussion of the issue has become a vogue during the last decade .
Considering soial atmosphere today , some people hold the opinion that learning facts is more important for students is superior to understanding ideas and concepts .
Others , however , contradict learning facts .
Personally , I agree on that understanding ideas and concepts because it has more advantags .

Firstly , thoes people agree on learning forget a universal truth that as a old saying that `` know the smell until you teste it '' .
As I remember , the people popular in the society all have strong abilities that can paly a role in their work areas .
The abilities can not be learned in the classes , because it needs to have more practise in the real society .

Inaddition , another more essential factor why I advocate understanding is more importan is that learning facts without understan will forget soon .
An example I can give the details of the argument : some people like to copy other 's work in order to hand in in to the teacher , but they never understand what the answers mean , because they just learn to do not understand to do .
Thus , they could't get the knowlogies .

Of couse , choosing the learning facts also has advantages in some extent .
For example , the tescher always give us right answer that could avoid to waste of time ; they also guide us a shortest way to reach the results ; and they do good for us to make a better life ; and so on .

But if all these factors are contemplate , the advantages of understanding idaes and concepts carry more weight than those of learning .
To sum up , based on the above discussion , it is obvious to conclude that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning factors .
