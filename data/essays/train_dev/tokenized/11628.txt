For lots of people , traveling is one of the most enjoyable experiences .
Throughout the world , millions of tourists travel every year .
Some of those tourists travel independantly while others are led by tour guides .

In my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid because by this way I will be sure that I will visit the most interisting places at the country to which I traveled .
I remember , for instance , my first trip to Egypt and how the tour guide insured me and the other group members seenig the most fascinating archaeological sights there .
Moreover , I believe that being led by a tour guid is more secure than exploring a foriegn country lonely .
However , being led by a tour guide would not be a happy experience for a tourist who wants to wonder around the real cities and discover the the other lively sides of a country .

Furthermore , there are other methods that can provide the same capablity of a tourist guid .
For example , the books that include useful information about the places that can be enjoyable for tourist to visit , maps and illustrated books .

Another important raeson makes me prefer traveling with a group that being with a group of someone 's country or cluture would make them feel more secure and safe rather than knowing no one .

In conclusion , I would prefer to guided by a local person who know more than me about his/her country .
