I agree with the passage that states that successful people try new things and take risks .

It is good for people to do what they know how to do well , and probably they will succeed on that topic but if they only focus on that , they wo n't be as succesful as they would have been by trying different things and taking risks .

I believe that the more new things we try , the more we learn , and therefore , the more chances we have to feel that we made it to our goal , which I think is what defines sucess in life .

But of course the risk should not be any type of risk , for example , opening a new business like the restaurant , would be a risk for people that do not have the expertise on that type of business but if they ask for advice from experts on that area and make a sound judgement of the possibilities of that particular business , it is good to take the risk .

Another example of a type of risks that people can take in order to reach sucess , is taking the chance to apply to a University to get a degree .
Some people think that they will be rejected and because of that they just keep in the same possition that they are at that moment , maybe because they have a fear of failure .
If they do not work hard to get what they want and do not risk the possibility of feeling rejected , it is something that , I believe , will affect them in the future when they think about the things they have done in their pastw and did not do it .
That wo n't make the person feel sucesssful .

For all these reasons , I believe that sucessful people should take risks and learn to do new things in life .
