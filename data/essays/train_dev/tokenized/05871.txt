Can we say that successful people are the ones willing to try risky possibilities rather than running business as usual ?
I would think so .
There are , indeed , diffrent ways to `` try new things '' : launching a product that creates a new demand almost from scratch , and adding small changes to the way a business is run as successful people would not necessarily have to make a `` revolution '' and bringing slight changes can sometimes be a challenging risk .

First , let 's consider meaningful changes .
When taking a close look at the business world around us , there is no denial that many company leaders have succeeded in creating very profitable products that have sometimes meant the start of a new story for their company .
That 's what happenend with Apple when Steve Jobs decided to lauch the iPOD .
Instead of merely sticking to the core business of the company , which is selling MAC computers , this leader decided to take the risk and start a totally new product .
And , indeed , he succeded , reaching a point at which his product triggered a new way of listening to the music , therefore changing some cultural habbits in the American society , then worldwide and creating a new demand for his specific product .

That has also been the approach of Starbucks , that changed the way people drink their coffee : not any more in a caf , but walking in the street !
There was a huge risk for this success story at the begining , as it involved changing people 's habbits and way of life , but the risk was definitely worth it given the success of the company .

Secondly , we delve into detail in a different approach : the small changes to a business model-but that can mean more , indeed when put into practice .
It can also be a significant risk to change slight things in appearance , but a very rewarding one .
For example , Dell created a new way to make computers with customarized computers ordered piece by piece by the customers .
That was very successful
