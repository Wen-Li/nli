Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for many reasons .
First , trying new things gives you an opportunity to learn more , for example , learning to drive can make you focus more and see more .
In addition , you can be more experianced when you take the risk and try new things , the more you try the more feeling that you get that you have no limitations in what you can do , the more experinced you get .
Lets take the CEO 's of the big companies for example , if they did not try new thing and if they did not take risks , they definatlly would not be where they are now .
Third , trying new things and taking risks makes you more ready to solve problems .

On the other hand , not having the guts to try new thing and take risks could concequence in beeing in the same position for a long time if not for ever , .
Yuo will do your thing right , but you will do it for ever .
In conclusion , dont limit your self , dont underestemait your self , go out there and try new things and take the risk .
