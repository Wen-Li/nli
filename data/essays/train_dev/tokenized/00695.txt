About this topic , different people have different point of view .
However I think that is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First of all , we should know what is advertisement , that is a way to sell the products the company make , so that means the advertisement has to makes the products attractive to people , that is a main reason leads people decide to buy it or not .
For example , if you want to sell cookie , you may want to more and more people to buy it so you have to catch people 's eyes .
You may need to use some technology to improve your cookie 's feature .
Like the color should be more bright or make a suggestion that how to eat this cookie by the best way .
Thereby , that is impossible just to use the original feature of your cookie to make its advertisements .
So you have to make your cookie seem much better than it really is .

Also , there have a interesting thing that advertisements may trick the kids to interested about the products , like transformer advertisement .
In that advertisement , you will see that transformer can flys .
We all know that is impossible because the transformer even not exsists .
So when you buy a transformer to your children , they may dissappoints about this toy , because this is different from what they see from the transformer 's advertisement .
That is another reason advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Beside that , competition is anotrher reason that advertisements m - ake products seem much better than they really are , because this is a competition society , all the businessman are compare with others , so advertisements is another way to improve their business , so that sometimes , they may focus on the affection of advertisements instead the quality of the products .
When you watching the advertisement , you may have desire to buy it , that only prove that the advertisement of products affects you but not the real products , becuase before you want to buy it , you may even never use or taste the products before .

From what has been discussed above , we could safety draw the conclusion that Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
