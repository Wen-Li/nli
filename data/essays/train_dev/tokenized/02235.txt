In these modern times , youth are always bothered about achieving thieir individual goals and fullfiling their needs .
They are less bothered about their community .
Every youth has to play a certain role in the community .
He has to serve for the benefit of the community and future generations .

Often , Youth benefit from a communtiy and when they achieve their goal or reached a better situation with the aid of the community , they forget the help rendered to them .
For example in developing countires many students are provided reservations because they belong to a certain downtrodded community .
The students after achieving success are not indebted to the community and dont try to help it .

But there are some instances where this is not always true .
Consider the case of an Indian student going to the United States to pursue higher education .
He checks out the memeber 's of the Indian community in that college and contacts them before hand .
The members of the community then arrange for his transport from the airport to the university campus and then take care of him for two to three days .
Since the basic idea of this community is to help other students and in this aspect young people are suceeding .

There are also several youth who try to help their communities .
When a person leaves his country and achieves success , they do not forget their mother land , they try to help their native community .
Take the case of many Non Resident Indians .
These young people try to help and fund various charity organisations in India .

So , though i agree that young peole now a days are not giving enough time to help their communities , I feel that this is not always true because there are some instances where young people spend their time and money for the benefit of the community .
