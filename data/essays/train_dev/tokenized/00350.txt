Comparing to previous generations , many of today 's young people have forgotten the importance of their community .
Instead , they are now focusing on their own leisure times , such as playing video games and watching television .

It is a fact that many young people do not give enough time to helping their communitires .
Since today 's development of technology , many things seem fascinating to people .
Especially to the young people , who are curious about the society .
There are too many things that young people want to experience and try , and it also includes many negative things , such as smoking and drinkging .
Unlike today 's people , our previous generations learn to treasure their communities because they felt responsible to their own environment ; it is something they were told when they were young .

Unfortunately , today 's values are different from before ; people concentrate on physical enjoyment .
But , while they are experiencing the sensation of enjoyment , they are also ignoring their obligations to their communities and society .
In schools , we all have learned to be responsible to our surroundings ; however , many of us have forgotten the real concept of this responsibility .

Further , there are many examples of helping communities .
For an example , maintaing the cleaness and order of community is everyone 's obligation because everyone is a part of the community .
But , the many young people do not realize the importance of this obligation .
When the elders ask them for some working , they are usually respond with bad or unpleased attitudes ; they think it is a waste of time to help the community .
By looking closely , I see many negative things that will happen as those young people become adults .
Our society will be decadent if the government is ruled by lazy people ; more scarily , it is not only a joke but a truth of today 's young men .

However , our society have already realized the importance of correcting the young people 's attitudes .
They first begin the work at school by requiring community service for each student before they graduate from schools .
This is an important step to start with , because school is the place where everyone goes to .
Besides the effect of community service , many schools now also spreading the idea of protecting our environment .
Personally , I see these two things are start to work in many young minds .

Finally , before we act anything , we should first notice that Earth is our home ; we are all the owner of this planet ; therefore , while we are enjoying our physical happiness , we should also do something for our community .
The community is not only our home but also belong to our offsprings .
Even a bit of work we contribute to the community can make a change in society .
Lastly , we should provide a clean and healthy environment for our children .
