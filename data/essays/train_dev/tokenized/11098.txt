In these society , most people will spend for 6 to 12 years in different school to study .
The main purpose is to gain konwledge .
While some students think to understand ideas and concepts is more important than to learn facts , so they just learn to understand .
I do n't agree with that .
I think the facts of konwledge is importand as well as the ideas and concepts .
The two con not be without in the process to study .

First of all .
we should konw the purpose of study really .
Everyone konw that the purpose is to gain konwledge .
But what will we do use the konwledge ?
We should use the konledge to become out sklls and abilitise , which could use in the work and real life .
For example if a student thinks understand idase and concepst is more important than to learn facts .
He will easly ingore the significant of the facts .
And then do n't like to learn them .
After the student graduate , they just master many different concepts , but he is difficult to find a good job .
Becouse he can not use his konledge in the work .
So learn fact is very importan for the students ' future .

On the other hand , learn facts is also a good way to help the student to understand the ideas and concepts .
As we all konw , most of the ideas and concepts are consist of words and fomulars .
They are verg boring for students .
While when the student leare the ideas and concepts , the teacher tell them some facts about the concepts .
The student will become more interesting and understand the boring concepts more quickly .
So the fact iis good for the student to learn .

The last but not the least , students can learn some experisence and lestens from the facts .
The facts are some events , somethings happened in the past or some example of unsuccess .
These is very important .
If the sutents do n't learn some experiences from the facts , they will learn in the future by themselves , maybe form the falure .

From all above , I can draw the conclusion that learn facts is very important for students .
Everyone can not ingorne them .
