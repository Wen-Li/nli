It is true that there are many reasons such as increasing number of using public transportaion that support decline of car supply .
However I have other opinins why there will be more cars on the road instead of decline .

First people try to have their own car personally , not one in a family .
In family , for exaple , father need his car to go his workplace .
Mother need her car to go her workplace .
Even though she does not have job , she also need car to use pick up her kids or go shopping .
There is also demands from children when they grow up and become age of owinig a car ; when they go to colloege .
As a results all members need .
Therefore each person need car .
As a result , increasing cars in society .

Second , trend of living a little distance from workplace increase demand of car .
Nowdays korea people , internationally also , prefer to live 30min .
to 1hr .
distance from their work .
This mean they need automobils to go their work .
For insatace , my professor who lives one hour distance from college , has her own car .
She come school every morning using her car , not subway .

It is true that there is increasing number of people who use public transportation to save money , oil or etc .
However , this does not mean they do not have car .
They have car their own but just use public transportation in order to save money .
When they are run out of time , when they feel tired to waitng bus , or when they want to go somewhere where public transportation do not go , they will take out their personal car and drive .

therfore , the need of owning car each of one person , the trend of move distance from workplace make increasing of car demand .
futhermore , even though some people use pblic transportation , they surely posses car .
as a results , there will be more cars in the road than now .
