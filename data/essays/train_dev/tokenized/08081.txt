Over the last century , advertising has become one of the most developped and i ; portant activity in humankind .
It suurounds us everywhere today : on television of course , in the street , in the subway , on our cars . ..
we can not avoid it .
Some may say that : `` Most advertisers make products seem much better than they really are '' .
Do they ?
Is advertising that simple ?
Do they not take into account the risk it creates when the customer will be disappointed ?

First of all , the question seems simple , of course they do , they sure will not make their products seem worse .
They are paid to sell something to people who did not even want to buy it in the first place , who did not even needed it sometimes .
They must create a need in customers ' minds and a will to buy precisely that product .
How could they do that without making their products look good , even better than they are , to kind of sell dream to people .
It is not what they do it for but in the end they kind of give hope to people , like when one sees an advertisment who would make one believe that the product it defends is exactly what one has hoped to find during all these years , or tht it is so much better that all its competition .
That is why in all soap spots , the laundry is whiter and smoother than ever or in all shampoo spots , the actress ' hair shines more than ever .

However , is it always like that ?
Do not advertisers fear people to stop buying a product because they were deceived by the difference with the ad ?
Actually , even if it is not to be more honest with people , some advertisers use other techniques to sell their products .
They can choose to criticize their competition in order to make their product look better by comparison .
It is what is importat in the end that the buyer choosse your product over the others .
It was used by Coca Cola in a spot in which a little girl shows her deceivement with thw voice of a Godfather when she is given a Pepsi Cola and not the Coca Cola she ordered .
Advertising could also use reversed psychology , maybe to play with people curiosity , like the campaign using do not go and see that movie , it is bad for instance .

To conclude , I would say that whereas other techniques exist , most advertisers make products seem better than they really are .
Nowadays , eventhough people know all they see in advertising is not true , they fall for it anyway and that is how tha consumption society got this far .
