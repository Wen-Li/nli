While_IN it_PRP is_VBZ widely_RB assumed_VBN that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, I_PRP do_VBP not_RB completly_RB agree_VB with_IN this_DT generic_JJ statement_NN ._.
My_PRP$ stand_NN is_VBZ based_VBN on_IN following_VBG premises_NNS ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ true_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR energy_NN and_CC enthusiasm_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
The_DT most_RBS common_JJ means_NNS of_IN enjoyment_NN for_IN most_JJS young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP partying_VBG ,_, movies_NNS ,_, adventure_NN sports_NNS ,_, etc_FW ._.
However_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP experienced_VBN different_JJ aspects_NNS of_IN life_NN ,_, and_CC clearly_RB understand_VB what_WP gives_VBZ them_PRP maximum_JJ satisfaction_NN and_CC enjoyment_NN ._.
With_IN limited_JJ energy_NN they_PRP usually_RB tend_VBP to_TO engage_VB in_IN those_DT activities_NNS that_WDT excite_VBP them_PRP the_DT most_JJS ._.
The_DT definition_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN changes_NNS with_IN experience_NN ._.
While_IN youngsters_NNS may_MD feel_VB that_IN older_JJR people_NNS can_MD not_RB go_VB out_RP for_IN for_IN sports_NNS or_CC parties_NNS and_CC therefore_RB are_VBP not_RB enjoying_VBG ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ possible_JJ that_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP the_DT company_NN of_IN their_PRP$ family_NN members_NNS than_IN going_VBG out_RP for_IN parties_NNS ._.
Also_RB ,_, many_JJ a_DT times_NNS ,_, what_WDT youngsters_NNS define_VBP as_IN enjoyment_NN is_VBZ usually_RB what_WP all_DT people_NNS do_VBP for_IN fun_NN ,_, and_CC not_RB what_WP they_PRP themselves_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO do_VB ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, in_IN effect_NN ,_, they_PRP do_VBP what_WP society_NN classifies_VBZ as_IN fun_NN ,_, and_CC not_RB what_WP makes_VBZ them_PRP happy_JJ as_IN an_DT individual_NN ._.
Whereas_IN ,_, there_EX are_VBP not_RB many_JJ set_VBN avenues_NNS of_IN enjoyment_NN for_IN old_JJ people_NNS ,_, and_CC hence_RB they_PRP do_VBP what_WP they_PRP themselves_PRP enjoy_VBP doing_VBG the_DT most_JJS ._.
While_IN people_NNS are_VBP young_JJ ,_, there_EX is_VBZ lot_NN of_IN uncertainity_NN in_IN their_PRP$ mind_NN about_IN their_PRP$ future_NN ._.
Some_DT youngsters_NNS may_MD have_VB the_DT resources_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB but_CC they_PRP are_VBP constantly_RB busy_JJ in_IN working_VBG toward_IN their_PRP$ ambitious_JJ goals_NNS ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP their_PRP$ future_JJ clear_JJ in_IN front_NN of_IN them_PRP ._.
There_EX are_VBP not_RB many_JJ uncertainities_NNS in_IN life_NN ,_, and_CC hence_RB they_PRP can_MD spend_VB their_PRP$ free_JJ time_NN in_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN to_TO the_DT fullest_JJS ._.
Overall_RB ,_, I_PRP feel_VBP that_IN people_NNS who_WP have_VBP the_DT maturity_NN to_TO understand_VB what_WP gives_VBZ them_PRP maximum_JJ enjoyment_NN ,_, have_VBP the_DT required_VBN resources_NNS for_IN enjoyment_NN and_CC most_RBS importantly_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB ,_, are_VBP the_DT ones_NNS who_WP enjoy_VBP life_NN the_DT most_JJS ._.
