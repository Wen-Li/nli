Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
This_DT statement_NN makes_VBZ us_PRP wonder_VB how_WRB can_MD one_PRP define_VB enjoyment_NN ._.
Being_VBG subjective_JJ not_RB only_RB from_IN person_NN to_TO person_NN but_CC also_RB from_IN time_NN to_TO time_NN ,_, enjoyement_NN in_IN totality_NN refers_VBZ to_TO satisfaction_NN of_IN ones_NNS expectations_NNS and_CC desires_NNS ._.
In_IN the_DT case_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, who_WP have_VBP ``_`` enjoyed_VBN ''_'' the_DT best_JJS of_IN their_PRP$ youth_NN ,_, old_JJ age_NN brings_VBZ about_IN a_DT sudden_JJ restriction_NN in_IN terms_NNS of_IN what_WP they_PRP are_VBP capable_JJ of_IN doing_VBG and_CC what_WP they_PRP must_MD learn_VB to_TO live_VB without_IN ._.
No_DT one_NN welcomes_VBZ this_DT change_NN but_CC some_DT find_VBP a_DT way_NN to_TO remain_VB satisfied_JJ and_CC happy_JJ in_IN there_EX restricted_JJ lives_NNS ._.
These_DT older_JJR people_NNS continue_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
But_CC we_PRP find_VBP that_IN they_PRP form_VBP a_DT minority_NN ._.
In_IN the_DT case_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, faced_VBN with_IN limitless_JJ possibilities_NNS ,_, aspirations_NNS and_CC expectations_NNS are_VBP soaring_VBG high_JJ ._.
These_DT youngsters_NNS are_VBP willing_JJ to_TO do_VB whatever_WDT it_PRP takes_VBZ to_TO have_VB a_DT good_JJ time_NN ._.
They_PRP defy_VBP rules_NNS ,_, and_CC set_VB new_JJ boundaries_NNS for_IN themselves_PRP to_TO try_VB and_CC cross_VB ._.
Life_NNP for_IN them_PRP is_VBZ like_IN a_DT window_NN ._.
Their_PRP$ expecations_NNS represented_VBN by_IN the_DT horizon_NN and_CC their_PRP$ desires_NNS by_IN the_DT distance_NN from_IN the_DT window_NN to_TO the_DT horizon_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD only_RB do_VB so_RB much_RB while_IN their_PRP$ youth_NN lasts_VBZ ._.
Comparing_VBG the_DT two_CD ,_, we_PRP notice_VBP that_IN while_IN the_DT youth_NN end_VB up_RP enjoying_VBG more_JJR than_IN most_JJS older_JJR people_NNS ;_: in_IN comparison_NN with_IN the_DT limit_NN to_TO which_WDT they_PRP could_MD have_VB enjoyed_VBN ,_, the_DT older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP a_DT higher_JJR sense_NN of_IN satisfaction_NN ._.
They_PRP know_VBP their_PRP$ boundaries_NNS and_CC make_VB the_DT most_JJS of_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS eachday_NN ._.
Almost_RB everyone_NN enjoys_VBZ their_PRP$ youth_NN ,_, but_CC people_NNS who_WP can_MD learn_VB to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ old_JJ age_NN aswell_NN are_VBP the_DT people_NNS who_WP have_VBP truely_RB enjoyed_VBN ``_`` life_NN ''_'' ._.
So_RB in_IN conclusion_NN ,_, i_FW would_MD like_VB to_TO say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP ``_`` youth_NN ''_'' but_CC older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP ``_`` life_NN ''_'' ._.
