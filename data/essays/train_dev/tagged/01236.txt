Through_IN advancements_NNS of_IN technology_NN and_CC the_DT convenience_NN that_WDT cars_NNS seem_VBP to_TO have_VB brought_VBN to_TO human_JJ beings_NNS ,_, it_PRP came_VBD hand_NN in_IN hand_NN with_IN a_DT number_NN of_IN issues_NNS that_WDT are_VBP widely_RB discussed_VBN today_NN ._.

Last_JJ but_CC not_RB least_JJS ,_, is_VBZ the_DT cost_NN of_IN purchasing_VBG a_DT car_NN and_CC the_DT gas_NN to_TO fuel_VB it_PRP ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ because_IN of_IN these_DT issues_NNS ,_, that_IN there_EX is_VBZ a_DT high_JJ chance_NN that_WDT in_IN twenty_CD years_NNS there_RB will_MD be_VB fewer_JJR cars_NNS in_IN use_NN than_IN there_EX are_VBP today_NN ._.
Pollution_NNP contributes_VBZ to_TO the_DT usage_NN rate_NN of_IN cars_NNS within_IN a_DT country_NN ._.
Take_VB Bangkok_NNP ,_, a_DT city_NN that_WDT is_VBZ polluted_JJ and_CC notorious_JJ for_IN its_PRP$ traffic_NN jams_NNS as_IN an_DT example_NN ._.
People_NNS living_VBG in_IN Bangkok_NNP are_VBP probably_RB immune_JJ to_TO the_DT amount_NN of_IN pollution_NN that_IN they_PRP breathe_VBP and_CC interact_VBP with_IN everyday_JJ ._.
Tourists_NNS however_RB ,_, are_VBP a_DT different_JJ story_NN in_IN terms_NNS of_IN the_DT pollution_NN rate_NN in_IN Thailand_NNP ._.
Some_DT complain_VBP of_IN bad_JJ skin_NN ,_, some_DT claim_NN of_IN constant_JJ coughs_NNS ,_, some_DT complain_VBP on_IN blurred_VBN vision_NN with_IN the_DT amount_NN of_IN smoke_NN on_IN the_DT streets_NNS ._.
When_WRB the_DT pollution_NN rate_NN of_IN a_DT city_NN is_VBZ so_RB high_JJ ,_, there_EX will_MD be_VB a_DT reduction_NN in_IN the_DT amount_NN of_IN cars_NNS that_WDT are_VBP used_VBN ._.
The_DT government_NN will_MD most_RBS probably_RB bring_VB out_RP policies_NNS that_WDT control_VBP the_DT amount_NN of_IN cars_NNS through_IN means_NNS of_IN indirect_JJ tax_NN on_IN cars_NNS and_CC the_DT amount_NN of_IN roads_NNS that_IN they_PRP allow_VBP to_TO pass_VB through_RP at_IN a_DT given_VBN time_NN period_NN ._.
In_IN this_DT case_NN ,_, it_PRP would_MD just_RB be_VB convenient_JJ for_IN people_NNS to_TO travel_VB through_IN modes_NNS of_IN public_JJ transportation_NN ._.
When_WRB there_EX are_VBP tax_NN on_IN cars_NNS ,_, lesser_JJR people_NNS will_MD purchase_VB cars_NNS ,_, and_CC for_IN convenience_NN purposes_NNS ,_, more_JJR will_MD use_VB public_JJ transportation_NN ._.
Thereby_RB ,_, reducing_VBG the_DT amount_NN of_IN cars_NNS that_WDT are_VBP being_VBG bought_VBN and_CC driven_VBN on_IN a_DT daily_JJ basis_NN ._.
Following_VBG that_DT would_MD be_VB the_DT depletion_NN of_IN scarce_JJ resources_NNS of_IN gas_NN ._.
The_DT escalating_VBG oil_NN prices_NNS have_VBP made_VBN headlines_NNS more_RBR than_IN once_RB in_IN any_DT form_NN of_IN mass_NN media_NNS worldwide_RB ._.
The_DT Thai_NNP government_NN had_VBD subsidized_VBN the_DT oil_NN price_NN from_IN rising_VBG in_IN Thailand_NNP for_IN quite_RB a_DT while_NN ,_, and_CC this_DT allow_VBP the_DT Thais_NNPS to_TO continue_VB their_PRP$ transportation_NN as_IN they_PRP wish_VBP ._.
However_RB ,_, after_IN the_DT Thai_NNP government_NN ceased_VBD to_TO subsidize_VB the_DT oil_NN price_NN ,_, did_VBD public_JJ modes_NNS of_IN transportation_NN like_IN the_DT subway_NN become_VBN overcrowded_JJ ._.
With_IN the_DT gradual_JJ depletion_NN of_IN scarce_JJ resources_NNS like_IN that_DT of_IN oil_NN that_IN fuels_NNS the_DT car_NN in_IN which_WDT we_PRP drive_VBP in_IN ,_, the_DT costs_NNS for_IN the_DT scarce_JJ resource_NN will_MD rise_VB ._.
When_WRB a_DT price_NN of_IN a_DT good_JJ rises_NNS ,_, this_DT will_MD discourage_VB the_DT consumers_NNS from_IN purchasing_VBG such_PDT a_DT product_NN ._.
It_PRP can_MD be_VB seen_VBN that_IN oil_NN fuels_NNS cars_NNS ,_, so_RB without_IN fuel_NN for_IN cars_NNS ,_, there_EX will_MD be_VB adequate_JJ reason_NN to_TO purchase_VB or_CC use_VB more_JJR cars_NNS ._.
In_IN this_DT case_NN ,_, the_DT amount_NN of_IN cars_NNS that_WDT are_VBP used_VBN today_NN and_CC in_IN twenty_CD years_NNS time_NN will_MD most_RBS likely_RB have_VBP decreased_VBN substantially_RB ._.
Last_JJ but_CC not_RB least_JJS is_VBZ the_DT better_JJR alternatives_NNS that_WDT our_PRP$ technology_NN is_VBZ coming_VBG up_RP with_IN ._.
On_IN a_DT day-to-day_JJ basis_NN ,_, there_EX are_VBP advancements_NNS of_IN technology_NN seen_VBN everywhere_RB ._.
Even_RB after_IN the_DT rising_VBG gas_NN costs_NNS ,_, countries_NNS turned_VBD to_TO alternatives_NNS of_IN gas_NN ._.
In_IN a_DT few_JJ years_NNS of_IN course_NN ,_, it_PRP can_MD most_RBS probably_RB be_VB assumed_VBN that_IN gas_NN will_MD run_VB out_RP so_RB another_DT alternative_NN will_MD have_VB to_TO be_VB thought_VBN of_IN ._.
Now_RB with_IN the_DT convenience_NN of_IN public_JJ transportation_NN in_IN the_DT sense_NN that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ more_RBR efficient_JJ ,_, less_JJR time_NN consuming_NN and_CC cheaper_JJR in_IN terms_NNS of_IN gas_NN and_CC maintainence_NN price_NN of_IN the_DT car_NN ._.
Most_JJS people_NNS will_MD be_VB turning_VBG to_TO public_JJ modes_NNS of_IN transportation_NN as_IN opposed_VBN to_TO private_JJ modes_NNS of_IN transportation_NN in_IN travelling_VBG in_IN cars_NNS ._.
More_JJR and_CC more_JJR people_NNS are_VBP becoming_VBG educated_VBN ,_, and_CC this_DT has_VBZ increased_VBN in_IN the_DT awareness_NN of_IN the_DT environment_NN ._.
People_NNS will_MD then_RB try_VB to_TO reduce_VB the_DT amount_NN of_IN pollution_NN by_IN using_VBG less_JJR of_IN products_NNS that_WDT produce_VBP pollution_NN by_IN finding_VBG other_JJ alternatives_NNS like_IN that_DT of_IN using_VBG public_JJ modes_NNS of_IN transportation_NN ._.
In_IN this_DT case_NN ,_, because_IN cars_NNS produce_VBP a_DT significant_JJ amount_NN of_IN pollution_NN to_TO our_PRP$ world_NN ,_, the_DT amount_NN of_IN car_NN purchases_NNS will_MD have_VB decreased_VBN quite_RB a_DT deal_NN ._.
Hence_RB ,_, it_PRP can_MD probably_RB be_VB seen_VBN and_CC assumed_VBN that_IN within_IN 20_CD years_NNS ,_, there_EX will_MD be_VB fewer_JJR cars_NNS in_IN use_NN than_IN there_EX are_VBP today_NN ._.
With_IN escalating_VBG oil_NN costs_NNS and_CC pollution_NN ,_, gradual_JJ depletion_NN of_IN scarce_JJ resources_NNS ,_, better_JJR technology_NN that_WDT can_MD come_VB up_RP with_IN alternatives_NNS and_CC enivornmental_JJ friendly_JJ people_NNS ,_, the_DT amount_NN of_IN cars_NNS that_WDT will_MD be_VB purchased_VBN in_IN the_DT next_JJ few_JJ years_NNS will_MD be_VB gradually_RB declining_VBG ._.
