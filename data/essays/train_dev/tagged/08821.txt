In_IN our_PRP$ current_JJ society_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ thought_VBN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, I_PRP would_MD disagree_VB with_IN this_DT statement_NN because_IN there_EX are_VBP so_RB many_JJ humanitarian_JJ organizations_NNS and_CC associations_NNS that_WDT high_JJ school_NN and_CC college_NN students_NNS are_VBP involved_VBN in_IN during_IN their_PRP$ course_NN of_IN study_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, in_IN academic_JJ institutions_NNS ,_, there_EX are_VBP associations_NNS runned_VBN by_IN young_JJ people_NNS who_WP focuse_VBP on_IN helping_VBG handicapped_JJ students_NNS feel_VBP more_RBR at_IN ease_NN and_CC equal_JJ in_IN class_NN ._.
The_DT services_NNS proposed_VBN are_VBP various_JJ :_: support_NN during_IN courses_NNS by_IN working_VBG in_IN teams_NNS and_CC preparing_VBG collective_JJ projects_NNS or_CC suggesting_VBG gatherings_NNS and_CC pick_VB nicks_NNS after_IN class_NN in_IN order_NN to_TO meet_VB ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, there_EX are_VBP so_RB many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS serving_VBG and_CC helping_VBG poor_JJ countries_NNS to_TO develop_VB their_PRP$ education_NN and_CC health_NN measures_NNS nation_NN wide_JJ and_CC internationally_RB ._.
The_DT Red_NNP Cross_NNP ,_, the_DT United_NNP Nations_NNPS ,_, the_DT World_NNP Bank_NNP ,_, for_IN example_NN ,_, focuse_VBP their_PRP$ work_NN on_IN helping_VBG people_NNS ._.
For_IN their_PRP$ missions_NNS ,_, these_DT organizations_NNS send_VBP each_DT year_NN thousands_NNS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS and_CC young_JJ graduates_NNS from_IN developped_VBN countries_NNS to_TO acquire_VB work_NN experience_NN but_CC mostly_RB to_TO share_VB their_PRP$ own_JJ knowledge_NN by_IN making_VBG the_DT poor_JJ and_CC needing_VBG people_NNS who_WP live_VBP in_IN much_JJ further_JJ communities_NNS taste_VBP a_DT better_JJR and_CC happier_JJR life_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT contrary_NN ,_, the_DT statement_NN can_MD be_VB partly_RB true_JJ because_IN some_DT young_JJ people_NNS grow_VBP in_IN a_DT more_RBR selfish_JJ way_NN nowadays_RB ._.
They_PRP are_VBP brought_VBN up_RP to_TO be_VB spoiled_VBN and_CC learn_VB to_TO take_VB more_JJR than_IN to_TO give_VB ,_, and_CC that_IN increases_VBZ personal_JJ pride_NN and_CC self_NN satisfaction_NN ._.
Some_DT progress_NN and_CC new_JJ technologies_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN mass_NN consumption_NN or_CC just_RB sating_VBG at_IN home_NN and_CC playing_VBG video_NN games_NNS ,_, have_VBP bad_JJ influence_NN on_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Consequently_RB ,_, they_PRP build_VBP anger_NN ,_, hate_NN and_CC jealousy_NN between_IN each_DT other_JJ ._.
Another_DT factor_NN among_IN young_JJ people_NNS is_VBZ laziness_NN and_CC lack_NN of_IN responsability_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, this_DT statement_NN must_MD be_VB debated_VBN and_CC it_PRP can_MD not_RB just_RB reflect_VB the_DT one_CD and_CC only_RB vision_NN of_IN the_DT world_NN ._.
A_DT lot_NN of_IN people_NNS work_VBP hard_RB to_TO help_VB improve_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ,_, even_RB for_IN free_JJ ,_, and_CC will_MD try_VB to_TO travel_VB in_IN order_NN to_TO share_VB the_DT ideas_NNS they_PRP have_VBP already_RB implemented_VBN in_IN their_PRP$ commnutiy_NN ._.
