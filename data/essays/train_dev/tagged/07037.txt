Although_IN I_PRP think_VBP I_PRP am_VBP young_JJ ,_, I_PRP can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB my_PRP$ life_NN because_IN of_IN lack_NN of_IN money_NN and_CC time_NN ._.
I_PRP had_VBD to_TO study_VB hard_JJ to_TO attend_VB a_DT good_JJ university_NN since_IN I_PRP was_VBD a_DT child_NN ._.
After_IN graduating_VBG from_IN university_NN ,_, I_PRP also_RB had_VBD to_TO get_VB a_DT job_NN to_TO earn_VB money_NN for_IN living_NN ._.
As_IN a_DT result_NN ,_, I_PRP disagree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_IN of_IN lack_NN or_CC money_NN and_CC time_NN ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN the_DT older_JJR can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_RBR ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, the_DT older_JJR have_VBP more_JJR money_NN than_IN the_DT young_JJ ._.
we_PRP need_VBP money_NN to_TO do_VB something_NN ._.
If_IN I_PRP like_VBP reading_VBG novels_NNS ,_, I_PRP have_VBP to_TO buy_VB books_NNS ._.
If_IN I_PRP like_VBP a_DT travel_NN ,_, I_PRP have_VBP to_TO buy_VB a_DT car_NN or_CC buy_VB a_DT expensive_JJ airline_NN ticket_NN for_IN going_VBG abrod_NN ._.
Because_IN of_IN this_DT money_NN problem_NN ,_, I_PRP can_MD not_RB often_RB travel_VB abroad_RB ._.
However_RB ,_, my_PRP$ parents_NNS used_VBN to_TO go_VB abroad_RB for_IN their_PRP$ enjoyment_NN because_IN they_PRP are_VBP rich_JJ ._.
They_PRP have_VBP enough_RB nomey_JJ to_TO buy_VB expensive_JJ tickets_NNS and_CC to_TO pay_VB for_IN luxury_NN hotel_NN room_NN ._.
I_PRP am_VBP envious_JJ his_PRP$ welth_NN ,_, so_IN I_PRP am_VBP working_VBG hard_RB to_TO earn_VB more_JJR money_NN ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP no_DT enough_JJ time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD child_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP to_TO study_VB hard_RB ._.
Because_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS want_VBP to_TO go_VB more_RBR high_JJ repuataional_JJ university_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP spend_VB all_DT time_NN to_TO study_VB ._.
They_PRP also_RB have_VBP no_DT time_NN after_IN graduating_VBG from_IN university_NN ._.
Because_IN tuition_NN fee_NN of_IN university_NN is_VBZ very_RB expensive_JJ ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS would_MD have_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN depths_NNS after_IN graduation_NN ._.
After_IN all_DT ,_, they_PRP have_VBP to_TO work_VB hard_RB for_IN the_DT depths_NNS and_CC then_RB for_IN marriage_NN and_CC for_IN their_PRP$ children_NNS ._.
In_IN contrast_NN ,_, old_JJ people_NNS would_MD have_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN if_IN many_JJ old_JJ people_NNS already_RB retired_VBN ._.
Thus_RB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS were_VBD not_RB worry_VB about_IN lack_NN of_IN time_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, although_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR high_JJ physical_JJ power_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS because_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP no_DT enough_JJ money_NN and_CC time_NN ._.
As_IN a_DT result_NN ,_, I_PRP disagree_VBP that_IN the_DT young_JJ enjoys_VBZ life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT old_JJ does_VBZ ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN when_WRB young_JJ people_NNS work_VBP hard_RB ,_, they_PRP can_MD be_VB seen_VBN a_DT good_JJ people_NNS ._.
