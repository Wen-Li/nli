I_PRP would_MD definitely_RB agree_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP the_DT more_JJR enjoyable_JJ life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP two_CD reasons_NNS :_: physical_JJ strength_NN and_CC sensitive_JJ feeling_NN ._.
To_TO begin_VB with_IN ,_, the_DT phsical_JJ strength_NN is_VBZ necessary_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, if_IN people_NNS go_VBP to_TO the_DT other_JJ country_NN for_IN travel_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP to_TO carry_VB the_DT heavy_JJ baggage_NN in_IN which_WDT all_DT equipments_NNS for_IN travel_NN install_VBP ._.
Generally_RB speaking_VBG ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ easier_JJR for_IN young_JJ people_NNS to_TO complete_VB ,_, as_IN compared_VBN as_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Additionally_RB if_IN they_PRP could_MD not_RB carry_VB heavy_JJ baggage_NN like_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, the_DT areas_NNS where_WRB they_PRP could_MD go_VB is_VBZ limited_JJ or_CC they_PRP have_VBP to_TO pay_VB money_NN to_TO make_VB someone_NN carry_VBP ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS will_MD not_RB go_VB around_RB ._.
Because_IN they_PRP have_VBP the_DT phsical_JJ strengh_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP to_TO travel_VB in_IN the_DT other_JJ country_NN ,_, even_RB though_IN they_PRP have_VBP to_TO move_VB with_IN their_PRP$ heavy_JJ baggage_NN ._.
In_IN the_DT second_JJ place_NN ,_, the_DT sensitive_JJ feeling_NN will_MD lead_VB to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
If_IN people_NNS face_VBP any_DT arts_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN pictures_NNS ,_, music_NN ,_, paintings_NNS ,_, they_PRP will_MD able_JJ to_TO obsorb_VB in_IN their_PRP$ sensitive_JJ feeling_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, gradually_RB they_PRP are_VBP deeply_RB interested_JJ in_IN music_NN and_CC they_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO learn_VB and_CC play_VB instruments_NNS ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP the_DT sensitive_JJ feeling_NN which_WDT is_VBZ need_NN for_IN playing_VBG instruments_NNS ,_, as_IN compared_VBN as_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, it_PRP will_MD be_VB clear_JJ for_IN older_JJR people_NNS that_IN the_DT sensitive_JJ feeling_NN will_MD be_VB decreased_VBN when_WRB they_PRP start_VBP learning_VBG instruments_NNS ._.
That_DT 's_VBZ why_WRB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN to_TO face_VB or_CC learn_VB any_DT arts_NNS ._.
As_IN a_DT result_NN ,_, I_PRP would_MD definitely_RB agree_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP the_DT more_JJR enjoyable_JJ life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, as_IN thinking_VBG about_IN the_DT physical_JJ strength_NN and_CC the_DT sensitive_JJ feeling_NN ._.
