It_PRP is_VBZ often_RB said_VBD that_IN young_JJ people_NNS would_MD not_RB spend_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG and_CC supporting_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS in_IN our_PRP$ society_NN ._.
I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN that_DT opinion_NN ._.
At_IN first_RB ,_, I_PRP do_VBP not_RB think_VB that_IN interest_NN in_IN policy_NN has_VBZ decreased_VBN over_IN the_DT years_NNS ._.
The_DT most_RBS important_JJ reason_NN for_IN that_DT is_VBZ that_IN our_PRP$ system_NN is_VBZ democratic_JJ which_WDT means_VBZ that_IN people_NNS have_VBP the_DT ability_NN to_TO vote_VB and_CC can_MD influence_VB policy_NN which_WDT is_VBZ not_RB possible_JJ in_IN a_DT dictatorship_NN ,_, for_IN example_NN ._.
Another_DT important_JJ factor_NN is_VBZ that_IN every_DT citizen_NN has_VBZ this_DT right_NN from_IN a_DT certain_JJ age_NN on_IN ._.
In_IN the_DT past_NN ,_, that_WDT often_RB depended_VBD on_IN the_DT income_NN and_CC women_NNS did_VBD not_RB have_VB suffrage_NN at_IN all_DT ._.
Today_NN ,_, nearly_RB every_DT political_JJ party_NN has_VBZ a_DT youth_NN organization_NN ,_, as_RB well_RB ._.
That_DT would_MD not_RB be_VB neccessary_JJ ,_, if_IN young_JJ people_NNS were_VBD not_RB interested_JJ in_IN policy_NN ._.
Furthermore_RB there_EX are_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN poltical_JJ independent_JJ organizations_NNS which_WDT concern_NN about_IN the_DT interests_NNS of_IN the_DT communities_NNS ._.
In_IN the_DT past_JJ there_EX were_VBD neither_DT political_JJ youth_NN organizations_NNS ,_, nor_CC independent_JJ poltical_JJ youth_NN organzitaions_NNS In_IN spite_NN of_IN the_DT decreasing_VBG number_NN of_IN people_NNS to_TO vote_VB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP it_PRP would_MD be_VB exaggerated_VBN to_TO say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB put_VB enough_JJ effort_NN or_CC time_NN in_IN helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
