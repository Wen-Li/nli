I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN there_EX are_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN ways_NNS enjoying_VBG life_NN that_WDT are_VBP also_RB suitable_JJ for_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
So_IN the_DT age_NN is_VBZ not_RB an_DT indicator_NN or_CC enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
Perhaps_RB it_PRP seems_VBZ to_TO be_VB obvious_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN much_RB more_RBR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS by_IN having_VBG more_RBR activities_NNS and_CC doing_VBG sports_NNS that_WDT usually_RB are_VBP not_RB associated_VBN with_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
But_CC doing_VBG that_IN much_JJ sport_NN like_IN some_DT young_JJ people_NNS is_VBZ not_RB an_DT direct_JJ evidence_NN of_IN having_VBG a_DT good_JJ time_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN there_EX are_VBP many_JJ older_JJR people_NNS that_WDT travel_VBP the_DT whole_JJ world_NN after_IN they_PRP have_VBP n't_RB to_TO work_VB anymore_RB ._.
Travelling_VBG the_DT world_NN and_CC visiting_VBG several_JJ countries_NNS is_VBZ in_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN a_DT very_RB good_JJ way_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
In_IN addition_NN to_TO that_IN there_EX are_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS that_WDT do_VBP many_JJ things_NNS up_RP to_TO a_DT very_RB high_JJ age_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN politicians_NNS are_VBP normally_RB above_IN 60_CD years_NNS old_JJ and_CC probably_RB enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ work_NN ._.
Additionally_RB ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ own_JJ family_NN my_PRP$ grandpa_NN did_VBD a_DT lot_NN of_IN work_NN in_IN the_DT garden_NN up_IN to_TO an_DT age_NN of_IN 86_CD like_IN he_PRP did_VBD as_IN gardener_NN before_IN ._.
Finally_RB I_PRP constantly_RB experience_VBP another_DT example_NN for_IN older_JJR people_NNS enoying_VBG their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
When_WRB I_PRP go_VBP to_TO the_DT swimming_NN pool_NN in_IN the_DT morning_NN ,_, the_DT most_JJS people_NNS are_VBP older_JJR than_IN 60_CD ._.
While_IN swimming_VBG they_PRP are_VBP talking_VBG with_IN each_DT other_JJ and_CC enjoying_VBG the_DT morning_NN sun_NN ._.
As_IN mentioned_VBN above_IN people_NNS who_WP have_VBP n't_RB to_TO work_VB anymore_RB have_VBP much_RB more_JJR time_NN to_TO concentrate_VB on_IN their_PRP$ hobbies_NNS than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ._.
So_RB if_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN would_MD really_RB be_VB indicated_VBN by_IN the_DT activities_NNS of_IN the_DT people_NNS ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD concurate_VB with_IN young_JJ people_NNS basically_RB by_IN having_VBG more_JJR time_NN ._.
I_PRP could_MD imagine_VB a_DT life_NN for_IN me_PRP in_IN a_DT few_JJ decades_NNS in_IN which_WDT I_PRP have_VBP the_DT time_NN and_CC the_DT money_NN to_TO build_VB me_PRP an_DT own_JJ home_NN cinema_NN ._.
So_IN I_PRP would_MD really_RB enjoy_VB my_PRP$ life_NN despite_IN my_PRP$ high_JJ age_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN the_DT given_VBN points_NNS above_IN show_NN that_IN the_DT age_NN is_VBZ not_RB an_DT indicator_NN for_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
