Well_RB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_DT is_VBZ a_DT question_NN that_WDT depends_VBZ on_IN a_DT personality_NN or_CC different_JJ backgrounds_NNS in_IN which_WDT the_DT person_NN came_VBD from_IN ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP do_VBP think_VB that_IN a_DT more_RBR younger_JJR person_NN will_MD have_VB the_DT advantage_NN in_IN enjoying_VBG and_CC having_VBG fun_NN in_IN life_NN because_IN they_PRP have_VBP less_JJR to_TO worry_VB about_RB ._.
When_WRB a_DT person_NN becomes_VBZ older_JJR they_PRP are_VBP more_RBR aware_JJ and_CC warned_VBD of_IN personal_JJ and_CC social_JJ problems_NNS ,_, at_IN school_NN ,_, friendship_NN ,_, grades_NNS and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
What_WP I_PRP thought_VBD was_VBD the_DT most_RBS difficult_JJ ,_, while_IN growing_VBG up_RP to_TO be_VB a_DT pre-teenager_NN was_VBD that_IN I_PRP had_VBD to_TO conform_VB with_IN others_NNS and_CC I_PRP had_VBD to_TO use_VB the_DT right_JJ choice_NN of_IN words_NNS ._.
When_WRB you_PRP are_VBP little_JJ you_PRP have_VBP limited_VBN thoughts_NNS of_IN how_WRB your_PRP$ words_NNS may_MD affect_VB others_NNS and_CC how_WRB you_PRP accept_VBP differences_NNS ,_, but_CC when_WRB you_PRP grow_VBP up_RP ,_, you_PRP may_MD be_VB discriminated_VBN and_CC segrigated_VBN because_IN of_IN your_PRP$ skin_NN color_NN and_CC the_DT clothes_NNS you_PRP wear_VBP ,_, or_CC the_DT way_NN you_PRP look_VBP ._.
These_DT problems_NNS cause_VBP you_PRP to_TO worry_VB more_JJR and_CC be_VB less_JJR out_RP going_VBG ._.

At_IN school_NN ,_, not_RB just_RB young_JJ adolecents_NNS but_CC also_RB college_NN and_CC university_NN students_NNS have_VBP stress_NN up_RB on_IN managing_VBG their_PRP$ time_NN to_TO complete_VB and_CC hand_NN in_IN their_PRP$ assignments_NNS in_IN on_IN time_NN ._.
With_IN the_DT growing_VBG stress_NN ,_, you_PRP can_MD find_VB yourself_PRP caught_VBN up_RP on_IN homework_NN and_CC writing_VBG essays_NNS ,_, which_WDT prevents_VBZ you_PRP from_IN having_VBG free_JJ time_NN to_TO spend_VB for_IN your_PRP$ liking_NN and_CC enjoyment_NN ._.
When_WRB you_PRP become_VBP older_JJR you_PRP have_VBP to_TO worry_VB about_IN mannaging_VBG your_PRP$ deadlines_NNS at_IN work_NN ,_, how_WRB you_PRP are_VBP going_VBG to_TO pay_VB the_DT bills_NNS ,_, conforming_VBG with_IN your_PRP$ co-workers_NNS and_CC more_JJR social_JJ problems_NNS along_IN with_IN personal_JJ stress_NN ._.
