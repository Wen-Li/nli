I_PRP believe_VBP all_DT people_NNS may_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS independent_JJ from_IN their_PRP$ age_NN because_IN all_DT of_IN the_DT life_NN stages_NNS has_VBZ their_PRP$ own_JJ advantages_NNS and_CC disadvantages_NNS ._.
Thus_RB ,_, I_PRP do_VBP n't_RB agree_VB with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Assume_VB that_IN you_PRP 're_VBP 70_CD and_CC you_PRP do_VBP n't_RB have_VB grandchildren_NNS ._.
If_IN having_VBG children_NNS of_IN your_PRP$ children_NNS is_VBZ important_JJ to_TO you_PRP ,_, then_RB you_PRP wo_MD n't_RB be_VB happy_JJ and_CC wo_MD n't_RB be_VB enjoying_VBG your_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, assume_VB that_IN you_PRP are_VBP in_IN your_PRP$ twenties_NNS and_CC you_PRP can_MD not_RB go_VB to_TO dance_VB with_IN your_PRP$ friends_NNS ._.
Again_RB if_IN it_PRP is_VBZ relevant_JJ to_TO you_PRP ,_, you_PRP wo_MD n't_RB be_VB enjoying_VBG your_PRP$ life_NN and_CC age_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN if_IN you_PRP have_VBP all_DT your_PRP$ expectations_NNS from_IN your_PRP$ age_NN ,_, then_RB you_PRP 'll_MD be_VB the_DT best_JJS person_NN in_IN the_DT world_NN and_CC enjoy_VB your_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN anyone_NN in_IN the_DT world_NN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, it_PRP 's_VBZ true_JJ that_IN being_VBG young_JJ brings_VBZ some_DT advantages_NNS about_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
Like_IN you_PRP 're_VBP energetic_JJ ,_, healthy_JJ and_CC careless_JJ than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Traveling_VBG ,_, making_VBG sports_NNS and_CC dating_VBG are_VBP easy_JJ for_IN you_PRP ._.
However_RB ,_, it_PRP has_VBZ disadvantages_NNS ._.
You_PRP may_MD travel_VB more_JJR than_IN an_DT old_JJ person_NN but_CC in_IN case_NN if_IN you_PRP have_VBP enough_JJ money_NN and_CC permission_NN ._.
You_PRP can_MD not_RB shut_VB the_DT door_NN and_CC say_VB to_TO your_PRP$ parents_NNS that_IN you_PRP 're_VBP going_VBG to_TO a_DT spiritual_JJ trip_NN to_TO India_NNP ._.
They_PRP will_MD ask_VB you_PRP why_WRB and_CC most_RBS probably_RB they_PRP wo_MD n't_RB let_VB you_PRP ._.
Being_VBG older_JJR has_VBZ also_RB its_PRP$ disadvantages_NNS and_CC advantages_NNS ._.
When_WRB you_PRP are_VBP old_JJ ,_, this_DT means_VBZ you_PRP are_VBP full_JJ of_IN knowledge_NN at_IN least_JJS in_IN one_CD specific_JJ topic_NN ._.
Moreover_RB you_PRP have_VBP one-life_JJ long_JJ experiences_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, people_NNS like_IN and_CC want_VB to_TO talk_VB to_TO you_PRP due_JJ to_TO getting_VBG benefit_NN from_IN your_PRP$ knowledge_NN and_CC experiences_NNS ._.
You_PRP have_VBP lots_NNS of_IN things_NNS to_TO tell_VB such_JJ as_IN your_PRP$ memories_NNS of_IN childhood_NN ,_, experiences_NNS in_IN your_PRP$ work_NN and_CC all_PDT these_DT funny_JJ and_CC bad_JJ luck_NN events_NNS ._.
You_PRP have_VBP faced_VBN more_RBR years_NNS of_IN the_DT world_NN 's_POS history_NN that_IN youngsters_NNS can_MD not_RB have_VB a_DT chance_NN to_TO see_VB ._.
Of_IN course_NN ,_, as_IN a_DT direct_JJ disadvantage_NN of_IN this_DT view_NN ,_, you_PRP will_MD not_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO see_VB the_DT next_JJ generation_NN ._.
To_TO conclude_VB ,_, elder_JJR people_NNS may_MD also_RB enjoy_VB life_NN as_RB much_RB as_IN young_JJ people_NNS for_IN me_PRP ._.
It_PRP 's_VBZ solely_RB about_IN what_WP you_PRP expect_VBP from_IN life_NN and_CC what_WP the_DT life_NN gives_VBZ to_TO you_PRP ._.
If_IN they_PRP fit_VBP to_TO one_CD another_DT ,_, you_PRP will_MD be_VB enyojing_VBG your_PRP$ life_NN at_IN a_DT maximum_NN level_NN whatever_WDT your_PRP$ age_NN is_VBZ ._.
