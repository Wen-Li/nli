Agree_VB or_CC Disagree_VB ?_. !_.
When_WRB i_FW first_RB read_VB this_DT statement_NN i_FW thought_VBD it_PRP 's_VBZ hard_JJ for_IN me_PRP to_TO choose_VB if_IN i_FW agree_VBP or_CC disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT following_VBG statement_NN ._.
After_IN thinking_VBG for_IN few_JJ minutes_NNS ,_, I_PRP now_RB know_VBP an_DT answer_NN !_.
I_PRP agree_VBP and_CC disagree_VBP at_IN the_DT same_JJ time_NN !_.
I_PRP think_VBP its_PRP$ good_JJ to_TO have_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS and_CC at_IN the_DT same_JJ time_NN ,_, i_FW think_VBP that_IN specializing_VBG in_IN a_DT a_DT certain_JJ subject_NN is_VBZ perfect_JJ too_RB !_.
Both_DT conditions_NNS have_VBP advantages_NNS ._.
One_CD of_IN the_DT advantages_NNS of_IN having_VBG broad_JJ knowledge_NN in_IN more_JJR than_IN one_CD subject_NN is_VBZ that_IN this_DT knowledge_NN can_MD help_VB you_PRP alot_VB in_IN understanding_VBG what_WP people_NNS say_VBP ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, if_IN you_PRP are_VBP a_DT person_NN who_WP has_VBZ a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN in_IN various_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS ,_, you_PRP will_MD somehow_RB understand_VB a_DT program_NN that_WDT talk_VBP about_IN politics_NNS !_.
But_CC if_IN you_PRP were_VBD a_DT person_NN that_WDT specialized_VBN in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN and_CC that_IN subject_JJ ,_, for_IN example_NN was_VBD Astronomy_NNP ,_, it_PRP 'll_MD be_VB hard_JJ for_IN you_PRP to_TO understand_VB a_DT political_JJ program_NN !_.
An_DT advantage_NN for_IN a_DT person_NN that_WDT has_VBZ knowledge_NN in_IN only_RB a_DT specific_JJ subject_NN is_VBZ that_IN this_DT person_NN will_MD have_VB deep_JJ information_NN in_IN the_DT subject_NN that_IN they_PRP studied_VBD ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, a_DT person_NN who_WP specialized_VBD in_IN business_NN will_MD have_VB good_JJ information_NN and_CC detailed_JJ information_NN in_IN this_DT subject_NN ._.
In_IN contrast_NN ,_, a_DT person_NN that_WDT is_VBZ not_RB specialized_VBN in_IN a_DT specific_JJ subject_NN will_MD not_RB know_VB detailed_JJ information_NN in_IN a_DT subject_NN like_IN business_NN for_IN example_NN ._.
There_EX are_VBP more_RBR advantages_NNS and_CC disadvantages_NNS for_IN both_DT conditions_NNS but_CC i_FW just_RB wanted_VBD to_TO state_VB these_DT that_IN i_FW actually_RB can_MD think_VB of_IN for_IN now_RB ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN it_PRP would_MD be_VB perfect_JJ if_IN a_DT person_NN has_VBZ broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN various_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS as_IN a_DT well_RB as_IN specializing_VBG in_IN a_DT certain_JJ subject_JJ too_RB ,_, but_CC who_WP will_MD actually_RB do_VB that_DT ?_. !_.
As_IN for_IN me_PRP ,_, I_PRP really_RB want_VBP to_TO but_CC it_PRP 's_VBZ hard_JJ !!_IN
