Some_DT people_NNS think_VBP young_JJ people_NNS should_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, some_DT people_NNS belive_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS should_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ views_NNS ,_, I_PRP think_VBP the_DT second_JJ view_NN is_VBZ that_IN I_PRP like_VBP ._.
Because_IN the_DT following_VBG advantages_NNS will_MD be_VB supply_NN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, the_DT older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO spend_VB ,_, For_IN example_NN ,_, when_WRB the_DT older_JJR people_NNS retired_VBN from_IN their_PRP$ job_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD use_VB it_PRP to_TO other_JJ palce_NN that_WDT do_VBP not_RB delay_VB their_PRP$ work_NN ._.
But_CC if_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP it_PRP ,_, they_PRP must_MD affect_VB their_PRP$ job_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, if_IN older_JJR people_NNS want_VBP to_TO beach_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD go_VB at_IN once_RB ._.
They_PRP have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO prepare_VB the_DT all_DT things_NNS ,_, and_CC they_PRP can_MD use_VB their_PRP$ time_NN to_TO slow_VB drive_NN ._.
Additionally_RB ,_, the_DT older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP enough_JJ money_NN ._.
They_PRP do_VBP not_RB worry_VB the_DT cost_NN ._.
The_DT younger_JJR people_NNS should_MD take_VB care_VB their_PRP$ future_NN ._.
So_IN they_PRP must_MD save_VB ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, if_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB save_VB money_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD not_RB affort_VB the_DT cost_NN of_IN house_NN ._.
They_PRP also_RB lose_VBP their_PRP$ future_NN ._.
Finally_RB ,_, if_IN the_DT younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN specially_RB ,_, that_WDT will_MD result_VB they_PRP do_VBP not_RB connect_VB with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ._.
That_DT is_VBZ very_RB bad_JJ thing_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, some_DT young_JJ people_NNS make_VBP illeage_JJ thing_NN because_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN extremely_RB ._.
We_PRP should_MD encouge_VB the_DT young_JJ people_NNS study_VB more_JJR and_CC more_RBR ._.
According_VBG the_DT above_JJ metioned_JJ ,_, I_PRP think_VBP young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
They_PRP should_MD study_VB more_RBR ._.
When_WRB they_PRP are_VBP old_JJ ,_, they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_RBR ._.
