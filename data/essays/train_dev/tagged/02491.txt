Young_NNP means_VBZ activities_NNS ,_, hopes_NNS ,_, and_CC positivities_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS own_JJ much_RB more_JJR treasurs_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.

Firest_NNP ,_, owning_VBG a_DT strong_JJ and_CC healty_JJ body_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD do_VB whatever_WDT they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB ._.
Because_IN of_IN young_JJ ,_, they_PRP do_VBP n't_RB need_VB worry_NN about_IN their_PRP$ condition_NN of_IN health_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD do_VB any_DT heavy_JJ job_NN ._.

They_PRP are_VBP not_RB young_JJ ;_: they_PRP are_VBP always_RB bothered_VBN by_IN all_DT kinds_NNS of_IN disease_NN ._.
Quite_RB a_DT few_JJ hard_JJ and_CC complex_JJ jobs_NNS they_PRP ca_MD n't_RB fulfill_VB ._.
So_RB ,_, that_DT is_VBZ why_WRB people_NNS get_VBP to_TO a_DT old_JJ age_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP to_TO retire_VB ._.
The_DT second_JJ reason_NN is_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR time_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS and_CC they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR chance_NN to_TO learn_VB new_JJ knowledge_NN ._.

In_IN addition_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS more_RBR like_IN to_TO accept_VB fresh_JJ things_NNS than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
The_DT thoughts_NNS of_IN people_NNS who_WP get_VBP to_TO old_JJ usually_RB change_VBP to_TO be_VB simple_JJ and_CC dull_JJ ._.
