In_IN twenty_CD years_NNS ,_, will_MD there_RB be_VB fewer_JJR cars_NNS in_IN use_NN than_IN there_EX are_VBP today_NN ?_.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN there_EX will_MD be_VB fewer_JJR cars_NNS in_IN use_NN than_IN there_EX are_VBP today_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ true_JJ that_IN cars_NNS are_VBP significantly_RB important_JJ as_IN transportation_NN ways_NNS for_IN middle_JJ distance_NN ,_, and_CC the_DT middle-distance_JJ transportation_NN will_MD become_VB more_RBR important_JJ because_IN we_PRP need_VBP communication_NN and_CC transaction_NN with_IN those_DT who_WP live_VBP places_NNS where_WRB are_VBP far_RB from_IN the_DT places_NNS where_WRB we_PRP live_VBP in_IN ._.
However_RB ,_, for_IN two_CD reasons_NNS ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN there_EX will_MD be_VB fewer_JJR cars_NNS in_IN use_NN than_IN there_EX are_VBP today_NN ._.
The_DT first_JJ reason_NN is_VBZ the_DT increasing_VBG of_IN substitutional_JJ transportation_NN ways_NNS and_CC the_DT second_JJ reason_NN is_VBZ that_IN the_DT long-distance_JJ transportation_NN becomes_VBZ more_RBR impotant_JJ than_IN the_DT middle-distance_JJ transporation_NN ._.
First_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ true_JJ that_IN middle-distance_JJ transportation_NN becomes_VBZ more_RBR important_JJ ._.
However_RB ,_, ways_NNS of_IN middle-distance_JJ transportation_NN are_VBP not_RB only_RB cars_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, buses_NNS are_VBP in_IN use_NN for_IN middle-distance_JJ transportation_NN ._.
Recently_RB ,_, we_PRP pay_VBP attention_NN to_TO the_DT negative_JJ effect_NN of_IN cars_NNS on_IN environment_NN because_IN gases_NNS which_WDT are_VBP issued_VBN by_IN cars_NNS are_VBP said_VBN to_TO have_VB effects_NNS which_WDT make_VBP the_DT atomosphere_NN warmer_JJR ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, the_DT movement_NN occurs_VBZ that_IN we_PRP use_VBP buses_NNS instead_RB of_IN my_PRP$ cars_NNS in_IN order_NN to_TO reduce_VB cars_NNS which_WDT are_VBP in_IN use_NN at_IN the_DT same_JJ time_NN ._.
When_WRB we_PRP consider_VBP this_DT trend_NN ,_, there_EX will_MD be_VB fewer_JJR cars_NNS in_IN use_NN than_IN there_EX are_VBP today_NN ._.
Second_RB ,_, although_IN I_PRP think_VBP that_IN middle-distance_JJ transportation_NN becomes_VBZ more_RBR important_JJ ,_, long-distance_JJ transportation_NN must_MD become_VB more_RBR important_JJ than_IN middle-distance_JJ transportation_NN ,_, since_IN the_DT necessity_NN of_IN long-distance_JJ transportation_NN because_IN Information_NNP Technology_NNP allows_VBZ us_PRP to_TO find_VB new_JJ infomation_NN about_IN the_DT overseas_JJ and_CC to_TO encourage_VB us_PRP to_TO go_VB abroad_RB ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, although_IN middle-distance_JJ transportation_NN may_MD become_VB more_RBR important_JJ ,_, international_JJ transportation_NN becomes_VBZ important_JJ than_IN this_DT ._.
And_CC ,_, if_IN international_JJ transportation_NN is_VBZ more_RBR importatnt_JJ relatively_RB and_CC expenditure_NN by_IN people_NNS remains_VBZ unchanged_JJ ,_, people_NNS reduces_VBZ the_DT expenditure_NN for_IN middle-distance_JJ ,_, there_EX are_VBP fewer_JJR cars_NNS in_IN use_NN than_IN there_EX are_VBP today_NN ._.
For_IN the_DT above_JJ two_CD reasons_NNS ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN there_EX will_MD be_VB fewer_JJR cars_NNS in_IN use_NN than_IN there_EX are_VBP today_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, this_DT does_VBZ not_RB imply_VB that_IN cars_NNS are_VBP less_RBR important_JJ than_IN today_NN ;_: I_PRP mean_VBP that_IN long-distance_JJ transportation_NN is_VBZ by_IN far_RB more_RBR important_JJ than_IN middle-distance_JJ transportation_NN and_CC ways_NNS for_IN middle-distance_JJ transportation_NN change_NN ._.
