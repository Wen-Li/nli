Do_VB young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VB ?_.
This_DT for_IN sure_JJ is_VBZ one_CD of_IN those_DT questions_NNS that_WDT bring_VBP about_RB so_RB many_JJ discussions_NNS ._.
When_WRB one_CD is_VBZ young_JJ ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ easier_JJR to_TO speak_VB ,_, to_TO reach_VB strong_JJ judgments_NNS ._.
When_WRB you_PRP are_VBP older_JJR ,_, however_RB ,_, you_PRP get_VBP to_TO have_VB a_DT different_JJ perspective_NN on_IN life_NN --_: not_RB that_IN I_PRP am_VBP one_CD of_IN the_DT old_JJ yet_RB ,_, but_CC turning_VBG 30_CD recently_RB has_VBZ made_VBN me_PRP see_VB things_NNS in_IN a_DT different_JJ light_NN ._.
And_CC no_DT ,_, I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB with_IN the_DT idea_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Of_IN course_NN ,_, being_VBG young_JJ gives_VBZ one_CD an_DT obvious_JJ advantage_NN --_: that_IN of_IN being_VBG physically_RB fit_JJ and_CC active_JJ ._.
When_WRB one_CD is_VBZ young_JJ ,_, they_PRP feel_VBP like_IN they_PRP can_MD do_VB anything_NN ;_: they_PRP have_VBP their_PRP$ whole_JJ lives_NNS to_TO look_VB forward_RB to_TO ._.
They_PRP can_MD try_VB out_RP new_JJ things_NNS ,_, go_VB see_VB new_JJ places_NNS ,_, meet_VB new_JJ people_NNS ,_, and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
However_RB ,_, as_IN pleasing_NN as_IN this_DT may_MD seem_VB ,_, such_PDT an_DT abundance_NN of_IN choices_NNS also_RB brings_VBZ displeasure_NN ,_, unhappiness_NN ,_, and_CC at_IN times_NNS ,_, even_RB regrets_VBZ ._.
Especially_RB when_WRB combined_VBN with_IN inexperience_NN ,_, one_CD is_VBZ likely_JJ to_TO encounter_VB --_: and_CC will_MD ,_, by_IN all_DT means_NNS --_: many_JJ stones_NNS ._.
You_PRP tend_VBP to_TO make_VB more_JJR mistakes_NNS and_CC make_VB decisions_NNS you_PRP later_RB would_MD like_VB to_TO forget_VB ._.
Being_VBG old_JJ ,_, on_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, is_VBZ a_DT whole_JJ different_JJ story_NN ._.
Yes_UH ,_, it_PRP means_VBZ that_IN you_PRP will_MD not_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO jump_VB and_CC run_VB around_RP as_RB much_RB as_IN you_PRP would_MD like_VB ,_, you_PRP will_MD have_VB to_TO see_VB the_DT doctor_NN a_DT little_RB more_RBR often_RB than_IN you_PRP used_VBD to_TO ,_, and_CC you_PRP may_MD have_VB to_TO cut_VB out_RP on_IN certain_JJ flavors_NNS you_PRP are_VBP so_RB used_VBN to_TO have_VB ._.
However_RB ,_, this_DT does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB that_IN one_PRP can_MD not_RB really_RB enjoy_VB oneself_NN because_IN they_PRP are_VBP old_JJ ._.
Age_NNP means_VBZ experience_NN ,_, and_CC this_DT experience_NN is_VBZ what_WP makes_VBZ it_PRP easier_JJR to_TO derive_VB pleasure_NN out_IN of_IN life_NN ._.
The_DT more_JJR a_DT person_NN has_VBZ seen_VBN of_IN the_DT world_NN --_: the_DT pains_NNS and_CC the_DT pleasures_NNS ,_, the_DT easier_JJR it_PRP becomes_VBZ for_IN them_PRP to_TO make_VB the_DT most_JJS of_IN what_WP they_PRP have_VBP ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, being_VBG old_JJ does_VBZ not_RB necessarily_RB mean_VB getting_VBG less_JJR out_IN of_IN life_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT contrary_NN ,_, it_PRP provides_VBZ you_PRP with_IN the_DT opportunity_NN to_TO have_VB more_JJR pleasure_NN out_IN of_IN it_PRP ,_, and_CC what_WP is_VBZ more_JJR ,_, be_VB able_JJ to_TO be_VB grateful_JJ for_IN the_DT things_NNS you_PRP have_VBP ._.
