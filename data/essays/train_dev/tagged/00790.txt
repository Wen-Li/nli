There_EX are_VBP differences_NNS between_IN the_DT thinking_NN of_IN old_JJ and_CC young_JJ people_NNS due_JJ to_TO several_JJ reasons_NNS ,_, the_DT most_RBS important_JJ of_IN it_PRP is_VBZ their_PRP$ life_NN style_NN and_CC experience_NN ,_, and_CC their_PRP$ methods_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB themseves_NNS ,_, as_IN the_DT definitions_NNS of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN and_CC how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN can_MD differ_VB from_IN young_JJ people_NNS to_TO older_JJR people_NNS in_IN a_DT huge_JJ scale_NN ._.
as_IN a_DT young_JJ woman_NN ,_, i_FW believe_VBP that_IN youth_NN enjoy_VBP life_NN for_IN the_DT sake_NN of_IN enjoying_VBG it_PRP and_CC not_RB for_IN the_DT happiness_NN that_IN this_DT joy_NN can_MD result_VB ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS think_VBP that_IN there_EX are_VBP many_JJ years_NNS left_VBN in_IN life_NN and_CC we_PRP should_MD enjoy_VB it_PRP as_RB much_RB as_IN possible_JJ before_IN they_PRP have_VBP serious_JJ responsibilities_NNS such_JJ as_IN career_NN and_CC family_NN ._.
unfortunatly_RB ,_, some_DT times_NNS enjoying_VBG life_NN for_IN young_JJ people_NNS means_VBZ irresponsiblity_NN and_CC careless_JJ in_IN life_NN ,_, this_DT is_VBZ not_RB true_JJ for_IN all_DT young_JJ people_NNS ,_, but_CC many_JJ of_IN them_PRP interprete_VBP it_PRP this_DT way_NN ._.
According_VBG to_TO what_WP i_FW mentioned_VBN before_RB ,_, i_FW dont_FW agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statment_NN that_WDT says_VBZ ``_`` young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ''_'' ,_, as_IN i_FW believe_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP enjoy_VB life_NN ,_, but_CC in_IN a_DT different_JJ way_NN than_IN younger_JJR generation_NN would_MD understand_VB ,_, this_DT is_VBZ due_JJ in_IN many_JJ reasons_NNS like_IN the_DT lack_NN of_IN communication_NN between_IN older_JJR and_CC younger_JJR generations_NNS ,_, and_CC their_PRP$ different_JJ difinitions_NNS of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, i_FW enjoy_VB life_NN by_IN traveling_VBG around_IN the_DT world_NN and_CC by_IN meeting_VBG new_JJ freiends_NNS and_CC new_JJ contacts_NNS ,_, and_CC i_FW always_RB request_NN my_PRP$ mother_NN to_TO do_VB so_RB ,_, but_CC she_PRP as_IN an_DT older_JJR generation_NN tells_VBZ me_PRP that_IN her_PRP$ biggest_JJS joy_NN now_RB is_VBZ to_TO raise_VB her_PRP$ children_NNS well_RB ,_, and_CC to_TO watch_VB them_PRP get_VB successful_JJ and_CC happy_JJ ,_, while_IN years_NNS ago_IN she_PRP used_VBD to_TO enjoy_VB her_PRP$ self_NN differently_RB ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, i_FW believe_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN as_RB much_RB as_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ,_, and_CC sometimes_RB even_RB more_RBR ,_, but_CC the_DT difference_NN is_VBZ about_IN the_DT thinking_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, and_CC their_PRP$ experiences_NNS after_IN growing_VBG wise_JJ and_CC mature_JJ ,_, which_WDT are_VBP great_JJ things_NNS that_IN the_DT younger_JJR generation_NN can_MD learn_VB from_IN ,_, and_CC therefore_RB enjoy_VB life_NN more_RBR ._.
