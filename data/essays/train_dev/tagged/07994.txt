In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS actually_RB enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
I_PRP hold_VBP this_DT opinion_NN because_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP less_RBR weak_JJ ,_, less_RBR afraid_JJ ,_, and_CC less_RBR fragile_JJ than_IN older_JJR people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO be_VB ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, the_DT majority_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP alot_NNS of_IN energy_NN they_PRP can_MD disperse_VB without_IN becoming_VBG tired_JJ easily_RB ._.
While_IN most_JJS aged_JJ people_NNS get_VBP tired_VBN after_IN just_RB one_CD activity_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS ,_, like_IN students_NNS ,_, can_MD do_VB many_JJ activities_NNS in_IN just_RB one_CD day_NN ._.
Even_RB after_IN long_JJ hours_NNS of_IN work_NN in_IN school_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD easily_RB take_VB part_NN in_IN an_DT afterschool_JJ activity_NN ,_, and_CC then_RB come_VB home_NN to_TO do_VB homework_NN and_CC chores_NNS ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS get_VBP tired_VBN quickly_RB even_RB after_IN one_CD activity_NN ,_, such_JJ as_IN cleaning_VBG the_DT house_NN ._.
Being_VBG able_JJ to_TO do_VB many_JJ activities_NNS in_IN one_CD day_NN promotes_VBZ the_DT sense_NN of_IN accomplishment_NN and_CC happiness_NN ,_, and_CC thus_RB young_JJ people_NNS who_WP have_VBP more_RBR energy_NN enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO be_VB more_RBR brave_VB than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, and_CC take_VB more_JJR risks_NNS ._.
Risks_NNS ,_, because_IN no_DT outcome_NN can_MD be_VB predicted_VBN ,_, add_VB excitement_NN to_TO the_DT lives_NNS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, most_RBS older_JJR people_NNS prefer_VBP being_VBG stable_JJ and_CC assured_VBN ,_, and_CC do_VBP not_RB take_VB risks_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, alot_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS will_MD travel_VB to_TO distant_JJ countries_NNS ,_, and_CC gain_VB more_JJR experience_NN ._.
However_RB older_JJR people_NNS prefer_VBP remaining_VBG where_WRB they_PRP are_VBP ._.
Thus_RB in_IN the_DT lives_NNS of_IN older_JJR people_NNS things_NNS are_VBP monotonuous_JJ and_CC predictable_JJ ,_, whereas_IN in_IN the_DT lives_NNS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, nothing_NN can_MD be_VB predicted_VBN and_CC everything_NN is_VBZ exciting_JJ ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP also_RB more_RBR mentally_RB capable_JJ than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
As_IN people_NNS grow_VBP old_JJ ,_, they_PRP lose_VBP their_PRP$ ability_NN to_TO concentrate_VB for_IN long_JJ periods_NNS of_IN time_NN ,_, or_CC to_TO learn_VB new_JJ things_NNS ._.
In_IN contrast_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP full_JJ of_IN potential_JJ and_CC can_MD learn_VB new_JJ things_NNS ,_, like_IN another_DT language_NN or_CC a_DT new_JJ recipe_NN ._.
Learning_NNP new_JJ things_NNS is_VBZ very_RB enjoyable_JJ ,_, and_CC younger_JJR people_NNS who_WP have_VBP the_DT advantage_NN of_IN better_JJR mental_JJ capabilities_NNS ,_, enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP restrained_VBN by_IN various_JJ factors_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN fragility_NN and_CC inability_NN to_TO continue_VB activities_NNS for_IN long_JJ period_NN of_IN time_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, because_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP stronger_JJR physically_RB ,_, mentally_RB ,_, and_CC also_RB have_VBP less_RBR fear_NN ,_, their_PRP$ lives_NNS are_VBP filled_VBN with_IN excitement_NN and_CC fun_NN ,_, enabling_VBG them_PRP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
