Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VB ?_.
I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB the_DT statement_NN that_IN Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, and_CC I_PRP state_VBP my_PRP$ opinion_NN as_IN follows_VBZ ._.
Why_WRB age_NN ?_.
All_DT people_NNS should_MD know_VB how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN regardless_RB of_IN their_PRP$ age_NN ._.
There_EX may_MD be_VB different_JJ interests_NNS in_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN by_IN age_NN groups_NNS ,_, but_CC age_NN does_VBZ not_RB limit_VB how_WRB well_RB people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN ,_, therefore_RB it_PRP is_VBZ ridicurous_JJ to_TO say_VB that_IN some_DT age_NN group_NN is_VBZ not_RB good_JJ at_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
Generally_RB speaking_VBG ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP considered_VBN to_TO be_VB ,_, active_JJ ,_, healthy_JJ ,_, outgoing_JJ ,_, curious_JJ to_TO new_JJ things_NNS ,_, with_IN full_JJ energy_NN ,_, and_CC go_VB out_RP to_TO seek_VB enjoyment_NN ._.
But_CC is_VBZ it_PRP true_JJ ?_.
Old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR knowledge_NN and_CC experience_NN in_IN life_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP veterans_NNS who_WP have_VBP survived_VBN many_JJ hardships_NNS in_IN life_NN ,_, and_CC they_PRP should_MD also_RB have_VB experienced_VBN many_JJ joyful_JJ and_CC fullfilling_VBG moments_NNS in_IN life_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ natural_JJ to_TO expect_VB that_IN they_PRP know_VBP how_WRB to_TO cope_VB with_IN hardships_NNS in_IN life_NN and_CC make_VB much_JJ of_IN joyful_JJ and_CC fulfilling_VBG events_NNS to_TO enrich_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
On_IN good_JJ example_NN is_VBZ this_DT ._.
Once_RB I_PRP was_VBD in_IN a_DT developing_VBG country_NN todo_NN volunteer_NN work_NN ._.
In_IN the_DT country_NN ,_, there_EX were_VBD many_JJ young_JJ volunteers_NNS and_CC also_RB older_JJR volunteers_NNS ._.
To_TO my_PRP$ surprise_NN !_.
older_JJR people_NNS there_EX were_VBD so_RB active_JJ and_CC enjoyed_VBD their_PRP$ life_NN in_IN the_DT country_NN ._.
They_PRP went_VBD to_TO off_RP shore_NN fishing_NN on_IN a_DT boat_NN and_CC enjoyed_VBN cooking_NN fish_NN they_PRP took_VBD ._.
They_PRP went_VBD to_TO camping_JJ swimming_NN ,_, snorkelling_VBG ,_, and_CC even_RB diving_JJ ,_, and_CC did_VBD everything_NN they_PRP could_MD do_VB !_.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, those_DT who_WP got_VBD sick_JJ were_VBD always_RB young_JJ volunteers_NNS ._.
They_PRP had_VBD trouble_NN with_IN food_NN ,_, climate_NN ,_, language_NN ,_, culture_NN ,_, people_NNS ,_, and_CC everything_NN ._.
They_PRP just_RB did_VBD not_RB have_VB enough_JJ experience_NN to_TO cope_VB with_IN the_DT different_JJ environment_NN from_IN their_PRP$ modern_JJ ,_, confy_NN and_CC convenient_JJ life_NN ._.
Fron_NNP this_DT experience_NN ,_, I_PRP learned_VBD the_DT lesson_NN that_WDT at_IN any_DT age_NN ,_, people_NNS can_MD try_VB to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
