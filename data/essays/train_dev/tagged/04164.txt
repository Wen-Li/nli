It_PRP is_VBZ really_RB hard_JJ to_TO say_VB if_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, because_RB ,_, I_PRP mean_VBP ,_, they_PRP probably_RB could_MD both_DT enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN in_IN different_JJ ways_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP will_MD try_VB to_TO give_VB different_JJ reasons_NNS to_TO support_VB my_PRP$ opinion_NN which_WDT is_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR years_NNS that_IN the_DT old_JJ one_CD ._.
Is_VBZ it_PRP important_JJ ?_.
Well_RB ,_, my_PRP$ answer_NN is_VBZ yes_RB ._.
Why_WRB you_PRP do_VBP not_RB think_VB from_IN a_DT physycal_JJ point_NN of_IN view_NN for_IN example_NN about_IN the_DT strenghtness_NN ?_.
Young_JJ people_NNS can_MD do_VB lots_NNS of_IN physical_JJ exercise_NN to_TO keep_VB their_PRP$ bodies_NNS in_IN shape_NN and_CC do_VBP sports_NNS having_VBG fun_NN ._.
Unfortunatly_NNP ,_, fun_NN that_IN older_JJR people_NNS can_MD not_RB have_VB because_RB are_VBP weak_JJ or_CC they_PRP have_VBP diseases_NNS that_WDT make_VBP their_PRP$ body_NN prone_JJ to_TO trauma_NN ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, the_DT soul_NN ,_, the_DT spirit_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS has_VBZ a_DT positive_JJ attitude_NN toward_IN the_DT life_NN ._.
Why_WRB you_PRP do_VBP not_RB think_VB about_IN the_DT lackness_NN of_IN experiences_NNS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, expecially_RB the_DT negative_JJ experiences_NNS of_IN adults_NNS or_CC the_DT consequences_NNS of_IN certain_JJ bad_JJ behaviors_NNS ?_.
Young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP this_DT advantage_NN to_TO explore_VB their_PRP$ life_NN without_IN basing_VBG on_IN the_DT past_NN and_CC doing_VBG so_RB they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_RBR and_CC better_RBR ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD program_VB their_PRP$ life_NN to_TO have_VB success_NN ,_, and_CC when_WRB they_PRP reach_VBP success_NN they_PRP really_RB can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Thirdly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP the_DT possibility_NN to_TO build_VB a_DT family_NN ,_, having_VBG kids_NNS which_WDT are_VBP I_PRP think_VB the_DT best_JJS part_NN of_IN the_DT life_NN of_IN a_DT young_JJ person_NN ._.
Kids_NNS really_RB give_VBP you_PRP the_DT force_NN to_TO enjoy_VB your_PRP$ life_NN and_CC to_TO go_VB through_IN the_DT different_JJ problems_NNS that_IN you_PRP will_MD encounter_VB ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, for_IN the_DT above_JJ mentioned_VBN reasons_NNS I_PRP strongly_RB believe_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS can_MD really_RB enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS
