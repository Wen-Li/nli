Many_JJ people_NNS live_VBP for_IN their_PRP$ enjoyment_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, people_NNS do_VBP not_RB do_VB same_JJ things_NNS ._.
Some_DT people_NNS are_VBP going_VBG to_TO travel_VB and_CC other_JJ people_NNS are_VBP doing_VBG their_PRP$ own_JJ hobbies_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ home_NN ._.
Like_IN that_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS want_VBP to_TO more_RBR exciting_JJ one_CD like_IN extreme_JJ sports_NNS ,_, and_CC older_JJR people_NNS want_VBP to_TO do_VB something_NN comfortable_JJ like_IN reading_VBG books_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, someone_NN says_VBZ ``_`` Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP like_IN more_JJR htan_NN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._. ''_''
However_RB ,_, I_PRP disagree_VBP about_IN it_PRP ._.
I_PRP think_VBP both_CC young_JJ and_CC older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS much_RB even_RB though_IN they_PRP do_VBP differently_RB ._.
As_IN I_PRP said_VBD above_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS usually_RB want_VBP to_TO do_VB something_NN exciting_JJ and_CC even_RB dangerous_JJ if_IN it_PRP gives_VBZ enjoyment_NN to_TO them_PRP ,_, so_RB there_EX are_VBP more_RBR young_JJ people_NNS in_IN such_JJ as_IN skiing_NN jump_NN contests_NNS ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP more_JJR academic_JJ things_NNS like_IN math_NN contests_NNS like_IN me_PRP ._.
Although_IN now_RB I_PRP am_VBP not_RB interesting_JJ that_IN much_RB ,_, I_PRP was_VBD so_RB exciting_JJ when_WRB I_PRP was_VBD solving_VBG very_RB difficult_JJ math_NN problems_NNS at_IN around_IN 9th_JJ grade_NN ._.
Actually_RB there_EX are_VBP few_JJ older_JJR people_NNS in_IN the_DT contests_NNS ,_, but_CC there_EX are_VBP a_DT number_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Like_IN that_DT ,_, many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP physical_JJ things_NNS and_CC also_RB sitting_VBG and_CC reading_VBG books_NNS or_CC solving_VBG math_NN problems_NNS ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ why_WRB some_DT people_NNS say_VBP young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR peole_NN do_VBP becuase_NN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP more_JJR things_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
However_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS as_RB much_RB as_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP although_IN older_JJR people_NNS usually_RB want_VBP to_TO do_VB something_NN comfortable_JJ and_CC safe_JJ ._.
When_WRB we_PRP visit_VBP our_PRP$ grantparent_NN ,_, we_PRP usually_RB find_VBP they_PRP are_VBP reading_VBG many_JJ books_NNS or_CC making_VBG clothes_NNS for_IN their_PRP$ granddaughter_NN ._.
By_IN doing_VBG these_DT things_NNS ,_, they_PRP enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
My_PRP$ grandfather_NN also_RB played_VBD many_JJ Korean_JJ chess_NN games_NNS with_IN me_PRP ._.
At_IN that_DT time_NN ,_, I_PRP was_VBD not_RB interesting_JJ that_IN ,_, but_CC he_PRP was_VBD ._.
So_IN I_PRP asked_VBD it_PRP ._.
He_PRP said_VBD he_PRP was_VBD so_RB happy_JJ when_WRB he_PRP did_VBD something_NN with_IN me_PRP and_CC my_PRP$ sister_NN ._.
I_PRP do_VBP not_RB still_RB understand_VB him_PRP ,_, but_CC I_PRP knew_VBD he_PRP enjoyed_VBD it_PRP ._.
As_IN I_PRP am_VBP growing_VBG ,_, my_PRP$ enjoyment_NN are_VBP changing_VBG little_RB by_IN little_JJ ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP did_VBD not_RB think_VB I_PRP enjoy_VB my_PRP$ life_NN less_JJR than_IN when_WRB I_PRP was_VBD young_JJ ._.
Just_RB the_DT way_NN to_TO enjoy_VB is_VBZ changed_VBN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP their_PRP$ own_JJ interesting_JJ and_CC enjoyment_NN ,_, and_CC older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP also_RB own_JJ things_NNS ._.
I_PRP do_VBP not_RB think_VB which_WDT one_CD is_VBZ better_JJR or_CC which_WDT one_CD is_VBZ more_RBR enjoyable_JJ ._.
It_PRP depends_VBZ on_IN them_PRP not_RB their_PRP$ age_NN ._.
