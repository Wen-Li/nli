The_DT question_NN mentions_VBZ two_CD types_NNS of_IN knowledge_NN ._.
Having_VBG broad_JJ knowlegde_NN of_IN many_JJ subjects_NNS and_CC specializing_VBG in_IN one_CD subject_NN ._.
Having_VBG a_DT broad_JJ knowlegde_NN means_VBZ a_DT lot_NN of_IN subjects_NNS but_CC less_JJR information_NN ._.
Specializing_VBG in_IN one_CD subject_JJ means_NNS less_RBR subject_JJ but_CC tonnes_VBZ more_JJR information_NN ._.
They_PRP both_DT have_VBP advantegs_NNS and_CC disadvantages_NNS ._.
Having_VBG a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ subjects_NNS means_VBZ that_IN you_PRP have_VBP less_JJR infromation_NN about_IN many_JJ subjects_NNS ._.
Having_VBG knowlegde_NN on_IN a_DT wide_JJ range_NN of_IN subjects_NNS is_VBZ a_DT good_JJ thing_NN becuase_NN it_PRP means_VBZ that_IN you_PRP understand_VBP a_DT lot_NN about_IN many_JJ things_NNS ._.
However_RB as_IN it_PRP will_MD be_VB only_RB broad_JJ means_NNS that_IN you_PRP will_MD only_RB get_VB the_DT basic_JJ infromation_NN you_PRP need_VBP ,_, therefore_RB this_DT wont_NN be_VB enough_RB to_TO answer_VB or_CC fulfil_VB certain_JJ things_NNS ._.
I_PRP think_VBP you_PRP should_MD only_RB have_VB a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN things_NNS when_WRB you_PRP want_VBP to_TO be_VB general_JJ in_IN things_NNS you_PRP should_MD do_VB ._.
Example_VB a_DT general_JJ doctor_NN should_MD have_VB a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN what_WP different_JJ diseases_NNS are_VBP and_CC their_PRP$ symptoms_NNS ._.
Specializing_VBG in_IN one_CD subject_JJ means_NNS you_PRP only_RB do_VBP one_CD subject_JJ but_CC you_PRP concentrate_VBP on_IN it_PRP and_CC you_PRP will_MD get_VB more_JJR information_NN about_IN the_DT subject_JJ you_PRP are_VBP doing_VBG ._.
By_IN specializing_VBG in_IN one_CD subject_NN it_PRP menas_VBZ that_IN you_PRP will_MD have_VB more_JJR time_NN to_TO concentrate_VB on_IN the_DT subject_JJ you_PRP are_VBP doing_VBG which_WDT will_MD make_VB you_PRP as_IN a_DT person_NN an_DT expert_NN in_IN that_DT subject_NN ._.
In_IN some_DT professions_NNS you_PRP will_MD need_VB to_TO specialize_VB in_IN one_CD subject_NN ,_, such_JJ as_IN being_VBG a_DT professer_NN in_IN a_DT college_NN or_CC university_NN ._.
Example_NN and_CC geology_NN lecturer_NN should_MD specialise_VB in_IN geology_NN ,_, this_DT will_MD make_VB him_PRP have_VB more_RBR infromation_NN about_IN geology_NN as_IN he_PRP will_MD have_VB more_JJR time_NN to_TO concentrate_VB on_IN what_WP he_PRP is_VBZ doing_VBG and_CC learning_VBG ._.
This_DT will_MD result_VB in_IN a_DT more_RBR effiecient_JJ professor_NN !_.
From_IN my_PRP$ point_NN of_IN you_PRP i_FW see_VBP that_IN they_PRP both_DT are_VBP good_JJ and_CC beneficial_JJ depending_VBG on_IN what_WP you_PRP are_VBP going_VBG to_TO do_VB i_FW the_DT future_NN and_CC what_WP you_PRP think_VBP is_VBZ good_JJ for_IN you_PRP ._.
If_IN you_PRP want_VBP to_TO know_VB that_DT basics_NNS of_IN many_JJ subjects_NNS and_CC have_VBP be_VB a_DT bank_NN of_IN basic_JJ infromation_NN that_WDT go_VBP for_IN a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academis_JJ subjects_NNS ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN if_IN you_PRP want_VBP ot_NN be_VB an_DT expert_NN in_IN what_WP you_PRP aare_VBP doing_VBG then_RB specialise_VBP in_IN the_DT subject_NN that_IN you_PRP want_VBP to_TO be_VB an_DT expert_NN in_IN as_IN you_PRP will_MD have_VB a_DT much_RB greater_JJR knowledge_NN about_IN your_PRP$ subject_NN ,_, this_DT is_VBZ laso_JJ becuase_NN you_PRP will_MD have_VB more_JJR time_NN to_TO concentrate_VB on_IN your_PRP$ subject_NN ._.
