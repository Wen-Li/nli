I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN that_DT ``_`` It_PRP is_VBZ better_JJR to_TO have_VB borad_NN knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS than_IN to_TO specialize_VB in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject._NN ''_'' because_IN if_IN I_PRP have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN broad_JJ knowledge_NN I_PRP can_MD use_VB everywhere_RB in_IN the_DT test_NN or_CC exam_NN ._.
I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN that_DT because_IN if_IN they_PRP have_VBP broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS they_PRP can_MD understand_VB that_IN what_WP is_VBZ going_VBG on_IN here_RB and_CC what_WP is_VBZ going_VBG to_TO happening_VBG here_RB now_RB ._.
They_PRP will_MD not_RB lose_VB because_IN it_PRP is_VBZ good_JJ to_TO have_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN it_PRP is_VBZ like_IN general_JJ knowldge_NN even_RB I_PRP can_MD use_VB in_IN the_DT test_NN or_CC in_IN exam_NN if_IN they_PRP ask_VBP to_TO me_PRP that_IN about_IN world_NN or_CC anything_NN that_WDT about_IN general_JJ knowledge_NN or_CC broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ ._.
I_PRP think_VBP if_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN or_CC general_JJ knowledgeof_NN many_JJ academic_JJ ,_, they_PRP will_MD be_VB stupid_JJ because_IN if_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB know_VB about_IN anything_NN ,_, tyey_NN can_MD not_RB do_VB anything_NN for_IN example_NN in_IN japan_NN ,_, if_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO go_VB to_TO that_DT unvercity_NN they_PRP have_VBP to_TO write_VB exam_NN and_CC if_IN they_PRP pass_VBP that_DT exam_NN they_PRP can_MD go_VB that_IN univercity_NN but_CC for_IN that_DT exam_NN is_VBZ really_RB hard_JJ because_IN that_DT univercity_NN 's_POS exam_NN will_MD ask_VB to_TO them_PRP about_IN for_IN example_NN what_WP is_VBZ happening_VBG in_IN USA_NNP 's_POS gavernment_NN and_CC ect_NN so_IN which_WDT mean_NN is_VBZ that_IN if_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB any_DT of_IN general_JJ knowledge_NN or_CC broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ they_PRP will_MD not_RB pass_VB forever_RB ._.
If_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO have_VB general_JJ knowledge_NN or_CC broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ ,_, they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB to_TO study_VB to_TO know_VB this_DT ,_, they_PRP have_VBP to_TO do_VB is_VBZ that_DT just_RB read_VB the_DT newspaper_NN or_CC watch_VB the_DT news_NN everyday_JJ than_IN they_PRP will_MD have_VB general_JJ knowledge_NN or_CC broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ many_JJ academic_JJ but_CC they_PRP must_MD continue_VB they_PRP must_MD not_RB stop_VB it_PRP otherwise_RB they_PRP will_MD not_RB get_VB any_DT of_IN them_PRP ._.
So_RB as_IN you_PRP can_MD see_VB that_IN if_IN they_PRP have_VBP general_JJ knowledge_NN or_CC broad_JJ knowledge_NN if_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS it_PRP is_VBZ good_JJ to_TO have_VB tham_NN and_CC it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB wasting_VBG time_NN ._.
So_RB if_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO get_VB tham_VB just_RB read_VB the_DT newspaper_NN and_CC watch_VB the_DT news_NN every_DT single_JJ day_NN not_RB like_IN once_RB a_DT week_NN than_IN they_PRP will_MD get_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN things_NNS in_IN thier_NN head_NN and_CC stick_NN on_IN their_PRP$ head_NN so_IN they_PRP never_RB ever_RB forget_VB them_PRP ._.
