Be_VB it_PRP young_JJ or_CC old_JJ ,_, everyone_NN on_IN this_DT earth_NN enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ way_NN ._.
The_DT manner_NN in_IN which_WDT they_PRP enjoy_VBP differs_VBZ from_IN person_NN to_TO person_NN ._.
But_CC still_RB ,_, I_PRP feel_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN energy_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP full_JJ of_IN enthusiasm_NN that_IN they_PRP love_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS as_RB much_RB as_IN possible_JJ ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN fresh_JJ ideas_NNS that_IN they_PRP think_VBP of_IN innovative_JJ ways_NNS to_TO have_VB fun_NN ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, during_IN the_DT Christmas_NNP Eve_NNP and_CC New_NNP Year_NNP Celebrations_NNPS ,_, I_PRP saw_VBD a_DT lot_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS shopping_VBG late_JJ nights_NNS to_TO buy_VB gifts_NNS for_IN Christmas_NNP and_CC New_NNP Year_NNP ._.
And_CC also_RB they_PRP celebrated_VBD the_DT festival_NN in_IN a_DT grand_JJ manner_NN by_IN singing_NN ,_, dancing_NN ,_, partying_VBG and_CC having_VBG lots_NNS and_CC lots_NNS of_IN fun_NN with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS and_CC relatives_NNS ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS also_RB enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ way_NN ._.
For_IN them_PRP enjoyment_NN could_MD be_VB to_TO read_VB a_DT favorite_JJ book_NN or_CC to_TO play_VB with_IN their_PRP$ grandchildren_NNS or_CC to_TO visit_VB a_DT place_NN of_IN their_PRP$ choice_NN ._.
They_PRP also_RB celebrate_VBP their_PRP$ festivals_NNS with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS and_CC relatives_NNS ._.
Whereas_IN ,_, as_IN people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO grow_VB older_JJR ,_, their_PRP$ energy_NN levels_NNS deteriorates_VBZ and_CC are_VBP unable_JJ to_TO participate_VB in_IN physical_JJ activities_NNS ._.
Though_IN they_PRP would_MD wish_VB to_TO dance_VB or_CC sing_VB ,_, their_PRP$ physical_JJ health_NN might_MD not_RB favor_VB them_PRP ._.
In_IN their_PRP$ old_JJ age_NN ,_, they_PRP are_VBP pre-occupied_JJ with_IN other_JJ things_NNS that_IN they_PRP do_VBP n't_RB enjoy_VB as_IN the_DT youngsters_NNS do_VBP ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP their_PRP$ own_JJ ways_NNS of_IN recreation_NN that_WDT differs_VBZ from_IN those_DT of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
I_PRP conclude_VBP by_IN stating_VBG that_IN both_CC young_JJ and_CC old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS but_CC young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ high_JJ energy_NN levels_NNS and_CC enthusiastic_JJ spirits_NNS ._.
