I_PRP completely_RB agree_VBP with_IN this_DT issue_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
I_PRP believe_VBP there_EX are_VBP some_DT reasons_NNS about_IN it_PRP ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS can_MD be_VB more_RBR interested_JJ in_IN many_JJ things_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP likely_JJ to_TO be_VB able_JJ to_TO do_VB more_RBR active_JJ sports_NNS such_JJ as_IN baseball_NN ,_, soccer_NN ,_, tennis_NN ,_, runnning_VBG ,_, swimming_VBG ;_: on_IN the_DT contrary_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP likely_JJ not_RB to_TO be_VB able_JJ to_TO do_VB them_PRP ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP likely_JJ to_TO have_VB stronger_JJR bodies_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP likely_JJ to_TO get_VB more_JJR new_JJ abilities_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, and_CC young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP n't_RB likely_JJ to_TO forget_VB them_PRP ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR hopefull_JJ than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Yong_NNP people_NNS have_VBP many_JJ choices_NNS for_IN their_PRP$ future_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD easily_RB find_VB the_DT way_NN their_PRP$ life_NN go_VB ._.
People_NNS make_VBP many_JJ friends_NNS and_CC look_VB for_IN their_PRP$ partner_NN when_WRB they_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ._.
Thus_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP likely_JJ to_TO be_VB able_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS because_IN of_IN these_DT reasons_NNS ._.
