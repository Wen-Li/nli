In_IN this_DT text_NN i_FW am_VBP going_VBG to_TO deal_VB with_IN the_DT question_NN if_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN problems_NNS like_IN older_JJR peoples_NNS because_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB need_VB to_TO work_VB for_IN getting_VBG money_NN ._.
They_PRP get_VBP money_NN from_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS or_CC grandparents_NNS ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB fear_NN of_IN the_DT future_NN ,_, because_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB think_VB about_IN it_PRP ._.
Additionally_RB ,_, they_PRP enjoy_VBP playing_VBG with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ,_, e.g._FW playing_VBG football_NN ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP about_RB little_JJ things_NNS ,_, for_IN example_NN a_DT young_JJ child_NN is_VBZ happy_JJ about_IN a_DT small_JJ bubble_NN gum_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS like_IN children_NNS have_VBP to_TO do_VB what_WP their_PRP$ parant_JJ want_VBP because_IN the_DT parents_NNS give_VBP them_PRP a_DT little_JJ money_NN and_CC food_NN ._.

Furthermore_RB ,_, they_PRP have_VBP not_RB a_DT lot_NN of_IN free_JJ time_NN like_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Otherwise_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP some_DT advantages_NNS like_IN driving_VBG a_DT car_NN because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ work_NN ._.
They_PRP decide_VBP what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB and_CC do_VB not_RB rely_VB on_IN other_JJ people_NNS 's_POS decision_NN like_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, i_FW think_VBP young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS because_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB fear_VB the_DT future_NN like_IN older_JJR people_NNS sometimes_RB do_VBP ._.
