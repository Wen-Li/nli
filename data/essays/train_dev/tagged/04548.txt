I_PRP do_VBP n't_RB agree_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_IN of_IN the_DT following_VBG reasons_NNS ._.
This_DT statement_NN depends_VBZ on_IN what_WP you_PRP think_VBP is_VBZ young_JJ and_CC old_JJ ._.
First_RB ,_, all_DT people_NNS have_VBP different_JJ point_NN of_IN a_DT view_NN ._.
Usually_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP focused_VBN on_IN activities_NNS ,_, and_CC they_PRP think_VBP that_DT 's_VBZ important_JJ for_IN them_PRP ._.
By_IN the_DT way_NN ,_, most_JJS older_JJR people_NNS like_IN to_TO be_VB calm_JJ all_PDT the_DT time_NN ,_, and_CC they_PRP enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN with_IN their_PRP$ family_NN or_CC their_PRP$ life_NN partner_NN ._.
Second_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR money_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
many_JJ older_JJR people_NNS worked_VBD hard_JJ to_TO make_VB money_NN ,_, and_CC after_IN they_PRP retired_VBD ,_, what_WP they_PRP can_MD do_VB is_VBZ spending_VBG money_NN for_IN themselves_PRP ._.
Frankly_RB ,_, money_NN does_VBZ an_DT important_JJ role_NN in_IN people_NNS 's_POS lives_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS got_VBD to_TO work_VB hard_RB to_TO make_VB money_NN ,_, and_CC even_RB if_IN they_PRP have_VBP the_DT money_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP no_DT time_NN to_TO spend_VB the_DT money_NN ._.
Third_NNP ,_, older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP n't_RB have_VB worry_NN about_IN their_PRP$ family_NN too_RB much_RB ._.
Most_JJS older_JJR people_NNS live_VBP without_IN their_PRP$ children_NNS ._.
They_PRP only_RB need_VBP to_TO care_VB about_IN their_PRP$ husband_NN or_CC wife_NN ._.
But_CC ,_, young_JJ people_NNS need_VBP to_TO take_VB care_NN of_IN their_PRP$ children_NNS a_DT lot_NN if_IN they_PRP have_VBP ._.
They_PRP easily_RB can_MD get_VB stressed_VBN out_RP from_IN raising_VBG children_NNS ._.
Fourth_JJ ,_, older_JJR people_NNS think_VBP about_IN everything_NN calmly_RB ._.
They_PRP have_VBP lived_VBN longer_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, so_IN they_PRP can_MD understand_VB things_NNS easily_RB ._.
They_PRP do_VBP n't_RB act_VB too_RB fast_JJ or_CC too_RB aggressive_JJ ._.
Their_PRP$ lives_NNS have_VBP not_RB many_JJ things_NNS to_TO change_VB ._.
By_IN the_DT way_NN ,_, many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP busy_JJ ,_, that_WDT makes_VBZ them_PRP to_TO think_VB aggressively_RB and_CC furiously_RB ._.
They_PRP do_VBP n't_RB think_VB about_IN their_PRP$ behaviours_NNS ._.
If_IN someone_NN does_VBZ bad_JJ thing_NN to_TO them_PRP ,_, they_PRP would_MD get_VB angry_JJ and_CC they_PRP do_VBP n't_RB think_VB about_IN what_WP made_VBN other_JJ person_NN to_TO do_VB bad_JJ thing_NN to_TO them_PRP ._.
I_PRP strongly_RB think_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
