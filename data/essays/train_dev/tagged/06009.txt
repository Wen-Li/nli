Old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
I_PRP think_VBP age_NN of_IN people_NNS does_VBZ not_RB affect_VB the_DT enjoy_VB that_IN they_PRP can_MD take_VB from_IN life_NN in_IN a_DT negative_JJ way_NN ._.
The_DT most_RBS important_JJ fact_NN that_IN affects_VBZ the_DT level_NN of_IN the_DT enjoy_VBP they_PRP get_VB from_IN life_NN is_VBZ the_DT characteristics_NNS of_IN people_NNS ._.
According_VBG to_TO me_PRP ,_, the_DT enjoy_VB depends_VBZ on_IN that_IN the_DT person_NN is_VBZ social_JJ or_CC not_RB ._.
A_DT young_JJ person_NN who_WP is_VBZ not_RB social_JJ may_MD not_RB enjoy_VB from_IN life_NN as_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
A_DT social_JJ person_NN at_IN older_JJR ages_NNS can_MD be_VB a_DT member_NN of_IN social_JJ clubs_NNS ,_, attent_NN to_TO touristic_JJ journeys_NNS or_CC join_VB to_TO social_JJ activities_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, unsocial_JJ young_JJ person_NN can_MD stay_VB at_IN home_NN and_CC do_VBP nothing_NN except_IN eating_NN ,_, drinking_NN and_CC sleeping_VBG which_WDT are_VBP only_RB the_DT basic_JJ activities_NNS of_IN a_DT human_JJ being_NN can_MD do_VB ._.
An_DT advantage_NN of_IN old_JJ people_NNS possess_VBP in_IN enjoying_VBG more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS is_VBZ the_DT age_NN ._.
Age_NNP can_MD be_VB thought_VBN as_IN a_DT limiting_VBG fact_NN at_IN first_JJ ;_: nevertheless_RB ,_, if_IN we_PRP thought_VBD more_RBR we_PRP can_MD realise_VB that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS should_MD work_VB hard_RB to_TO earn_VB their_PRP$ life_NN in_IN economic_JJ means_NNS and_CC for_IN their_PRP$ career_NN ._.
They_PRP should_MD also_RB spend_VB their_PRP$ time_NN with_IN their_PRP$ families_NNS ._.
In_IN short_JJ ,_, they_PRP have_VBP limited_VBN time_NN for_IN too_RB much_JJ acivities_NNS or_CC duties_NNS ._.
In_IN contrast_NN ,_, old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP no_DT limiting_VBG time_NN problems_NNS ._.
They_PRP do_VBP not_RB to_TO think_VB about_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ,_, their_PRP$ work_NN and_CC their_PRP$ family_NN ,_, since_IN their_PRP$ life_NN is_VBZ at_IN a_DT stable_JJ phase_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT otherhand_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN stress_NN source_NN which_WDT decreases_VBZ or_CC limits_VBZ the_DT enjot_NN they_PRP get_VBP from_IN life_NN ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, their_PRP$ economic_JJ status_NN maybe_RB better_JJR than_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
They_PRP can_MD have_VB enough_JJ money_NN to_TO spend_VB in_IN social_JJ activities_NNS ._.
Another_DT advantage_NN of_IN old_JJ people_NNS for_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN more_RBR can_MD be_VB experience_NN ._.
As_IN they_PRP live_VBP more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD easily_RB find_VB anything_NN to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD go_VB to_TO a_DT holiday_NN instead_RB of_IN palying_JJ card_NN games_NNS with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, one_PRP can_MD say_VB that_IN there_EX are_VBP several_JJ disadvantages_NNS for_IN old_JJ people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB from_IN life_NN ._.
Health_NNP and_CC old_JJ ages_NNS are_VBP inhibiting_VBG agents_NNS of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS can_MD have_VB sicknesses_NNS more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, old_JJ ages_NNS can_MD restrict_VB them_PRP to_TO do_VB certain_JJ activities_NNS like_IN sport_NN activities_NNS ._.
Nevertheless_RB ,_, an_DT old_JJ but_CC social_JJ person_NN can_MD find_VB alternative_JJ activities_NNS according_VBG to_TO his_PRP$ or_CC her_PRP$ age_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN the_DT age_NN of_IN a_DT people_NNS does_VBZ not_RB defines_VBZ the_DT level_NN of_IN enjoy_VB that_IN they_PRP can_MD get_VB from_IN life_NN ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, old_JJ ages_NNS can_MD provide_VB more_JJR opportunity_NN to_TO people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB more_RBR from_IN life_NN ._.
