I_PRP would_MD not_RB fully_RB agree_VB on_IN the_DT comment_NN that_WDT younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP live_VB more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, I_PRP think_VBP younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN in_IN a_DT different_JJ way_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP it_PRP ._.
For_IN the_DT young_JJ generation_NN everything_NN has_VBZ to_TO be_VB harder_RBR ,_, bigger_JJR and_CC faster_RBR ._.
They_PRP want_VBP to_TO be_VB entertained_VBN and_CC are_VBP looking_VBG for_IN new_JJ exciting_JJ activities_NNS ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP happy_JJ with_IN life_NN as_IN it_PRP is_VBZ ._.
They_PRP do_VBP not_RB need_VB to_TO be_VB entertained_VBN anylonger_NN ._.
They_PRP had_VBD fun_NN when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ and_CC do_VBP not_RB need_VB such_JJ activities_NNS anymore_RB ._.
But_CC a_DT problem_NN which_WDT oftens_VBZ appers_NNS ,_, is_VBZ that_IN the_DT two_CD different_JJ generations_NNS do_VBP not_RB understand_VB each_DT other_JJ ._.
The_DT old_JJ people_NNS had_VBD a_DT really_RB different_JJ situation_NN when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ than_IN the_DT children_NNS today_NN and_CC so_IN they_PRP can_MD not_RB understand_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN things_NNS the_DT young_JJ generation_NN is_VBZ doing_VBG today_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ the_DT same_JJ with_IN the_DT young_JJ generation_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP young_JJ and_CC do_VBP not_RB understand_VB the_DT way_NN old_JJ people_NNS live_VBP ._.
They_PRP think_VBP it_PRP is_VBZ boring_JJ and_CC that_IN those_DT people_NNS never_RB had_VBD fun_NN ._.
But_CC thats_VBZ wrong_JJ they_PRP had_VBD fun_NN when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ and_CC they_PRP had_VBD fun_NN on_IN their_PRP$ way_NN ,_, they_PRP did_VBD what_WP people_NNS did_VBD in_IN that_DT time_NN and_CC now_RB the_DT time_NN has_VBZ changed_VBN and_CC the_DT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP what_WP young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP today_NN to_TO have_VB fun_NN ._.
So_IN you_PRP can_MD not_RB say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
The_DT only_JJ thing_NN you_PRP could_MD compare_VB is_VBZ if_IN young_JJ people_NNS 50_CD years_NNS ago_IN enjoyed_VBN life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS today_NN but_CC you_PRP can_MD not_RB compare_VB old_JJ and_CC young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP been_VBN young_JJ and_CC young_JJ people_NNS will_MD old_JJ one_CD day_NN ._.
