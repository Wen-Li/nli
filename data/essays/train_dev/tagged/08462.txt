Although_IN a_DT lot_NN of_IN people_NNS believe_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR peolpe_NN ,_, i_FW strongly_RB disagree_VBP this_DT belief_NN ._.
Enjoying_VBG the_DT life_NN doesn_NN '_'' t_NN depend_VB on_IN people_NNS 's_POS age_NN because_IN it_PRP depends_VBZ on_IN people_NNS 's_POS vision_NN ,_, expectation_NN from_IN life_NN ,_, and_CC spirit_NN ._.
Even_RB though_IN some_DT people_NNS become_VBP young_JJ and_CC ,_, they_PRP aren_VBP '_'' t_NN happy_JJ with_IN life_NN in_IN that_DT their_PRP$ vision_NN is_VBZ not_RB enough_JJ to_TO be_VB happy_JJ ._.
They_PRP think_VBP that_IN some_DT small_JJ obsctacles_NNS prevent_VBP them_PRP to_TO be_VB happy_JJ ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, I_PRP know_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN old_JJ people_NNS they_PRP try_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN though_IN they_PRP have_VBP some_DT disablities_NNS ._.
They_PRP are_VBP attend_VB many_JJ activities_NNS to_TO learn_VB new_JJ things_NNS and_CC have_VBP a_DT good_JJ time_NN ._.
These_DT are_VBP normal_JJ for_IN them_PRP because_IN this_DT is_VBZ their_PRP$ vision_NN ._.
People_NNS expectations_NNS from_IN the_DT life_NN change_NN when_WRB they_PRP are_VBP different_JJ age_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS believe_VBP that_IN the_DT most_RBS important_JJ thing_NN is_VBZ in_IN the_DT life_NN is_VBZ to_TO be_VB happy_JJ and_CC they_PRP try_VBP to_TO be_VB happy_JJ during_IN their_PRP$ older_JJR age_NN on_IN the_DT grounds_NNS that_IN they_PRP know_VBP better_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS that_WDT life_NN is_VBZ really_RB short_JJ and_CC they_PRP are_VBP doing_VBG their_PRP$ best_JJS during_IN this_DT time_NN unlike_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Lastly_RB ,_, people_NNS 's_POS spirit_NN is_VBZ the_DT other_JJ essential_JJ factor_NN in_IN people_NNS lives_NNS ._.
To_TO be_VB younger_JJR person_NN is_VBZ not_RB important_JJ ._.
This_DT only_JJ provides_VBZ people_NNS some_DT advantages_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, to_TO spend_VB more_JJR energy_NN and_CC do_VBP many_JJ things_NNS in_IN a_DT short_JJ time_NN but_CC old_JJ people_NNS organize_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS to_TO do_VB more_JJR things_NNS (_VBP like_IN trip_NN ,_, sports_NNS ,_, etc_FW ._. ._. )_SYM
to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN ._.
Consequently_RB ,_, to_TO be_VB happy_JJ is_VBZ not_RB really_RB related_JJ with_IN people_NNS age_NN ._.
