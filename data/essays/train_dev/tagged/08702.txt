I_PRP agree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communties_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP two_CD reasons_NNS as_IN below_RB ._.
First_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS need_VBP to_TO communicate_VB with_IN someone_NN who_WP join_VBP communties_NNS because_IN they_PRP can_MD learn_VB many_JJ things_NNS to_TO become_VB adults_NNS ._.
Second_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD get_VB good_JJ experience_NN and_CC advise_VB to_TO grow_VB their_PRP$ charactertistic_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, they_PRP talk_VBP with_IN elder_JJR people_NNS ,_, then_RB they_PRP have_VBP different_JJ thinking_NN ,_, so_RB young_JJ people_NNS can_MD get_VB different_JJ view_NN of_IN thinking_NN ._.
In_IN conclustion_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ very_RB important_JJ for_IN young_JJ people_NNS to_TO join_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
They_PRP can_MD spend_VB good_JJ time_NN in_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
