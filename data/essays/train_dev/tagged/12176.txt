Some_DT people_NNS become_VBP aware_JJ of_IN the_DT limited_JJ life_NN span_NN of_IN human_JJ being_VBG at_IN their_PRP$ early_JJ ages_NNS and_CC try_VB to_TO enjoy_VB it_PRP in_IN the_DT best_JJS way_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, there_EX are_VBP some_DT who_WP are_VBP able_JJ to_TO recognize_VB it_PRP when_WRB they_PRP come_VBP to_TO the_DT end_NN ._.
Though_NNP ,_, there_EX is_VBZ not_RB a_DT direct_JJ correlation_NN between_IN the_DT awareness_NN of_IN the_DT limited_JJ life_NN span_NN and_CC the_DT age_NN ,_, old_JJ people_NNS generally_RB tend_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO assess_VB the_DT problems_NNS bigger_JJR as_IN they_PRP are_VBP actually_RB ._.
Since_IN it_PRP is_VBZ hard_JJ for_IN a_DT typical_JJ young_JJ to_TO foresee_VB the_DT outcomes_NNS of_IN the_DT events_NNS ,_, they_PRP are_VBP magnifying_VBG every_DT difficulty_NN they_PRP come_VBP across_RP ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, many_JJ students_NNS in_IN my_PRP$ country_NN ,_, Turkey_NNP ,_, think_VBP that_IN the_DT university_NN entrance_NN exam_NN is_VBZ the_DT nost_NN important_JJ point_NN in_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, if_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB able_JJ to_TO achive_VB it_PRP ,_, most_JJS of_IN them_PRP are_VBP damaged_VBN mentally_RB ._.
However_RB ,_, since_IN older_JJR people_NNS has_VBZ a_DT lot_NN of_IN experience_NN ,_, they_PRP face_VBP problems_NNS in_IN a_DT calmer_JJR manner_NN ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, in_IN general_JJ ,_, an_DT older_JJR man_NN has_VBZ higher_JJR chance_NN of_IN having_VBG enough_JJ money_NN and_CC time_NN than_IN a_DT typical_JJ young_JJ person_NN to_TO do_VB what_WP they_PRP dreamed_VBD ._.
Vast_JJ majority_NN of_IN us_PRP have_VBP little_JJ money_NN to_TO spend_VB on_IN our_PRP$ personal_JJ lives_NNS ,_, while_IN we_PRP are_VBP studying_VBG ,_, since_IN we_PRP depend_VBP on_IN our_PRP$ families_NNS economically_RB ._.
Also_RB ,_, due_JJ to_TO our_PRP$ schools_NNS and_CC summer_NN schools_NNS ,_, our_PRP$ time_NN is_VBZ also_RB limited_VBN to_TO do_VB what_WP we_PRP want_VBP to_TO ,_, while_IN oleders_NNS hav_VBP
All_DT in_IN all_DT ,_, I_PRP am_VBP quite_RB disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT idea_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Though_IN I_PRP think_VBP that_IN youngers_NNS have_VBP more_RBR energy_NN and_CC more_JJR desire_NN than_IN the_DT olders_NNS ,_, they_PRP could_MD not_RB enjoy_VB life_NN due_JJ to_TO pressure_VB put_VBN on_IN them_PRP by_IN their_PRP$ families_NNS and_CC the_DT limited_JJ finance_NN and_CC time_NN ._.
