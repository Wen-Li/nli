I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN ``_`` young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ''_'' because_IN having_VBG a_DT fulfilling_VBG life_NN does_VBZ not_RB depend_VB of_IN age_NN as_IN people_NNS can_MD have_VB the_DT same_JJ activities_NNS or_CC responsabilities_NNS ._.
Although_IN many_JJ people_NNS would_MD believe_VB that_IN age_NN is_VBZ a_DT factor_NN for_IN happiness_NN ,_, this_DT is_VBZ a_DT false_JJ statement_NN because_IN older_JJR people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN by_IN having_VBG the_DT same_JJ activities_NNS that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP ._.
Many_JJ adults_NNS might_MD not_RB see_VB hapiness_NN as_IN simply_RB partying_VBG or_CC having_VBG holidays_NNS ;_: however_RB ,_, this_DT does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB that_IN they_PRP are_VBP unable_JJ to_TO do_VB these_DT activities_NNS ._.
Adults_NNS tend_VBP to_TO value_NN things_NNS that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB see_VB as_IN part_NN of_IN their_PRP$ daily_JJ hapiness_NN ;_: such_JJ as_IN ,_, having_VBG a_DT family_NN ._.
And_CC ,_, they_PRP choose_VBP to_TO stay_VB home_NN with_IN their_PRP$ families_NNS instead_RB of_IN going_VBG out_RP with_IN frinds_NNS to_TO the_DT closest_JJS pub_NN ._.
Nevertheless_RB ,_, the_DT activities_NNS someone_NN does_VBZ depend_VB on_IN personal_JJ choice_NN and_CC should_MD not_RB be_VB confuse_VB with_IN matter_NN of_IN age_NN ._.
Other_JJ people_NNS believe_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR life_NN because_IN they_PRP have_VBP less_RBR responsabilities_NNS ;_: however_RB ,_, this_DT is_VBZ not_RB completely_RB true_JJ ._.
With_IN globalization_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP facing_VBG more_JJR challenges_NNS everyday_JJ ._.
They_PRP not_RB only_RB have_VBP to_TO obtain_VB the_DT best_JJS grades_NNS they_PRP can_MD get_VB at_IN school_NN to_TO secure_VB a_DT future_JJ job_NN ,_, but_CC also_RB they_PRP have_VBP to_TO become_VB self-relient_JJ at_IN an_DT early_JJ stage_NN to_TO help_VB paying_VBG for_IN their_PRP$ education_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, adults_NNS are_VBP seeing_VBG everyday_JJ people_NNS better_RBR prepare_VB in_IN the_DT workforce_NN ,_, and_CC they_PRP have_VBP to_TO return_VB to_TO the_DT classrooms_NNS to_TO obtain_VB more_JJR knowledge_NN which_WDT is_VBZ a_DT responsability_NN that_IN many_JJ people_NNS associate_VBP with_IN youn_NN ._.
In_IN this_DT way_NN ,_, adults_NNS do_VBP not_RB necesarily_RB have_VB more_RBR moral_JJ or_CC monetary_JJ responsabilities_NNS than_IN young_JJ people_NNS that_WDT avoids_VBZ them_PRP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, for_IN people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN should_MD not_RB be_VB seen_VBN as_IN a_DT matter_NN of_IN age_NN because_IN anyone_NN can_MD choose_VB to_TO have_VB not_RB only_RB the_DT same_JJ activities_NNS ,_, but_CC also_RB the_DT same_JJ responsabilities_NNS ._.
Heppiness_NN depends_VBZ on_IN free_JJ will_NN which_WDT all_DT humans_NNS posses_NNS ._.
