I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN statement_NN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS ._.
The_DT young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB more_JJR than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS due_JJ to_TO the_DT following_VBG reasons_NNS ._.
First_NNP young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR place_NN to_TO explore_VB when_WRB compared_VBN to_TO old_JJ people_NNS ._.
To_TO explore_VB these_DT new_JJ places_NNS young_JJ have_VBP lots_NNS of_IN energy_NN and_CC enjoyment_NN by_IN exploring_VBG that_IN places_NNS ._.
Incontrast_NNP old_JJ who_WP might_MD have_VB already_RB visited_VBN that_IN places_NNS will_MD less_RBR entusiasm_JJ and_CC excitement_NN when_WRB compared_VBN to_TO the_DT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
second_RB ,_, most_JJS of_IN old_JJ people_NNS will_MD be_VB suffering_VBG from_IN chronic_JJ diseases_NNS like_IN diabates_NNS ,_, bloodpressure_NN ,_, and_CC heart_NN related_JJ diseases_NNS so_RB old_JJ people_NNS suffering_VBG from_IN these_DT disease_NN can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB as_RB much_JJ as_IN young_JJ people_NNS who_WP are_VBP more_RBR resistant_JJ to_TO these_DT chronic_JJ diseases_NNS ._.
Moreover_RB financial_JJ problems_NNS are_VBP more_RBR for_IN old_JJ people_NNS when_WRB compared_VBN to_TO young_JJ people_NNS because_IN old_JJ people_NNS will_MD not_RB have_VB sufficient_JJ energy_NN to_TO work_VB so_RB they_PRP cant_VBP earn_VB money_NN to_TO spend_VB it_PRP on_IN different_JJ amusements_NNS for_IN enjoying_VBG thier_JJR life_NN ._.
on_IN the_DT otherhand_NN young_JJ people_NNS with_IN lots_NNS of_IN energy_NN can_MD work_VB more_JJR and_CC can_MD earn_VB more_RBR so_IN that_IN they_PRP can_MD spend_VB on_IN different_JJ amusements_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB thier_JJR life_NN ._.
so_RB old_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN as_RB much_RB as_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS because_IN they_PRP have_VBP financial_JJ problems_NNS ,_, they_PRP may_MD be_VB suffering_VBG from_IN chronic_JJ diseases_NNS moreover_RB they_PRP dont_VBP have_VBP so_RB much_JJ energy_NN to_TO enjoy_VB thier_JJR life_NN when_WRB compared_VBN to_TO the_DT energetic_JJ young_JJ people_NNS ._.
