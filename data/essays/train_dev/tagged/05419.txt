People_NNS have_VBP their_PRP$ own_JJ way_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Old_NNP ,_, young_JJ ,_, men_NNS ,_, women_NNS they_PRP all_DT spend_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN differently_RB as_IN the_DT way_NN they_PRP want_VBP ._.
However_RB ,_, some_DT people_NNS say_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Some_DT people_NNS would_MD disagree_VB with_IN this_DT statement_NN because_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP n't_RB really_RB know_VB about_IN the_DT life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS because_IN they_PRP did_VBD n't_RB experience_VB their_PRP$ life_NN as_RB long_RB as_IN older_JJR people_NNS did_VBD ._.
However_RB ,_, as_IN for_IN me_PRP ,_, I_PRP think_VBP young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_IN younger_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR contact_NN with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ,_, and_CC activities_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
First_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS has_VBZ many_JJ organization_NN to_TO keep_VB contact_NN with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS and_CC also_RB make_VB new_JJ relations_NNS with_IN others_NNS such_JJ as_IN facilities_NNS like_IN schools_NNS ,_, or_CC mediums_NNS like_IN blogs_NNS ._.
They_PRP meet_VBP others_NNS through_IN these_DT organization_NN and_CC keep_VB contact_NN with_IN them_PRP ._.
With_IN many_JJ friends_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD fully_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN rather_RB than_IN being_VBG alone_RB ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS however_RB ,_, seems_VBZ to_TO have_VB difficulty_NN in_IN keeping_VBG in_IN touch_NN with_IN their_PRP$ old_JJ friends_NNS so_IN they_PRP spend_VBP most_JJS of_IN their_PRP$ time_NN alone_RB ,_, or_CC with_IN their_PRP$ family_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, when_WRB travelling_VBG alone_RB ,_, I_PRP enjoy_VBP it_PRP for_IN the_DT first_JJ day_NN ,_, but_CC as_IN time_NN goes_VBZ by_IN I_PRP find_VBP it_PRP routine_JJ to_TO take_VB picture_NN of_IN only_JJ land_NN scapes_NNS ,_, and_CC eating_NN alone_RB ._.
But_CC when_WRB I_PRP travel_VBP with_IN my_PRP$ friends_NNS ,_, we_PRP can_MD take_VB picture_NN of_IN each_DT other_JJ ,_, and_CC talk_NN and_CC chatter_NN while_IN transporting_VBG to_TO the_DT next_JJ place_NN to_TO tour_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ more_RBR enjoyable_JJ to_TO be_VB with_IN friends_NNS than_IN being_VBG alone_RB ._.
Second_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS know_VBP what_WP they_PRP want_VBP and_CC what_WP they_PRP like_VBP ._.
They_PRP would_MD rather_RB spend_VB their_PRP$ time_NN doing_VBG what_WP they_PRP like_VBP than_IN working_VBG over-time_NN for_IN more_JJR incomes_NNS ._.
They_PRP can_MD spend_VB their_PRP$ leisure_NN time_NN doing_VBG whatever_WDT they_PRP want_VBP since_IN they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR entertaing_JJ programs_NNS which_WDT did_VBD n't_RB exist_VB at_IN old_JJ people_NNS 's_POS young_JJ era_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, when_WRB I_PRP have_VBP leisure_NN time_NN I_PRP can_MD go_VB and_CC see_VB exibition_NN ,_, movie_NN theater_NN ,_, or_CC sporting_VBG event_NN ._.
Most_JJS of_IN old_JJ people_NNS does_VBZ n't_RB like_VB these_DT activities_NNS because_IN they_PRP did_VBD n't_RB experience_VB these_DT when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ ._.
Instead_RB they_PRP have_VBP interests_NNS in_IN activities_NNS which_WDT seem_VBP to_TO be_VB routine_JJ to_TO youngs_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN gardening_NN ,_, or_CC fishing_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, even_RB people_NNS have_VBP their_PRP$ own_JJ way_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS knows_VBZ how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_RBR ,_, because_IN they_PRP have_VBP medium_NN to_TO help_VB them_PRP to_TO keep_VB contact_NN with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ,_, and_CC facilities_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ spare_JJ time_NN ._.
