Life_NNP is_VBZ a_DT gift_NN from_IN god_NN and_CC one_CD has_VBZ to_TO enjoy_VB it_PRP ._.
However_RB ,_, life_NN enjoyment_NN differs_VBZ from_IN one_CD to_TO another_DT depending_VBG on_IN budgets_NNS ._.
Besides_IN it_PRP differs_VBZ from_IN young_JJ and_CC old_JJ peolpe_NN ._.
In_IN this_DT essay_NN ,_, I_PRP am_VBP going_VBG to_TO show_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ ones_NNS because_IN of_IN health_NN and_CC age_NN diffrences_NNS ._.
Young_JJ peple_NN enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, since_IN yong_NN peple_NN are_VBP more_RBR healthier_JJR than_IN old_JJ ones_NNS ._.
As_IN a_DT matter_NN of_IN fact_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP vivid_JJ ;_: that_DT is_VBZ to_TO say_VB ,_, they_PRP are_VBP full_JJ of_IN life_NN ;_: they_PRP ,_, indeed_RB ,_, can_MD travel_VB long_JJ distances_NNS enjoying_VBG the_DT beauty_NN of_IN the_DT land_NN scape_NN without_IN any_DT complaint_NN ._.
Nevertheless_RB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB travel_VB such_JJ distances_NNS they_PRP easily_RB get_VBP tired_VBN ._.
Adding_VBG to_TO that_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD do_VB other_JJ activities_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN going_VBG to_TO the_DT disco_NN ,_, swimming_VBG or_CC hiking_VBG ._.
Olders_NNP ,_, on_IN the_DT contrary_NN ,_, prefer_VBP sleeping_VBG or_CC taking_VBG a_DT nap_NN rather_RB than_IN amusing_JJ themselves_PRP ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN like_IN young_JJ people_NNS because_IN of_IN age_NN ._.
Some_DT old_JJ people_NNS think_VBP that_IN during_IN their_PRP$ youghts_NNS they_PRP enjoyed_VBD their_PRP$ time_NN and_CC believes_VBZ that_IN the_DT remaining_VBG of_IN their_PRP$ life_NN should_MD be_VB devoted_VBN to_TO their_PRP$ children_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, their_PRP$ main_JJ concern_NN is_VBZ to_TO see_VB their_PRP$ children_NNS 's_POS improvement_NN from_IN childhood_NN to_TO adulthood_NN ._.
Thus_RB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS think_VBP that_IN their_PRP$ role_NN is_VBZ to_TO serve_VB their_PRP$ children_NNS at_IN the_DT expense_NN of_IN their_PRP$ enjoyment_NN ._.
In_IN summary_NN ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN old_JJ people_NNS ,_, specially_RB parents_NNS are_VBP great_JJ ,_, as_IN they_PRP devote_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN for_IN their_PRP$ childern_NN rather_RB thanenjoying_VBG their_PRP$ time_NN like_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
