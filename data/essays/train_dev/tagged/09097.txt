Many_JJ people_NNS might_MD have_VB different_JJ points_NNS of_IN view_NN on_IN this_DT particular_JJ topic_NN based_VBN on_IN their_PRP$ personal_JJ experiences_NNS or_CC their_PRP$ social_JJ status_NN ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, since_IN the_DT lifespan_NN of_IN human_JJ has_VBZ greatly_RB extended_VBN compared_VBN to_TO the_DT past_NN due_JJ to_TO advanced_JJ health_NN care_NN system_NN ,_, it_PRP might_MD be_VB even_RB difficult_JJ to_TO classify_VB between_IN younger_JJR people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, if_IN I_PRP narrow_VBP down_RP the_DT definition_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS to_TO a_DT stage_NN of_IN teenager_NN I_PRP definetely_RB support_VBP the_DT idea_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS does_VBZ not_RB have_VB any_DT health_NN concerns_NNS while_IN the_DT older_JJR 's_POS do_VBP ._.
I_PRP often_RB see_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN old_JJ people_NNS visiting_VBG local_JJ hopital_NN to_TO check_VB up_RP thier_JJR health_NN on_IN a_DT regular_JJ basis_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS ,_, especially_RB teenagers_NNS are_VBP not_RB feard_VBN with_IN such_JJ things_NNS ._.
Thus_RB ,_, they_PRP likely_RB to_TO experience_VB new_JJ things_NNS that_IN they_PRP never_RB had_VBD tried_VBN in_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN smoking_NN ,_, drinking_NN with_IN friends_NNS ._.
Those_DT surely_RB might_MD be_VB very_RB interesting_JJ and_CC exiciting_VBG for_IN teenages_NNS because_IN they_PRP might_MD think_VB or_CC feel_VB that_IN they_PRP are_VBP approaching_VBG an_DT unknown_JJ territory_NN that_IN they_PRP have_VBP never_RB explored_VBN ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, unlike_IN old_JJ people_NNS who_WP has_VBZ health_NN limitations_NNS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS could_MD definetely_RB start_VB any_DT kind_NN of_IN sports_NNS that_IN they_PRP are_VBP interested_JJ in_IN ._.
Second_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, age_NN of_IN teenagers_NNS is_VBZ the_DT stage_NN when_WRB you_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB to_TO seriouly_RB concern_NN about_IN your_PRP$ future_JJ career_NN path_NN ._.
While_IN you_PRP are_VBP at_IN school_NN ,_, you_PRP can_MD try_VB to_TO taste_VB variety_NN of_IN ranges_NNS of_IN studies_NNS and_CC look_VB for_IN what_WP subject_JJ attracts_VBZ you_PRP the_DT most_JJS ._.
Nobody_NN would_MD force_VB you_PRP to_TO take_VB courses_NNS that_IN you_PRP dislike_VBP ._.
In_IN contrast_NN ,_, many_JJ old_JJ people_NNS might_MD have_VB put_VBN away_RP their_PRP$ dreams_NNS to_TO be_VB a_DT scientist_NN or_CC a_DT firefighter_NN in_IN order_NN to_TO have_VB more_JJR stablilty_NN in_IN financial_JJ matters_NNS ._.
From_IN time_NN to_TO time_NN ,_, old_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ hobbies_NNS or_CC stop_VB them_PRP from_IN traveling_VBG around_IN the_DT world_NN because_IN they_PRP have_VBP responsibility_NN to_TO support_VB and_CC raise_VB their_PRP$ children_NNS ._.
Amoung_NNP many_JJ reasons_NNS ,_, those_DT arguements_NNS I_PRP mentioned_VBD above_RB are_VBP the_DT ones_NNS I_PRP believe_VBP the_DT major_JJ differences_NNS between_IN older_JJR people_NNS and_CC young_JJ people_NNS ._.
People_NNS 's_POS taste_NN and_CC favor_NN might_MD vary_VB from_IN a_DT certain_JJ stage_NN of_IN age_NN to_TO another_DT ._.
However_RB ,_, the_DT sure_JJ thing_NN is_VBZ that_IN the_DT responsibilty_NN and_CC concern_NN grow_VBP bigger_JJR as_IN you_PRP get_VBP older_JJR ._.
Thus_RB ,_, limiting_VBG the_DT old_JJ people_NNS from_IN starting_VBG a_DT new_JJ thing_NN and_CC this_DT fact_NN leads_VBZ me_PRP to_TO a_DT conclusion_NN that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS have_VBP much_RB more_RBR fun_NN in_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS and_CC you_PRP should_MD not_RB waste_VB such_JJ precious_JJ time_NN ._.
