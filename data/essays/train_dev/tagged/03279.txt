I_PRP personally_RB do_VBP n't_RB agree_VB that_IN ``_`` young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ''_'' .l_NN have_VBP several_JJ reasons_NNS as_IN follows_VBZ ._.
First_RB ,_, the_DT older_JJR also_RB can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Because_IN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN experience_NN ,_, knowledge_NN and_CC wisdom_NN to_TO whole_JJ their_PRP$ lives_NNS individually_RB ,_, IThey_NN can_MD have_VB much_JJ time_NN
Second_RB ,_, Most_JJS older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR free_JJ time_NN and_CC money_NN than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ._.
They_PRP can_MD access_VB everwhere_RB and_CC every_DT time_NN they_PRP like_VBP if_IN they_PRP are_VBP fine_JJ ._.
In_IN japan_NN ,_, many_JJ elderly_JJ enjoy_VB to_TO travel_VB ,_, walk_VB mountains_NNS ,_, pray_VB KOTO_NNP ,_, write_VB HAIKU_NNP ,_, you_PRP know_VBP ,_, our_PRP$ traditional_JJ culture_NN and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, my_PRP$ grandparents_NNS love_VBP trevelling_VBG very_RB much_JJ together_RB ._.
From_IN when_WRB they_PRP finish_VBP to_TO grow_VB up_RP their_PRP$ child_NN ,_, my_PRP$ mother_NN ._.
they_PRP enjoy_VBP to_TO travel_VB in_IN Japan_NNP ,_, china_NN ,_, korea_NN and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
This_DT summer_NN ,_, they_PRP visited_VBD New_NNP York_NNP and_CC saw_VBD around_IN town_NN and_CC enjoy_VB to_TO see_VB musical_JJ in_IN broadway_NN ._.
They_PRP said_VBD to_TO me_PRP so_RB wonderful_JJ trip_NN !_.
I_PRP think_VBP their_PRP$ freetime_NN and_CC many_JJ by_IN working_VBG long_RB time_NN ,_, and_CC mental_JJ maturity_NN can_MD come_VB ture_NN that_WDT ._.
Third_NNP ,_, now_RB ,_, more_JJR and_CC more_RBR old_JJ people_NNS become_VBP to_TO keep_VB good_JJ health_NN ,_, and_CC have_VBP long_JJ life_NN expectancy_NN ._.
So_IN they_PRP can_MD move_VB active_JJ as_IN like_IN the_DT younger_JJR ._.
Actually_RB ._.
we_PRP can_MD see_VB that_IN some_DT elderly_JJ are_VBP active_JJ than_IN some_DT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
I_PRP Therefore_RB ,_, as_IN I_PRP mentioned_VBD above_RB ,_, I_PRP definitely_RB think_VBP that_IN old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN as_RB much_RB as_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
