I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT opinion_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS for_IN the_DT following_VBG reasons_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP less_RBR interested_JJ in_IN the_DT activities_NNS of_IN their_PRP$ communities_NNS ,_, although_IN communities_NNS are_VBP indispensable_JJ for_IN people_NNS to_TO live_VB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, I_PRP participate_VBP in_IN a_DT clean_JJ up_IN activity_NN around_IN the_DT central_JJ station_NN of_IN my_PRP$ city_NN ._.
This_DT activity_NN is_VBZ held_VBN every_DT week_NN and_CC young_JJ people_NNS live_VBP in_IN my_PRP$ city_NN is_VBZ strongly_RB encourage_VB to_TO join_VB ,_, however_RB ,_, there_EX are_VBP few_JJ young_JJ people_NNS among_IN the_DT participants_NNS ._.
This_DT example_NN clearly_RB shows_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB spend_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Second_RB ,_, the_DT vote_NN rate_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS in_IN elections_NNS in_IN Japan_NNP is_VBZ generally_RB much_RB less_JJR than_IN that_DT of_IN elder_JJR people_NNS ,_, although_IN to_TO join_VB political_JJ process_NN of_IN the_DT communities_NNS is_VBZ impotant_JJ activity_NN to_TO keep_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS active_JJ and_CC healthy_JJ ._.
To_TO join_VB political_JJ process_NN ,_, the_DT voter_NN must_MD have_VB their_PRP$ opinion_NN toward_IN their_PRP$ commutities_NNS ._.
If_IN young_JJ people_NNS paticipate_VBP in_IN their_PRP$ communities_NNS ,_, they_PRP should_MD have_VB some_DT opinion_NN toward_IN the_DT situation_NN or_CC future_NN of_IN their_PRP$ communities_NNS ,_, and_CC they_PRP should_MD have_VB strong_JJ incentive_NN to_TO go_VB voting_NN ._.
This_DT is_VBZ the_DT reason_NN why_WRB I_PRP think_VBP young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB spend_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Third_NNP ,_, there_EX are_VBP many_JJ companies_NNS which_WDT help_VBP elder_JJR people_NNS with_IN their_PRP$ house_NN hold_VBP errands_NNS and_CC chores_NNS ._.
The_DT copanies_NNS run_VBP their_PRP$ customers_NNS errands_NNS instead_RB of_IN instead_RB of_IN the_DT elder_JJR people_NNS ._.
This_DT business_NN increases_NNS because_IN young_JJ people_NNS will_MD not_RB help_VB their_PRP$ grand_JJ parents_NNS or_CC their_PRP$ parents_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, for_IN above_IN reasons_NNS ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT opinion_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
