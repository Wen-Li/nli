Although_IN it_PRP might_MD seems_VBZ that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, one_CD need_NN to_TO be_VB careful_JJ before_IN making_VBG such_JJ assumption_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS certainly_RB for_IN the_DT most_JJS part_NN seem_VBP to_TO be_VB more_RBR extroverted_JJ about_IN the_DT ways_NNS they_PRP pursue_VBP experiencing_VBG ,_, and_CC having_VBG fun_NN ._.
Perhaps_RB this_DT is_VBZ the_DT reason_NN why_WRB the_DT market_NN is_VBZ loaded_VBN with_IN a_DT plethora_NN of_IN outlets_NNS for_IN them_PRP to_TO consume_VB and_CC experience_VB ``_`` joy_NN ''_'' or_CC better_RBR said_VBD ``_`` fun_NN ''_'' ._.
Nowdays_RB as_IN technology_NN advances_NNS there_RB seems_VBZ to_TO be_VB a_DT never_RB ending_VBG industry_NN aimed_VBN to_TO providing_VBG entertainement_NN for_IN young_JJ folks_NNS ._.
This_DT explosion_NN of_IN gadgets_NNS and_CC toys_NNS certainly_RB can_MD be_VB distracting_VBG to_TO the_DT not-so_JJ analytical_JJ eye_NN and_CC might_MD lead_VB to_TO believe_VB what_WP the_DT statement_NN says_VBZ ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP consider_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN as_RB much_RB ,_, if_IN not_RB more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS because_IN they_PRP have_VBP reached_VBN the_DT maturity_NN for_IN doing_VBG so_RB in_IN a_DT more_RBR simpler_JJR ways_NNS ;_: and_CC because_IN they_PRP might_MD have_VB mastered_VBN the_DT basic_JJ elements_NNS that_WDT conceive_VBP the_DT art_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN at_IN its_PRP$ purest_JJS essence_NN ._.
Certainly_RB the_DT joys_NNS of_IN older_JJR people_NNS tend_VBP for_IN the_DT most_JJS part_NN to_TO manifest_VB differently_RB from_IN those_DT of_IN the_DT younger_JJR crowd_NN ._.
And_CC therfore_RB being_VBG unperceptible_JJ to_TO the_DT young_JJ and_CC inexperienced_JJ eye_NN ._.
One_CD of_IN the_DT reasons_NNS is_VBZ simply_RB because_IN older_JJR people_NNS did_VBD experience_NN similar_JJ ``_`` joys_NNS ''_'' when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ and_CC do_VBP not_RB need_VB them_PRP anymore_RB ._.
The_DT other_JJ reason_NN is_VBZ because_IN they_PRP might_MD make_VB ``_`` less_JJR noise_NN ''_'' about_IN the_DT ways_NNS they_PRP enjoy_VBP life_NN ._.
Some_DT may_MD say_VB that_IN when_WRB older_JJR folks_NNS were_VBD young_JJ they_PRP did_VBD not_RB have_VB all_PDT the_DT technological_JJ toys_NNS that_WDT are_VBP present_JJ today_NN in_IN the_DT market_NN and_CC therefore_RB they_PRP could_MD not_RB enjoy_VB life_NN as_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP today_NN ._.
Certainly_RB ,_, Play_VB Stations_NNS ,_, DVD_NN ,_, and_CC MP3_NN were_VBD not_RB around_RB 20_CD years_NNS ago_RB ,_, however_RB ,_, technology_NN such_JJ as_IN radio_NN ,_, television_NN ,_, record_NN players_NNS ,_, and_CC more_RBR that_WDT are_VBP taken_VBN for_IN granted_VBN today_NN ,_, were_VBD inovative_JJ technological_JJ ``_`` toys_NNS ''_'' thirty_CD and_CC fifty_CD years_NNS ago_IN that_DT provided_VBN plenty_NN opportunities_NNS for_IN the_DT youth_NN of_IN that_DT time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
Certainly_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ much_RB easier_JJR to_TO travel_VB today_NN than_IN it_PRP was_VBD fifty_CD years_NNS before_RB ,_, but_CC then_RB most_JJS people_NNS did_VBD not_RB think_VB of_IN it_PRP as_IN a_DT way_NN of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
One_PRP can_MD even_RB go_VB further_RB and_CC try_VB to_TO think_VB about_IN non-western_JJ societies_NNS where_WRB electronic_JJ gadgets_NNS are_VBP not_RB part_NN of_IN everyday_JJ life_NN ._.
There_EX too_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN differently_RB than_IN older_JJR folks_NNS ._.
Young_NNP men_NNS might_MD go_VB hunting_NN and_CC young_JJ girls_NNS might_MD be_VB involved_VBN in_IN weaving_VBG while_IN elders_NNS do_VBP n't_RB do_VB these_DT activities_NNS anymore_RB ._.
Perhaps_RB there_EX the_DT difference_NN might_MD be_VB that_IN more_RBR often_RB than_IN in_IN our_PRP$ societies_NNS ,_, both_CC young_JJ and_CC old_JJ people_NNS gather_VBP together_RB to_TO enjoy_VB for_IN instance_NN story_NN telling_VBG sessions_NNS ,_, where_WRB the_DT elders_NNS are_VBP the_DT main_JJ providers_NNS of_IN fun_NN and_CC the_DT youngers_NNS ones_NNS become_VBP apprentices_NNS of_IN the_DT ways_NNS they_PRP will_MD enjoy_VB life_NN later_RB on_IN ._.
