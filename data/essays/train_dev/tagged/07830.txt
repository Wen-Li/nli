Younger_NNP and_CC older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP differnt_JJ ways_NNS to_TO live_VB their_PRP$ lifes_NNS but_CC it_PRP seems_VBZ to_TO me_PRP that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ way_NN of_IN living_VBG more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS can_MD ._.
That_DT is_VBZ why_WRB I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT the_DT statment_NN ._.
On_IN reason_NN is_VBZ ,_, that_IN I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR unconscious_JJ than_IN older_JJR peolpe_NN and_CC that_DT is_VBZ why_WRB they_PRP are_VBP more_RBR free_JJ in_IN taking_VBG advantage_NN of_IN what_WP is_VBZ going_VBG on_IN in_IN front_NN of_IN them_PRP ._.
For_IN example_NN if_IN hey_NN have_VBP the_DT opportunity_NN to_TO go_VB and_CC visit_VB a_DT friend_NN in_IN another_DT country_NN they_PRP often_RB do_VBP not_RB thing_NN how_WRB hard_JJ it_PRP is_VBZ to_TO go_VB there_RB ._.
They_PRP just_RB take_VBP a_DT few_JJ things_NNS and_CC try_VB to_TO reach_VB their_PRP$ friends_NNS place_VBP ,_, maybe_RB by_IN hitch_NN hiking_NN ._.
This_DT mostly_RB differes_VBZ from_IN the_DT behaviour_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, which_WDT often_RB have_VBP to_TO plan_VB things_NNS in_IN a_DT really_RB organized_VBN way_NN ._.
And_CC often_RB have_VBP all_PDT this_DT thouhgts_NNS like_VBP is_VBZ this_DT the_DT right_JJ moment_NN in_IN my_PRP$ life_NN ,_, what_WP about_IN my_PRP$ job_NN ._. .._SYM
This_DT feels_VBZ like_IN ,_, that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP a_DT big_JJ amount_NN of_IN freedom_NN to_TO act_VB however_RB they_PRP want_VBP A_DT other_JJ reason_NN why_WRB young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lifes_NNS more_RBR is_VBZ ,_, that_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB the_DT same_JJ amount_NN of_IN responsibillities_NNS like_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
They_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB children_NNS to_TO look_VB for_IN ._.
They_PRP can_MD go_VB to_TO a_DT party_NN the_DT whole_JJ night_NN long_RB without_IN having_VBG lots_NNS of_IN stress_NN the_DT next_JJ day_NN ._.
They_PRP only_RB need_VBP to_TO go_VB to_TO school_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS often_RB are_VBP more_RBR healthy_JJ then_RB older_JJR peoples_NNS ,_, so_IN they_PRP can_MD do_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN things_NNS older_JJR people_NNS can_MD not_RB do_VB ,_, for_IN example_NN extrem_NN -_: sports_NNS According_VBG to_TO all_PDT the_DT other_JJ reasonable_JJ things_NNS about_IN this_DT topic_NN I_PRP would_MD think_VB ,_, that_IN the_DT main_JJ point_NN why_WRB young_JJ peoples_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN betteris_NN ,_, that_IN they_PRP still_RB have_VBP freedom_NN to_TO choose_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB ,_, without_IN beeing_VBG trapped_VBN in_IN an_DT adult_JJ life_NN ._.
