I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN that_DT stament_NN ._.
Younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP not_RB enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, they_PRP just_RB enjoy_VBP it_PRP in_IN a_DT diferent_JJ way_NN ._.
Younger_JJR people_NNS still_RB have_VBP the_DT energy_NN to_TO do_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN things_NNS older_JJR people_NNS can_MD not_RB do_VB ,_, such_JJ as_IN swimming_VBG and_CC running_VBG and_CC staying_VBG up_RP with_IN friends_NNS partying_VBG ,_, so_IN they_PRP enjoy_VBP life_NN with_IN a_DT big_JJ group_NN of_IN people_NNS ,_, often_RB their_PRP$ friends_NNS from_IN school_NN and_CC neighborhoods_NNS ._.
They_PRP also_RB usualy_RB do_VB not_RB need_VB to_TO work_VB and_CC worry_VB about_IN payments_NNS and_CC loans_NNS and_CC all_DT of_IN the_DT problems_NNS troubling_VBG the_DT older_JJR persons_NNS ,_, they_PRP only_RB need_VBP to_TO worry_VB about_IN education_NN and_CC their_PRP$ future_NN ,_, so_IN they_PRP tend_VBP to_TO play_VB games_NNS like_IN football_NN ,_, soccer_NN ,_, baseball_NN and_CC basketball_NN ,_, and_CC have_VBP hobbies_NNS like_IN swiming_VBG and_CC riding_VBG a_DT bicycle_NN ,_, going_VBG to_TO rock_VB concerts_NNS and_CC dancing_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN in_IN a_DT diferent_JJ way_NN simply_RB because_IN they_PRP no_RB longer_RB have_VBP the_DT time_NN ,_, or_CC energy_NN ,_, to_TO do_VB the_DT things_NNS they_PRP used_VBD to_TO do_VB ._.
They_PRP are_VBP too_RB responsible_JJ ,_, too_RB caring_VBG about_IN the_DT example_NN they_PRP set_VBP for_IN their_PRP$ sons_NNS and_CC the_DT time_NN they_PRP give_VBP to_TO them_PRP ,_, to_TO remember_VB that_IN they_PRP ,_, too_RB ,_, need_VBP a_DT moment_NN for_IN themselves_PRP ._.
A_DT grown_VBN person_NN has_VBZ to_TO worry_VB about_IN diferent_JJ issues_NNS ,_, like_IN working_VBG and_CC paying_VBG for_IN all_DT of_IN the_DT things_NNS they_PRP use_VBP ,_, about_IN not_RB being_VBG a_DT bad_JJ example_NN for_IN their_PRP$ children_NNS ,_, and_CC about_IN their_PRP$ education_NN ,_, among_IN other_JJ things_NNS ._.
