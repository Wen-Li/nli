I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN succesful_JJ people_NNS try_VBP new_JJ things_NNS and_CC take_VB risks_NNS rather_RB than_IN only_RB doing_VBG what_WP they_PRP already_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO do_VB well_RB ._.
In_IN fact_NN ,_, there_EX are_VBP only_RB few_JJ people_NNS who_WP can_MD be_VB considered_VBN truely_RB successful_JJ in_IN the_DT world_NN ,_, in_IN spite_NN the_DT fact_NN that_IN many_JJ people_NNS do_VBP what_WP they_PRP already_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO do_VB well_RB ._.
Besides_IN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ hard_JJ for_IN a_DT person_NN that_WDT does_VBZ what_WP he_PRP or_CC she_PRP already_RB knows_VBZ how_WRB to_TO do_VB well_RB to_TO be_VB recognized_VBN for_IN that_DT reason_NN and_CC ,_, thus_RB ,_, to_TO succeed_VB in_IN the_DT middle_NN of_IN a_DT crowd_NN ._.
Finally_RB ,_, some_DT of_IN the_DT most_RBS famous_JJ successful_JJ people_NNS in_IN the_DT world_NN clearly_RB illustrate_VBP that_DT successful_JJ people_NNS try_VBP new_JJ things_NNS and_CC take_VB risks_NNS ._.
On_IN the_DT one_CD hand_NN ,_, if_IN it_PRP only_RB took_VBD doing_VBG what_WP one_CD already_RB knows_VBZ how_WRB to_TO do_VB well_RB to_TO be_VB successful_JJ ,_, many_JJ people_NNS in_IN the_DT world_NN would_MD be_VB successful_JJ ,_, and_CC this_DT is_VBZ not_RB the_DT case_NN ._.
In_IN fact_NN ,_, many_JJ people_NNS in_IN the_DT world_NN dedicate_VB their_PRP$ entire_JJ lives_NNS to_TO doing_VBG what_WP they_PRP learnt_VBD through_IN formal_JJ education_NN or_CC experience_NN how_WRB to_TO do_VB well_RB ._.
However_RB ,_, there_EX are_VBP only_RB very_RB few_JJ truely_RB successful_JJ people_NNS in_IN the_DT world_NN ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, there_EX are_VBP many_JJ people_NNS who_WP ,_, in_IN spite_NN of_IN having_VBG always_RB done_VBN what_WP they_PRP knew_VBD what_WP to_TO do_VB well_RB ,_, have_VBP never_RB become_VBN successful_JJ ._.
For_IN that_DT reason_NN ,_, one_CD may_MD conclude_VB that_IN it_PRP takes_VBZ much_RB more_JJR than_IN doing_VBG what_WP one_CD knows_VBZ how_WRB to_TO do_VB well_RB in_IN order_NN to_TO be_VB successful_JJ ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, given_VBN that_IN most_JJS people_NNS do_VBP what_WP they_PRP already_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO do_VB well_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ hard_JJ for_IN them_PRP to_TO succeed_VB in_IN doing_VBG so_RB ,_, since_IN they_PRP have_VBP to_TO compete_VB with_IN so_RB many_JJ other_JJ people_NNS for_IN recognition_NN and_CC success_NN ._.
Indeed_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ very_RB difficult_JJ to_TO obtain_VB recognition_NN in_IN the_DT middle_NN of_IN a_DT crowd_NN ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, only_RB very_RB few_JJ workers_NNS of_IN a_DT corporation_NN are_VBP able_JJ to_TO obtain_VB such_JJ a_DT high_JJ degree_NN of_IN recognition_NN from_IN their_PRP$ employers_NNS that_WDT may_MD allow_VB them_PRP to_TO succeed_VB in_IN the_DT corporation_NN ._.
In_IN fact_NN ,_, in_IN a_DT corporation_NN ,_, success_NN means_VBZ being_VBG constantly_RB promoted_VBN until_IN obtaining_VBG a_DT high_JJ -_: or_CC the_DT highest_JJS -_: post_NN ._.
Thus_RB ,_, only_RB very_RB kew_NN of_IN the_DT workers_NNS of_IN a_DT corporation_NN succeed_VB ._.
And_CC this_DT happens_VBZ although_IN it_PRP is_VBZ very_RB likely_JJ that_IN most_JJS of_IN them_PRP do_VBP what_WP they_PRP already_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO do_VB well_RB ._.
Finally_RB ,_, some_DT of_IN the_DT most_RBS famous_JJ examples_NNS of_IN succesful_JJ people_NNS show_VBP us_PRP that_IN they_PRP have_VBP become_VBN successful_JJ by_IN trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS and_CC taking_VBG risks_NNS ._.
Contemporarily_RB speaking_VBG ,_, this_DT is_VBZ especially_RB the_DT case_NN of_IN people_NNS who_WP have_VBP created_VBN and_CC developed_VBN new_JJ technologies_NNS of_IN information_NN and_CC communication_NN ._.
The_DT cases_NNS of_IN the_DT creators_NNS of_IN Microsoft_NNP ,_, Apple_NNP computers_NNS and_CC Google_NNP are_VBP clear_JJ examples_NNS of_IN this_DT ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP believe_VBP that_DT successful_JJ people_NNS try_VBP new_JJ thing_NN and_CC take_VB risks_NNS rather_RB than_IN only_RB doing_VBG what_WP they_PRP already_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO do_VB well_RB ._.
This_DT explains_VBZ that_IN there_EX are_VBP only_RB few_JJ truely_RB successful_JJ people_NNS and_CC that_IN most_JJS of_IN the_DT famous_JJ successful_JJ people_NNS I_PRP know_VBP have_VBP become_VBN successfu_NN
