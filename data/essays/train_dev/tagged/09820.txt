I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR poeple_NN do_VBP because_IN young_JJ people_NNS want_VBP to_TO discover_VB the_DT world_NN ,_, they_PRP usually_RB have_VBP more_RBR energy_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS and_CC they_PRP are_VBP not_RB really_RB worriend_JJ about_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR their_PRP$ life_NN simply_RB because_IN they_PRP do_VBP n't_RB know_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN things_NNS ._.
This_DT is_VBZ an_DT extra_JJ motivation_NN to_TO enjoy_VB almost_RB anything_NN that_IN they_PRP go_VBP through_IN ._.
More_JJR over_IN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS always_RB want_VBP to_TO taste_VB by_IN themselves_PRP everything_NN that_WDT surrounds_VBZ them_PRP and_CC they_PRP will_MD always_RB try_VB to_TO discover_VB new_JJ and_CC exciting_JJ things_NNS ._.
Some_DT things_NNS that_WDT probably_RB older_JJR people_NNS wo_MD n't_RB do_VB are_VBP for_IN example_NN do_VBP extreme_JJ sports_NNS ,_, traveling_VBG around_IN the_DT world_NN and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
This_DT could_MD happen_VB because_IN of_IN a_DT lack_NN of_IN energy_NN by_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Energy_NNP is_VBZ really_RB important_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP usually_RB full_JJ of_IN energy_NN because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ youthness_NN ,_, which_WDT is_VBZ a_DT disadvantage_NN for_IN older_JJR people_NNS who_WP are_VBP usually_RB tired_VBN of_IN working_VBG and_CC spend_VB their_PRP$ free_JJ time_NN recovering_VBG ._.
A_DT lot_NN of_IN people_NNS would_MD say_VB that_IN energy_NN is_VBZ not_RB necessary_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN and_CC that_DT could_MD be_VB true_JJ ._.
Another_DT way_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN is_VBZ to_TO get_VB a_DT relax_VB time_NN ,_, but_CC again_RB young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB more_RBR this_DT relaxed_VBN times_NNS because_IN they_PRP are_VBP less_RBR tired_JJ than_IN older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP usually_RB busy_JJ with_IN their_PRP$ jobs_NNS because_IN they_PRP are_VBP worried_VBN about_IN their_PRP$ future_NN ._.
Although_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP also_RB worried_VBN about_IN their_PRP$ future_NN ,_, they_PRP will_MD always_RB be_VB less_RBR worried_VBN on_IN this_DT kind_NN of_IN issues_NNS ._.
This_DT less_JJR worried_JJ attitude_NN lead_VBP us_PRP to_TO think_VB about_IN a_DT lack_NN of_IN resposability_NN by_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
But_CC that_DT 's_VBZ what_WP makes_VBZ life_NN more_RBR enjoyable_JJ ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS will_MD always_RB think_VB they_PRP have_VBP a_DT whole_JJ life_NN towards_IN them_PRP and_CC that_DT is_VBZ a_DT relief_NN from_IN some_DT worries_NNS that_IN older_JJR people_NNS usually_RB have_VBP ._.
Every_DT person_NN can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN to_TO the_DT maximun_NN ,_, but_CC for_IN sure_JJ young_JJ ones_NNS will_MD enjoy_VB it_PRP more_RBR because_IN their_PRP$ path_NN in_IN life_NN has_VBZ just_RB began_VBD and_CC they_PRP still_RB have_VBP a_DT long_JJ road_NN to_TO go_VB through_IN it_PRP ,_, which_WDT makes_VBZ life_NN more_RBR enjoyable_JJ and_CC exciting_JJ ._.
