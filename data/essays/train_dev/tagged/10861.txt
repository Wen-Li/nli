I_PRP do_VBP agree_VB with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_IN there_EX attitiude_NN is_VBZ totally_RB different_JJ from_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS during_IN there_EX college_NN days_NNS they_PRP spent_VBD in_IN studing_VBG and_CC playing_VBG games_NNS and_CC aslo_IN they_PRP prefer_VBP to_TO go_VB the_DT pary_NN or_CC an_DT some_DT vocation_NN places_VBZ to_TO spent_VBN their_PRP$ time_NN ,_, the_DT young_JJ student_NN like_IN spend_VBP most_RBS amount_VB of_IN their_PRP$ time_NN friends_NNS and_CC others_NNS which_WDT help_VBP them_PRP to_TO interact_VB with_IN differnt_JJ type_NN of_IN people_NNS in_IN order_NN to_TO know_VB more_JJR about_IN the_DT differnt_JJ things_NNS but_CC the_DT older_JJR people_NNS will_MD think_VB in_IN different_JJ way_NN they_PRP like_VBP to_TO sit_VB in_IN a_DT home_NN and_CC think_VB about_IN differnent_JJ things_NNS such_JJ as_IN house_NN hould_NN things_NNS ,_, and_CC many_JJ many_JJ other_JJ related_JJ things_NNS they_PRP feel_VBP very_RB stressful_JJ life_NN ._.
young_JJ people_NNS does'nt_VBP have_VBP a_DT stressfull_JJ life_NN they_PRP allways_RB think_VBP about_IN their_PRP$ carrier_NN related_JJ part_NN of_IN the_DT life_NN rather_RB than_IN thinking_VBG in_IN different_JJ way_NN ,_, they_PRP does'nt_VBP have_VBP the_DT burden_NN of_IN their_PRP$ family_NN that_IN their_PRP$ family_NN have_VBP ,_, during_IN thier_JJR free_JJ time_NN they_PRP like_VBP to_TO spend_VB most_RBS amount_VB of_IN time_NN with_IN friend_NN and_CC with_IN collegemates_NNS ,_, they_PRP often_RB try_VBP to_TO for_IN the_DT tour_NN to_TO the_DT different_JJ places_NNS ,_, and_CC when_WRB a_DT callege_NN camp_NN is_VBZ there_EX they_PRP try_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN in_IN campus_NN camp_NN and_CC at_IN the_DT same_JJ they_PRP can_MD gain_VB mor_NN knowledge_NN about_IN different_JJ things_NNS ._.
