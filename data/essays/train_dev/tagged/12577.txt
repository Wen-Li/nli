Do_VB you_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN moer_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VB ?_.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN most_JJS people_NNS agree_VBP this_DT statement_NN ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ natural_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Because_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP there_EX things_NNS that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ hard_JJ for_IN older_JJR people_NNS to_TO get_VB ;_: time_NN ,_, curiosity_NN ,_, and_CC responsibility_NN ._.
First_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP enough_JJ time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP classes_NNS on_IN school_NN but_CC it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB spend_VB whole_JJ day_NN and_CC they_PRP have_VBP free_JJ time_NN everyday_JJ ._.
On_IN their_PRP$ free_JJ time_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD do_VB anything_NN what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB ,_, such_JJ as_IN playing_VBG with_IN friends_NNS ,_, doing_VBG clubs_NNS ,_, doing_VBG homeworks_NNS ,_, and_CC doing_VBG part-time_JJ jobs_NNS ._.
Also_RB they_PRP can_MD go_VB everywhere_RB they_PRP want_VBP to_TO go_VB ._.
They_PRP do_VBP not_RB think_VB that_IN they_PRP enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, because_IN they_PRP just_RB killing_VBG their_PRP$ free_JJ time_NN by_IN doing_VBG something_NN ._.
They_PRP just_RB use_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN effectively_RB ._.
Second_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP much_JJ curiosity_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
For_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, life_NN is_VBZ unexpectable_JJ and_CC there_EX seems_VBZ many_JJ interest_NN things_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP many_JJ wonderful_JJ things_NNS to_TO challange_NN ._.
They_PRP act_VBP as_RB soon_RB as_IN they_PRP think_VBP ._.
Sometimes_RB ,_, not_RB thinkig_NN carefully_RB lead_VBP them_PRP dangerous_JJ but_CC their_PRP$ curiosity_NN make_VB them_PRP have_VB possibilities_NNS to_TO get_VB more_JJR specific_JJ knowlege_NN and_CC find_VB something_NN new_JJ and_CC problems_NNS ._.
Third_NNP ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB responsibility_NN yet_RB ._.
They_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB limit_NN for_IN doing_VBG something_NN and_CC they_PRP also_RB do_VBP not_RB care_VB about_IN their_PRP$ fame_NN of_IN authorities_NNS ._.
They_PRP will_MD act_VB before_IN not_RB thinking_VBG that_IN their_PRP$ action_NN is_VBZ good_JJ or_CC bad_JJ ._.
When_WRB they_PRP feced_VBD some_DT problems_NNS ,_, they_PRP will_MD notice_VB the_DT importance_NN of_IN responsibility_NN ._.
From_IN these_DT reasons_NNS ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Their_PRP$ free_JJ time_NN ,_, their_PRP$ curiosity_NN ,_, and_CC their_PRP$ irresponsibility_NN ,_, sometimes_RB ,_, connect_VB to_TO their_PRP$ social_JJ experiences_NNS ._.
By_IN enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ life_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD get_VB variety_NN of_IN knowlede_NN ,_, experiences_NNS ,_, and_CC moral_JJ and_CC then_RB they_PRP grow_VBP up_RP to_TO adaluts_NNS ._.
