Whether_IN one_CD enjoys_VBZ or_CC not_RB ,_, depends_VBZ mostly_RB on_IN the_DT individuals_NNS definition_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN ._.
If_IN a_DT person_NN finds_VBZ one_CD work_NN interesting_JJ ,_, he/she_NN will_MD drive_VB immense_JJ enjoyment_NN in_IN doing_VBG it_PRP ,_, even_RB though_IN the_DT same_JJ job_NN might_MD appear_VB extremely_RB drab_JJ to_TO another_DT person_NN ._.
In_IN order_NN to_TO do_VB justice_NN to_TO the_DT statement_NN made_VBN here_RB ,_, we_PRP need_VBP to_TO understand_VB how_WRB the_DT preferences_NNS of_IN young_JJ and_CC old_JJ people_NNS differ_VBP in_IN terms_NNS of_IN their_PRP$ activities_NNS ._.
This_DT statement_NN seems_VBZ to_TO be_VB written_VBN by_IN a_DT young_JJ person_NN who_WP feels_VBZ that_IN his/her_JJR present_JJ pursuits_NNS of_IN vibrant_JJ physical_JJ activities_NNS ,_, adventures_NNS and_CC long_JJ vacations_NNS spent_VBN in_IN travelling_VBG to_TO exciting_JJ destinations_NNS are_VBP his_PRP$ sole_JJ source_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN ._.
Because_IN he_PRP feels_VBZ that_IN he_PRP might_MD not_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO do_VB these_DT things_NNS in_IN advanced_JJ age_NN ,_, older_JJR age_NN might_MD be_VB boring_JJ in_IN all_DT respects_NNS ._.
However_RB looking_VBG from_IN the_DT perspective_NN of_IN an_DT old_JJ person_NN ,_, having_VBG lived_VBN his/her_JJR younger_JJR life_NN in_IN constant_JJ activity_NN ,_, lot_NN more_JJR enjoyment_NN is_VBZ found_VBN in_IN doing_VBG the_DT other_JJ kind_NN of_IN things_NNS ._.
These_DT can_MD be_VB small_JJ little_JJ things_NNS like_IN reading_VBG books_NNS ,_, soaking_VBG sun_NN in_IN the_DT garden_NN ,_, gardening_NN ,_, playing_VBG with_IN children_NNS and_CC the_DT like_JJ ._.
We_PRP need_VBP to_TO understand_VB here_RB that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB that_IN they_PRP have_VBP to_TO do_VB this_DT ,_, but_CC because_IN they_PRP choose_VBP to_TO do_VB this_DT which_WDT in_IN turn_NN is_VBZ simply_RB because_IN they_PRP enjoy_VBP doing_VBG it_PRP ._.
I_PRP am_VBP not_RB generalising_VBG all_PDT the_DT elder_JJR people_NNS as_IN dormant_JJ personalities_NNS who_WP indulge_VBP in_IN less_JJR physical_JJ activities_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP cases_NNS that_WDT one_CD comes_VBZ across_IN in_IN which_WDT people_NNS in_IN old_JJ age_NN resolve_NN to_TO do_VB something_NN very_RB demanding_VBG in_IN physical_JJ terms_NNS just_RB because_IN they_PRP could_MD not_RB do_VB it_PRP when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD younger_JJR ,_, and_CC they_PRP feel_VBP that_IN doing_VBG it_PRP would_MD bring_VB them_PRP lot_NN of_IN satisfaction_NN and_CC enjoyment_NN ._.
Thereby_RB we_PRP have_VBP stories_NNS of_IN some_DT 60-70_CD year_NN old_JJ trying_VBG their_PRP$ hands_NNS at_IN trekking_VBG or_CC a_DT cross-country_JJ run_NN ._.
I_PRP agree_VBP that_IN there_EX can_MD be_VB cases_NNS where_WRB a_DT person_NN might_MD become_VB physically_RB unfit_JJ to_TO take_VB up_RP an_DT activity_NN that_IN he_PRP would_MD really_RB want_VB to_TO ._.
This_DT might_MD happen_VB more_RBR often_RB in_IN old_JJ age_NN ,_, but_CC we_PRP need_MD not_RB forget_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP not_RB completely_RB excluded_VBN from_IN that_DT ._.
There_EX can_MD be_VB cases_NNS where_WRB people_NNS in_IN young_JJ age_NN are_VBP incapacitated_VBN in_IN various_JJ aspects_NNS as_RB well_RB ._.
But_CC even_RB in_IN such_JJ cases_NNS one_CD will_MD surely_RB engage_VB oneself_NN in_IN some_DT activity_NN that_WDT he/she_VBP might_MD eventually_RB end_VB up_RP enjoying_VBG a_DT lot_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ apt_JJ to_TO mention_VB here_RB that_IN enjoyment_NN emanates_VBZ from_IN an_DT initial_JJ emotion_NN of_IN accomplishment_NN ._.
When_WRB one_CD feels_VBZ having_VBG made_VBN an_DT accomplishment_NN in_IN any_DT field_NN ,_, he/she_NN starts_VBZ `_`` enjoying_VBG '_'' it_PRP ._.
To_TO conclude_VB ,_, I_PRP wish_VBP to_TO reiterate_VB that_IN enjoyment_NN and_CC happiness_NN are_VBP a_DT state_NN of_IN mind_NN and_CC matter_NN of_IN personal_JJ choice_NN rather_RB than_IN absolute_JJ entities_NNS ._.
Hence_RB to_TO say_VB that_IN criterion_NN of_IN age_NN ,_, sex_NN ,_, education_NN ,_, opportunities_NNS and_CC the_DT like_JJ will_MD bar_VB someone_NN from_IN `_`` enjoying_VBG '_'' ,_, is_VBZ not_RB correct_VB ._.
