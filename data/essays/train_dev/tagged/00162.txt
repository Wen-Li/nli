I_PRP do_VBP not_RB feel_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_IN I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN they_PRP are_VBP also_RB humans_NNS ans_IN every_DT human_JJ enjoy_VB 's_POS his_PRP$ life_NN to_TO fullest_JJS and_CC to_TO the_DT best_JJS of_IN his_PRP$ capacity_NN ._.
Even_RB though_IN there_EX idea_NN or_CC way_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN is_VBZ different_JJ ._.
We_PRP should_MD also_RB not_RB forget_VB that_IN these_DT old_JJ people_NNS were_VBD also_RB young_JJ someday_RB so_IN they_PRP know_VBP much_RB better_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS the_DT defination_NN of_IN ``_`` Enjoying_VBG ._. ''_''
I_PRP do_VBP not_RB feel_VB that_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN less_RBR this_DT is_VBZ because_IN being_VBG a_DT human_JJ they_PRP always_RB have_VBP a_DT desire_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN ._.
There_EX may_MD be_VB the_DT case_NN that_IN there_EX ways_NNS of_IN enjoyment_NN is_VBZ different_JJ as_IN compared_VBN to_TO young_JJ people_NNS because_IN of_IN the_DT constraints_NNS such_JJ as_IN age_NN or_CC physical_JJ disability_NN which_WDT comes_VBZ with_IN age_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN for_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoyment_NN could_MD be_VB doing_VBG mountain_NN climbing_VBG or_CC playing_VBG basket_NN ball_NN but_CC because_IN of_IN age_NN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB able_JJ to_TO do_VB all_PDT these_DT activities_NNS ._.
Instead_RB they_PRP love_VBP to_TO go_VB for_IN a_DT walk_NN or_CC sit_VB with_IN friends_NNS and_CC have_VBP coffee_NN which_WDT young_JJ people_NNS find_VBP boring_JJ ._.
This_DT made_VBD them_PRP think_VB that_IN old_JJ people_NNS dont_VBP know_VB enjoyment_NN ._.
They_PRP tend_VBP to_TO forget_VB that_IN these_DT old_JJ people_NNS were_VBD also_RB young_JJ and_CC have_VBP done_VBN all_PDT these_DT activities_NNS ._.
Secondally_RB ,_, I_PRP feel_VBP this_DT because_IN older_JJR people_NNS also_RB have_VBP various_JJ responsibilities_NNS toward_IN their_PRP$ work_NN and_CC families_NNS and_CC being_VBG old_JJ society_NN also_RB expects_VBZ that_IN them_PRP to_TO be_VB responsible_JJ for_IN their_PRP$ actions_NNS but_CC young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP generally_RB away_RB from_IN these_DT tension_NN ._.
Even_RB then_RB we_PRP find_VBP older_JJR people_NNS laughing_VBG and_CC always_RB present_JJ and_CC supporting_VBG these_DT young_JJ generation_NN ._.
Thirdly_RB ,_, Older_JJR people_NNS with_IN their_PRP$ experience_NN and_CC intelligence_NN which_WDT grows_VBZ with_IN time_NN know_VBP the_DT proper_JJ defination_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN ._.
It_PRP does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB trying_VBG out_IN risky_JJ acts_NNS such_JJ as_IN driving_VBG a_DT bike_NN at_IN high_JJ speed_NN or_CC keeping_VBG your_PRP$ both_DT hands_NNS free_JJ ,_, which_WDT younger_JJR generation_NN find_VB the_DT idea_NN of_IN real_JJ fun_NN ._.
Instead_RB they_PRP know_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ a_DT shear_NN stupidity_NN and_CC not_RB fun_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN you_PRP will_MD find_VB older_JJR people_NNS driving_VBG slowly_RB and_CC listening_VBG to_TO a_DT romantic_JJ music_NN with_IN their_PRP$ better_JJR halfs_NNS in_IN side_NN or_CC you_PRP will_MD also_RB see_VB them_PRP with_IN their_PRP$ grand_JJ children_NNS and_CC singing_VBG a_DT famous_JJ nursery_NN rhyme_NN ._.
At_IN last_JJ ,_, I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO conclude_VB it_PRP as_IN that_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS find_VBP their_PRP$ happiness_NN or_CC they_PRP enjoy_VBP when_WRB their_PRP$ family_NN is_VBZ happy_JJ ,_, when_WRB these_DT younger_JJR people_NNS are_VBP happy_JJ ._.
So_RB ,_, it_PRP would_MD be_VB very_RB wrong_JJ on_IN anybody_NN 's_POS part_NN to_TO say_VB that_IN ``_`` young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ''_'' instead_RB it_PRP should_MD be_VB said_VBD that_DT ''_'' Older_JJR people_NNS make_VBP younger_JJR people_NNS to_TO enjoy._VB ``_`` because_IN all_PDT the_DT tensions_NNS of_IN life_NN are_VBP taken_VBN by_IN them_PRP and_CC the_DT younger_JJR people_NNS are_VBP left_VBN free_JJ of_IN all_DT problems_NNS ._.
