I_PRP do_VBP agree_VB with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN ``_`` Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ''_'' ._.
I_PRP have_VBP several_JJ reasons_NNS to_TO support_VB my_PRP$ argument_NN but_CC it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB easy_JJ to_TO make_VB an_DT accurate_JJ decision_NN because_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN means_VBZ different_JJ person_NN by_IN person_NN ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS usually_RB have_VBP more_RBR free_JJ time_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Because_IN of_IN the_DT fact_NN that_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP a_DT job_NN and_CC have_VBP a_DT family_NN to_TO support_VB ,_, younger_JJR people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO have_VB more_JJR free_JJ time_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP usually_RB refered_VBN as_IN children_NNS ,_, students_NNS and_CC adult_NN who_WP is_VBZ not_RB married_VBN yet_RB ._.
They_PRP have_VBP planty_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO do_VB exciting_JJ activities_NNS and_CC enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lifes_NNS with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS need_VBP to_TO go_VB to_TO work_VB and_CC feed_VB the_DT family_NN ._.
They_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB time_NN to_TO do_VB exciting_JJ activities_NNS because_IN their_PRP$ tired_JJ body_NN need_VBP a_DT rest_NN during_IN holidays_NNS and_CC weekends_NNS ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP healthier_JJR body_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Younger_JJR people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR eligible_JJ to_TO do_VB various_JJ activities_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Such_JJ as_IN sports_NNS that_WDT needs_VBZ a_DT lot_NN of_IN physical_JJ ability_NN like_IN rock_NN climbing_NN and_CC weight_NN lifting_NN ._.
Although_IN if_IN older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP experienced_VBN in_IN those_DT activities_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD do_VB it_PRP but_CC it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB that_IN common_JJ ._.
When_WRB young_JJ people_NNS can_MD start_VB any_DT kind_NN of_IN activities_NNS ,_, old_JJ people_NNS need_VBP to_TO measure_VB their_PRP$ ability_NN otherwise_RB they_PRP might_MD get_VB injured_VBN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD also_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
If_IN they_PRP are_VBP financially_RB free_JJ after_IN the_DT retirement_NN ,_, they_PRP will_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Such_JJ as_IN crusing_VBG around_IN the_DT world_NN ,_, travel_NN to_TO the_DT unknown_JJ countries_NNS and_CC living_VBG in_IN a_DT beautiful_JJ place_NN ._.
This_DT is_VBZ something_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB do_VB because_IN they_PRP need_VBP to_TO work_VB ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN both_CC young_JJ and_CC old_JJ people_NNS can_MD achieve_VB joyfuol_NN life_NN ._.
