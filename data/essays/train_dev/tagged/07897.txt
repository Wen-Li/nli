I_PRP agree_VBP to_TO the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB do_VBP not_RB care_VB much_JJ about_IN their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
The_DT change_NN of_IN how_WRB people_NNS think_VBP is_VBZ the_DT major_JJ reason_NN for_IN this_DT problem_NN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, many_JJ youngsters_NNS nowadays_RB spend_VBP much_JJ of_IN their_PRP$ time_NN doing_VBG their_PRP$ own_JJ things_NNS ,_, therefore_RB they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB time_NN to_TO think_VB about_IN their_PRP$ surroundings_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS want_VBP money_NN ,_, so_IN they_PRP spend_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN on_IN doing_VBG jobs_NNS ._.
So_RB ,_, they_PRP leave_VBP home_RB early_RB ,_, and_CC they_PRP come_VBP back_RB home_RB late_JJ ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS today_NN are_VBP becoming_VBG extremely_RB lazy_JJ ._.
They_PRP would_MD rather_RB do_VB something_NN which_WDT they_PRP can_MD be_VB satisfied_VBN in_IN the_DT short-term_JJ ,_, rather_RB than_IN the_DT long-term_JJ ._.
There_EX are_VBP many_JJ homes_NNS today_NN with_IN television_NN and_CC computers_NNS ,_, so_RB young_JJ people_NNS stay_VBP in_IN their_PRP$ homes_NNS reffering_VBG to_TO watch_VB television_NN than_IN help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
These_DT new_JJ technologies_NNS keep_VBP the_DT young_JJ people_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ homes_NNS ._.
Finally_RB ,_, the_DT new_JJ generation_NN of_IN people_NNS are_VBP selfish_JJ ._.
They_PRP would_MD not_RB volunteer_VB to_TO do_VB anything_NN if_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB recieve_VB something_NN ._.
Even_RB at_IN schools_NNS ,_, a_DT child_NN would_MD not_RB help_VB teachers_NNS move_VB books_NNS unless_IN they_PRP get_VBP a_DT candy_NN ._.
A_DT young_JJ teenager_NN would_MD not_RB do_VB chores_NNS if_IN he_PRP does_VBZ not_RB get_VB an_DT allowance_NN ._.
Overall_RB ,_, young_JJ men_NNS and_CC women_NNS today_NN must_MD be_VB satisfied_VBN with_IN themselves_PRP before_IN thinking_VBG of_IN others_NNS ._.
It_PRP will_MD take_VB a_DT fortune_NN to_TO be_VB satisfied_VBN with_IN oneself_NN ,_, so_RB eventually_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS will_MD end_VB up_RP doing_VBG nothing_NN to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
