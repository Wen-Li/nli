I_PRP dont_VBP agree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Enjoyment_NN and_CC happieness_NN doesnt_JJ stop_NN at_IN defenite_JJ age_NN ._.
It_PRP depend_VBP on_IN many_JJ other_JJ factors_NNS which_WDT are_VBP more_RBR important_JJ than_IN the_DT age_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ not_RB nescessary_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS more_JJR than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS for_IN many_JJ reasons_NNS ._.
We_PRP can_MD find_VB many_JJ old_JJ people_NNS who_WP enjoy_VBP thier_JJR lives_NNS by_IN different_JJ ways_NNS for_IN example_NN ,_, if_IN we_PRP will_MD see_VB the_DT travellers_NNS to_TO any_DT country_NN ,_, we_PRP can_MD find_VB that_IN lots_NNS of_IN travellers_NNS rare_JJ not_RB young_JJ people_NNS ._.
On_IN other_JJ hand_NN ,_, there_EX are_VBP many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS who_WP dont_VBP enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS as_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
So_RB enjoyment_NN mainly_RB depends_VBZ on_IN the_DT person_NN himself_PRP so_RB if_IN he_PRP /_: she_PRP someone_NN who_WP like_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB his_PRP$ life_NN and_CC has_VBZ many_JJ interesting_JJ things_NNS to_TO do_VB in_IN his_PRP$ /_: her_PRP$ life_NN ,_, nothing_NN can_MD prevent_VB that_IN to_TO occurs_VBZ even_RB if_IN the_DT person_NN was_VBD old_JJ ._.
Some_DT old_JJ people_NNS live_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS as_IN young_JJ people_NNS and_CC some_DT young_JJ people_NNS live_VBP thier_JJR lives_NNS as_IN old_JJ people_NNS for_IN example_NN ,_, there_EX are_VBP some_DT youngs_NNS who_WP dont_VBP enjoy_VB thier_JJR times_NNS and_CC dont_NN like_IN advantures_NNS or_CC to_TO try_VB new_JJ things_NNS they_PRP seem_VBP to_TO be_VB as_IN complex_JJ people_NNS ._.
On_IN other_JJ hand_NN Some_DT old_JJ people_NNS they_PRP like_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB thier_JJR lives_NNS so_IN they_PRP do_VBP any_DT thing_NN make_VB them_PRP happy_JJ so_RB when_WRB you_PRP meet_VBP them_PRP you_PRP think_VBP that_IN you_PRP meet_VBP young_JJ people_NNS not_RB old_JJ ones_NNS !_.
Some_DT people_NNS think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN others_NNS because_IN the_DT period_NN of_IN their_PRP$ life_NN is_VBZ the_DT most_RBS exciting_JJ time_NN and_CC full_JJ of_IN playing_VBG and_CC new_JJ experiences_NNS because_IN young_JJ people_NNS like_IN to_TO try_VB any_DT thing_NN new_JJ but_CC certainly_RB this_DT is_VBZ wrong_JJ opinion_NN because_IN old_JJ people_NNS also_RB have_VBP their_PRP$ methods_NNS and_CC ways_NNS that_WDT make_VBP them_PRP enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS for_IN example_NN :_: marriage_NN ,_, money_NN ,_, travel_NN ,_, friends_NNS ,_, ..._:
etc_NN ._.
So_IN the_DT life_NN is_VBZ Enjoya_NNP
