People_NNS can_MD choose_VB between_IN having_VBG broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS and_CC specializing_VBG in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN ._.
Some_DT people_NNS prefer_VBP that_IN studying_VBG broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS because_IN learning_VBG the_DT academic_JJ subject_NN of_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_JJ provides_VBZ narrow_JJ knowledge_NN with_IN people_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP strongly_RB prefer_VBP that_IN studying_VBG the_DT academic_JJ subject_NN of_IN one_CD specific_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS because_IN it_PRP strenthens_VBZ people_NNS 's_POS exciting_JJ studying_VBG environments_NNS and_CC future_JJ occupation_NN needs_VBZ professional_JJ knowledges_NNS in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, I_PRP prefer_VBP that_IN specializing_VBG in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN because_IN it_PRP provides_VBZ people_NNS with_IN exciting_JJ learing_VBG environments_NNS ._.
Learing_VBG many_JJ academic_JJ subject_JJ needs_NNS a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, if_IN some_DT academic_JJ in_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS is_VBZ not_RB interesting_JJ to_TO people_NNS ,_, then_RB the_DT environment_NN discouages_VBZ people_NNS 's_POS studying_VBG ability_NN For_IN example_NN ,_, according_VBG to_TO the_DT study_NN by_IN one_CD of_IN the_DT most_RBS famous_JJ professor_NN Dr._NNP Kim_NNP in_IN Republic_NNP of_IN Korea_NNP ,_, 68.9_CD %_NN of_IN people_NNS like_IN learing_VBG one_CD exciting_JJ academic_JJ subject_NN because_IN it_PRP makes_VBZ people_NNS 's_POS good_JJ studying_VBG circumstances_NNS ._.
In_IN this_DT sense_NN ,_, I_PRP would_MD rather_RB that_IN specializing_VBG in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN because_IN it_PRP strengthens_VBZ people_NNS 's_POS exciting_JJ studying_VBG circumstances_NNS ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, I_PRP would_MD rather_RB studying_VBG the_DT academic_JJ subject_NN of_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN because_IN future_JJ occupation_NN needs_VBZ professional_JJ knowledges_NNS ._.
Our_PRP$ special_JJ occupation_NN in_IN the_DT future_NN is_VBZ generally_RB only_RB one_CD such_JJ as_IN teacher_NN ,_, nurse_NN and_CC doctor_NN ._.
These_DT occupations_NNS have_VBP a_DT special_JJ technique_NN to_TO do_VB their_PRP$ works_NNS ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ case_NN ,_, the_DT computer_NN programmer_NN needs_VBZ special_JJ knowledges_NNS such_JJ as_IN coding_VBG Java_NNP languages_NNS ,_, C_NN languages_NNS and_CC C++_NNP language_NN ._.
These_DT knowledge_NN can_MD aquire_VB efficiently_RB only_RB in_IN computer_NN science_NN academic_JJ subject_NN ._.
In_IN this_DT sense_NN ,_, I_PRP would_MD rather_RB that_IN learning_VBG the_DT academic_JJ subject_NN of_IN one_CD specific_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS because_IN future_JJ occupation_NN needs_VBZ professional_JJ knowledges_NNS in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP definitely_RB prefer_VBP that_IN specializing_VBG in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN because_IN it_PRP intensifies_VBZ people_NNS 's_POS exciting_JJ studying_VBG environments_NNS and_CC future_JJ occupation_NN needs_VBZ professional_JJ knowledges_NNS in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN ._.
