i_LS agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN which_WDT successful_JJ people_NNS try_VBP new_JJ things_NNS and_CC take_VB rishks_NNS rather_RB than_IN only_RB doing_VBG what_WP they_PRP already_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO do_VB well_RB ._.
Generally_RB ,_, the_DT people_NNS doing_VBG what_WP they_PRP already_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO do_VB will_MD not_RB work_VB hard_RB on_IN their_PRP$ things_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, the_DT people_NNS trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS and_CC take_VB risks_NNS may_MD reach_VB success_NN easily_RB ._.
In_IN the_DT risking_VBG and_CC trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS ,_, they_PRP might_MD advantage_VB in_IN opportunity_NN and_CC knowledge_NN ._.
Trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS means_VBZ having_VBG more_RBR opportunities_NNS ,_, beacause_NN you_PRP can_MD find_VB more_JJR accesses_NNS to_TO accomplish_VB the_DT thing_NN that_IN you_PRP try_VBP ._.
Once_RB you_PRP begin_VB with_IN a_DT one_CD subject_NN ,_, you_PRP will_MD be_VB surprised_VBN with_IN what_WP it_PRP looks_VBZ like_IN and_CC try_VB to_TO know_VB more_JJR about_IN it_PRP ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, you_PRP are_VBP having_VBG a_DT toefl_NN test_NN ._.
In_IN this_DT test_NN ,_, you_PRP do_VBP n't_RB know_VB what_WP is_VBZ the_DT test_NN looks_VBZ like_IN ,_, because_IN you_PRP did_VBD n't_RB take_VB the_DT test_NN before_IN ._.
Hence_RB ,_, you_PRP will_MD meet_VB lots_NNS of_IN difficulties_NNS in_IN this_DT test_NN which_WDT you_PRP do_VBP n't_RB predict_VB ahead_RB ._.
And_CC several_JJ good_JJ opportunities_NNS are_VBP given_VBN ,_, and_CC you_PRP have_VBP to_TO overcome_VB them_PRP one_CD by_IN one_CD ._.
Since_IN that_DT ,_, you_PRP will_MD know_VB what_WP you_PRP will_MD do_VB on_IN next_JJ time_NN ._.
That_DT can_MD be_VB helpful_JJ for_IN being_VBG success_NN ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, knowledgy_NN can_MD be_VB a_DT assistance_NN who_WP can_MD you_PRP to_TO be_VB success_NN ._.
But_CC first_RB of_IN all_DT ,_, how_WRB can_MD we_PRP get_VB knowledge_NN ?_.
The_DT answer_NN is_VBZ simple_JJ as_IN taking_VBG risks_NNS ._.
In_IN any_DT knid_NN of_IN risks_NNS ,_, you_PRP must_MD learn_VB some_DT skills_NNS to_TO survive_VB ._.
In_IN this_DT process_NN ,_, your_PRP$ knowledge_NN is_VBZ gained_VBN and_CC you_PRP are_VBP more_RBR approaching_VBG to_TO success_NN ._.
If_IN you_PRP doing_VBG what_WP you_PRP already_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO do_VB ,_, then_RB you_PRP will_MD lose_VB the_DT interest_NN in_IN the_DT thing_NN that_IN you_PRP are_VBP doing_VBG ._.
So_IN you_PRP wo_MD n't_RB put_VB many_JJ affords_NNS on_IN that_DT subject_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, you_PRP probably_RB fall_VBP asleep_RB in_IN the_DT math_NN class_NN which_WDT you_PRP have_VBP taken_VBN five_CD times_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, the_DT statemen_NN is_VBZ t_NN
