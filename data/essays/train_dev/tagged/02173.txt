Do_VB the_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ?_.
My_PRP$ answer_NN is_VBZ exactly_RB no_DT beacuse_NN of_IN two_CD reasons_NNS ;_:
One_CD of_IN the_DT reasons_NNS is_VBZ that_IN the_DT life_NN is_VBZ so_RB hard_JJ to_TO understand_VB to_TO young_JJ people_NNS because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ lack_NN of_IN experiment_NN and_CC education_NN ._.
And_CC the_DT understanding_VBG the_DT life_NN can_MD raise_VB the_DT taste_NN that_IN you_PRP take_VBP from_IN it_PRP ._.
The_DT other_JJ reasons_NNS is_VBZ that_IN you_PRP can_MD know_VB about_IN yourself_PRP much_RB when_WRB you_PRP get_VBP older_JJR ,_, and_CC if_IN a_DT person_NN knows_VBZ about_IN himself/herself_NN enough_RB ,_, this_DT maturity_NN gives_VBZ him/her_NN a_DT chance_NN to_TO rule_VB on_IN him/her_JJR life_NN in_IN a_DT more_RBR correct_JJ way_NN ,_, so_IN they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT others_NNS ._.
Knowledge_NN about_IN life_NN and_CC about_IN ourselves_PRP ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN they_PRP are_VBP the_DT keys_NNS of_IN happinies_NNS ._.
Socrat_NNP ,_, the_DT famous_JJ greek_JJ philosopher_NN ,_, says_VBZ that_IN ``_`` know_VB him/herself_NN ''_'' ._.
I_PRP think_VBP this_DT advise_VBP is_VBZ explain_VB the_DT most_RBS important_JJ thing_NN in_IN humans_NNS life_NN ._.
