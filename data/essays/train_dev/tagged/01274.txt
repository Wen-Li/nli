Will_MD there_RB be_VB fewer_JJR cars_NNS in_IN use_NN than_IN there_EX are_VBP today_NN ?_.
I_PRP agree_VBP so_RB insofar_RB as_IN with_IN the_DT rapidly_RB development_NN of_IN new_JJ technology_NN which_WDT could_MD reshape_VB the_DT way_NN people_NNS live_VBP the_DT life_NN and_CC people_NNS communicate_VBP with_IN each_DT other_JJ ._.
However_RB ,_, in_IN thougfull_JJ consideration_NN ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN there_EX will_MD increase_VB more_RBR cars_NNS than_IN there_EX are_VBP today_NN concerning_VBG with_IN the_DT increasing_VBG wealth_NN of_IN individuls_NNS and_CC the_DT seperation_NN between_IN working_VBG area_NN and_CC living_VBG area_NN ._.
Admittedly_RB ,_, with_IN the_DT complete_JJ development_NN of_IN public_JJ transportation_NN system_NN such_JJ as_IN the_DT development_NN of_IN underground_JJ transportation_NN ,_, the_DT system_NN will_MD obtain_VB larger_JJR capacity_NN ,_, which_WDT would_MD be_VB a_DT replacement_NN to_TO the_DT use_NN of_IN cars_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, according_VBG to_TO statistically_RB survey_VB ,_, there_EX is_VBZ also_RB increase_VB in_IN population_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, the_DT development_NN of_IN Internet_NN will_MD reshape_VB the_DT way_NN people_NNS communicate_VBP with_IN each_DT other_JJ ,_, which_WDT mean_VBP that_IN people_NNS have_VBP not_RB have_VB to_TO commuincate_JJ wiht_NN each_DT other_JJ through_IN public_JJ transportation_NN ,_, however_RB ,_, it_PRP does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB that_IN people_NNS will_MD replace_VB traditional_JJ way_NN of_IN communicating_VBG ._.
Some_DT important_JJ conferences_NNS must_MD be_VB held_VBN face_NN -_: to-face_NN ._.
Futhermore_RB ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN there_EX will_MD be_VB a_DT increase_NN in_IN cars_NNS due_JJ to_TO the_DT increasing_VBG wealth_NN of_IN individuls_NNS ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ human_JJ natural_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT achievement_NN of_IN wealth_NN ,_, so_RB ,_, in_IN this_DT case_NN ,_, people_NNS will_MD intend_VB to_TO buy_VB some_DT staff_NN such_JJ as_IN cars_NNS to_TO encourage_VB themselves_PRP ._.
The_DT second_JJ reason_NN why_WRB I_PRP think_VBP that_IN cars_NNS will_MD be_VB increase_NN is_VBZ involved_VBN in_IN the_DT seperation_NN between_IN the_DT working_VBG area_NN and_CC living_VBG area_NN ._.
Assuming_VBG the_DT case_NN that_IN you_PRP live_VBP in_IN a_DT town_NN nearby_RB the_DT city_NN and_CC there_EX is_VBZ no_DT other_JJ transportation_NN tools_NNS like_IN subway_NN or_CC buses_NNS ._.
You_PRP have_VBP to_TO buy_VB an_DT cars_NNS in_IN order_NN to_TO arrive_VB the_DT place_NN you_PRP work_VBP on_IN time_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN with_IN developement_NN of_IN new_JJ technology_NN ,_, it_PRP will_MD allievate_VB the_DT pressure_NN on_IN trasportation_NN ,_, However_RB ,_, cars_NNS will_MD continue_VB to_TO increase_VB becasue_NN of_IN the_DT spout_VBP of_IN population_NN ,_, increase_NN in_IN wealth_NN and_CC the_DT seperation_NN between_IN working_VBG area_NN and_CC living_VBG area_NN
