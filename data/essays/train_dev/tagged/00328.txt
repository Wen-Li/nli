People_NNS come_VBP to_TO life_NN once_RB so_IN they_PRP might_MD as_RB well_RB enjoy_VB it_PRP as_IN they_PRP live_VBP it_PRP ._.
Both_CC the_DT young_JJ and_CC the_DT old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN ._.
Some_DT assume_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, in_IN the_DT contrary_NN ,_, some_DT people_NNS think_VBP that_IN old_JJ people_NNS would_MD enjoy_VB it_PRP more_JJR than_IN the_DT younger_JJR people_NNS as_IN the_DT time_NN passes_VBZ ._.
I_PRP totally_RB agree_VBP with_IN the_DT first_JJ idea_NN ._.
I_PRP think_VBP young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN a_DT lot_NN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO have_VB fitter_JJR body_NN ._.
Many_JJ of_IN the_DT activities_NNS that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP such_JJ as_IN to_TO go_VB to_TO clubs_NNS ,_, dance_NN like_IN crazy_JJ or_CC ride_VB a_DT horse_NN can_MD not_RB be_VB done_VBN with_IN an_DT unfit_JJ body_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN when_WRB I_PRP make_VBP a_DT tennis_NN match_NN with_IN my_PRP$ mother_NN ,_, she_PRP gives_VBZ up_RP after_IN sometime_RB ._.
I_PRP definitely_RB beat_VBD her_PRP in_IN every_DT match_NN because_IN she_PRP does_VBZ n't_RB have_VB that_DT much_JJ energy_NN ._.
In_IN addition_NN to_TO this_DT ,_, younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP have_VB healthier_JJR bodies_NNS ._.
They_PRP can_MD drink_VB and_CC eat_VB without_IN counting_VBG the_DT calories_NNS ._.
They_PRP do_VBP n't_RB have_VB to_TO think_VB what_WP would_MD be_VB bad_JJ for_IN their_PRP$ calosterol_NN or_CC heart_NN conditions_NNS ._.
Hence_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS would_MD be_VB able_JJ to_TO go_VB any_DT restaurant_NN or_CC cafe_NN ,_, and_CC enjoy_VB the_DT terrific_JJ part_NN of_IN life_NN which_WDT is_VBZ composed_VBN of_IN eating_NN and_CC drinking_NN ._.
The_DT last_JJ but_CC not_RB least_JJS ,_, since_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP n't_RB experienced_VBN many_JJ things_NNS in_IN life_NN ,_, they_PRP try_VBP new_JJ staff_NN all_PDT the_DT time_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN I_PRP have_VBP n't_RB done_VBN bungee-jumping_NN before_IN or_CC have_VBP n't_RB visited_VBN Japan_NNP ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN by_IN doing_VBG new_JJ and_CC exciting_JJ things_NNS whereas_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP nothing_NN great_JJ to_TO do_VB anymore_RB in_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
Besides_IN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO do_VB more_JJR dangerous_JJ things_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
That_DT 's_VBZ because_RB as_IN a_DT person_NN gets_VBZ older_JJR ,_, he_PRP or_CC she_PRP starts_VBZ to_TO think_VB of_IN dying_VBG ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP n't_RB want_VB to_TO die_VB therefore_RB they_PRP would_MD n't_RB try_VB all_PDT the_DT fun_NN things_NNS in_IN life_NN which_WDT are_VBP most_RBS of_IN the_DT time_NN more_RBR dangerous_JJ than_IN the_DT other_JJ things_NNS ._.
All_DT in_IN all_DT ,_, as_IN I_PRP said_VBD before_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_IN not_RB only_RB they_PRP have_VBP fitter_RBR and_CC healthier_RBR bodies_NNS but_CC also_RB they_PRP have_VBP the_DT courage_NN to_TO try_VB new_JJ things_NNS and_CC they_PRP do_VBP so_RB ._.
The_DT long_JJ and_CC short_JJ of_IN it_PRP all_DT ,_, although_IN I_PRP would_MD like_VB the_DT older_JJR people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ remaining_VBG time_NN as_IN much_JJ as_IN the_DT young_JJ generation_NN ,_, they_PRP do_VBP n't_RB enjoy_VB it_PRP and_CC they_PRP ca_MD n't_RB enjoy_VB it_PRP that_WDT much_RB ._.
