Enjoying_VBG life_NN is_VBZ altogether_RB a_DT different_JJ phenomenon_NN taking_VBG into_IN consideration_NN the_DT age_NN of_IN the_DT people_NNS ._.
Most_JJS people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS when_WRB they_PRP are_VBP young_JJ and_CC tend_VB to_TO become_VB more_RBR sober_JJ during_IN their_PRP$ later_JJ lives_NNS ._.
There_EX could_MD be_VB many_JJ reasons_NNS apart_RB from_IN the_DT age_NN factor_NN that_WDT makes_VBZ people_NNS to_TO stop_VB enjoying_VBG life_NN when_WRB they_PRP become_VBP old_JJ ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, I_PRP do_VBP think_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR that_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ._.
The_DT reason_NN for_IN this_DT might_MD be_VB that_IN the_DT people_NNS are_VBP quiet_JJ young_JJ and_CC energetic_JJ and_CC hence_RB tend_VB to_TO explore_VB more_JJR things_NNS in_IN this_DT world_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS generally_RB like_IN to_TO travel_VB around_RB and_CC see_VB the_DT places_NNS they_PRP have_VBP not_RB visited_VBN before_IN ._.
Not_RB only_RB with_IN the_DT family_NN but_CC also_RB with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ._.
Hence_RB those_DT tours_NNS are_VBP meant_VBN for_IN the_DT enjoyment_NN they_PRP can_MD derive_VB being_VBG with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ._.
Whereas_IN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP not_RB involve_VB in_IN such_JJ activities_NNS because_IN they_PRP may_MD have_VB more_RBR responsibilities_NNS on_IN their_PRP$ shoulders_NNS which_WDT the_DT young_JJ people_NNS may_MD not_RB have_VB ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, when_WRB people_NNS become_VBP old_JJ ,_, they_PRP tend_VBP to_TO think_VB more_JJR about_IN their_PRP$ offsprings_NNS rather_RB than_IN themselves_PRP ._.
And_CC also_RB the_DT fact_NN that_IN the_DT people_NNS like_IN to_TO look_VB after_IN their_PRP$ grandchildren_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ later_JJ parts_NNS of_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS might_MD deter_VB people_NNS from_IN enjoying_VBG ._.
Whereas_IN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS when_WRB they_PRP join_VBP their_PRP$ colleges_NNS ,_, meet_VBP with_IN new_JJ friends_NNS and_CC tend_VB to_TO learn_VB something_NN from_IN their_PRP$ new_JJ lives_NNS ._.
This_DT will_MD make_VB them_PRP to_TO explore_VB new_JJ things_NNS and_CC enjoy_VB a_DT little_JJ better_JJR ._.
Apart_RB from_IN all_DT these_DT factors_NNS ,_, the_DT most_RBS important_JJ factor_NN is_VBZ that_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP being_VBG discarded_VBN by_IN their_PRP$ children_NNS and_CC being_VBG kept_VBN in_IN the_DT old_JJ age_NN homes_NNS where_WRB they_PRP have_VBP very_RB little_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
Youngsters_NNS ,_, meanwhile_RB enjoy_VB a_DT lot_NN by_IN partying_VBG ,_, dancing_NN and_CC hanging_VBG out_RP with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ._.
To_TO summarize_VB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS like_IN to_TO relax_VB in_IN their_PRP$ later_JJ parts_NNS of_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
They_PRP would_MD have_VB also_RB enjoyed_VBN when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ ._.
Perhaps_RB ,_, this_DT might_MD be_VB the_DT reason_NN ,_, apart_RB from_IN the_DT energy_NN factor_NN that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS more_JJR than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
