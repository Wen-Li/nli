Young_JJ people_NNS seemed_VBD have_VBP everything_NN becouse_NN they_PRP are_VBP young_JJ and_CC they_PRP have_VBP energy_NN for_IN doing_VBG anything_NN ,_, so_IN it_PRP seemed_VBD like_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP finished_VBN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN along_IN thier_JJ age_NN ._.
Also_RB ,_, it_PRP sounds_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP much_RB more_RBR ambitious_JJ than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, in_IN fact_NN ,_, it_PRP must_MD be_VB misunderstand_VBN ._.
It_PRP can_MD not_RB say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS becouse_VBP both_DT ages_NNS have_VBP advantage_NN and_CC disadvantage_NN ,_, also_RB older_JJR people_NNS might_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
First_RB ,_, as_IN I_PRP mentiond_VBD before_RB ,_, an_DT advantadge_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS is_VBZ their_PRP$ age_NN ._.
They_PRP have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN and_CC long_JJ distance_NN for_IN the_DT end_NN of_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ certainly_RB the_DT advantage_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS which_WDT older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB ._.
Howevver_NNP ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB enough_JJ money_NN even_RB if_IN they_PRP had_VBD time_NN and_CC ambitious_JJ for_IN their_PRP$ plan_NN for_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS should_MD not_RB only_RB think_VB about_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN with_IN plans_NNS also_RB need_VBP to_TO work_VB on_IN their_PRP$ job_NN for_IN getting_VBG money_NN ._.
Second_RB ,_, although_IN older_JJR people_NNS actually_RB have_VBP less_JJR time_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, it_PRP means_VBZ that_IN old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP been_VBN working_VBG for_IN getting_VBG money_NN ._.
Hence_RB ,_, they_PRP have_VBP enough_JJ money_NN for_IN enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ plan_NN ._.
They_PRP have_VBP almost_RB same_JJ ambitious_JJ as_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP ._.
Besides_IN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP a_DT great_JJ experience_NN of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN through_IN their_PRP$ working_VBG life_NN ._.
There_EX have_VBP not_RB been_VBN only_RB interesting_JJ experience_NN ,_, also_RB some_DT bad_JJ or_CC miserable_JJ experience_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, it_PRP can_MD be_VB a_DT part_NN of_IN enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ life_NN as_RB well_RB ._.
Here_RB is_VBZ the_DT biggest_JJS diference_NN between_IN young_JJ people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS ._.
So_RB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP enjoying_VBG much_RB more_JJR than_IN youngers_NNS ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, enjoyment_NN of_IN life_NN is_VBZ related_VBN to_TO its_PRP$ age_NN ,_, and_CC I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN ``_`` Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._. ''_''

Both_CC young_JJ and_CC older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP the_DT advantages_NNS and_CC disadvantages_NNS ._.
