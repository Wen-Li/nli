In_IN my_PRP$ eyes_NNS it_PRP is_VBZ wrong_JJ to_TO say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Obviously_RB ,_, one_CD could_MD state_VB the_DT fact_NN younger_JJR people_NNS are_VBP healthier_RBR and_CC that_IN they_PRP still_RB have_VBP to_TO make_VB all_DT their_PRP$ important_JJ choices_NNS in_IN life_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP no_DT regrets_NNS ._.
Furthermore_RB they_PRP can_MD try_VB a_DT vast_JJ range_NN of_IN activities_NNS ._.
Because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ youth_NN and_CC health_NN they_PRP can_MD do_VB various_JJ sports_NNS ,_, learn_VB how_WRB to_TO play_VB muscial_JJ instruments_NNS ,_, travel_NN spontaneously_RB to_TO dangerous_JJ places_NNS and_CC if_IN they_PRP have_VBP not_RB started_VBN working_VBG yet_RB ,_, they_PRP have_VBP a_DT lot_NN less_JJR responabilities_NNS ._.
All_PDT these_DT choices_NNS might_MD be_VB out_IN of_IN reach_NN for_IN older_JJR people_NNS because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ health_NN and_CC social_JJ status_NN ._.
In_IN addition_NN to_TO this_DT older_JJR people_NNS could_MD be_VB in_IN a_DT worse_JJR emotional_JJ state_NN than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ._.
With_IN increasing_VBG responsabilities_NNS such_JJ as_IN bringing_VBG up_RP a_DT family_NN ,_, paying_VBG for_IN their_PRP$ children_NNS 's_POS education_NN ,_, they_PRP are_VBP less_RBR carefree_JJ ._.
Health_NNP issues_NNS ,_, e.g._FW age_NN related_JJ illnesses_NNS such_JJ as_IN Alzheimer_NNP 's_POS or_CC according_VBG to_TO age_NN impending_JJ death_NN can_MD turn_VB life_NN itself_PRP into_IN one_CD long_JJ hardship_NN for_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Also_RB ,_, they_PRP might_MD have_VB lost_VBN a_DT loved_VBN one_CD such_JJ as_IN their_PRP$ spouse_NN or_CC siblings_NNS ._.
But_CC nonetheless_RB one_CD has_VBZ to_TO take_VB into_IN account_NN older_JJR people_NNS 's_POS life_NN experience_NN and_CC what_WP they_PRP are_VBP looking_VBG back_RB on_IN ._.
In_IN the_DT course_NN of_IN their_PRP$ life_NN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP experienced_VBN all_DT kinds_NNS of_IN emotions_NNS and_CC things_NNS that_WDT turned_VBD them_PRP into_IN the_DT person_NN they_PRP are_VBP ._.
This_DT could_MD be_VB a_DT marriage_NN ,_, the_DT birth_NN of_IN a_DT child_NN ,_, the_DT further_JJ extension_NN of_IN their_PRP$ family_NN or_CC a_DT huge_JJ succes_NNS or_CC achievement_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD alsways_RB look_VB back_RB and_CC relive_VB the_DT most_RBS wonderful_JJ moments_NNS of_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ,_, something_NN younger_JJR people_NNS have_VBP yet_RB to_TO experience_VB ._.
And_CC finally_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP in_IN a_DT way_NN the_DT foundation_NN of_IN their_PRP$ family_NN ._.
To_TO know_VB that_IN one_CD is_VBZ appreciated_VBN ,_, needed_VBN and_CC relied_VBN upon_IN is_VBZ something_NN that_WDT makes_VBZ life_NN very_RB special_JJ ._.
