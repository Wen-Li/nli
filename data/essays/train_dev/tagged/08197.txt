Many_JJ people_NNS belive_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ better_JJR to_TO have_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS ,_, whereas_IN others_NNS prefer_VBP specializing_VBG in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN ._.
Both_DT paths_NNS have_VBP several_JJ advantages_NNS and_CC disadvantages_NNS ._.
I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN having_VBG a_DT more_RBR general_JJ knowledge_NN instead_RB of_IN focusing_VBG to_TO one_CD ,_, is_VBZ more_RBR beneficial_JJ ._.
There_EX are_VBP few_JJ advantages_NNS of_IN both_DT scenarios_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, for_IN studying_VBG more_JJR than_IN one_CD subject_NN ,_, you_PRP receive_VBP two_CD diplomas_NNS instead_RB of_IN just_RB one_CD ._.
This_DT could_MD look_VB good_JJ on_IN you_PRP C.V_NNP ._.
However_RB ,_, one_PRP can_MD attend_VB a_DT master_NN program_NN for_IN specialization_NN and_CC receive_VB another_DT diploma_NN which_WDT is_VBZ good_JJ too_RB ._.
Second_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ much_RB more_RBR easier_JJR to_TO study_VB several_JJ subjects_NNS because_IN you_PRP will_MD only_RB learn_VB the_DT primary_JJ things_NNS ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, after_IN you_PRP graduate_VBP ,_, if_IN you_PRP do_VBP n't_RB like_VB one_CD of_IN your_PRP$ academic_JJ subjects_NNS ,_, you_PRP are_VBP free_JJ to_TO choose_VB to_TO make_VB career_NN on_IN the_DT other_JJ branches_NNS you_PRP studied_VBD ._.
Last_JJ ,_, the_DT time_NN required_VBN to_TO complete_VB the_DT program_NN is_VBZ much_JJ shorter_JJR if_IN you_PRP specialize_VBP in_IN one_CD subject_NN ._.
Because_IN it_PRP is_VBZ easier_JJR to_TO learn_VB more_JJR about_IN a_DT subject_JJ you_PRP already_RB know_VBP ._.
However_RB ,_, there_EX some_DT disadvantages_NNS for_IN the_DT two_CD ways_NNS ,_, In_IN specialization_NN approach_NN ,_, you_PRP ca_MD n't_RB change_VB your_PRP$ career_NN if_IN you_PRP do_VBP n't_RB like_VB it_PRP ._.
Once_RB you_PRP graduate_VBP ,_, you_PRP will_MD only_RB have_VB one_CD major_JJ ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, you_PRP will_MD have_VB a_DT narrower_JJR information_NN about_IN life_NN ._.
Because_IN it_PRP prevents_VBZ you_PRP from_IN seeing_VBG other_JJ stuff_NN ._.
In_IN summary_NN ,_, I_PRP believe_VBP it_PRP is_VBZ more_RBR benefi_IN
