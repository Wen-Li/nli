People_NNS ,_, especially_RB students_NNS ,_, often_RB discuss_VBP whether_IN having_VBG some_DT specific_JJ knowledge_NN about_IN one_CD sucject_NN is_VBZ better_JJR than_IN having_VBG broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP strongly_RB believe_VBP that_IN having_VBG broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS is_VBZ more_RBR useful_JJ ._.
This_DT rational_JJ behind_IN this_DT that_IN it_PRP allows_VBZ people_NNS to_TO have_VB more_JJR chance_NN to_TO get_VB a_DT job_NN ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, students_NNS can_MD learn_VB well-balanced_JJ educations_NNS ._.
In_IN Korea_NNP ,_, most_JJS big_JJ companies_NNS want_VBP to_TO recruit_VB someone_NN who_WP has_VBZ broad_JJ knowledge_NN ._.
That_DT is_VBZ because_IN these_DT kinds_NNS of_IN people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR helpful_JJ to_TO them_PRP to_TO make_VB a_DT large_JJ amount_NN of_IN money_NN ._.
As_IN everyone_NN knows_VBZ ,_, as_IN a_DT matter_NN of_IN fact_NN ,_, having_VBG broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ subjects_NNS has_VBZ a_DT disadvatage_NN which_WDT leads_VBZ to_TO shallow_JJ knowledge_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, this_DT advantage_NN can_MD eclipse_VB this_DT disadvantage_NN ._.
From_IN my_PRP$ own_JJ experience_NN ,_, when_WRB i_FW was_VBD a_DT university_NN student_NN ,_, i_FW took_VBD a_DT lot_NN of_IN academic_JJ courses_NNS such_JJ as_IN biology_NN ,_, computer_NN and_CC spanish_NNP ._.
So_RB ,_, I_PRP got_VBD some_DT advantage_NN when_WRB I_PRP got_VBD into_IN my_PRP$ company_NN ,_, SAM-SUNG_NN ._.
On_IN top_NN of_IN that_DT ,_, Students_NNS can_MD get_VB well-balanced_JJ educations_NNS ._.
Basically_RB ,_, the_DT purpose_NN of_IN school_NN is_VBZ educating_VBG their_PRP$ students_NNS about_IN many_JJ subjects_NNS ._.
That_DT is_VBZ because_IN having_VBG specific_JJ knowledge_NN about_IN some_DT courses_NNS is_VBZ like_IN picky_JJ ._.
I_PRP mean_VBP when_WRB children_NNS eat_VBP their_PRP$ meals_NNS ,_, they_PRP usually_RB pick_VBP up_RP what_WP they_PRP want_VBP such_JJ as_IN meat_NN ._.
So_RB ,_, it_PRP leads_VBZ to_TO health_NN problem_NN ,_, obesity_NN ,_, which_WDT causes_VBZ various_JJ health_NN problem_NN ._.
I_PRP bet_VBP that_IN having_VBG specific_JJ knowledge_NN is_VBZ definetly_RB harmful_JJ for_IN their_PRP$ personality_NN or_CC their_PRP$ future_NN ._.
Taking_VBG all_DT of_IN these_DT into_IN account_NN ,_, I_PRP have_VBP no_DT doubt_NN in_IN my_PRP$ mind_NN that_IN having_VBG a_DT lot_NN of_IN knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS is_VBZ helpful_JJ for_IN people_NNS in_IN our_PRP$ future_NN to_TO reach_VB our_PRP$ goals_NNS ._.
