The_DT time_NN passes_VBZ and_CC the_DT life_NN goes_VBZ on_IN ,_, every_DT person_NN in_IN life_NN encountered_VBN with_IN situatins_NNS some_DT are_VBP good_JJ ,_, some_DT are_VBP bad_JJ ._.
However_RB the_DT best_JJS think_NN we_PRP can_MD do_VB is_VBZ enjoying_VBG the_DT ,_, because_IN we_PRP would_MD not_RB live_VB that_DT kind_NN of_IN life_NN again_RB ._.
Since_IN I_PRP realized_VBD that_IN while_IN I_PRP was_VBD growing_VBG everything_NN started_VBD to_TO lose_VB its_PRP$ exiteness_NN ,_, I_PRP would_MD claim_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS would_MD enjoy_VB life_NN than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, since_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP not_RB experinced_VBN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ seen_VBN that_IN most_JJS of_IN the_DT events_NNS are_VBP interesting_JJ ._.
However_RB the_DT old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP experienced_VBN about_IN life_NN and_CC the_DT events_NNS that_WDT cover_VBP it_PRP ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, playing_VBG a_DT car_NN ,_, you_PRP can_MD not_RB do_VB this_DT until_IN you_PRP are_VBP 20_CD ._.
So_RB ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS seems_VBZ that_IN issue_NN more_RBR exiting_VBG and_CC enjoyable_JJ because_IN he_PRP has_VBZ not_RB done_VBN it_PRP yet_RB ._.
However_RB ,_, the_DT older_JJR people_NNS know_VBP how_WRB to_TO drive_VB it_PRP in_IN he_PRP filled_VBD his_PRP$ ego_NN about_IN it_PRP years_NNS ago_RB and_CC find_VB such_JJ and_CC event_NN unexited_JJ ,_, only_RB neccesary_JJ ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR chance_NN to_TO do_VB enjoyable_JJ activities_NNS because_IN their_PRP$ mental_JJ and_CC physical_JJ abilities_NNS are_VBP better_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
These_DT abilities_NNS open_VBP the_DT doors_NNS of_IN enthusiasm_NN to_TO young_JJ people_NNS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS will_MD have_VB a_DT chance_NN to_TO do_VB interesting_JJ activities_NNS but_CC older_JJR may_MD not_RB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS will_MD want_VB to_TO go_VB entertainmant_JJ parks_NNS and_CC they_PRP have_VBP an_DT ability_NN to_TO this_DT ,_, also_RB their_PRP$ hormones_NNS are_VBP ready_JJ to_TO create_VB adrenalin_NN which_WDT makes_VBZ the_DT event_NN enjoyable_JJ ,_, however_RB older_JJR people_NNS may_MD not_RB have_VB ability_NN to_TO do_VB that_DT kind_NN of_IN activitie_NN ._.
Even_RB they_PRP have_VBP ,_, they_PRP would_MD not_RB release_VB adrenalin_NN and_CC the_DT event_NN would_MD not_RB be_VB that_DT kind_NN of_IN thing_NN enjoyable_JJ ._.
Consequently_RB ,_, I_PRP thought_VBD that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS would_MD have_VB more_RBR chance_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS because_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP not_RB experienced_JJ and_CC starved_VBN for_IN the_DT new_JJ issues_NNS to_TO learn_VB and_CC see_VB ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, their_PRP$ mental_JJ and_CC physical_JJ abilities_NNS are_VBP appropriate_JJ for_IN the_DT enjoyable_JJ activities_NNS that_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB ._.
Finally_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ easly_RB seen_VBN that_IN I_PRP do_VBP not_RB want_VB to_TO be_VB older_JJR ._.
