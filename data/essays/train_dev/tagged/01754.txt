No_DT wonder_NN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, in_IN the_DT early_JJ ages_NNS people_NNS can_MD do_VB lots_NNS of_IN things_NNS easily_RB without_IN worring_VBG anything_NN ._.
They_PRP just_RB decide_VB and_CC enjoy_VB what_WP they_PRP do_VBP ._.
I_PRP agree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR chance_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN for_IN the_DT following_VBG reasons_NNS :_: having_VBG less_JJR dependencies_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, and_CC the_DT desire_NN of_IN learning_VBG new_JJ information_NN and_CC having_VBG experience_NN ._.
First_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR dependencies_NNS such_JJ as_IN looking_VBG after_IN someone_NN ,_, the_DT need_NN of_IN earning_VBG money_NN or_CC health_NN issues_NNS -_: obstacles_NNS for_IN travelling_VBG countries_NNS -_: than_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP able_JJ to_TO travel_VB different_JJ countries_NNS easily_RB without_IN thinking_VBG anybody_NN stays_VBZ back_RP like_IN children_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, my_PRP$ parents_NNS have_VBP three_CD children_NNS including_VBG me_PRP ._.
If_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO travel_VB to_TO Spain_NNP during_IN the_DT rest_NN of_IN their_PRP$ time_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD not_RB leave_VB their_PRP$ children_NNS because_IN children_NNS need_VBP to_TO be_VB looked_VBN after_IN ._.
In_IN this_DT case_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS who_WP do_VBP not_RB have_VB any_DT children_NNS can_MD easily_RB go_VB for_IN travelling_VBG ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS usually_RB want_VBP to_TO learn_VB and_CC gain_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN different_JJ kinds_NNS of_IN experience_NN during_IN their_PRP$ early_JJ ages_NNS ._.
I_PRP can_MD remember_VB ,_, when_WRB my_PRP$ brother_NN was_VBD nineteen_CD he_PRP used_VBD to_TO go_VB to_TO music_NN festivals_NNS ,_, theathers_NNS ,_, and_CC travel_VB a_DT lot_NN ._.
Basically_RB ,_, he_PRP enjoyed_VBD a_DT lot_NN because_IN he_PRP had_VBD time_NN ,_, sufficent_JJ amount_NN of_IN money_NN and_CC energy_NN ._.
Also_RB ,_, he_PRP could_MD easily_RB adapt_VB difficult_JJ conditions_NNS whatever_WDT he_PRP faced_VBD with_IN ._.
I_PRP can_MD not_RB imagine_VB that_IN older_JJR people_NNS join_VB a_DT party_NN and_CC a_DT boat_NN trip_NN at_IN the_DT same_JJ day_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS and_CC young_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB be_VB compared_VBN ehether_NN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP the_DT life_NN more_RBR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS or_CC not_RB ._.
So_RB basically_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS should_MD be_VB aware_JJ of_IN their_PRP$ opportunities_NNS in_IN order_NN to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT time_NN ._.
