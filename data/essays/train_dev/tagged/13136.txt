It_PRP is_VBZ a_DT common_JJ notion_NN that_IN older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP in_IN greater_JJR concern_NN about_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ health_NN than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ,_, talk_NN about_IN the_DT ``_`` good_JJ old_JJ times_NNS ''_'' and_CC often_RB seem_VBP to_TO be_VB skeptical_JJ towards_IN changes_NNS in_IN lifestyle_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, this_DT notion_NN is_VBZ only_RB a_DT matter_NN of_IN perspective_NN and_CC can_MD not_RB be_VB generalized_VBN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
In_IN fact_NN ,_, enjoyment_NN of_IN life_NN is_VBZ such_JJ an_DT individual_JJ concept_NN that_WDT is_VBZ impossible_JJ to_TO compare_VB the_DT levels_NNS of_IN enjoyment_NN among_IN different_JJ age_NN groups_NNS ._.
Who_WP could_MD give_VB an_DT general_JJ definition_NN of_IN ``_`` enjoyment_NN ''_'' ,_, let_VB alone_RB some_DT way_NN of_IN measuring_VBG the_DT level_NN of_IN it_PRP ?_.
This_DT ,_, however_RB ,_, would_MD be_VB required_VBN before_IN someone_NN can_MD state_VB a_DT different_JJ level_NN of_IN enjoying_VBG certain_JJ things_NNS ._.
The_DT answer_NN whether_IN there_EX is_VBZ a_DT difference_NN in_IN the_DT elvel_NN of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN between_IN certain_JJ groups_NNS of_IN people_NNS can_MD only_RB be_VB a_DT balanced_JJ one_CD ._.
The_DT perceived_VBN difference_NN in_IN the_DT level_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN lies_VBZ in_IN the_DT different_JJ ways_NNS that_WDT various_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN ._.
A_DT close_JJ look_NN at_IN a_DT typical_JJ family_NN reunion_NN ,_, e.g._FW ,_, Thanksgiving_NNP ,_, where_WRB different_JJ age_NN groups_NNS of_IN one_CD family_NN get_VB together_RB ,_, reveals_VBZ that_IN the_DT difference_NN in_IN perceiving_VBG joy_NN in_IN life_NN may_MD very_RB well_RB be_VB associated_VBN with_IN the_DT age_NN of_IN a_DT certain_JJ person_NN ._.
While_IN the_DT grandparents_NNS may_MD enjoy_VB watching_VBG their_PRP$ grandchildren_NNS play_VBP ,_, younger_JJR members_NNS of_IN the_DT family_NN might_MD need_VB talking_VBG amongst_IN themselves_PRP or_CC some_DT other_JJ activity_NN to_TO be_VB able_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ time_NN ._.
This_DT ,_, of_IN course_NN ,_, can_MD not_RB be_VB generally_RB said_VBD about_IN all_DT families_NNS ,_, but_CC certainly_RB a_DT similar_JJ case_NN can_MD be_VB constructed_VBN from_IN the_DT social_JJ network_NN of_IN almost_RB every_DT individual_NN ._.
Least_VB to_TO say_VB ,_, if_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoyed_VBN life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, should_MD n't_RB there_RB be_VB some_DT statistical_JJ evidence_NN from_IN the_DT social_JJ sciences_NNS to_TO support_VB that_IN claim_NN ?_.
Such_PDT a_DT fact_NN would_MD certainly_RB show_VB in_IN many_JJ observations_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN happiness_NN surveys_NNS ,_, comparisons_NNS of_IN the_DT quality_NN of_IN living_VBG across_IN regions_NNS ,_, or_CC possibly_RB suicide_NN rates_NNS ._.
Yet_CC there_EX is_VBZ no_DT numerical_JJ evidence_NN to_TO support_VB that_IN assertion_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, while_IN someone_NN might_MD perceive_VB a_DT difference_NN that_WDT another_DT person_NN does_VBZ n't_RB enjoy_VB life_NN as_RB much_RB as_IN the_DT observer_NN does_VBZ ,_, the_DT only_JJ difference_NN lies_VBZ in_IN the_DT way_NN the_DT enjoyment_NN is_VBZ felt_VBN ._.
