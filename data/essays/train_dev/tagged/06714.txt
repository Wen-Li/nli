The_DT statement_NN mentioned_VBN here_RB is_VBZ quite_RB an_DT interesting_JJ one_CD and_CC it_PRP holds_VBZ considerable_JJ importance_NN in_IN this_DT modern_JJ era_NN ._.
At_IN first_JJ glance_NN majority_NN of_IN people_NNS will_MD feel_VB that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP n't_RB enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS but_CC if_IN the_DT matter_NN is_VBZ taken_VBN more_RBR seriously_RB then_RB people_NNS will_MD realise_VB that_IN that_DT 's_VBZ not_RB the_DT case_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP the_DT advantage_NN of_IN being_VBG young_JJ ._.
Age_NNP is_VBZ one_CD thing_NN that_WDT 's_VBZ in_IN their_PRP$ favor_NN ._.
Even_RB the_DT older_JJR people_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ younger_JJR days_NNS would_MD have_VB enjoyed_VBN life_NN more_RBR then_RB what_WP they_PRP are_VBP enjoying_VBG now_RB ._.
I_PRP feel_VBP that_IN health_NN is_VBZ an_DT issue_NN to_TO be_VB taken_VBN into_IN consideration_NN ._.
Most_JJS of_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS maintain_VBP better_JJR health_NN then_RB the_DT older_JJR people_NNS and_CC hence_RB they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB more_RBR ._.
I_PRP say_VBP this_DT because_IN I_PRP feel_VBP that_IN it_PRP 's_VBZ not_RB possible_JJ to_TO worry_VB about_IN health_NN issues_NNS and_CC enjoy_VB life_NN at_IN the_DT same_JJ time_NN ._.
I_PRP feel_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR then_RB older_JJR people_NNS because_IN with_IN age_NN comes_VBZ responsibility_NN ._.
As_IN compared_VBN to_TO the_DT older_JJR people_NNS young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP n't_RB have_VB much_JJ responsibility_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP n't_RB have_VB to_TO think_VB of_IN family_NN and_CC jobs_NNS whereas_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP to_TO do_VB that_DT ._.
Stress_NN is_VBZ another_DT factor_NN that_WDT should_MD be_VB taken_VBN into_IN consideration_NN ._.
According_VBG to_TO me_PRP older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR stressed_JJ then_RB younger_JJR people_NNS and_CC that_IN affects_VBZ their_PRP$ overall_JJ outlook_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
I_PRP feel_VBP that_IN a_DT person_NN without_IN stress_NN tends_VBZ to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN more_RBR then_RB a_DT person_NN under_IN stress_NN ._.
I_PRP also_RB feel_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR options_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
I_PRP say_VBP this_DT because_IN I_PRP feel_VBP that_IN health_NN does_VBZ n't_RB really_RB permit_VB old_JJ people_NNS to_TO take_VB part_NN in_IN various_JJ activities_NNS like_IN sports_NNS ._.
So_RB looking_VBG at_IN the_DT points_NNS mentioned_VBN above_IN I_PRP am_VBP confident_JJ to_TO say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR then_RB older_JJR people_NNS and_CC among_IN the_DT various_JJ points_NNS mentioned_VBN above_IN I_PRP feel_VBP that_DT 's_VBZ health_NN is_VBZ something_NN thatreally_RB against_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS is_VBZ their_PRP$ heath_NN ._.
