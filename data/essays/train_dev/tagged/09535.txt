Are_VBP young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO less-cooperative_JJ to_TO their_PRP$ communities_NNS ?_.
At_IN present_JJ ,_, some_DT thinks_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP not_RB helpful_JJ to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
In_IN contrast_NN ,_, some_DT poeple_NN think_VBP that_IN they_PRP are_VBP really_RB helphul_JJ ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, young_JJ poeple_NNS give_VBP enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS because_IN there_EX are_VBP many_JJ projects_NNS for_IN them_PRP ,_, schools_NNS encourage_VBP them_PRP to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, the_DT internet_NN made_VBD it_PRP easy_JJ to_TO get_VB information_NN about_IN their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
It_PRP makes_VBZ them_PRP think_VB they_PRP should_MD help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, I_PRP reckon_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP trying_VBG to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS because_IN I_PRP saw_VBD a_DT lot_NN of_IN projects_NNS for_IN them_PRP in_IN my_PRP$ home_NN towm_NN ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS in_IN my_PRP$ towm_NN clean_JJ up_IN the_DT roads_NNS every_DT weekends_NNS ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ because_IN the_DT city_NN put_VBD information_NN on_IN the_DT city_NN bulletin_NN board_NN ._.
There_EX are_VBP various_JJ kinds_NNS of_IN projects_NNS like_IN that_DT ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO contributing_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS because_IN schools_NNS require_VBP them_PRP to_TO do_VB so_RB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ high_JJ school_NN ,_, it_PRP was_VBD mandatory_JJ to_TO clean_VB the_DT river_NN once_RB a_DT month_NN ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, we_PRP should_MD wrote_VBD letters_NNS to_TO elderies_NNS ,_, visit_VB their_PRP$ homes_NNS and_CC have_VBP a_DT conversation_NN with_IN them_PRP ._.
There_EX are_VBP many_JJ schools_NNS which_WDT do_VBP similar_JJ things_NNS ._.
Consequently_RB ,_, I_PRP consider_VBP young_JJ poeple_NNS spend_VBP much_JJ time_NN to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Thirdly_RB ,_, there_EX are_VBP many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS who_WP are_VBP using_VBG the_DT internet_NN and_CC get_VB information_NN of_IN their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
As_IN a_DT result_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD realize_VB the_DT problems_NNS of_IN their_PRP$ cities_NNS ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ home_NN town_NN ,_, there_EX are_VBP many_JJ students_NNS who_WP are_VBP using_VBG the_DT internet_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD learn_VB about_IN their_PRP$ town_NN easily_RB by_IN it_PRP ._.
One_CD of_IN my_PRP$ friends_NNS said_VBD that_IN he_PRP came_VBD to_TO think_VB a_DT lot_NN about_IN his_PRP$ town_NN ._.
There_EX are_VBP many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS him_PRP in_IN my_PRP$ town_NN ._.
To_TO sum_VB up_RP ,_, I_PRP consider_VBP young_JJ poeple_NNS spend_VBP enough_JJ time_NN to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS because_IN there_EX are_VBP many_JJ events_NNS ,_, schools_NNS require_VBP them_PRP to_TO do_VB so_RB ,_, and_CC they_PRP can_MD
