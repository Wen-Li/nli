In_IN normally_RB ,_, as_IN a_DT nature_NN of_IN fact_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP some_DT different_JJ ideas_NNS and_CC approaches_NNS even_RB to_TO the_DT same_JJ situation_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, I_PRP completely_RB aggree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
This_DT is_VBZ because_IN due_JJ to_TO the_DT following_VBG reasons_NNS ._.
To_TO begin_VB with_IN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP different_JJ attitudes_NNS and_CC experiences_NNS ,_, so_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB expected_VBN to_TO behave_VB similar_JJ against_IN the_DT same_JJ situation_NN ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD try_VB to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN by_IN travelling_VBG ,_, dancing_NN ,_, doing_VBG so_RB many_JJ sport_NN activities_NNS such_JJ as_IN swimming_NN ,_, tracking_NN ,_, skiing_NN and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
However_RB ,_, in_IN general_JJ ,_, older_JJR people_NNS think_VBP to_TO live_VB a_DT more_RBR stable_JJ or_CC routine_JJ life_NN and_CC they_PRP usually_RB do_VBP not_RB want_VB to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN by_IN doing_VBG whatever_WDT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, young_JJ and_CC older_JJR people_NNS of_IN course_NN have_VBP different_JJ metabolism_NN which_WDT means_VBZ their_PRP$ hormones_NNS are_VBP really_RB different_JJ to_TO each_DT others_NNS '_POS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, one_PRP can_MD not_RB usually_RB expect_VBP to_TO someone_NN ,_, age_NN of_IN 75_CD ,_, to_TO make_VB bungee_NN jumping_VBG from_IN a_DT skyscraper_NN but_CC as_IN you_PRP guess_VBP ,_, a_DT young_JJ boy_NN try_VB to_TO feel_VB this_DT adrenalin_NN in_IN his_PRP$ vessels_NNS by_IN jumping_VBG from_IN 250_CD feet_NNS height_NN ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, similar_JJ to_TO these_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP no_DT such_JJ a_DT hard_JJ responsibilities_NNS for_IN their_PRP$ families_NNS or_CC someone_NN around_IN them_PRP ._.
However_RB ,_, many_JJ older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP grandmother_NN and_CC grandfather_NN so_IN they_PRP always_RB have_VBP to_TO think_VB not_RB only_RB themselves_PRP but_CC also_RB their_PRP$ childrens_NNS and_CC grand_JJ children_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, think_VBP a_DT boy_NN ,_, at_IN the_DT age_NN of_IN 15_CD ,_, he/she_NN can_MD go_VB to_TO a_DT holiday_NN for_IN two_CD or_CC three_CD months_NNS with_IN his/her_JJ friends_NNS because_IN if_IN the_DT schools_NNS are_VBP closed_VBN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP a_DT great_JJ time_NN to_TO make_VB whatever_WDT they_PRP want_VBP ,_, but_CC older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP a_DT limited_JJ time_NN to_TO do_VB so_RB ._.
In_IN the_DT ligth_NN of_IN above_JJ discussion_NN ,_, last_JJ but_CC not_RB at_IN least_JJS ,_, I_PRP wish_VBP to_TO conclude_VB by_IN saying_VBG that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS due_JJ to_TO their_PRP$ different_JJ experiences_NNS ,_, different_JJ hormonal_JJ metabolisms_NNS and_CC different_JJ responsibilities_NNS as_RB well_RB ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, as_IN a_DT young_JJ and_CC dynamic_JJ boy_NN ,_, I_PRP try_VBP to_TO do_VB whatever_WDT and_CC whenever_WRB I_PRP want_VBP because_IN I_PRP do_VBP not_RB want_VB to_TO say_VB when_WRB I_PRP am_VBP 65_CD years_NNS old_JJ that_IN I_PRP wish_VBP ._. .._SYM
