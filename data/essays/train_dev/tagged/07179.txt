Although_IN some_DT people_NNS says_VBZ young_JJ people_NNS should_MD not_RB enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP that_IN young_JJ peole_NN enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Because_IN of_IN 2_CD reasons_NNS :_: knouwledge_NN and_CC health_NN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, naturally_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR less_JJR knowledge_NN than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, siociety_NN ,_, some_DT actives_NNS ,_, and_CC many_JJ things_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB young_JJ people_NNS should_MD experience_VB many_JJ things_NNS ._.
But_CC they_PRP sould_VBP n't_RB affraid_VBN to_TO fail_VB ._.
They_PRP should_MD enjoy_VB every_DT new_JJ experiences_NNS ._.
Second_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, generally_RB ,_, most_JJS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP health_NN body_NN ._.
And_CC in_IN future_NN ,_, we_PRP need_VBP to_TO keep_VB our_PRP$ health_NN so_IN people_NNS who_WP can_MD move_VB their_PRP$ body_NN activity_NN -_: young_JJ people_NNS -_: should_MD develop_VB their_PRP$ health_NN ._.
However_RB stress_NN leads_VBZ people_NNS bad_JJ condition_NN so_IN they_PRP should_MD enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
For_IN these_DT reasons_NNS ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
