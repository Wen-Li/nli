With_IN a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN you_PRP can_MD understand_VB the_DT world_NN and_CC with_IN a_DT specialization_NN in_IN a_DT subject_JJ you_PRP may_MD be_VB the_DT most_RBS recurred_VBN person_NN in_IN the_DT whole_JJ world_NN ._.
Which_WDT path_NN should_MD one_CD take_VB ?_.
That_DT 's_VBZ a_DT topic_NN that_IN many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS deal_VBP with_IN ._.
Let_VB 's_PRP discuss_VB some_DT relevant_JJ points_NNS ._.
Having_VBG a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ essential_JJ subjects_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN history_NN ,_, mathematics_NN ,_, biology_NN and_CC language_NN is_VBZ not_RB only_RB important_JJ in_IN order_NN to_TO climb_VB the_DT latter_NN of_IN education_NN but_CC also_RB for_IN the_DT development_NN of_IN one_CD 's_POS ideas_NNS ,_, personality_NN and_CC tolerance_NN towards_IN others_NNS ._.
You_PRP can_MD be_VB able_JJ to_TO understand_VB the_DT world_NN ,_, draw_NN conclusions_NNS and_CC interrelate_VB the_DT different_JJ subjects_NNS ,_, and_CC therefore_RB have_VBP a_DT deeper_JJR and_CC more_RBR coherent_JJ view_NN of_IN things_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, if_IN you_PRP have_VBP learnd_VBN about_IN Darwin_NNP and_CC his_PRP$ theory_NN about_IN the_DT ``_`` survival_NN oh_UH the_DT fittest_JJS ''_'' and_CC have_VB a_DT knowledge_NN in_IN history_NN you_PRP would_MD know_VB how_WRB this_DT biological_JJ theory_NN applies_VBZ in_IN society_NN ,_, in_IN which_WDT powerful_JJ and_CC wealthy_JJ people_NNS rule_NN most_JJS of_IN the_DT time_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, being_VBG specialized_VBN in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN could_MD mean_VB being_VBG the_DT most_RBS known_JJ person_NN in_IN that_DT area_NN and_CC people_NNS will_MD recurr_VB to_TO you_PRP more_JJR than_IN to_TO anyone_NN else_RB who_WP does_VBZ not_RB have_VB the_DT knowledge_NN you_PRP have_VBP on_IN a_DT specific_JJ matter_NN ._.
You_PRP may_MD not_RB understand_VB the_DT whole_JJ world_NN ,_, but_CC have_VBP answers_NNS to_TO questions_NNS and_CC are_VBP able_JJ to_TO analyse_VB things_NNS that_WDT no_DT one_NN else_RB could_MD ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, if_IN you_PRP have_VBP a_DT unique_JJ disease_NN ,_, a_DT bacterial_JJ infection_NN ,_, you_PRP would_MD recurr_VB to_TO a_DT specialist_NN in_IN that_DT area_NN and_CC not_RB tho_VB your_PRP$ grandfather_NN that_WDT has_VBZ a_DT very_RB broad_JJ cultural_JJ knowledge_NN ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN you_PRP should_MD n't_RB choose_VB one_CD path_NN but_CC both_DT ._.
Throughout_IN your_PRP$ whole_JJ life_NN you_PRP should_MD be_VB interested_JJ to_TO expand_VB your_PRP$ broad_JJ knowledge_NN ,_, let_VB it_PRP be_VB by_IN studying_VBG or_CC travelling_VBG ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ indispensable_JJ to_TO know_VB about_RB many_JJ subjects_NNS in_IN order_NN to_TO understand_VB each_DT of_IN one_CD ,_, since_IN everything_NN interrelates_NNS in_IN one_CD world_NN ._.
Broad_NNP knowledge_NN is_VBZ the_DT basis_NN of_IN your_PRP$ futher_JJR area_NN of_IN study_NN that_IN you_PRP may_MD want_VB to_TO pursue_VB if_IN you_PRP are_VBP interest_NN in_IN a_DT specific_JJ matter_NN ._.
