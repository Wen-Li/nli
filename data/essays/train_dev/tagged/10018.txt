Although_IN some_DT people_NNS believes_VBZ that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ,_, I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB with_IN this_DT statment_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, at_IN my_PRP$ point_NN of_IN view_NN ,_, I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN the_DT enjoyment_NN is_VBZ not_RB related_VBN any_DT more_JJR to_TO the_DT old_JJ of_IN people_NNS ._.
So_RB many_JJ reason_NN can_MD support_VB may_MD point_VB of_IN view_NN ._.
In_IN this_DT life_NN ,_, there_EX are_VBP many_JJ things_NNS that_WDT can_MD enjoy_VB people_NNS ._.
These_DT than_IN are_VBP differ_VBP from_IN people_NNS to_TO other_JJ ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, the_DT children_NNS will_MD enjoy_VB with_IN playing_VBG the_DT computer_NN games_NNS ._.
but_CC ,_, when_WRB they_PRP become_VBP a_DT lettel_NN bet_NN older_JJR they_PRP will_MD enjoy_VB with_IN other_JJ thing_NN like_IN playing_VBG football_NN ._.
By_IN the_DT years_NNS ,_, there_EX way_NN of_IN entertainment_NN will_MD vary_VB according_VBG to_TO their_PRP$ ages_NNS ._.
another_DT reason_NN that_WDT support_VBP my_PRP$ opinion_NN is_VBZ the_DT diffrent_JJ circumenstances_NNS for_IN the_DT people_NNS ._.
some_DT people_NNS was_VBD sad_JJ during_IN their_PRP$ youth_NN and_CC become_VB happy_JJ when_WRB they_PRP are_VBP oled_VBN an_DT vice_NN versa_RB for_IN other_JJ people_NNS ._.
this_DT is_VBZ becuase_NN of_IN the_DT surrounding_VBG envirnoment_NN ._.
one_CD the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, some_DT people_NNS believes_VBZ that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
they_PRP supporet_VBP their_PRP$ idea_NN because_IN the_DT uouth_NN has_VBZ agood_VBN helth_NN ._.
Also_RB ,_, they_PRP have_VBP a_DT better_JJR ability_NN for_IN doing_VBG thin_JJ \_NN s_VBZ more_RBR that_IN the_DT old_JJ peopl_NN ._.
But_CC this_DT will_MD not_RB be_VB true_JJ alowas_NNS ._.
at_IN the_DT end_NN ,_, i_FW would_MD like_VB to_TO say_VB hat_NN the_DT enjoyment_NN of_IN the_DT life_NN depend_VBP mainly_RB on_IN the_DT person_NN himselm_NN rather_RB that_IN on_IN his_PRP$ age_NN ._.
so_RB ,_, i_FW would_MD like_VB to_TO say_VB to_TO the_DT people_NNS ._.
