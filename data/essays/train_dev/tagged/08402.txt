In_IN these_DT days_NNS ,_, a_DT decreasing_VBG number_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS helps_VBZ their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
In_IN this_DT way_NN ,_, communities_NNS seem_VBP to_TO be_VB almost_RB deserted_VBN ._.
But_CC should_MD young_JJ people_NNS really_RB do_VBP more_RBR in_IN favor_NN of_IN their_PRP$ communities_NNS ?_.
Or_CC is_VBZ it_PRP rather_RB the_DT fault_NN of_IN communities_NNS that_WDT youth_NN takes_VBZ no_RB more_JJR interest_NN in_IN aiding_VBG them_PRP ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP preoccupied_VBN with_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ problems_NNS today_NN ._.
Either_CC the_DT school_NN work_NN or_CC their_PRP$ job_NN is_VBZ giving_VBG them_PRP a_DT hard_JJ time_NN ._.
And_CC as_IN there_EX is_VBZ a_DT bad_JJ situation_NN at_IN the_DT employment_NN market_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ understandable_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS care_VBP a_DT lot_NN about_IN education_NN and_CC work_NN ._.
Still_RB ,_, one_CD could_MD argue_VB that_IN they_PRP will_MD have_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ comunity_NN ._.
Although_IN many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS spend_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN with_IN parties_NNS and_CC travel_NN ,_, they_PRP are_VBP not_RB willing_JJ to_TO give_VB a_DT little_JJ effort_NN in_IN order_NN to_TO support_VB their_PRP$ community_NN ._.
Entertainment_NNP and_CC amusement_NN seems_VBZ more_RBR important_JJ to_TO them_PRP ._.
However_RB ,_, one_CD should_MD ask_VB oneself_JJ why_WRB community_NN help_NN seems_VBZ so_RB abstruse_JJ to_TO them_PRP ._.
Looking_VBG at_IN churches_NNS ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ evident_JJ ,_, that_IN many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS feel_VBP its_PRP$ beliefs_NNS are_VBP antique_JJ ._.
That_DT shows_VBZ ,_, that_IN the_DT church_NN is_VBZ not_RB adapted_VBN to_TO modern_JJ times_NNS ._.
They_PRP do_VBP not_RB cover_VB the_DT needs_NNS and_CC beliefs_NNS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS anymore_RB ._.
And_CC this_DT is_VBZ the_DT reason_NN ,_, why_WRB young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP no_DT interest_NN in_IN participating_VBG at_IN a_DT community_NN of_IN the_DT church_NN ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, one_CD should_MD consider_VB the_DT fact_NN ,_, that_IN there_EX are_VBP no_DT benefits_NNS or_CC reward_NN for_IN help_NN in_IN a_DT community_NN ._.
It_PRP would_MD seem_VB quite_RB a_DT waste_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO consider_VB doing_VBG community_NN work_NN without_IN interest_NN or_CC reward_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP do_VBP not_RB think_VB young_JJ people_NNS spend_VBP to_TO little_JJ time_NN on_IN community_NN work_NN ._.
Still_RB communities_NNS require_VBP more_JJR help_NN ,_, which_WDT is_VBZ why_WRB I_PRP would_MD advise_VB them_PRP to_TO become_VB mor_NN
