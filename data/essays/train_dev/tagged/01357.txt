I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO answer_VB this_DT question_NN by_IN introducing_VBG what_WP that_DT means_VBZ :_: enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
If_IN people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lifes_NNS or_CC not_RB depends_VBZ on_IN many_JJ things_NNS ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, it_PRP could_MD depend_VB on_IN your_PRP$ hobbies_NNS ,_, like_IN playing_VBG basketball_NN or_CC fishing_NN ._.
Both_DT are_VBP completely_RB different_JJ and_CC you_PRP might_MD say_VB that_IN fishing_NN more_RBR fits_VBZ to_TO older_JJR people_NNS whereas_IN basketball_NN more_RBR fits_VBZ to_TO younger_JJR people_NNS ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, it_PRP depends_VBZ on_IN your_PRP$ social_JJ circumstances_NNS ._.
This_DT means_VBZ some_DT people_NNS enjoy_VBP spending_VBG time_NN with_IN there_EX family_NN ._.
Others_NNS like_IN to_TO go_VB to_TO parties_NNS whenever_WRB possible_JJ ._.
This_DT also_RB can_MD be_VB related_VBN to_TO the_DT age_NN ._.
Additionally_RB it_PRP could_MD depend_VB on_IN the_DT education_NN ._.
Higher_JJR educated_VBN people_NNS maybe_RB would_MD like_VB to_TO visit_VB an_DT opera_NN rather_RB than_IN hanging_VBG around_RP in_IN a_DT bar_NN ._.
Today_NN a_DT lot_NN of_IN people_NNS think_VBP education_NN was_VBD much_RB better_RBR in_IN former_JJ times_NNS ._.
Nevertheless_RB I_PRP believe_VBP younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR for_IN several_JJ reasons_NNS (_VBP but_CC this_DT answer_NN is_VBZ somehow_RB biased_VBN ,_, because_IN I_PRP think_VBP I_PRP am_VBP young_JJ )_NN ._.
All_PDT the_DT reasons_NNS mentioned_VBN above_IN can_MD not_RB lead_VB to_TO an_DT adequate_JJ answer_NN from_IN my_PRP$ point_NN of_IN view_NN ,_, because_IN that_DT are_VBP personal_JJ things_NNS ._.
Younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR ,_, because_IN they_PRP have_VBP less_RBR responsibilities_NNS ._.
So_RB younger_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR space_NN to_TO be_VB spontanous_JJ than_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP ._.
Furthermore_RB younger_JJR people_NNS are_VBP in_IN average_JJ healthier_JJR ,_, what_WP gives_VBZ them_PRP the_DT possibility_NN of_IN doing_VBG more_RBR things_NNS in_IN shorter_JJR period_NN of_IN time_NN ._.
In_IN addition_NN there_EX is_VBZ a_DT lot_NN of_IN stuff_NN to_TO discover_VB ,_, what_WDT older_JJR people_NNS may_MD have_VB discovered_VBN already_RB ._.
The_DT advantage_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS is_VBZ that_IN they_PRP have_VBP usally_RB more_JJR money_NN for_IN enjoing_VBG life_NN ,_, but_CC I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN caused_VBN by_IN todays_NNS globalization_NN it_PRP becomes_VBZ less_RBR important_JJ ._.
Everything_NN becomes_VBZ cheaper_JJR and_CC money_NN is_VBZ not_RB required_VBN for_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
To_TO conclude_VB this_DT essay_NN I_PRP would_MD say_VB that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_RBR because_IN of_IN the_DT reasons_NNS mentioned_VBN above_IN ._.
But_CC what_WP does_VBZ it_PRP really_RB mean_VB to_TO be_VB old_JJ ._.
Just_RB few_JJ people_NNS would_MD call_VB themselves_PRP old_JJ ._.
You_PRP are_VBP just_RB that_IN old_JJ ,_, how_WRB old_JJ you_PRP are_VBP feel_VB ._.
