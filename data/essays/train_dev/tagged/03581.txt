according_VBG to_TO me_PRP what_WP i_FW believe_VBP is_VBZ specialization_NN in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subjest_NN ._.
while_IN doing_VBG specialization_NN on_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN we_PRP will_MD be_VB knowing_VBG deep_JJ subject_JJ contained_VBN in_IN it_PRP ._.
and_CC it_PRP is_VBZ very_RB easy_JJ to_TO understand_VB when_WRB deeling_VBG with_IN one_CD subject_NN rather_RB with_IN many_JJ ._.
if_IN we_PRP want_VBP to_TO have_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academics_NNS ,_, it_PRP will_MD have_VB a_DT great_JJ complications_NNS while_IN doing_VBG that_DT ._.
but_CC if_IN we_PRP study_VBP one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN there_RB wont_JJ be_VB such_JJ difficulty_NN ._.
having_VBG a_DT knowledge_NN and_CC broad_JJ knowledge_NN will_MD make_VB a_DT difference_NN ._.
so_RB having_VBG knowledge_NN it_PRP means_VBZ general_JJ awareness_NN on_IN many_JJ academics_NNS is_VBZ possible_JJ and_CC compulsory_JJ ._.
for_IN example_NN if_IN we_PRP take_VBP children_NNS ,_, i_FW mean_VB from_IN 4_CD to_TO 14_CD years_NNS they_PRP will_MD be_VB learning_VBG about_RB many_JJ subjects_NNS but_CC not_RB broadly_RB ._.
and_CC when_WRB we_PRP take_VBP arround_JJ 15_CD to_TO 17_CD age_NN group_NN students_NNS they_PRP are_VBP restricted_JJ to_TO study_VB only_RB on_IN few_JJ subjects_NNS and_CC when_WRB we_PRP take_VBP 17_CD to_TO 21_CD age_NN grouped_VBD students_NNS that_WDT is_VBZ undergraduation_JJ studies_NNS will_MD restrict_VB the_DT students_NNS to_TO choose_VB only_RB one_CD subject_NN ._.
and_CC in_IN graduation_NN level_NN they_PRP are_VBP asked_VBN to_TO choose_VB only_RB one_CD branch_NN in_IN that_DT subject_JJ studied_VBN in_IN the_DT under_IN graduation_NN level_NN ._.
this_DT is_VBZ all_DT because_IN our_PRP$ education_NN system_NN is_VBZ designed_VBN in_IN such_JJ a_DT fashion_NN ._.
they_PRP are_VBP decorated_VBN based_VBN on_IN the_DT experince_NN the_DT educated_VBN people_NNS and_CC scholers_NNS has_VBZ on_IN the_DT education_NN system_NN ._.
well_RB i_FW think_VBP scholers_NNS will_MD not_RB go_VB wrong_JJ ._.
finally_RB i_FW would_MD like_VB to_TO convay_VB that_IN specialization_NN on_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN will_MD give_VB more_RBR command_NN and_CC authority_NN on_IN that_DT suject_JJ rather_RB than_IN to_TO have_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academics_NNS which_WDT will_MD ultimately_RB leads_VBZ to_TO confusion_NN and_CC less_JJR command_NN ,_, authority_NN and_CC grip_NN on_IN many_JJ subjects_NNS ._.
