I_PRP think_VBP it_PRP is_VBZ better_JJR to_TO have_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS than_IN to_TO specialize_VB in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, I_PRP think_VBP there_EX is_VBZ almost_RB no_DT profession_NN only_RB dealing_VBG with_IN one_CD academic_JJ subject_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, if_IN you_PRP study_VBP English_JJ literature_NN ,_, you_PRP also_RB need_VBP historical_JJ ,_, cultural_JJ and_CC linguistic_JJ knowledge_NN to_TO be_VB successful_JJ in_IN understanding_VBG your_PRP$ own_JJ subject_NN ._.
Or_CC if_IN you_PRP plan_VBP to_TO become_VB a_DT Physicist_NN ,_, you_PRP need_VBP extented_JJ knowledge_NN in_IN biology_NN ,_, chemistry_NN and_CC especially_RB mathematics_NNS ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, to_TO be_VB specialized_VBN in_IN only_RB one_CD subjects_NNS causes_VBZ remarkable_JJ difficulties_NNS in_IN private_JJ as_RB well_RB as_IN public_JJ life_NN ._.
Your_PRP$ relationships_NNS will_MD be_VB limited_VBN to_TO people_NNS of_IN your_PRP$ own_JJ specific_JJ subjects_NNS and_CC you_PRP are_VBP not_RB able_JJ to_TO connect_VB or_CC communicate_VB with_IN other_JJ people_NNS because_IN you_PRP can_MD not_RB understand_VB them_PRP and_CC vice_NN versa_RB ._.
If_IN you_PRP talk_VBP to_TO a_DT Biologist_NN who_WP does_VBZ not_RB know_VB anything_NN about_IN any_DT other_JJ topics_NNS ,_, you_PRP will_MD not_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO talk_VB to_TO him_PRP because_IN there_EX is_VBZ nothing_NN that_IN connects_VBZ you_PRP ._.
The_DT most_RBS important_JJ argument_NN for_IN favoring_VBG a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN rather_RB than_IN a_DT very_RB specific_JJ one_CD is_VBZ very_RB personal_JJ ._.
For_IN me_PRP it_PRP is_VBZ very_RB important_JJ to_TO gain_VB a_DT broad_JJ general_JJ knowledge_NN because_IN I_PRP think_VBP people_NNS with_IN limited_JJ specific_JJ knowledge_NN also_RB have_VBP a_DT limited_JJ emotional_JJ ability_NN ._.
I_PRP am_VBP sure_JJ that_IN people_NNS who_WP read_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN different_JJ kinds_NNS of_IN texts_NNS can_MD much_RB easier_JJR relate_VBP to_TO the_DT problems_NNS of_IN other_JJ people_NNS than_IN people_NNS who_WP tend_VBP to_TO read_VB texts_NNS exclusively_RB dealing_VBG with_IN one_CD subject_NN ._.
People_NNS with_IN knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ subjects_NNS can_MD understand_VB situations_NNS although_IN they_PRP will_MD never_RB have_VB to_TO face_VB them_PRP ,_, whereas_IN people_NNS with_IN restricted_JJ knowledge_NN will_MD not_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO deal_VB with_IN those_DT situations_NNS because_IN they_PRP are_VBP beyond_IN their_PRP$ limited_JJ horizon_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN I_NN may_MD say_VB that_IN a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ subjects_NNS makes_VBZ more_JJR sense_NN than_IN to_TO specialize_VB in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN ._.
People_NNS belonging_VBG to_TO the_DT first_JJ group_NN have_VBP advantages_NNS in_IN many_JJ different_JJ situations_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN academical_NN ,_, professional_JJ ,_, interactional_JJ as_RB well_RB as_IN emotional_JJ ones_NNS ,_, as_IN stated_VBN above_IN ._.
