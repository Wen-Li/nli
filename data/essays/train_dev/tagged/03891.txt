At_IN first_RB ,_, we_PRP should_MD make_VB a_DT definition_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN ._.
When_WRB poeple_NN have_VBP a_DT bad_JJ meaning_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN ,_, they_PRP numerate_VBP drinking_NN ,_, playing_VBG with_IN trivial_JJ things_NNS and_CC unrestricted_JJ acitivities_NNS ._.
But_CC I_PRP want_VBP to_TO make_VB a_DT distinction_NN between_IN good_JJ meaning_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN and_CC bad_JJ meaning_NN ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS can_MD be_VB described_VBN as_IN a_DT progessing_NN unit_NN to_TO become_VB a_DT sound_JJ personality_NN ._.
In_IN this_DT case_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, enjoyment_NN can_MD be_VB a_DT good_JJ way_NN to_TO enhance_VB their_PRP$ ability_NN to_TO become_VB a_DT adult_NN ._.
If_IN person_NN could_MD not_RB have_VB a_DT chance_NN to_TO learn_VB the_DT good_JJ way_NN to_TO enjoy_VB himself_PRP ,_, he_PRP would_MD not_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO make_VB his_PRP$ life_NN meaningful_JJ with_IN balance_NN between_IN enjoyment_NN and_CC temperance_NN ._.
The_DT emphasis_NN only_RB on_IN temperance_NN can_MD cause_VB a_DT stiff_JJ life_NN and_CC dry_JJ life_NN style_NN ._.
To_TO young_JJ people_NNS ,_, the_DT enjoyment_NN means_VBZ physical_JJ activities_NNS related_VBN with_IN sports_NNS ,_, travel_NN ,_, outdoor_JJ campaign_NN ._.
Because_IN young_JJ people_NNS usually_RB hav_VBP much_RB more_RBR energy_NN than_IN the_DT old_JJ ,_, they_PRP can_MD show_VB their_PRP$ desire_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_RBR apparently_RB that_IN the_DT old_JJ ._.
From_IN this_DT difference_NN ,_, some_DT people_NNS think_VBP that_IN youg_NN people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN that_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
But_CC it_PRP is_VBZ based_VBN on_IN the_DT different_JJ way_NN to_TO show_VB their_PRP$ taste_NN ,_, not_RB the_DT fundamental_JJ difference_NN between_IN the_DT younger_JJR and_CC the_DT older_JJR ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, as_IN people_NNS get_VBP older_JJR ,_, they_PRP realize_VBP that_IN the_DT outdoor_JJ activities_NNS are_VBP sometimes_RB beyond_IN thier_JJR physical_JJ capacitiy_NN ._.
This_DT realization_NN does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB that_IN the_DT older_JJR give_VBP up_RP their_PRP$ desire_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
They_PRP want_VBP to_TO find_VB more_JJR comfortable_JJ ways_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ leisure_NN time_NN as_IN far_RB as_IN thier_JJR body_NN condition_NN can_MD not_RB be_VB hurted_VBN ._.
It_PRP will_MD be_VB very_RB wiser_JJR for_IN them_PRP to_TO adjust_VB their_PRP$ taste_NN to_TO situation_NN ._.
So_RB ,_, in_IN the_DT matter_NN of_IN visible_JJ level_NN of_IN the_DT enjoyment_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS seem_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN that_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
The_DT visible_JJ thing_NN can_MD not_RB explain_VB all_DT of_IN the_DT enjoyment_NN ._.
If_IN we_PRP apply_VBP the_DT enjoyment_NN to_TO the_DT very_RB limited_JJ category_NN ,_, the_DT old_JJ people_NNS who_WP do_VBP a_DT yoga_NN for_IN health_NN in_IN leisure_NN time_NN would_MD fall_VB into_IN the_DT categoy_NN of_IN patients_NNS who_WP want_VBP to_TO recover_VB from_IN disease_NN ._.
widening_VBG the_DT meaning_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN can_MD be_VB helpful_JJ for_IN us_PRP to_TO understand_VB each_DT other_JJ ._.
Enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ life_NN according_VBG to_TO their_PRP$ situation_NN can_MD not_RB be_VB blamed_VBN ._.
The_DT one_CD thing_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS should_MD keep_VB in_IN mind_NN is_VBZ that_IN the_DT enjoyment_NN should_MD be_VB accompanied_VBN by_IN temperance_NN ._.
Usually_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB be_VB equipped_VBN with_IN temperance_NN ._.
They_PRP have_VBP less_JJR experience_NN than_IN the_DT old_JJ ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS take_VBP a_DT lesson_NN from_IN old_JJ generation_NN ._.
As_IN time_NN goes_VBZ by_IN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS follow_VBP the_DT way_NN that_IN the_DT old_JJ had_VBD trodden_JJ ._.
Enjoying_VBG life_NN is_VBZ very_RB important_JJ ._.
Making_VBG life_NN rich_JJ and_CC giving_VBG a_DT room_NN aside_RB from_IN busy_JJ job_NN is_VBZ a_DT basic_JJ function_NN of_IN the_DT enjoyment_NN ._.
