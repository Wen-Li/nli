I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS for_IN the_DT following_VBG reasons_NNS ._.
Most_JJS impotantly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD travel_VB anywhere_RB and_CC anytime_RB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, my_PRP$ family_NN used_VBN to_TO spend_VB our_PRP$ summer_NN vacation_NN in_IN Hawaii_NNP about_IN twenty_CD years_NNS ago_RB ,_, because_IN my_PRP$ parents_NNS liked_VBD Hawaii_NNP and_CC really_RB enjoyed_VBN traveling_VBG to_TO Hawaii_NNP ,_, such_JJ as_IN swinming_NN ,_, plating_VBG golf_NN ,_, going_VBG shopping_NN ._.
But_CC recently_RB their_PRP$ enjoment_NN of_IN spending_NN Hawaii_NNP during_IN summer_NN vacation_NN ,_, because_IN my_PRP$ parents_NNS recongized_VBD their_PRP$ weak_JJ points_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ body_NN because_IN of_IN old_JJ age_NN ._.
The_DT notice_NN of_IN disadvantage_NN tends_VBZ to_TO prevent_VB from_IN traveling_VBG anywhere_RB ,_, especially_RB ,_, Hawaii_NNP ._.
Contrary_JJ to_TO old_JJ people_NNS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS merely_RB recognizer_VBP their_PRP$ weak_JJ point_NN in_IN their_PRP$ body_NN because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ age_NN in_IN cluding_VBG me_PRP ,_, and_CC young_JJ people_NNS travel_VBP to_TO anywhere_RB where_WRB they_PRP want_VBP to_TO go_VB actively_RB ,_, also_RB including_VBG me_PRP ._.
But_CC old_JJ people_NNS as_IN like_IN my_PRP$ parents_NNS tend_VBP to_TO be_VB limited_VBN to_TO travel_VB because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ condition_NN ._.
As_IN the_DT above_JJ examples_NNS shows_VBZ ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD travel_VB anywhere_RB and_CC anytime_RB ._.
Additionally_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS try_VBP to_TO do_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB ._.
I_PRP enjoy_VBP doing_VBG yoga_NN in_IN owder_NN to_TO keep_VB healthier_JJR ._.
Also_RB ,_, in_IN spring_NN and_CC fall_NN ,_, I_PRP enjoy_VBP playing_VBG golf_NN ._.
Howerver_NNP old_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO bear_VB doing_VBG what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, my_PRP$ father_NN also_RB enjoyed_VBD playing_VBG golf_NN in_IN younger_JJR age_NN when_WRB I_PRP was_VBD littele_JJ child_NN ._.
But_CC ,_, when_WRB ten_CD years_NNS ago_RB ,_, he_PRP had_VBD the_DT operation_NN in_IN his_PRP$ eye_NN because_IN of_IN accumurated_JJ stresses_NNS for_IN a_DT long_JJ time_NN ,_, he_PRP came_VBD to_TO pay_VB attention_NN with_IN his_PRP$ body_NN ,_, of_IN course_NN including_VBG his_PRP$ eyes_NNS ._.
And_CC he_PRP stopped_VBD diving_NN car_NN because_IN of_IN the_DT affairs_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB he_PRP stands_VBZ up_RP plaing_VBG golf_NN ._.
Instead_RB he_PRP go_VB for_IN a_DT walk_NN every_DT morning_NN to_TO keep_VB his_PRP$ good_JJ condition_NN and_CC to_TO maintain_VB health_NN As_IN the_DT above_JJ examples_NNS demonstrates_VBZ ,_, old_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO be_VB limited_VBN when_WRB they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB anything_NN ,_, wheras_FW young_JJ people_NNS try_VBP to_TO do_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
