would_MD age_VB matter_NN for_IN the_DT living_NN style_NN of_IN a_DT person_NN ?_.
would_MD it_PRP affect_VB the_DT way_NN that_IN the_DT person_NN have_VBP the_DT taste_NN of_IN the_DT life_NN ?_.
the_DT answer_NN would_MD be_VB quite_RB different_JJ if_IN it_PRP was_VBD asked_VBN to_TO people_NNS in_IN different_JJ age_NN groups_NNS ._.
however_RB one_PRP can_MD not_RB miss_VB the_DT the_DT viewpoints_NNS of_IN most_JJS people_NNS being_VBG young_JJ is_VBZ more_RBR fascinating_JJ than_IN being_VBG old_JJ ._.
in_IN a_DT specific_JJ way_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP the_DT life_NN better_JJR than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
there_EX are_VBP numerous_JJ reasons_NNS for_IN this_DT but_CC to_TO state_VB some_DT ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ clear_JJ that_IN in_IN youth_NN ,_, people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR active_JJ ,_, energetic_JJ ;_: young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR curious_JJ than_IN old_JJ people_NNS that_WDT leads_VBZ them_PRP to_TO have_VB a_DT chance_NN to_TO get_VB the_DT joy_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
no_DT need_NN to_TO think_VB much_RB ._. ._.
first_RB of_IN all_DT it_PRP must_MD be_VB stated_VBN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR energy_NN than_IN the_DT old_JJ peple_NN ._.
this_DT is_VBZ a_DT fact_NN that_IN no_DT one_NN can_MD deny_VB ._.
being_VBG energetic_JJ and_CC active_JJ makes_VBZ the_DT young_JJ people_NNS to_TO have_VB the_DT strength_NN of_IN doing_VBG anything_NN that_IN they_PRP want_VBP ._.
by_IN this_DT way_NN they_PRP can_MD experience_VB lots_NNS of_IN things_NNS ._.
for_IN example_NN generally_RB ,_, an_DT old_JJ person_NN would_MD not_RB attempt_VB to_TO ride_VB a_DT motorbike_NN but_CC a_DT young_JJ person_NN do_VBP ._.
so_RB that_IN they_PRP feel_VBP the_DT wind_NN breezing_VBG on_IN their_PRP$ faces_NNS while_IN they_PRP go_VBP fast_RB and_CC they_PRP have_VBP the_DT joy_NN of_IN driving_VBG fast_JJ and_CC as_RB well_RB as_IN the_DT joy_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
moreover_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR curious_JJ almost_RB about_IN everything_NN ._.
for_IN instance_NN the_DT curiousity_NN leads_VBZ the_DT young_JJ people_NNS to_TO make_VB a_DT search_NN to_TO find_VB some_DT things_NNS new_JJ ._.
the_DT joy_NN of_IN making_VBG a_DT search_NN ,_, getting_VBG their_PRP$ own_JJ results_NNS and_CC making_VBG some_DT interpretations_NNS are_VBP very_RB valuable_JJ experiences_NNS for_IN a_DT young_JJ ._.
to_TO give_VB an_DT example_NN ,_, mostly_RB for_IN travel_NN ,_, old_JJ people_NNS go_VBP only_RB to_TO a_DT place_NN and_CC have_VBP some_DT rest_NN there_RB ._.
but_CC most_JJS of_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP some_DT travellings_NNS around_IN the_DT world_NN ._.
this_DT is_VBZ mostly_RB a_DT result_NN of_IN their_PRP$ curiousity_NN ._.
as_RB long_RB as_IN they_PRP are_VBP curious_JJ young_JJ people_NNS will_MD find_VB some_DT thing_NN to_TO enjoy_VB with_IN ,_, to_TO be_VB happy_JJ with_IN ._.
without_IN any_DT denial_NN ,_, one_CD must_MD accept_VB that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP enjoy_VB more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
for_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, being_VBG active_JJ ,_, energetic_JJ ,_, curious_JJ makes_VBZ them_PRP to_TO go_VB for_IN the_DT things_NNS they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB ._.
by_IN this_DT way_NN they_PRP take_VBP the_DT taste_NN of_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ,_, and_CC enjoy_VB until_IN they_PRP feel_VBP themselves_PRP as_IN young_JJ and_CC they_PRP realized_VBD that_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB done_VBN with_IN the_DT life_NN yet_RB ._.
