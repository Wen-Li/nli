Some_DT poople_NN in_IN Japan_NNP ,_, where_WRB I_PRP live_VBP ,_, disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB do_VBP not_RB give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB do_VBP not_RB give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG communities_NNS for_IN the_DT following_VBG reasons_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, school_NN often_RB says_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO spent_VBN their_PRP$ time_NN studing_VBG ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, My_PRP$ son_NN studies_NNS at_IN Shudo_NNP Highschool_NNP ,_, a_DT private_JJ achool_NN in_IN Hiroshima_NNP where_WRB locates_VBZ western_JJ part_NN of_IN Japan_NNP ._.
He_PRP wants_VBZ to_TO communicate_VB wiht_NN our_PRP$ neighborhood_NN ._.
But_CC ,_, he_PRP always_RB have_VBP many_JJ assignments_NNS and_CC can_MD not_RB attend_VB a_DT community_NN meetig_NN ._.
In_IN japan_NN ,_, exam_NN scores_NNS are_VBP most_RBS important_JJ so_RB young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO study_VB hard_JJ to_TO get_VB high_JJ score_NN ._.
In_IN consequent_JJ ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP no_DT time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Second_RB ,_, there_EX are_VBP few_JJ communities_NNS in_IN our_PRP$ neighborhood_NN so_RB if_IN young_JJ people_NNS want_VBP ,_, they_PRP can_MD not_RB spend_VB thier_JJR time_NN helping_VBG their_PRP$ communitiew_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, when_WRB I_PRP was_VBD a_DT junior_JJ highschool_NN student_NN there_EX were_VBD many_JJ communities_NNS around_IN us_PRP and_CC spent_VBD much_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG our_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Now_RB ,_, in_IN Japan_NNP ,_, people_NNS often_RB do_VBP not_RB know_VB who_WP lives_VBZ in_IN thier_NN neighborhood_NN ._.
We_PRP do_VBP not_RB know_VB each_DT other_JJ so_IN there_EX are_VBP few_JJ communities_NNS around_IN us_PRP ._.
Because_IN there_EX are_VBP few_JJ communities_NNS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB give_VB enogh_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
If_IN there_EX were_VBD many_JJ communities_NNS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS would_MD give_VB enogh_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Terefore_NNP ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB do_VBP not_RB give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
