In_IN addressing_VBG whether_IN younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, I_PRP can_MD not_RB state_VB for_IN certain_JJ ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN is_VBZ not_RB heavily_RB dependent_JJ upon_IN age_NN ,_, but_CC rather_RB on_IN the_DT different_JJ situations_NNS of_IN each_DT person_NN ._.
Admittedly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS seem_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS on_IN the_DT outside_NN ._.
This_DT is_VBZ because_IN younger_JJR people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR vibrant_JJ ,_, adventurous_JJ ,_, and_CC have_VBP more_RBR energy_NN ._.
They_PRP have_VBP less_RBR responsibilities_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, giving_VBG them_PRP more_RBR freedom_NN to_TO explore_VB and_CC have_VB fun_NN ._.
But_CC I_PRP can_MD not_RB rule_VB out_RP the_DT burdens_NNS that_IN I_PRP have_VBP experienced_VBN growing_VBG up_RP ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, the_DT pressure_NN of_IN entering_VBG university_NN ,_, then_RB graduating_VBG ,_, and_CC then_RB acquiring_VBG a_DT job_NN ._.
It_PRP seemed_VBD that_IN overcoming_VBG a_DT hill_NN led_VBD to_TO an_DT even_RB bigger_JJR mountain_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP can_MD not_RB ignore_VB the_DT fact_NN that_IN as_IN people_NNS grow_VBP older_JJR ,_, they_PRP have_VBP achieved_VBN many_JJ things_NNS along_IN the_DT way_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, a_DT stable_JJ job_NN ,_, leisure_NN time_NN to_TO do_VB hobbies_NNS ,_, birth_NN and_CC nuture_NN of_IN children_NNS are_VBP just_RB some_DT of_IN the_DT things_NNS that_WDT can_MD lead_VB to_TO an_DT enjoyable_JJ and_CC fulfilling_VBG life_NN ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, the_DT period_NN after_IN retirement_NN seems_VBZ so_RB liberating_JJ and_CC enjoyable_JJ ._.
But_CC on_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR responsibilities_NNS ,_, meaning_VBG less_JJR time_NN to_TO yourself_PRP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
It_PRP seems_VBZ that_IN who_WP enjoys_VBZ life_NN more_RBR ,_, the_DT younger_JJR or_CC older_JJR ,_, does_VBZ not_RB depend_VB on_IN age_NN ,_, but_CC rather_RB on_IN how_WRB the_DT individual_JJ grows_VBZ up_RP and_CC becomes_VBZ older_JJR ._.
Some_DT people_NNS may_MD think_VB that_IN their_PRP$ childhood_NN was_VBD a_DT disaster_NN ,_, without_IN many_JJ good_JJ memories_NNS ,_, while_IN being_VBG at_IN there_EX happiest_JJS at_IN an_DT older_JJR age_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, some_DT people_NNS may_MD miss_VB their_PRP$ childhood_NN and_CC wish_NN that_IN they_PRP could_MD go_VB back_RB to_TO the_DT innocent_JJ days_NNS when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD free_JJ to_TO do_VB whatever_WDT they_PRP wanted_VBD ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP do_VBP not_RB fully_RB agree_VB with_IN this_DT statement_NN ,_, as_IN questioning_VBG happiness_NN based_VBN on_IN age_NN does_VBZ not_RB produce_VB a_DT reliable_JJ answer_NN ._.
Rather_RB happiness_NN ,_, whenever_WRB experienced_JJ depends_VBZ on_IN the_DT individuals_NNS life_NN
