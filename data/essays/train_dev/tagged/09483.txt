Most_JJS people_NNS consider_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP like_IN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
But_CC I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN this_DT idea_NN from_IN the_DT reasons_NNS below_IN ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS know_VBP what_WP is_VBZ their_PRP$ interesting_JJ from_IN their_PRP$ long_JJ experiences_NNS ._.
When_WRB poeople_NN are_VBP still_RB young_JJ they_PRP are_VBP in_IN the_DT time_NN to_TO seek_VB what_WP they_PRP are_VBP really_RB interested_JJ in_IN ._.
On_IN the_DT contrary_NN ,_, oler_JJR people_NNS have_VBP already_RB know_VB because_IN they_PRP probably_RB have_VBP found_VBN their_PRP$ hobby_NN ,_, additionally_RB they_PRP know_VBP enoughly_RB how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB them_PRP ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, to_TO enjoy_VB carigraphy_NN deeply_RB ,_, it_PRP needs_VBZ to_TO much_JJ time_NN to_TO be_VB familliar_JJ with_IN it_PRP ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP money_NN that_WDT younger_JJR people_NNS ._.
In_IN any_DT countries_NNS ,_, people_NNS earn_VBP plenty_NN of_IN money_NN from_IN their_PRP$ long_JJ laboring_VBG to_TO sepnd_VB their_PRP$ retired_JJ time_NN without_IN working_VBG ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, in_IN Japan_NNP ,_, many_JJ company_NN aim_NN at_IN seniors_NNS and_CC produce_VBP many_JJ goods_NNS and_CC plans_NNS for_IN older_JJR people_NNS 's_POS hobbuy_NN such_JJ as_IN carigraphy_NN ,_, computer_NN games_NNS ,_, shogi_FW |_FW japanese_JJ chess_NN ]_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, being_VBG different_JJ from_IN their_PRP$ younger_JJR age_NN when_WRB they_PRP earn_VBP to_TO feed_VB their_PRP$ child_NN and_CC let_VB them_PRP enroll_VB schools_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD use_VB money_NN for_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ because_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB duty_NN to_TO raise_VB children_NNS ._.
Thirdly_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP enough_JJ time_NN to_TO spend_VB doing_VBG what_WP they_PRP like_VBP ._.
Recently_RB ,_, in_IN Japan_NNP ,_, many_JJ older_JJR people_NNS enroll_VBP into_IN some_DT communities_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB with_IN other_JJ seniors_NNS ._.
Although_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB enough_JJ time_NN because_IN they_PRP have_VBP to_TO work_VB to_TO live_VB or_CC feed_VB their_PRP$ children_NNS all_DT day_NN long_RB ._.
From_IN these_DT reasons_NNS ,_, I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT idea_NN to_TO consider_VB that_DT youn_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
