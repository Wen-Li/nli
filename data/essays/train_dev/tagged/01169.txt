The_DT community_NN associations_NNS are_VBP formed_VBN in_IN order_NN to_TO serve_VB their_PRP$ community_NN ,_, to_TO make_VB it_PRP develop_VB ._.
As_IN the_DT engines_NNS need_VBP petroleum_NN products_NNS to_TO work_VB ;_: the_DT community_NN needs_VBZ young_JJ people_NNS 's_POS attention_NN to_TO be_VB strong_JJ and_CC well-organized_JJ ._.
However_RB ,_, because_IN of_IN the_DT education_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP ,_, the_DT way_NN of_IN living_VBG that_IN the_DT others_NNS ,_, with_IN whom_WP the_DT young_JJ people_NNS live_VBP with_IN ,_, the_DT daily_JJ events_NNS ,_, which_WDT make_VBP the_DT young_JJ people_NNS think_VBP pessimistic_JJ ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB pay_VB enough_JJ attention_NN to_TO their_PRP$ communities_NNS as_IN they_PRP do_VBP before_RB ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, education_NN ,_, that_IN we_PRP have_VBP during_IN our_PRP$ lives_NNS ,_, has_VBZ really_RB important_JJ effects_NNS on_IN people_NNS 's_POS way_NN of_IN living_NN ._.
It_PRP can_MD be_VB easily_RB seen_VBN that_IN ,_, well-educated_JJ people_NNS are_VBP caring_VBG their_PRP$ community_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT other_JJ people_NNS ,_, who_WP are_VBP not_RB well-educated_JJ ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, think_VB of_IN somebody_NN who_WP graduated_VBD from_IN university_NN ._.
The_DT person_NN ,_, we_PRP are_VBP talking_VBG about_RB ,_, has_VBZ a_DT knowledge_NN of_IN things_NNS that_IN a_DT community_NN needs_VBZ and_CC can_MD give_VB a_DT decision_NN about_IN what_WP to_TO do_VB for_IN the_DT community_NN ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD get_VB easily_RB affected_VBN from_IN the_DT people_NNS they_PRP are_VBP living_VBG with_IN ._.
Is_VBZ not_RB it_PRP right_RB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS want_VBP to_TO be_VB like_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS ?_.
Nor_CC ,_, their_PRP$ parents_NNS do_VBP care_VB about_IN the_DT community_NN that_IN they_PRP live_VBP in_IN ,_, neither_CC the_DT young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP the_DT small_JJ versions_NNS of_IN parents_NNS ._.
These_DT are_VBP not_RB all_PDT the_DT factors_NNS that_WDT can_MD affect_VB young_JJ people_NNS in_IN a_DT bad_JJ way_NN like_IN this_DT ._.
Has_VBZ anybody_NN ever_RB thought_VBD the_DT idea_NN of_IN daily_JJ events_NNS can_MD affect_VB young_JJ people_NNS in_IN a_DT bad_JJ way_NN ?_.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, think_VBP about_IN the_DT topic_NN of_IN war_NN ,_, occuring_VBG in_IN the_DT middle_JJ eastern_JJ countries_NNS ._.
This_DT can_MD be_VB told_VBN as_IN one_CD of_IN the_DT reasons_NNS that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP pessimistic_JJ about_IN the_DT future_NN and_CC their_PRP$ community_NN ._.
Finally_RB ,_, from_IN my_PRP$ standpoint_NN it_PRP is_VBZ true_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
I_PRP do_VBP strongly_RB believe_VB the_DT thing_NN this_DT can_MD be_VB so_RB
