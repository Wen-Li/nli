it_PRP said_VBD that_IN ``_`` young_JJ poeple_NN enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ''_'' ,_, i_FW dont_FW agree_VBP with_IN it_PRP ._.
there_EX are_VBP some_DT of_IN my_PRP$ thoughts_NNS about_IN it_PRP ._.
first_RB of_IN all_DT ,_, old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR life_NN exprience_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, the_DT old_JJ people_NNS can_MD solve_VB the_DT problem_NN in_IN their_PRP$ life_NN easily_RB ,_, however_RB ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS usually_RB can_MD not_RB slove_VB it_PRP ,_, and_CC feel_VB sad_JJ ._.
second_RB ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN ,_, for_IN example_NN ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS think_VBP that_IN playing_VBG computer_NN games_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ house_NN is_VBZ means_VBZ enjoying_VBG life_NN ,_, Yet_CC it_PRP make_VB them_PRP do_VB not_RB chat_VB with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ,_, even_RB their_PRP$ family_NN ._.
the_DT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
in_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, the_DT old_JJ people_NNS usually_RB will_MD chat_VB with_IN their_PRP$ friend_NN and_CC do_VBP something_NN good_JJ for_IN them_PRP ._.
apart_RB from_IN knowing_VBG how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN ,_, the_DT old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP also_RB having_VBG more_JJR time_NN and_CC money_NN ,_, as_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB need_VB to_TO work_VB ,_, they_PRP have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
yet_RB ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS need_VBP to_TO go_VB to_TO school_NN ,_, and_CC they_PRP usually_RB do_VBP not_RB have_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN money_NN ._.
so_RB ._.
the_DT old_JJ people_NNS can_MD go_VB to_TO trip_NN around_IN the_DT world_NN and_CC enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
last_JJ but_CC not_RB least_JJS ,_, old_JJ people_NNS can_MD spend_VB more_JJR time_NN with_IN their_PRP$ lover_NN ,_, but_CC the_DT young_JJ can_MD not_RB spend_VB that_IN much_JJ time_NN with_IN their_PRP$ lover_NN ._.
to_TO sum_VB up_RP ,_, old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS because_IN they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR life_NN exprience_NN ,_, more_JJR time_NN ,_, more_JJR money_NN and_CC they_PRP know_VBP the_DT means_NNS
