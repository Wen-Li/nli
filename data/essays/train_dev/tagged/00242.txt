I_PRP agree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Both_CC young_JJ people_NNS and_CC old_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN ,_, but_CC young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT old_JJ one_CD ._.
Everyone_NN start_VB his_PRP$ life_NN as_IN a_DT child_NN ,_, then_RB he_PRP gradually_RB start_VBP the_DT young_JJ people_NNS life_NN ._.
Most_JJS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS miss_VBP thier_JJR childhood_NN life_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP sure_JJ that_IN they_PRP can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB life_NN as_IN they_PRP were_VBD doing_VBG in_IN their_PRP$ childhood_NN ._.
When_WRB they_PRP are_VBP young_JJ they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR responsibality_NN in_IN life_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, at_IN this_DT time_NN ,_, as_IN normal_JJ ,_, they_PRP have_VBP more_JJR power_NN and_CC more_JJR ability_NN to_TO do_VB works_NNS ._.
They_PRP have_VBP the_DT power_NN and_CC improved_VBD mind_NN that_WDT can_MD help_VB them_PRP to_TO do_VB more_JJR and_CC more_RBR fun_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD do_VB car_NN racing_NN ,_, mountains_NNS climbing_VBG ,_, sky_NN diving_NN ._. .._SYM
and_CC much_RB more_RBR which_WDT other_JJ ages_NNS people_NNS can_MD not_RB do_VB ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR likely_JJ like_IN children_NNS ._.
At_IN that_DT age_NN they_PRP need_VBP help_NN aproximatly_RB as_IN the_DT child_NN need_NN ._.
They_PRP became_VBD more_RBR depandent_JJ again_RB ._.
they_PRP can_MD not_RB do_VB as_RB much_JJ work_NN as_IN they_PRP can_MD before_RB ._.
They_PRP no_RB more_RBR have_VB the_DT power_NN they_PRP were_VBD had_VBN ,_, nor_CC in_IN their_PRP$ childhood_NN not_RB in_IN their_PRP$ young_JJ days_NNS ._.
They_PRP may_MD have_VB fun_NN ,_, but_CC they_PRP get_VBP tired_VBN more_RBR quick_JJ and_CC need_VB more_JJR time_NN to_TO rest_NN ._.
Enjoying_VBG life_NN needs_VBZ power_NN ,_, endurance_JJ ,_, indepandent_JJ ,_, strenght_NN ,_, activity_NN and_CC much_JJ things_NNS that_WDT older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB or_CC have_VB but_CC in_IN less_JJR level_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP ._.
For_IN more_JJR clearifying_NN ,_, when_WRB we_PRP take_VBP dance_NN as_IN an_DT example_NN ,_, can_MD old_JJ people_NNS dance_VBP as_IN good_JJ as_IN young_JJ people_NNS ?_.
or_CC can_MD they_PRP enjoy_VB sex_NN as_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VB ?_.
can_MD they_PRP laugh_NN as_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VB ?_.
can_MD they_PRP do_VB advantures_NNS as_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VB ?_.
and_CC keep_VB going_VBG !_.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
Because_IN of_IN what_WP I_PRP said_VBD before_IN and_CC also_RB because_IN young_JJ people_NNS can_MD be_VB more_RBR excited_JJ and_CC more_RBR active_JJ than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
