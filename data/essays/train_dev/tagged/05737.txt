I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB do_VBP not_RB give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
This_DT is_VBZ because_IN the_DT current_JJ society_NN seems_VBZ to_TO promote_VB active_JJ community_NN services_NNS in_IN many_JJ areas_NNS and_CC encourage_VB young_JJ people_NNS to_TO get_VB involved_VBN in_IN community_NN services_NNS by_IN suggesting_VBG attractive_JJ rewards_NNS by_IN doing_VBG that_DT ._.
To_TO start_VB with_IN ,_, most_JJS schools_NNS requires_VBZ certain_JJ tasks_NNS of_IN community_NN services_NNS in_IN school_NN activities_NNS ._.
I_PRP personally_RB experienced_VBD this_DT when_WRB I_PRP was_VBD in_IN highschool_NN in_IN Sydney_NNP ._.
I_PRP and_CC my_PRP$ friends_NNS are_VBP regulary_RB sent_VBN to_TO certain_JJ institutions_NNS or_CC places_NNS that_WDT need_VBP help_NN ._.
Thus_RB we_PRP had_VBD to_TO spend_VB two_CD hours_NNS a_DT week_NN in_IN evey_NN year_NN helping_VBG our_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ now_RB became_VBN compulsory_JJ for_IN all_DT students_NNS to_TO spend_VB certain_JJ amount_NN of_IN time_NN helping_VBG communities_NNS in_IN order_NN to_TO graduate_VB middle_JJ school_NN and_CC high_JJ school_NN in_IN Korea_NNP ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, it_PRP can_MD be_VB said_VBD that_IN young_JJ people_NNS spend_VBP enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS whethere_VBP they_PRP want_VBP or_CC not_RB ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, community_NN services_NNS do_VBP help_VB young_JJ people_NNS enter_VBP a_DT college_NN or_CC get_VB a_DT job_NN ._.
Most_JJS colleges_NNS and_CC companies_NNS gives_VBZ extra_JJ scores_NNS if_IN a_DT candidate_NN have_VBP numerous_JJ experience_NN of_IN community_NN services_NNS ._.
In_IN other_JJ words_NNS ,_, more_JJR and_CC more_RBR young_JJ people_NNS desire_VBP to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS in_IN order_NN to_TO enter_VB colleges_NNS or_CC get_VB a_DT job_NN ._.
In_IN short_JJ ,_, I_PRP strongly_RB believe_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS spend_VBP enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG communities_NNS in_IN these_DT days_NNS ._.
In_IN fact_NN ,_, it_PRP seems_VBZ that_IN the_DT society_NN force_NN young_JJ people_NNS to_TO participate_VB in_IN community_NN services_NNS more_RBR rather_RB than_IN vonluteer_NN themselves_PRP ._.
But_CC this_DT phenomenon_NN can_MD not_RB be_VB blamed_VBN because_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB seems_VBZ that_IN they_PRP becomes_VBZ more_RBR selfish_JJ than_IN ever_RB before_RB ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, in_IN which_WDT way_NN they_PRP contribute_VBP to_TO helping_VBG communities_NNS ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ true_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS spend_VBP enough_JJ time_NN to_TO help_VB thei_IN
