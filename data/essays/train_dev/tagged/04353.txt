I_PRP disagree_VBP to_TO the_DT statement_NN that_IN states_NNS successful_JJ people_NNS try_VBP new_JJ things_NNS and_CC take_VB risks_NNS rather_RB than_IN only_RB doing_VBG what_WP they_PRP already_RB know_VBP hot_JJ wo_MD do_VB well_RB for_IN three_CD reasons_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, successful_JJ people_NNS prefer_VBP to_TO train_VB their_PRP$ skills_NNS and_CC knowledge_NN even_RB though_IN they_PRP already_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO do_VB well_RB ._.
Although_IN they_PRP have_VBP good_JJ skills_NNS and_CC knowledges_NNS ,_, they_PRP may_MD not_RB try_VB to_TO take_VB the_DT new_JJ things_NNS and_CC take_VB risks_NNS because_IN they_PRP know_VBP that_IN changing_VBG their_PRP$ mind_NN often_RB can_MD worse_JJR their_PRP$ ability_NN ._.
By_IN taking_VBG the_DT new_JJ skills_NNS and_CC risks_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD improve_VB their_PRP$ knowledges_NNS and_CC become_VB more_RBR confident_JJ ;_: however_RB ,_, if_IN they_PRP doing_VBG so_RB ,_, they_PRP may_MD also_RB take_VB the_DT risk_NN to_TO dwindle_VB their_PRP$ ability_NN that_WDT was_VBD aquired_VBN well_RB because_IN they_PRP should_MD concentrate_VB on_IN only_RB the_DT new_JJ thing_NN to_TO improve_VB ._.
Second_RB ,_, successful_JJ people_NNS want_VBP to_TO utilize_VB their_PRP$ knowlede_NN and_CC skills_NNS in_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
The_DT successful_JJ people_NNS ,_, who_WP have_VBP the_DT great_JJ knowledge_NN and_CC interesting_JJ in_IN the_DT particular_JJ thing_NN ,_, dreaming_VBG to_TO work_VB in_IN the_DT future_NN that_WDT requiring_VBG their_PRP$ ability_NN ._.
Compared_VBN with_IN the_DT normal_JJ people_NNS ,_, the_DT successful_JJ peolpe_NN have_VBP been_VBN enthusiastic_JJ about_IN the_DT only_JJ what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO improve_VB and_CC what_WP they_PRP intresting_VBG in_IN while_IN normal_JJ people_NNS have_VBP intresting_VBG in_IN a_DT variety_NN of_IN things_NNS ,_, for_IN example_NN ,_, tennis_NN ,_, pianno_NN ,_, karate_NN ,_, etc_FW ._.
Finally_RB ,_, competing_VBG with_IN others_NNS are_VBP the_DT most_RBS important_JJ reasons_NNS that_IN the_DT successful_JJ people_NNS prefer_VBP to_TO continueing_VBG to_TO take_VB the_DT risk_NN and_CC training_VBG their_PRP$ skills_NNS that_IN they_PRP already_RB know_VBP well_RB ._.
By_IN having_VBG the_DT rivel_NN ,_, successful_JJ people_NNS trying_VBG to_TO defeat_VB each_DT others_NNS ._.
When_WRB the_DT rivel_JJ defeat_NN other_JJ rivel_NN ,_, then_RB the_DT other_JJ rivel_NN try_VB to_TO defeat_VB the_DT rivel_NN and_CC work_NN harder_RB ;_: however_RB ,_, if_IN one_CD of_IN them_PRP change_VBP their_PRP$ risk_NN to_TO take_VB ,_, then_RB he/she_NN will_MD recognize_VB it_PRP as_IN rivel_NN admit_VBP losing_VBG ._.
In_IN the_DT conclusion_NN ,_, successful_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO do_VB not_RB take_VB the_DT new_JJ skills_NNS and_CC risks_NNS because_IN they_PRP have_VBP rivel_NN ,_, desire_NN to_TO utilize_VB their_PRP$ skills_NNS and_CC knowledge_NN ,_, and_CC want_VBP to_TO improve_VB them_PRP ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, taking_VBG the_DT new_JJ skills_NNS or_CC risks_NNS is_VBZ not_RB bad_JJ ,_, however_RB ,_, if_IN they_PRP really_RB want_VBP to_TO improve_VB their_PRP$ skills_NNS ,_, they_PRP should_MD not_RB try_VB to_TO learn_VB any_DT other_JJ new_JJ things_NNS ,_,
