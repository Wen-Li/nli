Today_NN ,_, we_PRP can_MD see_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN people_NNS who_WP are_VBP around_IN us_PRP enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN happily_RB ._.
Some_DT people_NNS go_VBP abroad_RB and_CC have_VB good_JJ experience_NN ._.
Other_JJ people_NNS go_VBP to_TO the_DT beach_NN and_CC relex_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP ,_, most_JJS of_IN people_NNS who_WP enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN are_VBP order_NN people_NNS ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP n't_RB have_VB many_JJ opportunities_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, most_RBS young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO study_VB for_IN their_PRP$ future_NN ._.
They_PRP have_VBP to_TO go_VB to_TO school_NN and_CC stay_VB in_IN school_NN for_IN half_NN of_IN the_DT day_NN ._.
So_RB ,_, they_PRP do_VBP n't_RB have_VB many_JJ chances_NNS to_TO play_VB around_RP ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, I_PRP am_VBP in_IN grade_NN 12_CD and_CC go_VB high_JJ school_NN and_CC so_RB busy_JJ about_IN doing_VBG a_DT lot_NN of_IN homework_NN and_CC choosing_VBG an_DT university_NN for_IN my_PRP$ future_NN ._.
Although_IN I_PRP have_VBP no_DT time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB my_PRP$ life_NN ,_, I_PRP went_VBD to_TO Rocky_NNP Mountain_NNP with_IN my_PRP$ friends_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, the_DT experience_NN was_VBD not_RB that_IN greate_NN because_IN I_PRP had_VBD to_TO keep_VB thinking_VBG about_IN school_NN and_CC university_NN ._.
Morevoer_NNP ,_, order_NN people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS because_IN they_PRP have_VBP much_JJ time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
Many_JJ order_NN people_NNS quit_VBP their_PRP$ jobs_NNS and_CC have_VB enough_JJ money_NN from_IN the_DT jobs_NNS to_TO relex_NN ._.
So_RB ,_, they_PRP can_MD travel_VB around_IN the_DT world_NN for_IN a_DT long_JJ time_NN rather_RB than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, my_PRP$ homestay_NN mom_NN 's_POS mother_NN is_VBZ staying_VBG in_IN Canada_NNP for_IN four_CD months_NNS ._.
She_PRP can_MD stay_VB even_RB for_IN a_DT year_NN because_IN my_PRP$ homestay_NN mom_NN provides_VBZ food_NN ,_, money_NN ,_, and_CC room_NN for_IN her_PRP ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS usually_RB do_VBP n't_RB have_VB enough_JJ money_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Usually_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS get_VBP money_NN from_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS ._.
Because_IN of_IN that_DT reason_NN ,_, they_PRP may_MD not_RB have_VB enough_JJ money_NN to_TO travel_VB or_CC enjoy_VB ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, order_NN people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS because_IN they_PRP may_MD have_VB much_JJ time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ,_, and_CC possess_VBP not_RB much_JJ tasks_NNS to_TO concern_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO attend_VB school_NN ,_, need_VBP to_TO study_VB all_PDT the_DT time_NN that_IN they_PRP have_VBP ,_, and_CC get_VB not_RB enough_JJ money_NN to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
So_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP n't_RB have_VB many_JJ chances_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, order_NN people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_RBR ._.
