I_PRP disagree_VBP to_TO have_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS because_IN it_PRP is_VBZ confusing_JJ and_CC wasting_VBG time_NN ._.
When_WRB you_PRP want_VBP to_TO have_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS you_PRP wo_MD n't_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO focus_VB on_IN specific_JJ subject_NN ._.
So_RB ,_, you_PRP probaply_RB wo_MD n't_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO determine_VB which_WDT subject_NN you_PRP should_MD choose_VB ._.
In_IN addition_NN to_TO that_DT ,_, you_PRP will_MD be_VB wasting_VBG your_PRP$ time_NN to_TO know_VB about_IN diffrent_JJ subjects_NNS you_PRP batter_VBP save_VB this_DT time_NN for_IN your_PRP$ subject_NN that_IN you_PRP like_IN for_IN example_NN ,_, If_IN I_PRP am_VBP interested_JJ in_IN art_NN I_NN should_MD look_VB for_IN subjects_NNS that_WDT are_VBP related_JJ to_TO art_NN ._.
that_WDT will_MD make_VB me_PRP more_RBR interested_JJ in_IN art_NN and_CC also_RB having_VBG more_JJR knowledge_NN about_IN art_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, If_IN I_PRP am_VBP interested_JJ in_IN many_JJ subjects_NNS I_PRP will_MD spend_VB alot_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO know_VB about_RB many_JJ subjects_NNS that_IN I_PRP am_VBP n't_RB really_RB interested_JJ in_IN ._.
In_IN short_JJ ,_, having_VBG broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS is_VBZ confusing_VBG and_CC wasting_VBG time_NN ._.
