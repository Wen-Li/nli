I_PRP think_VBP older_JJR people_NNS can_MD also_RB enjoy_VB like_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP ._.
so_RB i_FW am_VBP totally_RB disagree_VB with_IN that_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN more_RBR then_RB that_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
its_PRP$ not_RB mandatory_JJ for_IN old_JJ people_NNS to_TO live_VB their_PRP$ life_NN as_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
they_PRP can_MD live_VB their_PRP$ life_NN in_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ way_NN to_TO make_VB it_PRP beautiful_JJ ._.
its_PRP$ totally_RB depend_VB on_IN people_NNS to_TO people_NNS ._.
Firstally_RB i_FW want_VBP to_TO say_VB that_IN older_JJR people_NNS can_MD do_VB any_DT thing_NN like_IN young_JJ people_NNS like_IN if_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO go_VB for_IN a_DT party_NN they_PRP can_MD go_VB ._.
if_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB dance_VB in_IN party_NN they_PRP can_MD do_VB ._.
i_LS had_VBD seen_VBN one_CD old_JJ person_NN in_IN someones_NNS party_NN ._.
these_DT old_JJ age_NN person_NN dance_NN like_IN young_JJ ones_NNS ._.
he_PRP was_VBD so_RB active_JJ ._.
secondly_RB ,_, if_IN young_JJ people_NNS thought_VBD that_IN they_PRP are_VBP active_JJ than_IN old_JJ person_NN ._.
so_IN they_PRP are_VBP wrong_JJ ._.
old_JJ person_NN can_MD do_VB anything_NN like_IN marathon_NN etc._FW it_PRP shows_VBZ that_IN they_PRP can_MD work_VB like_IN young_JJ people_NNS they_PRP can_MD do_VB anything_NN which_WDT young_JJ people_NNS cant_VBP
thirdly_RB its_PRP$ impoosible_NN to_TO say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR enjoy_VB because_IN young_JJ people_NNS always_RB take_VBP decision_NN instantly_RB which_WDT will_MD be_VB not_RB beneficial_JJ to_TO them_PRP because_IN by_IN doing_VBG that_IN can_MD put_VB themslves_NNS in_IN danger_NN but_CC for_IN the_DT case_NN of_IN old_JJ people_NNS they_PRP take_VBP their_PRP$ their_PRP$ decision_NN after_IN thinking_VBG very_RB deeply_RB ._.
take_VB the_DT example_NN of_IN our_PRP$ poltician_NN they_PRP are_VBP totally_RB old_JJ and_CC take_VB decision_NN very_RB politely_RB which_WDT makes_VBZ them_PRP happy_JJ ._.
so_RB i_FW believe_VBP that_IN old_JJ peolpe_NN can_MD also_RB enjoy_VB like_IN young_JJ people_NNS not_RB in_IN the_DT same_JJ manner_NN just_RB like_IN young_JJ one_CD do_VBP but_CC in_IN different_JJ manner_NN so_IN its_PRP$ ridiculos_NNS to_TO say_VB that_IN young_JJ can_MD enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN more_RBR than_IN that_DT old_JJ people_NNS ._.
