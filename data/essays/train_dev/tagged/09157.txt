Some_DT people_NNS agree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR then_RB older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_IN of_IN vast_JJ energy_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP ,_, while_IN some_DT people_NNS claim_VBP that_IN age_NN is_VBZ not_RB important_JJ for_IN enjoyable_JJ life_NN because_IN every_DT part_NN of_IN life_NN has_VBZ its_PRP$ own_JJ enjoyement_NN ._.
After_IN consedering_VBG this_DT question_NN ,_, according_VBG to_TO my_PRP$ age_NN and_CC personal_JJ view_NN ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT idea_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT young_JJ people_NNS 's_POS physical_JJ condition_NN provide_VBP them_PRP to_TO make_VB different_JJ kinds_NNS of_IN sports_NNS such_JJ as_IN snow-boarding_NN ,_, squba_NN diving_NN ._.
Therefore_RB I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS can_MD have_VB more_RBR exciting_JJ hobies_NNS ._.
They_PRP can_MD travel_VB or_CC explore_VB different_JJ places_NNS so_IN I_PRP advocate_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ the_DT very_RB important_JJ part_NN of_IN good_JJ life_NN ._.
Additionally_RB young_JJ people_NNS 's_POS energy_NN help_VB them_PRP to_TO reach_VB their_PRP$ goals_NNS easier_JJR they_PRP can_MD work_VB harder_JJR and_CC can_MD obtain_VB greater_JJR career_NN ._.
Secondly_RB mental_JJ tireness_NN makes_VBZ older_JJR people_NNS to_TO lost_VBN motivation_NN or_CC expectation_NN from_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS has_VBZ energy_NN to_TO try_VB to_TO solve_VB problems_NNS or_CC put_VB up_RP with_IN them_PRP ._.
Thus_RB I_PRP advocate_VBP that_IN this_DT energy_NN is_VBZ the_DT foundation_NN of_IN having_VBG enjoyable_JJ life_NN ._.
Last_JJ but_CC not_RB least_JJS while_IN individuals_NNS are_VBP young_JJ they_PRP have_VBP a_DT temptation_NN to_TO taste_VB different_JJ food_NN or_CC to_TO meet_VB different_JJ people_NNS ._.
for_IN this_DT reasons_NNS happiness_NN and_CC enjoyement_NN are_VBP directly_RB linking_VBG age_NN and_CC this_DT temptation_NN ._.
All_DT in_IN all_DT I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT opinion_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, because_IN young_JJ peple_NNS including_VBG myself_PRP have_VB more_RBR energy_NN in_IN terms_NNS of_IN mental_JJ or_CC physical_JJ ._.
