The_DT reason_NN that_IN the_DT younger_JJR seems_VBZ to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT older_JJR generation_NN is_VBZ that_IN they_PRP seem_VBP to_TO have_VB a_DT greater_JJR ability_NN to_TO make_VB what_WP they_PRP desire_VBP for_IN to_TO come_VB true_JJ ._.
this_DT could_MD be_VB because_IN of_IN the_DT greater_JJR energy_NN levels_NNS that_IN the_DT younger_JJR generation_NN has_VBZ when_WRB compared_VBN to_TO the_DT Old_NNP ._.
The_DT second_JJ reason_NN is_VBZ the_DT flexible_JJ attitute_NN that_IN the_DT young_JJ can_MD wear_VB ._.
they_PRP are_VBP easily_RB adaptable_JJ to_TO the_DT situation_NN and_CC change_NN accordingly_RB and_CC make_VB the_DT most_JJS of_IN the_DT things_NNS ,_, but_CC on_IN the_DT contrary_JJ the_DT old_JJ are_VBP not_RB that_IN flexible_JJ ._.
they_PRP do_VBP not_RB want_VB to_TO change_VB from_IN the_DT normal_JJ routine_JJ work_NN that_IN they_PRP try_VBP to_TO ._.
they_PRP are_VBP very_RB much_RB used_VBN to_TO the_DT old_JJ work_NN that_IN they_PRP always_RB do_VBP and_CC thus_RB they_PRP miss_VBP enjoying_VBG on_IN other_JJ works_NNS which_WDT they_PRP can_MD ._.
example_NN a_DT group_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS when_WRB they_PRP are_VBP out_RB would_MD always_RB like_VB to_TO try_VB out_RP new_JJ things_NNS which_WDT they_PRP have_VBP never_RB before_RB done_VBN but_CC old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP always_RB end_VB up_RP doing_VBG things_NNS that_IN they_PRP have_VBP always_RB been_VBN doing_VBG ._.
but_CC on_IN the_DT contrary_JJ enjoyment_NN would_MD mean_VB differently_RB to_TO different_JJ people_NNS ._.
The_DT old_JJ grandpa_NN of_IN two_CD children_NNS would_MD find_VB great_JJ pleasure_NN in_IN telling_VBG a_DT story_NN to_TO his_PRP$ little_JJ grandchildren_NNS ._.
the_DT old_JJ person_NN would_MD find_VB immence_JJ pleasure_NN in_IN that_DT and_CC that_IN enjoyment_NN can_MD not_RB be_VB neglected_VBN ._.
the_DT young_JJ may_MD consider_VB it_PRP to_TO be_VB boring_JJ but_CC not_RB the_DT same_JJ feeling_NN is_VBZ carried_VBN by_IN all_DT ._.
the_DT old_JJ person_NN would_MD have_VB tried_VBN all_DT that_IN the_DT younger_JJR generation_NN is_VBZ presently_RB doing_VBG and_CC now_RB is_VBZ just_RB enjoying_VBG by_IN looking_VBG at_IN how_WRB the_DT young_JJ do_VBP it_PRP ._.
even_RB that_DT may_MD give_VB immence_NN enjoyment_NN to_TO the_DT old_JJ ._.
the_DT old_JJ person_NN would_MD enjoy_VB to_TO the_DT maximum_NN when_WRB he_PRP is_VBZ around_IN with_IN his_PRP$ family_NN and_CC sharing_VBG things_NNS with_IN them_PRP ._.
thus_RB it_PRP can_MD be_VB concluded_VBN that_IN the_DT meaning_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN is_VBZ diffently_RB viewed_VBN by_IN different_JJ people_NNS and_CC can_MD not_RB be_VB weighted_VBN on_IN superficial_JJ appearences_NNS and_CC has_VBZ deep_JJ meaning_NN ._.
