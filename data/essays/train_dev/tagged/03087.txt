The_DT above_JJ statement_NN that_WDT is_VBZ ``_`` young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ''_'' it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB right_JJ ._.
I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN this_DT statement_NN ._.
Many_JJ of_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP with_IN thier_JJR life_NN than_IN youngers_NNS ._.
In_IN the_DT oldage_NN the_DT people_NNS have_VBP leave_VB all_PDT the_DT burdens_NNS and_CC they_PRP are_VBP spending_VBG their_PRP$ own_JJ interested_JJ work_NN ._.
infact_NN younger_JJR have_VBP more_RBR responsibilities_NNS and_CC work_NN in_IN that_DT age_NN ,_, sometimes_RB they_PRP ca_MD n't_RB enjoy_VB because_IN they_PRP dont_VBP want_VB to_TO loose_VB their_PRP$ official_JJ work_NN ._.
Forexample_NNP ,_, long_JJ toor_NN we_PRP want_VBP to_TO go_VB ,_, in_IN that_DT time_NN spending_NN fifteen_CD days_NNS of_IN time_NN for_IN that_DT ,_, that_DT is_VBZ not_RB sufficiant_JJ for_IN all_PDT the_DT youngers_NNS ._.
some_DT of_IN them_PRP are_VBP missing_VBG for_IN thier_NN own_JJ impertent_JJ things_NNS But_CC old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP spending_VBG maximum_JJ time_NN to_TO that_DT toor_NN ._.
Not_RB only_RB toors_NNS but_CC also_RB in_IN daily_JJ things_NNS ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, Old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP with_IN childrens_NNS and_CC playing_VBG with_IN them_PRP ._.
they_PRP can_MD act_VB like_IN a_DT child_NN like_IN playing_VBG criket_NN ,_, chess_NN etc._FW they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB thier_JJR own_JJ way_NN ._.
old_JJ people_NNS work_VBP in_IN their_PRP$ young_JJ age_NN and_CC then_RB taking_VBG the_DT rest_NN in_IN this_DT old_JJ age_NN with_IN their_PRP$ interesting_JJ activities_NNS and_CC abilities_NNS ._.
I_PRP conclude_VBP that_IN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS also_RB enjoy_VBP ._.
enjoyable_JJ things_NNS and_CC ways_NNS are_VBP different_JJ but_CC they_PRP can_MD also_RB enjoy_VB ._.
not_RB young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS and_CC old_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB themselves_PRP in_IN thier_NN own_JJ ways_NNS ,_, styles_NNS and_CC adjustments_NNS ._.
