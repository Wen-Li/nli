I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN `_`` Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._. '_''
There_EX were_VBD two_CD main_JJ reason_NN for_IN agreeing_VBG this_DT statement_NN ._.
They_PRP were_VBD `_`` variation_NN of_IN choice_NN '_'' and_CC `_`` passionate_JJ '_'' ._.
For_IN the_DT first_JJ reason_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD have_VB more_RBR choice_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Usually_RB older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR opportunity_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ age_NN and_CC also_RB they_PRP have_VBP bad_JJ health_NN than_IN young_JJ do_VBP ._.
Also_RB when_WRB older_JJR get_VBP hurt_VBN ,_, they_PRP are_VBP recovered_VBN slower_JJR than_IN young_JJ do_VBP because_IN of_IN older_JJR 's_POS cells_NNS are_VBP too_RB old_JJ reproduce_VBP themselves_PRP ._.
This_DT cause_NN older_JJR 's_POS choices_NNS became_VBD limited_JJ ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, oldies_NNS can_MD not_RB ride_VB a_DT ski_NN or_CC snow_NN board_NN as_IN youth_NN people_NNS do_VBP dangerous_JJ trick_NN because_IN they_PRP have_VBP more_JJR risk_NN than_IN young_JJ riders_NNS have_VBP ._.
For_IN the_DT second_JJ reason_NN is_VBZ related_VBN with_IN passionate_JJ ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS usually_RB have_VBP more_RBR passion_NN than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
For_IN the_DT reason_NN of_IN this_DT ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ because_IN of_IN hormones_NNS and_CC the_DT different_JJ amount_NN of_IN experience_NN ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR hormones_NNS than_IN young_JJ guys_NNS have_VBP and_CC hormones_NNS is_VBZ one_CD of_IN scientific_JJ catalyst_NN that_WDT made_VBD exciting_JJ to_TO the_DT brain_NN ._.
For_IN the_DT result_NN of_IN this_DT ,_, even_RB if_IN young_JJ and_CC old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP sex_NN with_IN a_DT same_JJ situation_NN ,_, their_PRP$ excitement_NN are_VBP different_JJ because_IN of_IN amount_NN of_IN hormones_NNS ._.
For_IN passionate_JJ ,_, amount_NN of_IN experience_NN also_RB affect_VBP a_DT lot_NN ._.
Usually_RB beginner_NN has_VBZ more_JJR exciting_JJ than_IN veteran_NN does_VBZ ._.
For_IN example_NN of_IN this_DT ,_, when_WRB two_CD different_JJ type_NN of_IN people_NNS have_VBP same_JJ girl_NN friend_NN ,_, the_DT amount_NN of_IN excitings_NNS are_VBP different_JJ between_IN ladies_NNS guy_NN and_CC the_DT person_NN who_WP never_RB had_VBD girl_NN friend_NN because_IN ladies_NNS guy_NN already_RB has_VBZ experience_NN about_IN having_VBG girl_NN friend_NN ._.
This_DT relationship_NN does_VBZ not_RB change_VB a_DT lot_NN between_IN old_JJ people_NNS and_CC young_JJ people_NNS because_IN old_JJ people_NNS usually_RB have_VBP more_RBR experience_NN than_IN youth_NN people_NNS have_VBP ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS can_MD also_RB enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN ,_, but_CC young_JJ people_NNS usually_RB can_MD get_VB more_JJR exciting_JJ or_CC enjoyness_NN from_IN same_JJ activities_NNS ._.
They_PRP caused_VBD from_IN a_DT lot_NN of_IN reason_NN and_CC some_DT of_IN them_PRP based_VBN on_IN scientific_JJ data_NNS and_CC psychological_JJ data_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, this_DT does_VBZ n't_RB mean_VB old_JJ people_NNS ca_MD n't_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN even_RB if_IN the_DT exciteness_NN is_VBZ different_JJ with_IN youth_NN group_NN ,_, they_PRP still_RB can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
