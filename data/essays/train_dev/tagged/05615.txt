I_PRP totally_RB agree_VBP with_IN this_DT statement_NN because_IN I_PRP think_VBP that_IN ,_, since_IN that_DT kind_NN of_IN people_NNS already_RB are_VBP successful_JJ ,_, they_PRP will_MD be_VB less_RBR hesitating_VBG to_TO try_VB something_NN new_JJ because_IN they_PRP have_VBP their_PRP$ first_JJ success_NN has_VBZ a_DT backup_NN ._.
Even_RB their_PRP$ new_JJ project_NN does_VBZ not_RB work_VB out_RP ,_, they_PRP will_MD not_RB be_VB hopeless_JJ because_IN they_PRP already_RB had_VBD their_PRP$ time_NN and_CC they_PRP think_VBP ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, that_IN it_PRP will_MD come_VB back_RB if_IN they_PRP try_VBP harder_RBR contrary_JJ to_TO someone_NN who_WP has_VBZ never_RB succeeded_VBN in_IN something_NN who_WP will_MD take_VB less_JJR risks_NNS because_IN ,_, if_IN he_PRP fails_VBZ ,_, he_PRP will_MD loose_VB everything_NN ._.
I_PRP also_RB think_VBP that_DT successful_JJ poeple_NN have_VBP some_DT kind_NN of_IN confidence_NN resulting_VBG of_IN their_PRP$ first_JJ success_NN because_IN they_PRP have_VBP in_IN mind_NN how_WRB they_PRP managed_VBD to_TO succeed_VB and_CC they_PRP know_VBP how_WRB to_TO do_VB it_PRP again_RB ._.
According_VBG to_TO me_PRP ,_, when_WRB you_PRP believe_VBP in_IN something_NN and_CC you_PRP have_VBP faith_NN in_IN it_PRP ,_, you_PRP can_MD reach_VB it_PRP in_IN an_DT easier_JJR way_NN than_IN if_IN you_PRP do_VBP n't_RB ._.
We_PRP could_MD take_VB the_DT example_NN of_IN the_DT chairman_NN of_IN a_DT big_JJ company_NN who_WP starts_VBZ a_DT new_JJ activity_NN different_JJ than_IN his_PRP$ first_JJ one_CD or_CC a_DT famous_JJ singer_NN who_WP starts_VBZ an_DT actor_NN career_NN ._.
Indeed_RB ,_, lots_NNS of_IN already_RB famous_JJ singers_NNS have_VBP tried_VBN to_TO succeed_VB in_IN the_DT movie_NN entertainement_NN and_CC in_IN the_DT most_JJS part_NN of_IN them_PRP ,_, they_PRP have_VBP ._.
An_DT actor_NN has_VBZ n't_RB become_VB one_CD of_IN the_DT most_RBS recorded_JJ president_NN of_IN the_DT United_NNP States_NNPS of_IN America_NNP ?_.
In_IN order_NN to_TO conclude_VB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN ,_, even_RB if_IN we_PRP can_MD predict_VB a_DT success_NN ,_,
