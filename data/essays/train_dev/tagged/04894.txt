Today_NN there_EX are_VBP more_RBR number_NN of_IN cars_NNS on_IN the_DT roads_NNS then_RB perhaps_RB the_DT people_NNS walking_VBG on_IN the_DT roads_NNS which_WDT clearly_RB means_VBZ that_IN most_JJS of_IN the_DT people_NNS own_VBP a_DT car_NN ._.
But_CC I_PRP firmly_RB believe_VBP that_IN in_IN twenty_CD years_NNS from_IN now_RB fewer_JJR number_NN of_IN cars_NNS would_MD be_VB running_VBG on_IN the_DT roads_NNS ._.
This_DT would_MD directly_RB imply_VB that_IN the_DT traffic_NN conditions_NNS would_MD improve_VB in_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
Governments_NNS everywhere_RB are_VBP taking_VBG effective_JJ steps_NNS to_TO improve_VB the_DT public_JJ transportation_NN system_NN which_WDT would_MD mean_VB incorporation_NN of_IN buses_NNS ,_, metro_NN services_NNS and_CC sky_NN trains_NNS in_IN the_DT public_JJ transport_NN system_NN ._.
So_RB in_IN times_NNS to_TO come_VB ,_, people_NNS would_MD prefer_VB to_TO move_VB through_IN public_JJ transport_NN as_IN it_PRP would_MD be_VB hassle_NN free_JJ ,_, time_NN saving_NN and_CC money_NN saving_NN ._.
In_IN times_NNS to_TO come_VB the_DT prices_NNS of_IN the_DT fuel_NN like_IN petroleum_NN and_CC diesel_NN are_VBP expected_VBN to_TO rise_VB up_RP drastically_RB which_WDT would_MD mean_VB that_IN only_RB few_JJ people_NNS would_MD have_VB the_DT capability_NN to_TO afford_VB it_PRP ._.
So_RB only_RB very_RB few_JJ people_NNS would_MD be_VB in_IN a_DT position_NN to_TO travel_VB in_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ cars_NNS ._.
This_DT would_MD also_RB cause_VB reduction_NN in_IN the_DT number_NN of_IN cars_NNS in_IN years_NNS to_TO come_VB as_IN most_JJS of_IN the_DT people_NNS would_MD have_VB to_TO look_VB for_IN alternative_JJ options_NNS to_TO travel_VB in_IN order_NN to_TO save_VB money_NN ._.
People_NNS today_NN are_VBP beoming_VBG more_RBR aware_JJ about_IN the_DT enviornmental_JJ damages_NNS caused_VBN by_IN the_DT harmful_JJ gases_NNS emitted_VBN from_IN vehicles_NNS such_JJ as_IN cars_NNS ._.
So_RB more_JJR and_CC more_JJR people_NNS are_VBP opting_VBG for_IN options_NNS like_IN car_NN pools_NNS in_IN case_NN several_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO go_VB to_TO the_DT same_JJ place_NN ._.
This_DT means_VBZ lesser_JJR number_NN of_IN cars_NNS running_VBG on_IN the_DT roads_NNS ._.
Also_RB people_NNS are_VBP preferring_VBG public_JJ transport_NN for_IN this_DT reason_NN of_IN enviornmental_JJ damages_NNS ._.
So_RB this_DT awareness_NN about_IN the_DT enviornmental_JJ damages_NNS would_MD continue_VB to_TO increase_VB manifolds_NNS in_IN times_NNS to_TO come_VB and_CC hence_RB lesser_JJR number_NN of_IN cars_NNS would_MD run_VB on_IN the_DT roads_NNS in_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
So_IN the_DT possible_JJ conclusion_NN can_MD be_VB that_IN in_IN the_DT present_JJ scenario_NN almost_RB every_DT earning_VBG individual_JJ owns_VBZ a_DT car_NN due_JJ to_TO reasons_NNS of_IN comfort_NN and_CC also_RB because_IN cars_NNS are_VBP considered_VBN a_DT status_NN symbol_NN ._.
But_CC in_IN times_NNS to_TO come_VB people_NNS would_MD prefer_VB other_JJ means_NNS of_IN transportation_NN rather_RB than_IN moving_VBG in_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ cars_NNS because_IN of_IN the_DT better_JJR public_JJ transportation_NN system_NN ,_, high_JJ fuel_NN prices_NNS and_CC enviornmental_JJ damages_NNS ._.
