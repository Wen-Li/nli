When_WRB you_PRP ask_VBP me_PRP ,_, if_IN I_PRP agree_VBP or_CC disagree_VBP this_DT statement_NN my_PRP$ answer_NN would_MD be_VB :_: both_DT ._.
On_IN the_DT one_CD hand_NN are_VBP many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS active_JJ community-members_NNS ._.
They_PRP help_VBP for_IN an_DT example_NN in_IN sportclubs_NNS ,_, take_VB care_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS or_CC are_VBP in_IN a_DT political_JJ party_NN ._.
All_PDT these_DT activities_NNS support_VBP the_DT community_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS don_VBP ``_`` t_NN care_NN about_IN the_DT community_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP a_DT kind_NN of_IN egoistic_JJ and_CC the_DT reasons_NNS vary_VBP ._.
Often_RB you_PRP hear_VBP from_IN young_JJ people_NNS that_IN they_PRP don_VBP ``_`` t_NN have_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ community_NN ,_, because_IN they_PRP have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN work_NN to_TO do_VB ._.
But_CC I_PRP think_VBP this_DT is_VBZ not_RB the_DT entire_JJ truth_NN ._.
Some_DT people_NNS are_VBP afraid_JJ of_IN taking_VBG responsibilty_NN for_IN something_NN or_CC can_MD ``_`` t_NN act_NN in_IN teams_NNS ._.
Moreover_RB they_PRP are_VBP thinking_VBG only_RB of_IN time_NN or_CC money_NN and_CC forget_VB that_IN it_PRP can_MD be_VB a_DT great_JJ feeling_NN to_TO help_VB others_NNS ._.
Mostly_RB these_DT people_NNS are_VBP great_JJ critics_NNS but_CC they_PRP don_VBP ``_`` t_NN try_VB to_TO improve_VB things_NNS by_IN helping_VBG ._.
My_PRP$ guess_NN is_VBZ they_PRP are_VBP lazy_JJ too_RB ._.
Advantages_NNS of_IN helping_VBG in_IN your_PRP$ community_NN are_VBP that_IN you_PRP meet_VBP interesting_JJ people_NNS and_CC learn_VB some_DT skills_NNS ,_, like_IN speaking_VBG in_IN front_NN of_IN a_DT group_NN or_CC teamwork_NN ,_, that_IN no_DT teacher_NN can_MD teach_VB you_PRP ._.
Although_IN it_PRP cost_VB you_PRP some_DT leisure_NN it_PRP can_MD be_VB fun_NN ._.
In_IN summary_NN I_PRP think_VBP it_PRP ``_`` s_NNS good_JJ for_IN your_PRP$ community_NN as_RB well_RB as_IN for_IN your_PRP$ character_NN to_TO say_VB yes_UH to_TO a_DT task_NN and_CC help_NN in_IN a_DT community_NN ._.
