In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ,_, although_IN both_DT of_IN them_PRP have_VBP their_PRP$ own_JJ unique_JJ ways_NNS of_IN enjoyment_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS mostly_RB spend_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN away_RB from_IN home_NN enjoying_VBG outside_RB ,_, whereas_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP most_JJS of_IN their_PRP$ time_NN spendind_NN at_IN home_NN itself_PRP ._.
One_CD reason_NN may_MD be_VB that_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB strong_JJ enough_RB to_TO move_VB around_RB at_IN that_DT age_NN or_CC may_MD be_VB they_PRP have_VBP enough_RB spent_VBN their_PRP$ time_NN outside_IN during_IN their_PRP$ young_JJ age_NN ._.
Younger_JJR generations_NNS are_VBP involved_VBN with_IN studying_VBG and_CC career_NN development_NN ,_, where_WRB most_JJS of_IN their_PRP$ teenage_JJ is_VBZ runs_VBZ off_RP ._.
In_IN contrast_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS must_MD have_VB either_CC retired_VBN by_IN then_RB and_CC so_RB they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB without_IN any_DT thinking_VBG for_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, responsibilities_NNS arrest_VBP the_DT younger_JJR generations_NNS from_IN enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ own_JJ life_NN ._.
This_DT does_VBZ not_RB happen_VB with_IN older_JJR people_NNS as_IN all_DT their_PRP$ responsibilities_NNS might_MD have_VB been_VBN finished_VBN by_IN then_RB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, a_DT younger_JJR person_NN working_NN has_VBZ support_VB his_PRP$ family_NN finacially_RB and_CC should_MD be_VB responsible_JJ towards_IN everyone_NN in_IN the_DT family_NN ._.
so_RB ,_, most_JJS of_IN his_PRP$ time_NN has_VBZ been_VBN spent_VBN in_IN accomplishing_VBG his_PRP$ goals_NNS and_CC supporting_VBG the_DT family_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_RBR because_IN of_IN lack_NN of_IN obligations_NNS at_IN their_PRP$ age_NN ._.
Although_IN ,_, younger_JJR people_NNS pass_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN with_IN friends_NNS ,_, they_PRP do_VBP only_RB occasionally_RB ._.
First_JJ few_JJ years_NNS of_IN teenage_JJ is_VBZ spent_VBN in_IN studying_VBG ,_, after_IN graduating_VBG jod_NN search_NN starts_VBZ ._.
Later_RB ,_, work_NN tensions_NNS builts_VBZ up_RP stressing_VBG in_IN all_DT aspects_NNS ._.
So_RB ,_, there_EX is_VBZ hardly_RB anytime_RB left_VBN over_RP for_IN joy_NN in_IN life_NN ._.
In_IN contrast_NN ,_, as_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP already_RB passed_VBN through_IN these_DT stages_NNS of_IN life_NN ,_, they_PRP are_VBP absolutely_RB free_JJ of_IN such_JJ work_NN pressures_NNS and_CC hence_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN to_TO the_DT maximum_NN extent_NN ._.
Another_DT factor_NN is_VBZ money_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP financially_RB more_RBR strong_JJ than_IN young_JJ people_NNS and_CC so_RB spend_VB as_RB much_JJ as_IN they_PRP can_MD because_RB ,_, they_PRP dont_VBP need_VB to_TO give_VB explanation_NN for_IN the_DT money_NN they_PRP spent_VBD as_RB do_VB the_DT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
To_TO conclude_VB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR than_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
