As_IN time_NN goes_VBZ by_IN ,_, lifestyle_NN has_VBZ changed_VBN a_DT lot_NN back_RB than_IN in_IN the_DT 1970_CD 's_POS ._.
some_DT people_NNS believe_VBP that_IN yong_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
i_LS strongly_RB agree_VBP with_IN this_DT statement_NN as_IN following_VBG supports_NNS ._.
however_RB ,_, i_FW have_VBP to_TO say_VB that_IN it_PRP depends_VBZ on_IN viewers_NNS who_WP are_VBP young_JJ people_NNS or_CC older_JJR people_NNS ._.
first_RB of_IN all_DT ,_, for_IN example_NN ,_, my_PRP$ father_NN just_RB enjoy_VB playing_VBG golf_NN whenever_WRB he_PRP has_VBZ time_NN ,_, However_RB ,_, i_FW do_VBP n't_RB like_VB golf_NN because_IN it_PRP feels_VBZ like_IN boring_VBG to_TO me._VB so_RB i_FW usually_RB go_VBP to_TO sea_NN to_TO swim_VB for_IN summer_NN and_CC go_VB for_IN snowboarding_VBG for_IN winter_NN with_IN my_PRP$ friends_NNS ._.
i_LS think_VB the_DT reason_NN is_VBZ that_IN older_JJR people_NNS did_VBD n't_RB have_VB chance_NN to_TO have_VB those_DT sports_NNS which_WDT i_FW enjoy_VB ._.
basically_RB ,_, because_IN i_FW am_VBP young_JJ ,_, i_FW can_MD have_VB more_RBR chance_NN to_TO do_VB something_NN which_WDT i_FW prefer_VBP to_TO than_IN my_PRP$ father_NN ._.
in_IN addition_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS usually_RB like_IN doing_VBG non-activity_JJ action_NN such_JJ as_IN reading_NN ,_, watching_VBG movie_NN ,_, seeding_NN ._.
however_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS usually_RB like_IN doing_VBG activity_NN action_NN such_JJ as_IN soccer_NN ,_, basketball_NN ._.
actually_RB ,_, i_FW think_VBP that_IN these_DT kinds_NNS of_IN theories_NNS are_VBP natural_JJ rule_NN ._.
my_PRP$ point_NN is_VBZ that_IN between_IN older_JJR people_NNS and_CC young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP different_JJ thoughts_NNS and_CC lifestyles_NNS ._.
finally_RB ,_, many_JJ years_NNS ago_RB ,_, people_NNS have_VBP to_TO work_VB to_TO survive_VB without_IN breaking_VBG ._.
for_IN example_NN ,_, my_PRP$ grandfather_NN used_VBN to_TO work_VB outside_JJ untill_NN he_PRP died_VBD ._.
this_DT effect_NN caused_VBN by_IN social_JJ circumstance_NN ._.
however_RB ,_, he_PRP really_RB enjoyed_VBD his_PRP$ work_NN for_IN life_NN ._.
As_IN you_PRP know_VBP ,_, at_IN that_DT time_NN many_JJ people_NNS did_VBD for_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
however_RB ,_, as_IN i_FW mentioned_VBN above_IN ,_, everything_NN is_VBZ changed_VBN by_IN time_NN ._.
of_IN course_NN ,_, if_IN i_FW have_VBP son_NN ,_, my_PRP$ son_NN will_MD enjoy_VB life_NN much_RB more_RBR than_IN me._VB that_DT 's_VBZ why_WRB i_FW really_RB agree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
