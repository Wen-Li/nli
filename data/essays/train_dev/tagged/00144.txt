Does_VBZ young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VB ?_.
If_IN I_PRP am_VBP asked_VBN to_TO answer_VB this_DT question_NN ,_, I_PRP would_MD say_VB no_DT ._.
Many_JJ older_JJR people_NNS think_VBP and_CC say_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP freedom_NN and_CC they_PRP can_MD do_VB whatever_WDT they_PRP want_VBP ._.
However_RB ,_, that_DT is_VBZ not_RB true_JJ for_IN young_JJ people_NNS because_IN there_EX are_VBP many_JJ things_NNS to_TO do_VB for_IN young_JJ people_NNS befor_VBP they_PRP become_VB an_DT adult_NN ._.
As_IN a_DT young_JJ person_NN ,_, I_PRP feel_VBP like_IN I_PRP have_VBP very_RB limited_JJ life_NN ._.
Teens_NNS go_VBP to_TO school_NN everyday_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP to_TO do_VB their_PRP$ homeworks_NNS and_CC projects_NNS ,_, and_CC they_PRP also_RB have_VBP to_TO prepare_VB to_TO go_VB to_TO college_NN ._.
Preparing_VBG for_IN the_DT college_NN gives_VBZ a_DT lot_NN of_IN stress_NN to_TO young_JJ people_NNS because_IN most_JJS of_IN the_DT students_NNS want_VBP to_TO go_VB to_TO good_JJ colleges_NNS ._.
In_IN order_NN to_TO go_VB to_TO good_JJ college_NN ,_, they_PRP need_VBP to_TO work_VB hard_RB in_IN school_NN and_CC also_RB they_PRP need_VBP to_TO do_VB many_JJ extracurricular_JJ activities_NNS ._.
Even_RB though_IN they_PRP have_VBP something_NN that_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB ,_, either_CC there_EX are_VBP no_DT free_JJ time_NN for_IN them_PRP or_CC there_EX are_VBP things_NNS that_WDT is_VBZ not_RB allowed_VBN to_TO young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Also_RB ,_, in_IN order_NN to_TO achieve_VB their_PRP$ goals_NNS in_IN the_DT future_NN ,_, it_PRP seems_VBZ it_PRP is_VBZ necessary_JJ to_TO go_VB to_TO college_NN and_CC study_NN in_IN the_DT field_NN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO study_VB ._.
Without_IN that_DT education_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ hard_JJ to_TO get_VB a_DT job_NN in_IN the_DT high_JJ position_NN or_CC to_TO earn_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN money_NN ._.
Not_RB only_RB that_IN ,_, but_CC also_RB they_PRP need_VBP to_TO listen_VB to_TO their_PRP$ parents_NNS because_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB adult_JJ yet_RB ._.
If_IN the_DT parent_NN do_VBP n't_RB agree_VB with_IN something_NN that_IN you_PRP want_VBP to_TO achieve_VB ,_, you_PRP need_VBP to_TO either_CC give_VB up_RP or_CC change_VB your_PRP$ mind_NN ._.
There_EX is_VBZ actually_RB no_DT freedom_NN for_IN teens_NNS at_IN school_NN or_CC at_IN home_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR able_JJ to_TO do_VB whatever_WDT they_PRP want_VBP because_IN they_PRP have_VBP freedom_NN and_CC they_PRP do_VBP n't_RB have_VB financial_JJ problem_NN because_IN most_JJS of_IN them_PRP work_VBP ._.
Basically_RB ,_, they_PRP can_MD buy_VB anything_NN they_PRP want_VBP without_IN asking_VBG or_CC getting_VBG permission_NN to_TO their_PRP$ parents_NNS ,_, and_CC they_PRP can_MD also_RB do_VB whatever_WDT they_PRP want_VBP without_IN being_VBG pressured_VBN under_IN parents_NNS ._.
We_PRP do_VBP n't_RB exactly_RB know_VB when_WRB a_DT young_JJ person_NN becomes_VBZ a_DT older_JJR person_NN ,_, but_CC what_WP we_PRP know_VBP is_VBZ that_IN when_WRB a_DT person_NN becomes_VBZ old_JJ enough_RB ,_, they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN doing_VBG whatever_WDT they_PRP want_VBP and_CC they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR freedom_NN than_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
