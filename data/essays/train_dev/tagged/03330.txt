Some_DT people_NNS believe_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ better_JJR to_TO have_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS whereas_IN others_NNS support_VBP to_TO specialize_VB in_IN one_CD subject_NN ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, notwithstanding_IN a_DT person_NN should_MD have_VB knowledge_NN of_IN all_DT related_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS ,_, to_TO specialize_VB in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN is_VBZ most_RBS appropriate_JJ in_IN compliance_NN with_IN this_DT century_NN ._.
We_PRP are_VBP living_VBG in_IN a_DT century_NN in_IN which_WDT it_PRP is_VBZ easy_JJ for_IN everyone_NN to_TO reach_VB information_NN about_IN nearly_RB anything_NN at_IN anytime_RB they_PRP wish_VBP ._.
However_RB this_DT knowledge_NN is_VBZ generally_RB too_RB surface_NN based_VBN ._.
Therefore_RB the_DT level_NN of_IN knowledge_NN determines_VBZ the_DT difference_NN between_IN an_DT academic_JJ person_NN and_CC non-academic_JJ person_NN ._.
To_TO specialize_VB in_IN one_CD academic_JJ subject_JJ prevents_VBZ a_DT person_NN from_IN spreading_VBG his_PRP$ energy_NN ,_, effort_NN and_CC time_NN to_TO too_RB many_JJ things_NNS at_IN the_DT same_JJ time_NN and_CC helps_VBZ to_TO contrate_VB on_IN that_DT one_CD subject_JJ whereas_IN broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS shall_MD only_RB result_VB with_IN a_DT lot_NN of_IN unnecessary_JJ ,_, unclear_JJ and_CC ambiguos_NNS knowledge_NN which_WDT ends_VBZ up_RP with_IN no_DT contribution_NN to_TO academics_NNS at_IN all_DT ._.
The_DT areas_NNS that_WDT agrees_VBZ to_TO specializaton_NN has_VBZ been_VBN increased_VBN by_IN the_DT development_NN of_IN technology_NN ._.
Science_NNP has_VBZ been_VBN seperated_VBN to_TO much_RB more_JJR branches_NNS than_IN it_PRP was_VBD fifty_CD years_NNS ago_RB ._.
For_IN example_NN principles_NNS such_JJ as_IN law_NN and_CC medicine_NN encourages_VBZ people_NNS to_TO specialize_VB in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN since_IN it_PRP is_VBZ impossible_JJ to_TO learn_VB to_TO a_DT subject_JJ deeply_RB with_IN a_DT surface_NN based_VBN knowledge_NN ._.
Thus_RB ,_, i_FW believe_VBP that_IN considering_VBG the_DT easiness_NN and_CC quickness_NN at_IN reaching_VBG information_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ better_JJR to_TO specialize_VB in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN in_IN order_NN to_TO draw_VB a_DT difference_NN between_IN academic_JJ and_CC non_JJ academic_JJ ._.
