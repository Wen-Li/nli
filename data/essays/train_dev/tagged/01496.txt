I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN because_IN I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR opportunities_NNS in_IN life_NN ._.
Three_CD major_JJ points_NNS convince_VBP me_PRP that_IN life_NN as_IN a_DT young_JJ person_NN has_VBZ more_JJR to_TO offer_VB ._.
At_IN first_RB the_DT body_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS allows_VBZ much_RB more_RBR stress_NN ,_, thereby_RB offering_VBG the_DT possibility_NN for_IN various_JJ activities_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN you_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB most_RBS sports_NNS and_CC other_JJ leisure_NN activities_NNS without_IN endangering_VBG yourself_PRP physically_RB ._.
You_PRP are_VBP also_RB sound_JJ enough_JJ to_TO travel_VB for_IN a_DT longer_JJR time_NN like_IN for_IN example_NN flying_VBG to_TO far_RB away_RB continents_NNS whereas_IN you_PRP might_MD not_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO do_VB that_DT anymore_RB from_IN a_DT specific_JJ age_NN on_IN because_IN of_IN medical_JJ problems_NNS such_JJ as_IN a_DT low_JJ blood_NN pressure_NN ._.
As_IN a_DT second_JJ point_NN life_NN as_IN a_DT young_JJ person_NN offers_VBZ numerous_JJ options_NNS for_IN your_PRP$ future_NN both_CC in_IN social_JJ and_CC professional_JJ view_NN ._.
You_PRP may_MD have_VB dates_NNS and_CC can_MD search_VB for_IN the_DT boy_NN or_CC girl_NN of_IN your_PRP$ dreams_NNS unless_IN you_PRP have_VBP not_RB met_VBN a_DT marriage_NN partner_NN yet_RB ._.
Additionally_RB you_PRP can_MD choose_VB the_DT career_NN that_WDT suits_VBZ your_PRP$ personal_JJ preferences_NNS and_CC even_RB more_RBR important_JJ ,_, you_PRP might_MD try_VB out_RP more_JJR than_IN one_CD profession_NN because_IN of_IN your_PRP$ young_JJ age_NN ._.
These_DT various_JJ choices_NNS may_MD make_VB you_PRP feel_VB happy_JJ because_IN you_PRP can_MD look_VB forward_RB to_TO your_PRP$ future_NN ._.
The_DT last_JJ very_RB important_JJ point_NN is_VBZ that_IN you_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB so_RB much_JJ responsibility_NN while_IN being_VBG young_JJ ._.
As_IN an_DT older_JJR person_NN you_PRP might_MD have_VB to_TO care_VB for_IN a_DT family_NN or_CC employees_NNS ,_, this_DT may_MD generate_VB stress_NN and_CC makes_VBZ you_PRP dependant_JJ to_TO certain_JJ places_NNS or_CC people_NNS ._.
When_WRB you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ,_, you_PRP might_MD move_VB to_TO another_DT city_NN or_CC even_RB country_NN more_RBR easily_RB ._.
You_PRP are_VBP also_RB allowed_VBN to_TO make_VB mistakes_NNS because_IN you_PRP have_VBP time_NN to_TO try_VB it_PRP again_RB and_CC grow_VB with_IN the_DT challenge_NN ._.
Not_RB everything_NN that_IN you_PRP do_VBP has_VBZ to_TO be_VB reasonable_JJ ,_, for_IN example_NN buying_VBG an_DT expensive_JJ car_NN or_CC having_VBG a_DT dangerous_JJ hobby_NN like_IN parachuting_VBG or_CC whitewater-rafting_NN ._.
I_PRP am_VBP certain_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ advantages_NNS like_IN good_JJ health_NN ,_, many_JJ options_NNS and_CC less_JJR responsibilties_NNS to_TO take_VB care_NN off_IN ._.
