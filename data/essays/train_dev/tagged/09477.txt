Before_IN discussing_VBG this_DT statement_NN ,_, we_PRP have_VBP to_TO think_VB about_IN what_WP ``_`` enjoying_VBG life_NN ''_'' means_VBZ ._.
It_PRP could_MD be_VB simply_RB ``_`` having_VBG fun_NN ._. ''_''
If_IN it_PRP is_VBZ the_DT case_NN ,_, we_PRP have_VBP to_TO say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
But_CC I_PRP want_VBP to_TO say_VB that_IN ``_`` enjoying_VBG life_NN ''_'' can_MD be_VB attained_VBN after_IN we_PRP recognize_VBP ``_`` the_DT meaning_NN of_IN life_NN ._. ''_''
When_WRB we_PRP follow_VBP my_PRP$ own_JJ definition_NN of_IN ``_`` enjoying_VBG life_NN ,_, ''_'' then_RB we_PRP can_MD say_VB that_IN old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS may_MD have_VB fun_NN during_IN their_PRP$ school_NN life_NN by_IN discussing_VBG topics_NNS that_IN they_PRP newly_RB discovered_VBD ,_, traveling_VBG foreign_JJ countries_NNS or_CC simply_RB going_VBG out_RP with_IN friends_NNS ._.
However_RB I_PRP want_VBP to_TO say_VB that_IN these_DT experiences_NNS would_MD be_VB merely_RB ``_`` fun_NN ''_'' rather_RB than_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
Because_IN ``_`` life_NN ''_'' is_VBZ such_JJ a_DT serious_JJ thing_NN ,_, it_PRP will_MD take_VB time_NN for_IN young_JJ people_NNS to_TO recognize_VB the_DT meaning_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
Also_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP busy_JJ and_CC poor_JJ ._.
They_PRP have_VBP too_RB much_JJ things_NNS to_TO do_VB to_TO prepare_VB for_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
They_PRP do_VBP n't_RB have_VB enough_JJ money_NN to_TO spend_VB to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS ,_, on_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, through_IN their_PRP$ abundant_JJ experience_NN ,_, would_MD get_VB their_PRP$ own_JJ idea_NN of_IN ``_`` life_NN ._. ''_''
Only_RB after_IN they_PRP have_VBP some_DT idea_NN of_IN life_NN ,_, they_PRP will_MD think_VB about_IN what_WP would_MD enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ lives_NNS mean_VB ._.
It_PRP could_MD be_VB helping_VBG others_NNS ,_, reading_VBG books_NNS and_CC discuss_VBP about_RB ,_, or_CC travel_VB to_TO diffenent_JJ countries_NNS ._.
But_CC their_PRP$ experiences_NNS would_MD not_RB merely_RB fun_NN ._.
We_PRP could_MD say_VB these_DT experiences_NNS are_VBP ``_`` enjoying_VBG lives_NNS ._. ''_''
Facinating_VBG thing_NN for_IN older_JJR people_NNS would_MD be_VB that_IN they_PRP have_VBP time_NN and_CC money_NN to_TO spend_VB for_IN enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
As_IN a_DT conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO say_VB that_IN old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
So_IN I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN ._.
