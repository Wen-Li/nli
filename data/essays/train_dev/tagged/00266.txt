I_PRP think_VBP young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
This_DT can_MD be_VB said_VBN from_IN my_PRP$ own_JJ experiences_NNS and_CC from_IN what_WP I_PRP see_VBP from_IN other_JJ people_NNS 's_POS experiences_NNS ._.
One_CD of_IN the_DT reasons_NNS I_PRP think_VBP this_DT is_VBZ because_RB ,_, younger_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR power_NN or_CC stamina_NN to_TO do_VB things_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, if_IN a_DT 50-year_JJ old_JJ person_NN were_VBD to_TO play_VB baseball_NN ,_, he/she_NN would_MD have_VB a_DT hard_JJ time_NN in_IN hitting_VBG the_DT ball_NN and_CC running_VBG to_TO the_DT base_NN ,_, and_CC catching_VBG a_DT ball_NN and_CC throwing_VBG it_PRP ._.
As_IN for_IN the_DT younger_JJR people_NNS ,_, they_PRP still_RB have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN strength_NN and_CC energy_NN left_VBD to_TO move_VB around_RB and_CC use_VB as_RB much_JJ power_NN as_IN they_PRP want_VBP ._.
Younger_JJR people_NNS have_VBP an_DT advantage_NN that_IN they_PRP are_VBP able_JJ to_TO move_VB quicker_JJR and_CC stronger_JJR compared_VBN to_TO older_JJR people_NNS ,_, so_IN I_PRP think_VBP younger_JJR people_NNS would_MD enjoy_VB sports_NNS more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ own_JJ experience_NN ,_, my_PRP$ dad_NN and_CC I_PRP were_VBD playing_VBG catch_NN ._.
I_PRP could_MD throw_VB really_RB fast_RB at_IN my_PRP$ dad_NN ,_, but_CC my_PRP$ dad_NN could_MD n't_RB throw_VB that_DT fast_RB ._.
I_PRP think_VBP this_DT was_VBD because_IN he_PRP got_VBD tired_VBN faster_RBR than_IN I_PRP did_VBD ,_, or_CC he_PRP did_VBD n't_RB have_VB much_JJ strength_NN so_IN he_PRP could_MD n't_RB throw_VB a_DT ball_NN like_IN he_PRP used_VBD to_TO when_WRB he_PRP was_VBD young_JJ ._.
We_PRP can_MD see_VB that_IN if_IN we_PRP get_VBP older_JJR ,_, our_PRP$ choices_NNS of_IN what_WP we_PRP can_MD do_VB will_MD decrease_VB ._.
Another_DT example_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS is_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS can_MD fool_VB around_IN more_JJR compared_VBN to_TO older_JJR people_NNS ._.
This_DT can_MD be_VB said_VBN because_IN if_IN an_DT adult_JJ were_VBD to_TO jump_VB around_IN naked_JJ in_IN his/her_NN yard_NN ,_, he_PRP would_MD get_VB caught_VBN by_IN the_DT police_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, if_IN a_DT 5-year_JJ old_JJ boy_NN were_VBD to_TO jump_VB around_IN naked_JJ in_IN his_PRP$ yard_NN ,_, he_PRP obviously_RB would_MD n't_RB get_VB caught_VBN ._.
As_IN you_PRP can_MD see_VB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR restrictions_NNS compared_VBN to_TO young_JJ people_NNS ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS will_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
This_DT can_MD be_VB said_VBN because_IN younger_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR opportunities_NNS to_TO do_VB certain_JJ things_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS like_IN play_VBP a_DT sport_NN ,_, or_CC go_VB naked_JJ in_IN your_PRP$ yard_NN ._.
I_PRP have_VBP never_RB been_VBN old_JJ before_RB ,_, but_CC in_IN fact_NN ,_, I_PRP am_VBP having_VBG the_DT greatest_JJS time_NN in_IN my_PRP$ life_NN now_RB ,_, YOUNG_NNP !!_IN
