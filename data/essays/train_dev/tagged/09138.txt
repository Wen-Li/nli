There_EX are_VBP widespread_JJ opinions_NNS on_IN the_DT responsibilities_NNS and_CC expectations_NNS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS today_NN still_RB spend_VBP sufficient_JJ time_NN helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
But_CC before_IN beginning_VBG the_DT reasoning_NN ,_, ``_`` young_JJ people_NNS ''_'' and_CC ``_`` helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ''_'' needs_VBZ to_TO be_VB defined_VBN :_: I_PRP consider_VBP young_JJ people_NNS to_TO be_VB teenagers_NNS of_IN the_DT age_NN between_IN 13_CD and_CC 19_CD years_NNS old_JJ ._.
Help_VB in_IN communities_NNS comprises_VBZ activities_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN supporting_VBG the_DT elderly_JJ ,_, being_VBG engaged_VBN in_IN municipal_JJ politics_NNS ,_, playing_VBG in_IN a_DT sports_NNS club_NN ,_, or_CC spending_NN time_NN with_IN small_JJ children_NNS during_IN holidays_NNS ._.
Many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS today_NN are_VBP engaged_VBN in_IN politics_NNS to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
The_DT number_NN of_IN members_NNS joining_VBG political_JJ youth_NN organizations_NNS has_VBZ steadily_RB increased_VBN over_IN the_DT last_JJ ten_CD years_NNS ._.
When_WRB talking_VBG to_TO those_DT teenagers_NNS ,_, I_PRP can_MD see_VB their_PRP$ motivation_NN and_CC enthusiasm_NN to_TO participate_VB in_IN political_JJ work_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP aware_JJ that_IN they_PRP have_VBP a_DT responsibility_NN towards_IN their_PRP$ community_NN and_CC even_RB enjoy_VB this_DT fact_NN ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, the_DT popularity_NN of_IN sports_NNS clubs_NNS has_VBZ never_RB decreased_VBN ._.
Most_JJS young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP at_IN least_JJS in_IN one_CD club_NN ,_, such_JJ as_IN the_DT local_JJ soccer_NN ,_, tennis_NN ,_, or_CC track_NN and_CC field_NN team_NN ._.
Although_IN some_DT sports_NNS have_VBP seen_VBN a_DT decrease_NN in_IN members_NNS ,_, other_JJ sports_NNS have_VBP become_VBN more_RBR attractive_JJ ._.
This_DT can_MD be_VB exemplified_VBN by_IN sports_NNS like_IN American_JJ football_NN ,_, baseball_NN and_CC beach_NN volleyball_NN ._.
Finally_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS today_NN are_VBP aware_JJ that_IN social_JJ activities_NNS are_VBP meaningful_JJ and_CC even_RB useful_JJ for_IN their_PRP$ future_JJ life_NN ._.
Everybody_NN who_WP wants_VBZ to_TO apply_VB for_IN a_DT job_NN after_IN school_NN knows_VBZ that_IN these_DT activities_NNS are_VBP an_DT important_JJ part_NN of_IN their_PRP$ resume_VB ._.
Somebody_NN who_WP has_VBZ not_RB participated_VBN in_IN any_DT social_JJ community_NN work_NN is_VBZ less_RBR likely_JJ to_TO be_VB an_DT attractive_JJ applicant_NN ._.
Some_DT might_MD object_VB that_IN nowadays_RB young_JJ people_NNS spend_VBP more_JJR and_CC more_JJR time_NN playing_VBG computer_NN or_CC surfing_VBG the_DT internet_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, this_DT objection_NN can_MD be_VB countered_VBN by_IN the_DT fact_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS used_VBN to_TO watch_VB TV_NN a_DT lot_NN or_CC maybe_RB read_VB books_NNS instead_RB ._.
The_DT argument_NN misses_VBZ to_TO state_VB how_WRB young_JJ people_NNS in_IN former_JJ times_NNS helped_VBD their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
To_TO summarize_VB ,_, the_DT political_JJ engagement_NN ,_, the_DT popularity_NN of_IN sports_NNS clubs_NNS ,_, and_CC the_DT awareness_NN demonstrate_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB do_VBP spend_VB enough_JJ time_NN on_IN helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
