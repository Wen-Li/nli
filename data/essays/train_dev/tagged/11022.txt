Life_NNP is_VBZ perceived_VBN differently_RB by_IN different_JJ kinds_NNS of_IN people_NNS ._.
Similarly_RB young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN elders_NNS do_VBP can_MD be_VB stated_VBN only_RB by_IN viewing_VBG perspecrtives_NNS of_IN life_NN partially_RB ._.
What_WDT i_FW mean_VB to_TO say_VB is_VBZ that_IN i_FW do_VBP not_RB agree_VB with_IN the_DT fact_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR than_IN the_DT elders_NNS do_VBP completely_RB ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN youth_NN can_MD be_VB viewed_VBN as_IN stage_NN of_IN physical_JJ stength_NN and_CC vigour_NN and_CC also_RB as_IN a_DT stage_NN of_IN stress_NN and_CC responsibility_NN ._.
In_IN youth_NN every_DT day_NN is_VBZ a_DT challenge_NN and_CC one_NN can_MD not_RB afford_VB to_TO while_IN away_RB the_DT time_NN they_PRP have_VBP ._.
Therefore_RB it_PRP becomes_VBZ more_RBR stressful_JJ for_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
One_CD has_VBZ to_TO attend_VB their_PRP$ studies_NNS ,_, fund_VB their_PRP$ studies_NNS and_CC at_IN the_DT same_JJ time_NN earn_VB for_IN a_DT living_NN ,_, compete_VB with_IN their_PRP$ fellow_JJ classmates_NNS for_IN the_DT first_JJ position_NN ._.
Then_RB comes_VBZ a_DT stage_NN of_IN choosing-choose_NN a_DT career_NN that_WDT shall_MD decide_VB everything_NN and_CC choose_VB a_DT life_NN partner_NN with_IN whom_WP one_PRP has_VBZ to_TO spend_VB the_DT rest_NN of_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Once_RB satisfied_JJ about_IN the_DT stage_NN of_IN settlement_NN ,_, then_RB comes_VBZ the_DT stage_NN of_IN feeling_NN responsible_JJ for_IN one_CD 's_POS children_NNS ,_, their_PRP$ education_NN ,_, desires_NNS and_CC their_PRP$ settlement_NN ._.
Inspite_NNP of_IN all_PDT these_DT difficulties_NNS youth_NN is_VBZ an_DT age_NN of_IN pleasure_NN ,_, vigour_NN ,_, adventures_NNS ,_, friendship_NN and_CC love_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ a_DT blessed_VBN state_NN ,_, usually_RB with_IN constant_JJ good_JJ health_NN that_WDT gives_VBZ an_DT oppurtunity_NN to_TO experiment_NN and_CC make_VB the_DT most_JJS of_IN life_NN ._.
I_PRP feel_VBP unfortunate_JJ are_VBP those_DT who_WP do_VBP not_RB realise_VB the_DT importance_NN of_IN youth_NN and_CC neglect_NN the_DT age_NN under_IN the_DT pressure_NN of_IN responsibility_NN ._.
Old_JJ age_NN to_TO me_PRP in_IN a_DT stage_NN of_IN peace_NN where_WRB one_PRP has_VBZ to_TO enoy_VB the_DT fruit_NN of_IN all_PDT the_DT hardwork_NN one_CD has_VBZ done_VBN during_IN their_PRP$ lifetime_NN ._.
Since_IN elder_JJR people_NNS are_VBP often_RB subjected_VBN to_TO brunt_NN of_IN illhealth_NN and_CC illness_NN they_PRP have_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN to_TO the_DT maximum_NN in_IN the_DT destined_VBN duration_NN of_IN old_JJ age_NN that_IN they_PRP have_VBP ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, I_PRP opine_VBP that_IN one_CD has_VBZ to_TO perceive_VB life_NN beautifull_NN ,_, all_DT stages_NNS have_VBP their_PRP$ own_JJ importance_NN and_CC each_DT stage_NN should_MD be_VB enjoyed_VBN with_IN an_DT optimistic_JJ attitude_NN ._.
Only_RB then_RB can_MD one_CD realise_VBP the_DT importance_NN of_IN ouer_NN birth_NN ._.
