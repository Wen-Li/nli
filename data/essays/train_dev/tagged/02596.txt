Indeed_RB I_PRP disagree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS because_IN I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB themselves_PRP ,_, have_VBP less_JJR responsibilities_NNS and_CC have_VBP a_DT good_JJ life_NN experience_NN and_CC resources_NNS which_WDT they_PRP can_MD use_VB to_TO enjoy_VB themselves_PRP ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS usually_RB have_VBP much_JJ time_NN for_IN enjoyement_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP almost_RB retired_VBN after_IN they_PRP finished_VBD their_PRP$ work_NN time_NN and_CC so_IN they_PRP will_MD concentrate_VB on_IN enjoying_VBG theirselves_NNS through_IN travelling_VBG abroad_RB or_CC did_VBD their_PRP$ own_JJ favorite_JJ hobbies_NNS like_IN reading_NN ,_, painting_NN ,_, etc_FW ._. .._SYM
Other_JJ important_JJ thing_NN which_WDT enable_VBP elderly_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN is_VBZ the_DT fact_NN that_IN they_PRP are_VBP free_JJ ._.
They_PRP have_VBP no_RB much_JJ responsibilities_NNS to_TO do_VB ._.
They_PRP are_VBP already_RB retired_VBN from_IN work_NN so_IN they_PRP will_MD not_RB care_VB about_IN their_PRP$ boss_NN or_CC their_PRP$ duties_NNS ._.
Their_PRP$ kid_NN are_VBP independent_JJ now_RB so_IN they_PRP will_MD not_RB worry_VB about_IN them_PRP ._.
All_PDT these_DT factors_NNS give_VBP old_JJ people_NNS time_NN and_CC chance_NN to_TO enjoy_VB themselves_PRP and_CC not_RB anything_NN else_RB ._.
The_DT life_NN experience_NN and_CC knowledge_NN usually_RB old_JJ people_NNS gained_VBN from_IN their_PRP$ long_JJ enrollement_NN in_IN work_NN ,_, reading_NN and_CC dealing_VBG with_IN people_NNS will_MD surely_RB offer_VB them_PRP the_DT capability_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ time_NN ._.
They_PRP know_VBP most_RBS places_NNS which_WDT worths_NNS visiting_VBG ._.
They_PRP know_VBP how_WRB to_TO choose_VB their_PRP$ friends_NNS and_CC peers_NNS ,_, and_CC they_PRP can_MD deal_VB with_IN any_DT problem_NN might_MD face_VB them_PRP ._.
In_IN addition_NN to_TO that_DT old_JJ people_NNS might_MD collect_VB much_RB more_JJR money_NN than_IN young_JJ did_VBD ,_, so_IN they_PRP can_MD use_VB their_PRP$ money_NN in_IN enjoyment_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN old_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN much_RB better_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ,_, this_DT is_VBZ because_IN old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR time_NN and_CC money_NN ,_, got_VBD better_JJR experience_NN ,_, and_CC lastly_RB they_PRP are_VBP free_JJ from_IN responsibilities_NNS which_WDT the_DT younge_NN people_NNS have_VBP ._.
