Some_DT people_NNS may_MD think_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN harder_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_IN the_DT young_JJ have_VBP been_VBN brough_VBN up_RP in_IN a_DT society_NN which_WDT teaches_VBZ people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB with_IN the_DT statement_NN ;_: the_DT older_JJR are_VBP the_DT ones_NNS who_WP truly_RB understand_VBP how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB and_CC what_WP to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
Admittedly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR likely_JJ to_TO accept_VB the_DT newly_RB developed_VBN technologies_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN the_DT chatting_VBG on_IN line_NN program_NN MSN_NNP ,_, more_RBR quickly_RB than_IN the_DT seniors_NNS do_VBP ._.
In_IN such_JJ condition_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN better_JJR ._.
However_RB ,_, it_PRP does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB that_IN the_DT young_JJ enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR ._.
In_IN most_JJS cases_NNS ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP also_RB eager_JJ to_TO learn_VB new_JJ implements_VBZ which_WDT can_MD benefit_VB their_PRP$ both_DT academic_JJ career_NN and_CC leisure_NN time_NN ._.
Although_IN to_TO a_DT cartain_NN degree_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP slow_JJ learners_NNS ,_, but_CC their_PRP$ motivation_NN and_CC their_PRP$ experience_NN they_PRP have_VBP will_MD help_VB them_PRP to_TO finally_RB manage_VB the_DT technology_NN and_CC use_VB it_PRP for_IN enjoyment_NN ._.
The_DT only_JJ difference_NN between_IN the_DT young_JJ and_CC the_DT older_JJR is_VBZ the_DT time_NN when_WRB to_TO manage_VB the_DT technology_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
Some_DT may_MD argue_VB that_IN ,_, being_VBG young_JJ ,_, most_JJS people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB the_DT family_NN supporting_VBG burden_NN ,_, thus_RB having_VBG enough_JJ money_NN and_CC time_NN ,_, and_CC being_VBG able_JJ to_TO do_VB whatever_WDT they_PRP like_VBP ._.
But_CC when_WRB having_VBG the_DT finacial_JJ burden_NN on_IN themselves_PRP ,_, the_DT older_JJR are_VBP incline_NN to_TO cherish_VB time_NN and_CC money_NN and_CC will_MD not_RB chose_VBD a_DT expensive_JJ and_CC time_NN assuming_VBG way_NN for_IN enjoyment_NN ._.
Further_RB more_RBR ,_, being_VBG older_JJR ,_, they_PRP have_VBP experienced_VBN much_RB more_RBR than_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS and_CC consequently_RB know_VB more_JJR about_IN what_WP are_VBP the_DT most_RBS important_JJ things_NNS in_IN one_CD 's_POS life_NN ,_, and_CC will_MD chose_VBD the_DT meaningful_JJ way_NN to_TO kill_VB their_PRP$ time_NN instead_RB of_IN doing_VBG something_NN senseless_JJ ._.
On_IN the_DT contrary_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS lack_VBP the_DT experience_NN to_TO judge_VB whether_IN something_NN is_VBZ good_JJ or_CC not_RB ,_, so_IN they_PRP tend_VBP to_TO have_VB the_DT wrong_JJ mode_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, as_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP experienced_VBN more_RBR the_DT young_JJ do_VBP ,_, they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR motivation_NN and_CC knowledge_NN than_IN the_DT young_JJ do_VBP ,_, on_IN how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN meaningfully_RB and_CC wisely_RB ._.
