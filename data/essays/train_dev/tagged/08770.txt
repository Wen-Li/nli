Do_VB the_DT elderly_JJ enjoy_VB life_NN as_IN the_DT young_JJ do_VB ?_.
From_IN a_DT psychological_JJ standpoint_NN ,_, it_PRP can_MD ben_VB claimed_VBD that_IN the_DT way_NN people_NNS perceive_VBP the_DT world_NN changes_NNS as_IN they_PRP get_VBP older_JJR ._.
In_IN other_JJ words_NNS ,_, they_PRP get_VBP more_JJR realistic_JJ as_IN years_NNS pass_VBP ._.
Thus_RB ,_, I_PRP am_VBP inclined_VBN to_TO believe_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
To_TO start_VB with_IN ,_, younger_JJR people_NNS expect_VBP more_RBR from_IN life_NN ,_, and_CC ,_, to_TO a_DT great_JJ extent_NN ,_, people_NNS believe_VBP in_IN the_DT possibility_NN of_IN realizing_VBG their_PRP$ dreams_NNS in_IN younger_JJR ages_NNS ._.
As_IN a_DT resut_NN ,_, this_DT inner_JJ drive_NN makes_VBZ people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN in_IN all_DT means_NNS ,_, since_IN they_PRP feel_VBP that_IN they_PRP still_RB have_VBP time_NN to_TO do_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB ._.
However_RB ,_, as_IN they_PRP get_VBP older_JJR ,_, they_PRP start_VBP to_TO think_VB that_IN they_PRP will_MD never_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO be_VB the_DT person_NN that_IN they_PRP have_VBP dreamt_VBN of_IN ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, younger_JJR people_NNS have_VBP the_DT energy_NN that_WDT is_VBZ needed_VBN to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN ._.
That_DT is_VBZ to_TO say_VB ,_, they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB to_TO worry_VB about_IN their_PRP$ health_NN situation_NN while_IN thinking_VBG about_IN an_DT activity_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ almost_RB impossible_JJ for_IN older_JJR people_NNS to_TO attend_VB activities_NNS that_WDT need_VBP more_JJR energy_NN and_CC attention_NN such_JJ as_IN surfing_NN ,_, rafting_NN ,_, and_CC skiing_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, some_DT people_NNS claim_VBP that_IN older_JJR peple_NN enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ,_, since_IN they_PRP have_VBP more_JJR time_NN than_IN the_DT young_JJ ._.
In_IN other_JJ words_NNS ,_, they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB to_TO worry_VB about_IN anything_NN else_RB apart_RB from_IN making_VBG themselves_PRP feeling_VBG better_JJR ,_, and_CC enjoying_VBG the_DT life_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, this_DT argument_NN can_MD be_VB considered_VBN as_RB right_RB only_RB for_IN a_DT small_JJ percentage_NN of_IN the_DT elderly_JJ ,_, since_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB even_RB able_JJ to_TO find_VB someone_NN to_TO accompany_VB them_PRP for_IN most_JJS of_IN the_DT time_NN ._.
Taking_VBG these_DT points_NNS into_IN consideration_NN ,_, obviously_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR opportunity_NN ,_, and_CC chance_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN when_WRB compared_VBN to_TO the_DT old_JJ ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP strongly_RB believe_VBP that_IN this_DT situation_NN can_MD be_VB improved_VBN in_IN the_DT future_NN for_IN the_DT advantage_NN of_IN the_DT elderly_JJ ._.
