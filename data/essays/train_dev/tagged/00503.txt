Some_DT people_NNS might_MD say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB have_VBP enough_JJ time_NN to_TO help_VB the_DT communities_NNS around_IN them_PRP ._.
But_CC ,_, personally_RB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP young_JJ people_NNS had_VBD limited_VBN time_NN to_TO take_VB part_NN in_IN the_DT community_NN activites_NNS ._.
Where_WRB I_PRP live_VBP ,_, in_IN Japan_NNP ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB spend_VB their_PRP$ time_NN for_IN communities_NNS ._.
So_RB ,_, I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO illustrate_VB the_DT situations_NNS below_IN ._.
Most_RBS importantly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS in_IN recent_JJ years_NNS tend_VBP to_TO be_VB more_RBR busier_JJR than_IN those_DT in_IN previous_JJ years_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, the_DT recent_JJ young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO study_VB from_IN the_DT morning_NN to_TO the_DT midnight_NN every_DT day_NN ._.
They_PRP have_VBP to_TO go_VB to_TO junior_NN or_CC high_JJ schools_NNS and_CC also_RB have_VBP to_TO go_VB to_TO the_DT preparatory_JJ schools_NNS in_IN order_NN to_TO get_VB in_IN a_DT competitive_JJ Universities_NNS ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, they_PRP must_MD take_VB part_NN in_IN the_DT club_NN activities_NNS such_JJ as_IN basketball_NN club_NN or_CC Judo_NN club_NN after_IN school_NN to_TO strengthen_VB themselves_PRP physically_RB and_CC mentally_RB ._.
I_PRP think_VBP there_EX are_VBP more_JJR time_NN for_IN University_NNP students_NNS to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS than_IN any_DT other_JJ students_NNS in_IN different_JJ ages_NNS ._.
But_CC after_IN graduated_VBN from_IN University_NNP ,_, young_JJ businessperson_NN must_MD work_VB from_IN early_JJ in_IN the_DT morning_NN till_IN midnight_NN in_IN Japan_NNP ._.
They_PRP could_MD not_RB afford_VB to_TO have_VB sufficient_JJ dinner_NN time_NN because_IN of_IN the_DT hectic_JJ schedules_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, they_PRP hardly_RB have_VBP time_NN to_TO spend_VB for_IN community_NN activities_NNS ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO get_VB involved_VBN with_IN the_DT familiar_JJ relationship_NN in_IN their_PRP$ spare_JJ time_NN ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, they_PRP pleasedly_RB meet_VBP with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS in_IN weekends_NNS ,_, however_RB ,_, they_PRP are_VBP likely_JJ to_TO be_VB reluctant_JJ to_TO participate_VB in_IN the_DT program_NN to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ own_JJ communities_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP not_RB so_RB many_JJ mutual_JJ relationship_NN between_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS such_JJ as_IN high_JJ school_NN students_NNS and_CC the_DT people_NNS living_VBG in_IN the_DT area_NN where_WRB the_DT school_NN locates_VBZ or_CC their_PRP$ own_JJ house_NN locates_VBZ ._.
Additionally_RB ,_, the_DT many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ 20s_CD now_RB leave_VBP their_PRP$ own_JJ hometown_NN toward_IN the_DT central_JJ city_NN to_TO live_VB alone_RB and_CC enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN times_NNS ._.
They_PRP increasingly_RB tend_VBP to_TO get_VB involved_VBN with_IN people_NNS in_IN the_DT close_NN and_CC comfortable_JJ relathionship_NN ._.
It_PRP means_VBZ that_IN it_PRP become_VB more_RBR difficult_JJ for_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS to_TO get_VB involived_VBN with_IN local_JJ communities_NNS ._.
Considering_VBG from_IN the_DT point_NN mentioned_VBN above_IN ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO spend_VB for_IN community_NN activities_NNS ._.
Personally_RB ,_, I_PRP hope_VBP that_IN more_JJR young_JJ people_NNS help_VBP their_PRP$ communities_NNS to_TO build_VB the_DT relationship_NN between_IN the_DT people_NNS with_IN different_JJ ages_NNS and_CC in_IN different_JJ situations_NNS and_CC adults_NNS supports_VBZ the_DT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
