Young_NNP and_CC elder_JJR people_NNS have_VBP different_JJ ways_NNS of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
In_IN fact_NN ,_, some_DT enterainment_NN are_VBP specific_JJ to_TO your_PRP$ age_NN ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, sports_NNS well_RB illustrates_VBZ that_IN difference_NN between_IN generations_NNS ._.
So_RB ,_, with_IN respects_NNS to_TO those_DT differences_NNS ,_, do_VBP young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VB ?_.
According_VBG to_TO me_PRP ,_, young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR tha_NN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
First_RB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN contrary_JJ to_TO older_JJR people_NNS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB any_DT physical_JJ limit_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN in_IN any_DT conditions_NNS ,_, compare_VBP with_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB any_DT limitations_NNS considering_VBG their_PRP$ activity_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD play_VB any_DT sport_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD run_VB ._.
When_WRB you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ,_, your_PRP$ body_NN is_VBZ still_RB a_DT place_NN to_TO discover_VB and_CC to_TO grow_VB playing_VBG sport_NN or_CC doing_VBG any_DT physical_JJ activity_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT contrary_NN ,_, for_IN many_JJ older_JJR persons_NNS ,_, any_DT activity_NN needs_VBZ a_DT long_JJ preparation_NN ,_, for_IN instance_NN shopping_NN or_CC even_RB just_RB walking_VBG ._.
So_IN I_PRP think_VBP that_IN in_IN those_DT conditions_NNS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Second_RB ,_, when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ,_, you_PRP know_VBP nothing_NN ,_, you_PRP are_VBP curious_JJ ._.
It_PRP means_VBZ that_IN during_IN your_PRP$ youthness_NN ,_, life_NN is_VBZ an_DT extraordinary_JJ place_NN to_TO discover_VB through_IN relationships_NNS ,_, knowledges_NNS ,_, travels_NNS ,_, cultures_NNS ,_, etc_FW ._.
Everything_NN is_VBZ new_JJ for_IN you_PRP :_: people_NNS ,_, love_VBP countries_NNS ,_, language_NN ._.
Though_NNP ,_, when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ,_, you_PRP can_MD not_RB be_VB messed_VBN up_RP ._.
Each_DT experience_NN is_VBZ a_DT new_JJ one_CD ._.
On_IN the_DT contrary_NN ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP older_JJR ,_, life_NN is_VBZ hardly_RB a_DT daily_JJ surprise_NN and_CC ,_, by_IN the_DT way_NN ,_, easily_RB becomes_VBZ a_DT routine_JJ ._.
It_PRP s_VBZ harder_JJR to_TO meet_VB new_JJ people_NNS ,_, traveling_VBG becomes_VBZ difficult_JJ ._.
So_RB ,_, that_DT is_VBZ to_TO say_VB ,_, that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO take_VB advantage_NN of_IN their_PRP$ youthness_NN ._.
According_VBG to_TO me_PRP ,_, we_PRP are_VBP young_JJ only_RB once_RB in_IN our_PRP$ entire_JJ life_NN that_WDT is_VBZ why_WRB young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP have_VB to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP alrea_IN
