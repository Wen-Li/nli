Parents_NNS always_RB say_VBP that_IN you_PRP have_VBP to_TO work_VB very_RB hard_RB at_IN your_PRP$ younger_JJR age_NN ,_, so_RB as_IN to_TO enjoy_VB your_PRP$ older_JJR age_NN ._.
I_PRP do_VBP n't_RB think_VB that_IN this_DT is_VBZ a_DT valid_JJ deal_NN cause_NN I_PRP dont_VBP think_VB that_IN I_PRP will_MD be_VB able_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB more_RBR in_IN my_PRP$ older_JJR days_NNS than_IN when_WRB I_PRP am_VBP young_JJ ._.
Cause_VB at_IN older_JJR age_NN you_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO settle_VB down_RP in_IN a_DT calm_JJ village_NN and_CC enjoy_VB the_DT peaceful_JJ and_CC pleasant_JJ climate_NN rather_RB than_IN living_VBG in_IN a_DT crowded_JJ city_NN ,_, with_IN lot_NN of_IN things_NNS happening_VBG around_IN you_PRP and_CC that_IN interests_NNS you_PRP ._.
At_IN your_PRP$ younger_JJR age_NN ,_, you_PRP will_MD have_VB the_DT energy_NN to_TO go_VB around_RB different_JJ places_NNS and_CC view_VB some_DT of_IN the_DT beautiful_JJ creations_NNS in_IN the_DT world_NN ._.
But_CC when_WRB you_PRP become_VBP old_JJ ,_, maybe_RB your_PRP$ health_NN will_MD not_RB allow_VB you_PRP to_TO do_VB adventures_NNS ._.
At_IN your_PRP$ younger_JJR age_NN ,_, you_PRP have_VBP many_JJ things_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB because_IN of_IN less_JJR responsibilities_NNS and_CC more_JJR energy_NN ._.
At_IN young_JJ age_NN you_PRP can_MD also_RB have_VB a_DT great_JJ enjoyment_NN with_IN your_PRP$ romantic_JJ life_NN too_RB ._.
Enjoying_VBG to_TO the_DT highest_JJS at_IN your_PRP$ younger_JJR age_NN and_CC also_RB working_VBG hard_RB to_TO get_VB settled_VBN in_IN the_DT future_NN is_VBZ my_PRP$ moto_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
Normally_RB people_NNS think_VBP that_IN they_PRP will_MD enjoy_VB there_RB life_NN after_IN they_PRP are_VBP old_JJ and_CC they_PRP only_RB work_VBP ._.
But_CC this_DT can_MD be_VB harmfull_NN if_IN they_PRP dont_VBP get_VB a_DT chance_NN to_TO enjoy_VB at_IN thier_JJR older_JJR stage_NN after_IN so_RB many_JJ years_NNS of_IN hardwork_NN ._.
Normally_RB youngsters_NNS do_VBP enjoy_VB a_DT lot_NN by_IN arranging_VBG disco_NN parties_NNS and_CC trips_NNS to_TO different_JJ locations_NNS with_IN friends_NNS ._.
They_PRP get_VBP in_IN touch_NN with_IN the_DT latest_JJS technologies_NNS and_CC gadgets_NNS like_IN ipods_NNS ,_, mobile_JJ phones_NNS ,_, games_NNS and_CC many_JJ more_JJR ._.

Youngsters_NNS also_RB enjoy_VBP sports_NNS and_CC have_VBP a_DT abilitiy_NN to_TO take_VB part_NN in_IN it_PRP ._.
So_RB finally_RB I_PRP can_MD say_VB that_IN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS with_IN respect_NN to_TO health_NN ,_, responsibilties_NNS ,_, technology_NN and_CC much_RB more_RBR ._.
