I_PRP do_VBP n't_RB think_VB young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
I_PRP have_VBP three_CD reasons_NNS for_IN my_PRP$ notion_NN ._.
One_CD is_VBZ the_DT difference_NN of_IN pleasure_NN which_WDT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP and_CC that_IN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Second_JJ reason_NN is_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN the_DT seeds_NNS of_IN annoying_JJ comparering_VBG to_TO older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Third_NNP one_CD is_VBZ the_DT the_DT amount_NN of_IN property_NN they_PRP have_VBP ._.
First_JJ reason_NN is_VBZ the_DT difference_NN of_IN how_WRB young_JJ people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR activities_NNS something_NN use_VBP their_PRP$ bodies_NNS like_IN sports_NNS ,_, going_VBG somewhere_RB far_RB from_IN they_PRP live_VBP ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN they_PRP can_MD use_VB freely_RB ._.
They_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB the_DT time_NN when_WRB they_PRP are_VBP be_VB able_JJ to_TO be_VB relaxed_VBN ,_, they_PRP can_MD feel_VB the_DT stream_NN of_IN time_NN comfortably_RB ._.
Even_RB though_IN the_DT kind_NN of_IN the_DT pleasure_NN is_VBZ different_JJ ,_, both_DT are_VBP great_JJ ._.
What_WP 's_VBZ more_JJR ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP already_RB experienced_VBN the_DT joy_NN which_WDT young_JJ people_NNS feel_VBP when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ ._.
As_IN a_DT second_JJ reason_NN ,_, we_PRP can_MD say_VB that_IN somethimes_VBZ it_PRP is_VBZ difficul_JJ for_IN young_JJ people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ daily_JJ life_NN wholeheartedly_RB ._.
It_PRP might_MD be_VB because_IN of_IN the_DT relationship_NN between_IN friends_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ school_NN ,_, the_DT assignment_NN of_IN home_NN work_NN ._.
Some_DT children_NNS even_RB do_VBP commit_VB suacide_NN ._.
Although_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP fewer_JJR problems_NNS they_PRP should_MD do_VB ._.
Third_JJ reason_NN is_VBZ the_DT about_RB how_WRB much_JJ money_NN they_PRP can_MD use_VB ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP much_JJ money_NN they_PRP have_VBP earned_VBN ,_, but_CC young_JJ people_NNS ,_, especially_RB young_JJ children_NNS ,_, does_VBZ n't_RB have_VB enough_JJ money_NN they_PRP need_VBP ._.
To_TO spend_VB the_DT time_NN doing_VBG part_NN time_NN job_NN to_TO earn_VB money_NN sounds_NNS like_IN waste_NN of_IN time_NN ._.
For_IN these_DT three_CD reasons_NNS ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ difficult_JJ for_IN me_PRP to_TO state_NN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
