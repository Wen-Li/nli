In_IN the_DT Western_JJ world_NN most_JJS people_NNS consider_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
I_PRP have_VBP recently_RB been_VBN asked_VBN if_IN I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN that_DT line_NN of_IN thought_NN ._.
Contrary_JJ to_TO what_WP most_JJS people_NNS think_VBP ,_, I_PRP consider_VBP that_DT old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR for_IN a_DT number_NN of_IN reasons_NNS :_: they_PRP have_VBP life_NN achievements_NNS to_TO look_VB back_RB to_TO and_CC be_VB proud_JJ of_IN ;_: they_PRP can_MD see_VB the_DT influence_NN they_PRP exert_VBP in_IN their_PRP$ children_NNS and_CC grandchildren_NNS ;_: and_CC ,_, they_PRP are_VBP experienced_JJ and_CC see_VB life_NN from_IN another_DT perspective_NN ._.
Through_IN time_NN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP experienced_VBN positive_JJ and_CC negative_JJ events_NNS ._.
They_PRP have_VBP been_VBN through_IN moments_NNS in_IN life_NN ,_, where_WRB everything_NN has_VBZ been_VBN about_IN accomplishments_NNS and_CC triumphs_NNS ,_, like_IN getting_VBG married_JJ or_CC becoming_VBG a_DT well-known_JJ doctor_NN ,_, and_CC others_NNS where_WRB failure_NN and_CC tragedy_NN ,_, like_IN closing_VBG a_DT business_NN or_CC facing_VBG a_DT close_JJ relative_JJ 's_POS death_NN ,_, have_VBP played_VBN an_DT important_JJ role_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, throughout_IN the_DT years_NNS they_PRP have_VBP learned_VBN to_TO balance_VB all_PDT these_DT experiences_NNS and_CC see_VB that_DT life_NN is_VBZ beautiful_JJ ,_, and_CC that_IN every_DT accomplishment_NN should_MD be_VB a_DT reason_NN to_TO be_VB proud_JJ of_IN and_CC every_DT moment_NN should_MD be_VB enjoyed_VBN to_TO its_PRP$ fullest_JJS potential_NN ._.
At_IN the_DT same_JJ time_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP able_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT influence_NN they_PRP exert_VBP in_IN their_PRP$ children_NNS and_CC grandchildren_NNS ,_, and_CC see_VB the_DT effort_NN they_PRP did_VBD throughout_IN their_PRP$ life_NN reflected_VBD on_IN them_PRP ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ difficult_JJ to_TO see_VB a_DT higher_JJR pride_NN or_CC degree_NN of_IN accomplishment_NN ,_, than_IN that_DT shown_VBN on_IN a_DT grandfather_NN 's_POS face_NN when_WRB playing_VBG ball_NN with_IN his_PRP$ grandson_NN ._.
That_DT is_VBZ a_DT sign_NN of_IN enjoying_VBG the_DT little_JJ moments_NNS of_IN life_NN at_IN their_PRP$ greatest_JJS potential_NN ,_, without_IN worrying_VBG about_IN the_DT next_JJ day_NN 's_POS meeting_NN ,_, or_CC the_DT undone_VBN project_NN sitting_VBG in_IN front_NN of_IN the_DT computer_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS see_VBP life_NN from_IN a_DT different_JJ perspective_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
And_CC as_IN a_DT famous_JJ Latin_JJ American_JJ poet_NN writes_VBZ ,_, ``_`` if_IN I_PRP lived_VBD again_RB I_PRP would_MD worry_VB much_RB less_JJR about_IN being_VBG so_RB careful_JJ ,_, about_IN wearing_VBG sweaters_NNS and_CC always_RB leaving_VBG home_NN with_IN an_DT umbrella_NN ._. .._SYM
I_PRP would_MD travel_VB without_IN luggage_NN and_CC not_RB be_VB concerned_VBN of_IN the_DT day_NN I_CD have_VBP to_TO come_VB back_RB ._. .._FW ''_''
For_IN these_DT reasons_NNS I_PRP think_VBP old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
The_DT good_JJ news_NN is_VBZ that_IN we_PRP are_VBP still_RB young_JJ and_CC we_PRP can_MD start_VB enjoying_VBG life_NN just_RB as_IN all_DT of_IN our_PRP$ grandparents_NNS do_VBP ,_, taking_VBG from_IN them_PRP an_DT example_NN for_IN the_DT rest_NN of_IN our_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
