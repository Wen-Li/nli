Does_VBZ young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS do_VB ?_.
The_DT answer_NN to_TO this_DT question_NN ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, is_VBZ ``_`` NO_NN ''_'' ._.
The_DT following_VBG three_CD reasons_NNS supports_VBZ my_PRP$ opinion_NN ._.
Everyone_NN in_IN this_DT world_NN enjoys_VBZ life_NN the_DT way_NN he_PRP wants_VBZ to_TO depending_VBG on_IN the_DT available_JJ resources_NNS ._.
The_DT young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP working_VBG full-time_RB and_CC have_VB much_RB more_JJR money_NN in_IN hand_NN as_IN compared_VBN to_TO that_DT of_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, who_WP are_VBP living_VBG on_IN old_JJ age_NN pensions_NNS or_CC working_VBG part-time_JJ for_IN the_DT little_JJ amount_NN of_IN money_NN ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, as_IN they_PRP are_VBP old_JJ they_PRP usually_RB do_VBP not_RB have_VB good_JJ health_NN and_CC lots_NNS of_IN their_PRP$ money_NN is_VBZ spent_VBN in_IN hospital_NN and_CC medicine_NN bills_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR enjoyment_NN resources_NNS as_IN compared_VBN to_TO the_DT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
We_PRP could_MD find_VB almost_RB all_DT younger_JJR people_NNS going_VBG to_TO resturaunts_NNS ,_, clubs_NNS and_CC on_IN holidays_NNS frequently_RB and_CC think_VB that_IN they_PRP are_VBP enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS might_MD have_VB also_RB done_VBN the_DT same_JJ when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ and_CC might_MD not_RB want_VB to_TO do_VB same_JJ at_IN this_DT stage_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
They_PRP might_MD want_VB to_TO travel_VB to_TO a_DT peaceful_JJ place_NN like_IN temple_NN or_CC church_NN and_CC spend_VB some_DT time_NN there_RB in_IN peace_NN ,_, which_WDT they_PRP think_VBP they_PRP enjoys_VBZ the_DT most_JJS ._.
The_DT second_JJ and_CC most_RBS important_JJ point_NN is_VBZ the_DT physical_JJ strength_NN ._.
The_DT older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP very_RB less_RBR physical_JJ strength_NN as_IN compared_VBN to_TO the_DT energetic_JJ younger_JJR population_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, the_DT older_JJR people_NNS want_VBP to_TO stay_VB at_IN home_NN and_CC enjoy_VB life_NN with_IN their_PRP$ family_NN ,_, which_WDT does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB that_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB enjoying_VBG life_NN but_CC their_PRP$ means_NNS of_IN enjoyment_NN is_VBZ different_JJ from_IN that_DT of_IN the_DT younger_JJR generation_NN ._.
The_DT younger_JJR generation_NN actuall_NN shows_VBZ to_TO their_PRP$ peers_NNS and_CC others_NNS that_IN this_DT is_VBZ the_DT stage_NN in_IN their_PRP$ life_NN and_CC they_PRP should_MD enjoy_VB the_DT most_RBS now_RB and_CC tend_VB to_TO show_VB their_PRP$ peers_NNS that_IN they_PRP are_VBP enjoying_VBG much_RB more_JJR than_IN them_PRP and_CC we_PRP usually_RB get_VBP the_DT perception_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP enjoying_VBG more_JJR than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN if_IN a_DT twenty_CD year_NN old_JJ guy_NN goes_VBZ to_TO the_DT best_JJS and_CC most_RBS expensive_JJ disco_NN in_IN town_NN ,_, he_PRP will_MD be_VB telling_VBG this_DT to_TO all_DT of_IN his_PRP$ friends_NNS to_TO show_VB his_PRP$ superiorness_NN to_TO his_PRP$ friends_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB the_DT difference_NN is_VBZ not_RB who_WP enjoys_VBZ the_DT life_NN more_RBR ,_, young_JJ or_CC old_JJ people_NNS ,_, but_CC the_DT difference_NN is_VBZ how_WRB both_CC young_JJ and_CC old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN ._.
Their_PRP$ preferences_NNS and_CC means_NNS of_IN enjoyment_NN are_VBP different_JJ but_CC both_DT enjoy_VBP life_NN equally_RB ._.
