I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
This_DT is_VBZ because_IN although_IN young_JJ people_NNS usually_RB have_VBP a_DT healthier_JJR state_NN than_IN old_JJ ones_NNS ,_, this_DT does_VBZ n't_RB mean_VB that_IN this_DT is_VBZ the_DT only_JJ factor_NN that_WDT controls_VBZ a_DT person_NN 's_POS enjoyment_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN each_DT of_IN these_DT two_CD categories_NNS -_: young_JJ and_CC old_JJ people_NNS -_: have_VBP their_PRP$ own_JJ way_NN of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, despite_IN the_DT fact_NN that_IN old_JJ people_NNS ca_MD n't_RB do_VB some_DT types_NNS of_IN enjoyment_NN that_IN the_DT youngsters_NNS can_MD do_VB -_: such_JJ as_IN hanging_VBG out_RP ,_, and_CC playing_VBG some_DT types_NNS of_IN sports_NNS -_: however_RB ,_, they_PRP also_RB have_VBP a_DT wide_JJ range_NN of_IN enjoyable_JJ activities_NNS that_IN they_PRP can_MD perform_VB ._.
The_DT types_NNS of_IN activities_NNS that_WDT older_JJR people_NNS can_MD do_VB to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN often_RB depends_VBZ on_IN the_DT age_NN category_NN they_PRP belong_VBP to_TO ._.
For_IN example_NN people_NNS at_IN the_DT age_NN of_IN sixty_CD or_CC above_RB often_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN after_IN retirement_NN by_IN buying_VBG themselves_PRP houses_NNS in_IN quiet_JJ and_CC calm_JJ areas_NNS ,_, where_WRB they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB the_DT free_JJ time_NN they_PRP have_VBP by_IN relaxing_VBG ._.
They_PRP can_MD also_RB spend_VB their_PRP$ time_NN in_IN gardening_NN ,_, playing_VBG with_IN their_PRP$ grandchildren_NNS and_CC taking_VBG care_NN of_IN them_PRP ,_, or_CC discussing_VBG any_DT subjects_NNS in_IN life_NN ._.
They_PRP also_RB have_VBP their_PRP$ type_NN of_IN sports_NNS that_WDT help_VBP them_PRP relax_VB such_JJ as_IN golf_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, people_NNS at_IN younger_JJR ages_NNS -_: from_IN forty_CD to_TO sixty_CD -_: often_RB enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN by_IN making_VBG trips_NNS around_IN the_DT world_NN to_TO places_NNS they_PRP have_VBP n't_RB visited_VBN when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ ._.
This_DT type_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN ,_, and_CC other_JJ ``_`` time_NN consuming_NN ''_'' activities_NNS ,_, are_VBP usually_RB not_RB available_JJ for_IN young_JJ people_NNS because_IN they_PRP often_RB do_VBP n't_RB have_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO do_VB it_PRP ._.
This_DT is_VBZ due_JJ to_TO the_DT reason_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS usually_RB spend_VBP most_JJS of_IN their_PRP$ time_NN in_IN their_PRP$ studies_NNS ,_, doing_VBG homeworks_NNS ,_, and_CC writing_VBG papers_NNS ._.
I_PRP again_RB emphasize_VBP the_DT idea_NN that_IN each_DT has_VBZ his/her_NN own_JJ types_NNS of_IN enjoyment_NN ,_, and_CC that_IN he/she_NN probably_RB wo_MD n't_RB enjoy_VB doing_VBG what_WP other_JJ people_NNS in_IN other_JJ age_NN categories_NNS do_VBP ._.
