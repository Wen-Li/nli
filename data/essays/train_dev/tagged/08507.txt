I_PRP do_VBP agree_VB with_IN the_DT following_VBG statement_NN ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
I_PRP have_VBP several_JJ reasons_NNS to_TO share_NN :_: First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP usually_RB much_RB more_RBR energy_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
For_IN exemple_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD go_VB do_VB all_DT kind_NN of_IN sports_NNS like_IN skydiving_NN ,_, scubadiving_NN ,_, dancing_NN ,_, and_CC a_DT lot_NN of_IN other_JJ sports_NNS ,_, without_IN really_RB think_VB about_IN the_DT heart_NN or_CC bones_NNS problems_NNS ._.
Second_RB ,_, yound_JJ people_NNS still_RB have_VBP to_TO live_VB many_JJ years_NNS and_CC experience_VB many_JJ different_JJ things_NNS ._.
A_DT teenage_JJ wants_VBZ to_TO become_VB independant_NN and_CC go_VB to_TO travel_VB all_DT around_IN the_DT world_NN to_TO make_VB his_PRP$ own_JJ experiences_NNS ,_, but_CC older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP often_RB already_RB set_VBN with_IN husband_NN or_CC wife_NN ,_, and_CC with_IN children_NNS ,_, and_CC prefer_VBP to_TO relax_VB at_IN home_NN during_IN the_DT week-end_NN ._.
Third_NNP ,_, yound_JJ people_NNS have_VBP much_RB more_RBR free_JJ mind_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS from_IN today_NN in_IN France_NNP for_IN example_NN ,_, live_VBP a_DT life_NN with_IN a_DT lot_NN of_IN comfort_NN and_CC do_VBP n't_RB worry_VB much_JJ about_IN wars_NNS or_CC hunger_NN ,_, but_CC some_DT grand-parents_NNS experienced_VBD the_DT war_NN and_CC remember_VB the_DT difficulties_NNS of_IN this_DT time_NN ._.
Some_DT have_VBP resentments_NNS against_IN Germans_NNS for_IN example_NN ,_, but_CC young_JJ people_NNS live_VBP all_DT together_RB in_IN peace_NN Germans_NNS ,_, Spanish_JJ people_NNS and_CC all_DT because_IN they_PRP did_VBD n't_RB live_VB the_DT war_NN ._.
Fourth_JJ ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD experience_VB much_RB more_RBR things_NNS with_IN the_DT evolution_NN of_IN the_DT science_NN ._.
There_EX are_VBP many_JJ innovations_NNS today_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS can_MD use_VB for_IN their_PRP$ everyday_JJ life_NN ,_, that_IN older_JJR people_NNS did_VBD n't_RB have_VB at_IN their_PRP$ youth_NN time_NN ._.
Like_IN the_DT MP3_NN that_WDT can_MD carry_VB many_JJ songs_NNS and_CC most_JJS of_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS use_VBP it_PRP ._.
To_TO conclude_VB ,_, i_FW think_VBP it_PRP 's_VBZ normal_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Everybody_NN is_VBZ young_JJ one_CD day_NN ,_, and_CC become_VB old_JJ an_DT other_JJ day_NN ._.
