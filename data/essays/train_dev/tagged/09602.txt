I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN ``_`` young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ''_'' ._.
Many_JJ old_JJ people_NNS might_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ,_, since_IN they_PRP know_VBP more_RBR about_IN life_NN because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ age_NN ,_, or_CC they_PRP know_VBP that_IN they_PRP are_VBP close_JJ to_TO end_VB so_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB it_PRP as_RB much_RB as_IN possible_JJ before_IN it_PRP is_VBZ gone_VBN ._.
Enjoying_VBG life_NN is_VBZ not_RB related_VBN to_TO person_NN 's_POS age_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ more_RBR related_JJ to_TO individual_NN 's_POS personality_NN ,_, or_CC the_DT life_NN conditions_NNS that_WDT individual_NN has_VBZ ,_, and_CC the_DT accidents_NNS or_CC luck_NN that_IN the_DT life_NN brings_VBZ to_TO an_DT individual_NN ._.
I_PRP know_VBP many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS who_WP are_VBP dealing_VBG with_IN many_JJ problems_NNS of_IN life_NN rather_RB than_IN enjoying_VBG it_PRP ._.
Financial_NNP problems_NNS ,_, or_CC career_NN concerns_NNS are_VBP the_DT main_JJ topics_NNS that_WDT makes_VBZ young_JJ people_NNS too_RB much_JJ stressed_JJ about_IN life_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, when_WRB we_PRP look_VBP at_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB hard_JJ to_TO see_VB on_IN their_PRP$ face_NN the_DT scarces_NNS of_IN satisfaction_NN and_CC awareness_NN ._.
They_PRP were_VBD slowed_VBN down_RB ,_, they_PRP ended_VBD the_DT competition_NN with_IN other_JJ people_NNS ,_, and_CC just_RB try_VB to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN after_IN accepting_VBG it_PRP as_IN what_WP it_PRP is_VBZ ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, it_PRP would_MD be_VB invalid_JJ when_WRB someone_NN claims_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Mainly_RB ,_, enjoyment_NN of_IN life_NN is_VBZ mostly_RB related_VBN with_IN personality_NN ._.
In_IN spite_NN of_IN many_JJ difficulties_NNS and_CC the_DT rapidness_NN in_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS ,_, there_EX are_VBP many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS who_WP enjoy_VBP life_NN ._.
Maybe_RB ,_, those_DT are_VBP the_DT ones_NNS who_WP can_MD balance_VB their_PRP$ enjoyments_NNS and_CC responsibilities_NNS ._.
While_IN they_PRP are_VBP holding_VBG a_DT lot_NN of_IN hard_JJ work_NN ,_, they_PRP also_RB leave_VBP some_DT time_NN to_TO have_VB fun_NN ,_, dealing_VBG with_IN friends_NNS ,_, families_NNS and_CC social_JJ activities_NNS ._.
Someone_NN might_MD have_VB a_DT positive_JJ motivation_NN of_IN life_NN ,_, which_WDT makes_VBZ him/her_JJR optimistic_JJ about_IN the_DT facts_NNS ,_, and_CC leads_VBZ him/her_NN to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN ._.
Some_DT others_NNS might_MD have_VB negative_JJ motivations_NNS that_IN they_PRP only_RB see_VBP the_DT negative_JJ aspect_NN of_IN the_DT facts_NNS and_CC can_MD not_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ motivations_NNS ._.
Some_DT people_NNS might_MD be_VB too_RB much_JJ concerned_VBN with_IN the_DT only_JJ ``_`` responsibiliy_NN ''_'' or_CC ``_`` career_NN ''_'' part_NN of_IN the_DT life_NN that_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB allow_VB themselves_PRP to_TO relax_VB ,_, spend_VB time_NN with_IN friends_NNS and_CC experience_VB the_DT enjoyable_JJ and_CC easy_JJ parts_NNS of_IN the_DT life_NN ._.
To_TO sum_VB up_RP ,_, enyoying_VBG life_NN is_VBZ not_RB related_VBN with_IN the_DT person_NN 's_POS age_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ more_RBR related_JJ to_TO person_NN 's_POS character_NN ,_, the_DT person_NN 's_POS perception_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
There_EX are_VBP many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS who_WP do_VBP not_RB enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ negative_JJ motivations_NNS of_IN life_NN or_CC because_IN of_IN the_DT other_JJ priorities_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
