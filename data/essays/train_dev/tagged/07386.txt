A_DT community_NN can_MD not_RB stand_VB up_RP alone_RB ._.
The_DT government_NN does_VBZ its_PRP$ best_JJS to_TO improve_VB its_PRP$ community_NN ._.
Those_DT in_IN charge_NN do_VBP what_WP they_PRP can_MD inorder_RB to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
But_CC the_DT question_NN is_VBZ :_: can_MD the_DT government_NN or_CC those_DT in_IN charge_NN improve_VB a_DT community_NN by_IN themselves_PRP ?_.
In_IN other_JJ words_NNS ,_, can_MD they_PRP improve_VB a_DT community_NN without_IN the_DT help_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ?_.
Some_DT young_JJ adults_NNS think_VBP that_IN they_PRP have_VBP nothing_NN to_TO do_VB with_IN their_PRP$ community_NN ._.
They_PRP think_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB their_PRP$ responsibilty_NN to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Others_NNS believe_VBP that_IN they_PRP have_VBP to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ community_NN ,_, even_RB if_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB enough_JJ time_NN ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB should_MD devote_VB time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP several_JJ reasons_NNS why_WRB they_PRP should_MD do_VB this_DT ._.
First_RB ,_, those_DT in_IN charge_NN can_MD not_RB perform_VB all_DT their_PRP$ jobs_NNS or_CC activities_NNS alone_RB ._.
They_PRP need_VBP support_NN and_CC help_NN from_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, if_IN the_DT government_NN decides_VBZ to_TO build_VB a_DT healthy_JJ ,_, clean_JJ club_NN for_IN the_DT sake_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, can_MD this_DT happen_VB if_IN a_DT young_JJ people_NNS enters_VBZ this_DT club_NN smoking_NN a_DT cigaratte_NN or_CC if_IN h/she_NN throws_VBZ a_DT waste_NN paper_NN ?_.
Moreover_RB ,_, the_DT youth_NN should_MD help_VB keeping_VBG the_DT river_NN and_CC streets_NNS clean_JJ because_IN this_DT would_MD make_VB their_PRP$ community_NN healthy_JJ and_CC free_JJ of_IN any_DT pollution_NN ._.
Second_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS should_MD help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS by_IN devoting_VBG time_NN and_CC money_NN to_TO charity_NN 's_POS activities_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, they_PRP would_MD visit_VB an_DT orphanage_NN ,_, play_VBP with_IN orphans_NNS ,_, buy_VB them_PRP new_JJ clothes_NNS and_CC toys_NNS ,_, and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
This_DT would_MD help_VB in_IN building_VBG up_RP a_DT flourishing_JJ ,_, kind_JJ community_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, there_EX are_VBP many_JJ reasons_NNS why_WRB young_JJ adults_NNS should_MD devote_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
They_PRP have_VBP to_TO support_VB the_DT governement_NN in_IN new_JJ project_NN by_IN avoiding_VBG doing_VBG such_JJ bad_JJ habits_NNS as_IN smoking_NN or_CC throwing_VBG wates_NNS in_IN the_DT streets_NNS or_CC rivers_NNS ._.
Second_RB ,_, they_PRP may_MD help_VB the_DT community_NN by_IN performing_VBG charities_NNS '_POS activities_NNS which_WDT would_MD help_VB the_DT community_NN in_IN lifting_VBG up_RP the_DT spirits_NNS of_IN the_DT poor_JJ and_CC the_DT orphans_NNS ._.
Thus_RB ,_, I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN it_PRP 'd_MD be_VB great_JJ if_IN young_JJ people_NNS devote_VBP much_RB of_IN their_PRP$ time_NN in_IN helpinh_JJ their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
