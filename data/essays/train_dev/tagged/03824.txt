The_DT issue_NN at_IN hand_NN is_VBZ whether_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS can_MD surely_RB enjoy_VB more_JJR than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
This_DT is_VBZ mainly_RB due_JJ to_TO couple_NN of_IN reasons_NNS ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, the_DT age_NN factor_NN serves_VBZ as_IN a_DT major_JJ consideration_NN when_WRB it_PRP comes_VBZ to_TO this_DT topic_NN ._.
Obviously_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP far_RB more_RBR energetic_JJ and_CC healthier_RBR than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS ._.
This_DT is_VBZ purely_RB due_JJ to_TO the_DT old_JJ age_NN that_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS attain_VBP which_WDT in_IN turn_NN makes_VBZ their_PRP$ body_NN and_CC mind_NN slower_JJR in_IN all_DT activities_NNS ._.
This_DT proves_VBZ that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB more_JJR than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS due_JJ to_TO the_DT high_JJ energy_NN levels_NNS and_CC good_JJ health_NN conditions_NNS ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR interest_NN in_IN life_NN to_TO enjoy_VB than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO come_VB up_RP with_IN new_JJ ideas_NNS for_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN and_CC like_IN to_TO have_VB utmost_JJ fun_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP more_RBR open_JJ minded_VBN that_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, most_JJS young_JJ people_NNS would_MD also_RB like_VB to_TO adventure_NN and_CC involve_VB them_PRP in_IN lot_NN of_IN trecking_NN activities_NNS ._.
Whereas_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS might_MD not_RB have_VB the_DT interest_NN and_CC energy_NN to_TO involve_VB in_IN adventures_NNS ._.
Thus_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB more_JJR than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS as_IN they_PRP are_VBP open_JJ to_TO new_JJ ideas_NNS to_TO discover_VB life_NN and_CC have_VBP fun_NN ._.
Finally_RB ,_, in_IN most_JJS cases_NNS ,_, money_NN plays_VBZ an_DT important_JJ role_NN for_IN enjoyment_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT most_RBS with_IN their_PRP$ money_NN ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, these_DT days_NNS even_RB young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP paid_VBN high_JJ salaries_NNS where_WRB they_PRP are_VBP able_JJ to_TO lead_VB a_DT luxurious_JJ life_NN at_IN a_DT very_RB young_JJ age_NN ._.
Eventhough_NNP ,_, the_DT older_JJR peope_NN may_MD have_VB lots_NNS of_IN money_NN compared_VBN to_TO the_DT younger_JJR people_NNS ,_, they_PRP might_MD not_RB be_VB willing_JJ to_TO spend_VB as_IN they_PRP already_RB know_VBP the_DT value_NN of_IN money_NN ._.
Also_RB ,_, due_JJ to_TO the_DT reason_NN that_IN they_PRP know_VBP how_WRB hard_JJ it_PRP is_VBZ to_TO earn_VB that_DT money_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT otherhand_NN ,_, the_DT younger_JJR people_NNS can_MD spend_VB more_JJR to_TO enjoy_VB as_IN they_PRP might_MD have_VB just_RB starting_VBG earning_NN and_CC have_VBP less_JJR responsibilities_NNS ._.
I_PRP ultimately_RB feel_VBP that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ._.
I_PRP believe_VBP this_DT because_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR responsibilities_NNS ,_, less_JJR hinderences_NNS ,_, more_JJR energy_NN and_CC more_JJR interest_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
