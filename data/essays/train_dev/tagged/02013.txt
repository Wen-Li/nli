I_PRP strongly_RB disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, because_IN of_IN two_CD reasons_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS had_VBD already_RB enjoyed_VBN their_PRP$ lives_NNS when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ ._.
Second_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD still_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
Before_IN my_PRP$ grandfather_NN died_VBD ,_, couples_NNS of_IN years_NNS ago_RB ._.
He_PRP used_VBD to_TO tell_VB me_PRP about_IN his_PRP$ life_NN when_WRB he_PRP was_VBD young_JJ ._.
He_PRP used_VBD to_TO tell_VB me_PRP all_PDT his_PRP$ stories_NNS about_IN ;_: his_PRP$ girlfriends_NNS ,_, his_PRP$ adventures_NNS and_CC his_PRP$ passion_NN ._.
But_CC ,_, he_PRP cleared_VBD me_PRP something_NN ,_, he_PRP told_VBD me_PRP that_IN he_PRP still_RB enjoyed_VBD his_PRP$ life_NN ._.
This_DT is_VBZ a_DT clear_JJ example_NN of_IN how_WRB much_JJ older_JJR people_NNS enjoyed_VBD their_PRP$ lives_NNS and_CC they_PRP are_VBP still_RB enjoying_VBG it_PRP ._.
The_DT time_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN is_VBZ like_IN two_CD or_CC three_CD times_NNS longer_JJR than_IN what_WP we_PRP ,_, young_JJ people_NNS ,_, have_VBP enjoyed_VBN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, it_PRP all_DT sumarizes_NNS that_WDT older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR that_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
As_IN mentioned_VBN before_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP still_RB enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ lives_NNS ,_, some_DT young_JJ people_NNS would_MD say_VB that_IN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD not_RB use_VB the_DT Internet_NN or_CC go_VB to_TO an_DT amusement_NN parks_NNS like_IN them_PRP ._.
But_CC ,_, that_DT is_VBZ completely_RB wrong_JJ ._.
I_PRP have_VBP a_DT friend_NN ,_, whose_WP$ grandmother_NN plays_VBZ computer_NN games_NNS with_IN him_PRP ._.
I_PRP could_MD not_RB believe_VB it_PRP until_IN I_PRP saw_VBD her_PRP$ playing_NN with_IN us_PRP ._.
My_PRP$ friends_NNS grandmother_NN likes_VBZ going_VBG to_TO amusement_NN parks_NNS too_RB ._.
Last_JJ summer_NN ,_, we_PRP went_VBD to_TO Wonderland_NNP together_RB ,_, it_PRP was_VBD simply_RB amazing_JJ !_.
Here_RB ,_, we_PRP can_MD see_VB another_DT example_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, if_IN older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP healthy_JJ enough_JJ and_CC strong_JJ enough_RB ,_, they_PRP can_MD do_VB whatever_WDT they_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO do_VB ._.
To_TO sumarize_VB everything_NN up_RB ,_, I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN and_CC I_PRP think_VBP older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS because_IN older_JJR people_NNS already_RB enjoyed_VBD their_PRP$ lives_NNS before_IN and_CC they_PRP keep_VBP on_IN enjoying_VBG it_PRP ._.
