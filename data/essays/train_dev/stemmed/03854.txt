when you tri to guess how mani car will be use in the futur , you have to pay attent to sever fact . some may impli that there will be even more car but in my opinion there are far mor reason that their will be nearli no car at all on our street anymor . the first and most import reason whi i am think thi way is fact of rise ga price . no one believ that the rise of ga price will stop . no , it is a fact that they will rais even faster . and who of the ordinardi peopl can easili pay the ga station bill nowaday ? thi will becom more and more difficult . so in my opinion , onli a few peopl will be abl to afford have a car . anoth reason whi i am the opinion there will be fewer car is that the public traffic institut will improv there servic and so the possibl of use them will look far more attract then it doe now . the price you will have to pay when use a train or bu will decreas when more peopl need to use them , e.g. as a result of rais ga price . and thi will lead more peopl to use public traffic vehicl again . the second improv of which i am sure to come is that the net structur will becom better day by day . thi will also be a result of increas interesst in them . anoth fact is , that accord to my own experi , you can use the time in a far more effic way when you are travel by bu or train . the time you spend with drive can be use to work . let 's assum you have to travel half an hour each day to arriv at the place you work . if you could invest thi time in prepar you work , you could take a free afternoon averi two week . and i am sure more and more peopl will see these advantag and there will be fewer car .
