i agre thi point that it is more import for student to undestand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . becaus understand concept make them to deal with the problem which are occur with that particular concept . let us take one exampl by learn the concept of comput we may abl to use it in an effici way . we are also abl to deal the probl found with it . onli the person who know about the comput can onli deal with it . by know the concept we are abl to have good idea about develop that concept . and we can creat a new concept . we are well experienc by know the concept concept undertand make us to have more command and control over a concept than learn fact . we do not get experienc by learn fact . we onli know about the thing and work about it . but know the concept we know the process of it and intern structur of it . by understand the concept we can even tri to work with the other field for exampl . if a person know about the program languag ` c ' he can also tri to work with ` java ' becaus some syntax are same in both of the languag . we cannnot have an idea by learn fact . they remain unchang even after the mani year . we may have new idea by understand concept . we also becom expert in taht particular field . by understand the concept there is no scope of forget it . so i suggest student to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact .
