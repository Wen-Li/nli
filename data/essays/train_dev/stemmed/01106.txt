i disagre with thi opinion which say that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are becaus , in my opinion , it depend on peopl how to be impress by advetis , and gener compani do n't do such a thing unless it 's a fraud . we should n't say that most advertis tell a lie . first , how the advertis influenc you would chang depend on what situat you are . for , instanc , if you see the advertis of the restaur when you are hungli , it would more affect you ; howev , if you are not , it doe n't impress you much . therefor , advirtis ' effect is chang alway . second , now it 's guarantee to send the product back to the compani after you bought them . usual , the compani take care of the cost of return . if the compani tell a lie at the advertis , it just hart themselv . therefor , the compani would n't tell a lie at the advertis becaus they know tell a lie at the advertis doe n't benefit the compani at all . final , now in thi global societi , some low prohibit to advertis the product not as they realli are . after the internet wa creat , we have been get some chanc to buy some on the internet . if we go to the store and see what the one realli is , we wo n't take ani mistak . howev , if we buy them from the internet without see the real product , we onli can see and imagin the advertis and the pictur of it . new therefor , in order to prevent costom do thi the new low are be creat in mani countri . it is clear that advertis do n't , make a product look better . advertis ca n't have it definit becaus it 's a just imag of the product which can be chang by each costom . from these reason , i strongli disagre the opinion which most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
