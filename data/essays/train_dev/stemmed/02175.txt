at first glanc it seem to be a baffl question but if you 'll take a closer look you might reckon to say that thi subject need to be examin . thi esssay deal with a broad descript of whi it is necessari to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . first of all i would like to say that it is indispens for ani kind of student to broaden hi knowledg . let us assum that you earn your bachelor 's degre in sport and that you would like to get some oversea work experi . due to the fact that you attend a univer that did n't allow you to learn a foreign languag it wo n't be possibl for you to fulli indulg in new surround . furthermor you can just work in a small work field that doe n't allow you obtain more respons . i am quit sure that you will soon feel uncomfort and that you might regret that you did n't take the opportun to broaden your academ skill . rome wa not build in a day and it is quit appar that you can hardli obtain more knowledg from one day to anoth . if those student who just focuss on a specif subject , such as sport , attend differ class , besid their major , it would be easier for them to surviv in the capitalist world . i am tri to reinforc my point of view with a quotat of darwin . '' the surviv of the fittest '' , express a fact , base on sever incid that took place in the earli 19th centuri . you can easili link it to our assig . thu , what happen to those student who attend busi class besid their normal major . let us assum that they have learn how to plan task and how to meet their target via shedul and agenda . mayb these busi class taught them how to control peopl via '' carrot and stick '' or through normal philanthroposi . these skill would truli broaden their possibl to appli for other job , such as manag sport event or lead an enterpris in the field of sport . i am pretti sure that everybodi take advantag of a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , as i 've examin in the line abov . i grew up with the belief that a person never truli finish hi educ and that there is someth new to learn with each day . refer to my introdcut it is vital to succedd academ due to these hint .
