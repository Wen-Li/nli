i disagre with thi statement . i would like talk about my opinion with 3 reason . the first , it is problem about feel of us , human . we alreadi know the eirth ha a lot of enviroment problem . i think co2 is a most famou reason of distroyed the earth , so use a car is a big reason , too . howev we alreadi know how a use car is so convini . if the famous peopl or gorvan said `` stop use a car !! '' , we ca n't do it . the second , it is problem in the develop counti . i said about the car which made co2 , but now they are reaserch some ecolog car in some compani , forexsampl hybrit-car . those are alreadi famou , and sometim we can see thi car in my citi , but it is expens than normal car . in the other hand , there are some problem in the butteri , too . some of peopl worri how we charg ani enelgi . if resarch make more servey or think more use idea , those will are use more peopl . then , how about the develop countri . the last reason is problem of the develop countri . some of the place in the develop counti , there are no an airport or a train . the peopl who live in like thi erea use onli a track or a car . if they can not use those , they ca n't transport some food or thing . i think some erea must develop to inprov own countri 's economi of situat , so transport are most import to develop . and thi problem is not onli thi . the develop countri send a lot of use car which is ofcors make co2 for the develop countri too cheep . those will be more inreas . thi hi problem is not onli the develop countri bout also the develop countri . therefor i dissagre .
