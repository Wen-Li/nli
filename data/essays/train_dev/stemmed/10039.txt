advertis ha got a great influenc on societi today . everywher you can read : `` buy our product as it is better than the other one . '' compani tri to make the peopl buy their product to gain more and more money . as far as i am concern , i think , most of the product which are advertis for are not as good as the advertis promis they are . first of all you have to ask yourself whi the compani advertis thier product . the answer is not realli difficult . the onli thing a compani care about is how much money the owner or the manag of thi compani will receiv at the end . but for be abl to sell a product they have to made thi product popular and well-known in the popul . they have to build up certain imag of thi product which ha to be rather posit . otherwis they would fail to achiv their aim of higher and higher wage . to achiev these aim they have to opt for advertis their product in a posit way and it doe not matter how good the qualiti of a product realli is . the opel compani serv as a good exampl here . the opel compani alway advertis it automobil as be the best car among the other and that you will never get problem with thi car . but thi wa onli a trick to make more peopl to buy their car . so there are more and more product which ha got a quit good advertis but in real onli a poor qualiti . in the end compani act in thi way cheat on the person who buy these product . howev , i think there are some possibl to take an advantag of thi situat of decreas honesti in advertis . compani which do not tri to cheat on custom and submit that their product just have the abil and qualitiy it realli ha the custom will thank the compani for it honest advertis and eventuelli buy more of the compani 's product . but now both , compani and custom have got advantag of thi solut .
