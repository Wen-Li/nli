i agre that the advertis that are wide use to promot product present them as much better than they are , in that they exagger the qualiti of the product and the effect that it will have on it consum . advertis present product in a superl light . i will not ventur to say that they deciev as to the qualiti but rather than they exagger it . well-to-do compani that can afford to advertis well are like to have good qualiti product , but they are not necessarili as perfect as their advertis show . for exampl , brand name cereal are present in advertis as the culmin of culinari excel . at the same time , unadvertis product may have almost ident ingredi but less name-recognit . the consum natur assum that the famou brand is higher in qualiti compar to the unknown brand but if he or she would tri both they would find them similar if not ident in tast . also , advertis onli concentr on the posit trait of the product , but never the neg trait . tobacco advertis somewhatexculd , they will alway make the product seem perfect and conveni and use and safe , even though it may not be . toy and applianc , among other product , are commanli advertis in thi way . the advertis will show how fun and excit the trampolin is . but if a custom were to tri it out , he or she would find that it is veri fragil , for exampl . thi is anoth common way of present advertis as better than they are . moreov the effect of the product on the consum as it is present in the advertis is deceiv . advertis typic reach their audienc by show vision of glamour , popular , pleasur , and increas appeal to the opposit sex as the effect of buy their specif product . it is these hidden imag that permeat advertis and it is these that attract custom , howev subconsci . the truth is of cours that these messag are flase and unreason . just becaus the axe commerci show that whoever use axe is irresist to women , it doe not mean that actual user of the product will share the same fate . advertis are an effect tool in market a product . thi is becaus they show it qualiti not it shortcom , they exaggerr it excel and uniqu , and send fals imag about the effect they will have on the custom that use them .
