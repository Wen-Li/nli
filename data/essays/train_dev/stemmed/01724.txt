be success and happi is the main aim of mani peopl . there is an ongo debat about whether sucess is achiev by tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what ha been known well . in my point of view , peopl who are do what they are know how to do well have more possibilti to becom success . the main reason for my point is that there is less uncertain when peopl do thing they know well . becaus , when there is uncertainti we may not be sure whether we are on the accur way or not . it is an inevit factor that in order to be success , we need to work regularli . under uncertain situat , plan is a veri hard task . thank to the certainti , we can plan our task and follow our progress clearli . also , peopl learn to be more effici by do thing they know . anoth reason for my point is we may onli wast our time and money by tri new thing . accord to research , most of the research and develop project are result with failur . instead of tri new thing , if we concentr on what we are do best , we can oproduc more favor outcom . anoth reason for my point is depend of tri new thing mostli on luck factor . may be some peopl are lucki to be success by tri new thing . but these peopl are veri limit in number . we onli heard stori about peopl who took risk and becom success in public . what about other peopl took risk and fail ? they confront with the hard face of life . wherea , most of the peopl who becam success ha progress step by step . i think it is not worth to risk my career and live standard in order to be success . i prefer to be success step by step with countini work . to sum up , peopl becom success by do what they are do best . by do so , they reduc uncertaini , they can do more clear plan and they achiev step by step . wherea , the other altern way of be success is quit depend on luck and may result in onli wast of resourc .
