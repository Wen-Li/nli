the statement `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use that there are today '' is veri strong . i disagre with it becaus we do not realli know what could happen in the futur to chang our mind in that way , it would be a veri radic chang . nowaday , the number of car in use in grow becaus peopl ha to commut to go to work or to studi to the univers . the distanc between our home and the place where we want to go make us to use the car . for exampl , we are 4 adult in my famili and we have more that one car , and everi day each one use our own car to our daili live . spain is a small countri in comparison to other . but it doe not mean that we use less the car . thu , i could imagin what happen in the big countri , where distanc between tow point are bigger , everyon use their own car becaus is faster and you do not need to wait for public transport . i know that thi actitud doe not help the environ , it caus a lot of pollut to the atmospher . but everi day , in our comun , we listen the advic to leav the car at home and use public tranport , and we still use our own car , we do not care about the pollut if we need to use the car . it is more confort for us . anoth inconveni of use the car is the lack of park in the citi , but the local goverb is build new park to solv thi problem . then i do not think that thi problem could make that peopl use less their own car . i know that there are neg effect of use my car but i prefer to feel confort , to arriv quickli to my destini ( work , parti ... ) and it also allow us to be more independ .
