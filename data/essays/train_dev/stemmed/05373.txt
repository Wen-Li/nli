for some reason we can think that young peopl enjoy more life than older peopl do . at first sight we can state thi becaus it is clear that it is easier to be young , in good health with futur perspect than to be old , to suffer and to count the year befor die . besid , parent often say to chidren that they are lucki . i ca n't deni that be old is not a veri funni thing over all for the bodi , for the health but on the other side it impli that you have live a lot of variou thing , you have found your way , you have children and mayb littl children . in few word at thi age , peopl have done the more difficult and they can use their time for pleasur , for rest , for what they want . on the other hand , be young is not such an easi thing and it is often a difficult part of life , over all the teenag period . inde teenag is the time of self construct , the time to discov love , problem , to take the first decis . .. and that is not an easi thing becaus teenag do n't have a lot of experi yet neither self confid . in addit , the youth is a tricki period concern relationship : young peopl are not nice between each other and a lot of them suffer a lot dure thi time . youth and more particularli teenag are transit and chang time and for that they 're not alway cool and easi . you lose some beauti thing like innoc , puriti , inconsciens and so on ; you enter in the real world and the decept can be high . at the contrari , older peopl have alreadi made their life , they have more experi about life and thank to that they meet less difficulti to resolv a problem . all in all , of cours i ca n't say that i prefer to be young or old , it is not the question but i think that everi age ha it advantag and it setback . but i do believ that the most difficult is to be young becaus it impli a lot of problem and question for whose we are not alway readi .
