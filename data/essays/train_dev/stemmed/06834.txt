i agre wich thi idea : most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are two import reason whi i think that thi statement is true . first , today , in our societi , the most import thing for peopl ha becom the appear , and not the realli essenc of thing . in the everi day life of each individu , the estheth and exterior aspect , such as cloth , beauti , money , rich and materi thing are most relev rather than the interior aspect , such as ethic valu , love , friendli , help etc . . for thi reason peopl think tha is right to appear and to demonstr these aspect rather than their essec . second , today tv , radio , paper and other form and sourc of inform , like mass meedia have devolop veri quickli connect group of differ peopl all over the world . so individu are slave of thi inform sphere that influenc them . so we can transport thi two concept from the life of peopl to their relationship with the differ kind of product , which they see and consid all day . i think that becaus peopl are are influenc and pay great attent to exterior aspect most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in conclus , i think that thi process is realli develop , but it is wrong and it demag our societi within few year .
