i agre with that understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact for student . there are some reason to surpport my opinion . first of all , think about the ordinari thing . for exampl , as we all know , the water becom a ice at the point of the tempertur is 0 degre . thi is a fact and it is common knowlegd . howev , how can we understand the fact ? we understand the fact by know the idea . almost peopl have taken the scienc class when they were in school and learnt about the tempertur . they might have done some lab and seen the idea of the fact . see the idea is effect to understand the fact . secondli , in an advertis . i have learnt about market , and i realiz that the fact is the onli the fact , and i have to know the concept of an advertis . i had n't known that the know the concept is veri import to improv my skill of advertis . i alway tri to think about the concept of advertis . even i did n't understnad the mean of the advertis , i could know the fact of the advertis after i research the concept of the advertis . i then gradual becam to be abl to understand the fact of the advertis . therefor , i need to know the concept . thi is help to creat the advertis to me becaus i have to think the concept so i need to learn about the concept . for these reason , i think student should understand idea and concept well . it will help them when they have to think about the fact . i also think that the fact is the onli fact , it is not well-understand if student do n't understand idea and concept . therefor , i think that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
