i disagre with the argument that there will be fewer car in use twenti year down the line than there are today . i can attribut a number of reason to support my agreement of argument . the most import reason i consid is the recent technolog advanc to use non-convent eneri sourc instead of convent fuel like gasolin and diesel . although i agre that there is decreas in quantiti of oil pool one can find out whcih are use to produc petroleum which in turn is use to extract gasolin and diesel , the main fuel that run car today . further , scarciti of petroleum ha lead to an exponenti increas in the growth of petroleum product price which directli affet the consumpt of the product . we can see in the current time , petrol price are rise at brisk rate and the trend will follow in the futur also becaus of the limit availabl of petroleum resourc . howev , there are step taken by compani , independ research to look for the non-convent resourc of eneri like hydrogen , electr as futur fuel of car but the experi have not been success commerci . i am sure that twenti year time is considerar good amount of time that the non-convent sourc of energi will complet replac the exisit convent fuel . i assum that non-convent fuel will replac the exist fuel technolog in the futur becaus they are easi to use , pollution-fre . automobil manufactur compani like gm , toyota etc. are look forward to welcom these new non-convent fuel and their research and develop group are persist work on prototyp which are small box that can easili be replac in exist car . exist of thi box will impli that we can just have thi new box fit and use differ fuel and there is no need to chang the car . that 's whi i think number of car twenti year down the line will not be fewer becaus of the exist of non-convent resourc of eneri and the adapt that the vehicl manufactur compani are do to their product .
