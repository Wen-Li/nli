although it is good to special in one subject , i agre with the opinion that peopl have to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . first , even if you are interest in that one subject you studi , you had better to see other subject . see other rang will be help to enlarg your knowledg . if you see mani thing and read mani kind of book , your brain and feel will be soft and you can learn more thing than befor . secondli , it will also help you to make it sure what you have learn . in one way , you can not know what is correct or not becaus your sight is narrow and small . if you learn someth about the one specif subject , you can not say that in other subject the same . you have to see it from mani way or you can not judg it . and also , all academ subject connect to each subject . we exist in thi world and mani materi exist togeth in a complex way as well . although each subject might look differ at all , in fact , they are tell us about thi world . unexpectedli , all subject are same thing . in sum , i support the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject with those three reason after all .
