young peopl now a day do not spend enough time to help their commun . i agre with the statement that most of the young peopl of the present gener do not show ani kind of intrest to spend atleast littl time of their valuabl time . it onli becaus peopl now a day are enagag with mani thing about themselv that they dont have time to think about the commun . young peopl , consid from shcool age to a person who is work or into a bussi ha got hi own tension . onc when he is back from hi daili routin work he is tire and want to spend some time in front of the tv or relax for some time . but he hardli think about hi communt or rather about himself . compar to past , our ancesstor and grand parent were alway concern about their famili as well as their commun . though they had veri less facilti avail they made best out of it . with thier commun and interact with peopl in the societi where as a person of today dosent have time to go and meet hi old friend or hi rel atleast . i think peopl should be tought to learn about their societi and other pepl who are live with them in the societi so that he can directli look at the peopl who are no have ani facil and sleep on the road so that they make out littl of their time and money to protect them and care for them . i would like to share one of my experi , when i wa in my colleg i saw a man who met with an accid lie on the road with blood flow , none of them show ani concern to take him to the hospit . .. as they were busi tie up with their own work and that they can not spend liitl time for that old man bcaus of which we all had to see him dead on the road . i think such thing should not be repeat . everi person should involv in the commun help the commun in one way or the other as much as he can . thi show hi concern for the peopl and helpi natur . right from the scratch they should be tought about moral and about societi , patriot peopl , one who learn moral never tri to neglect hi societi . and everi person should take their time in help the commun . i have seen mani old age peopl who do a lot for the commun , the place where i live we dont have medic servic for us for which our area peopl who were all 55 yr old group togeth and made a request to that area head that we are in need of a hospit which can help us in odd time for children and peopl live in thi area . they have taken the risk for the commun but peopl who are young were least bother about thi issu as they were much worri about their career and settlement rather other they were selfish with thier behavior . i think everi individu should take part in do someth for the societi thi give him noth but self satisfact which is more than anyth for a human .
