i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . if one were to analys the trait of success peopl in the area of busi , entertain , sport or even polit , the one common trait to emerg will be their abil to take intellig and thought risk and keep push the boundari of their area of expertis . human be are loath to chang and do not like to get out of their `` comfort zone '' . the averag person would rather continu to do what they know veri well becaus of the overal disrupt natur of `` chang '' . tri new thing is gener view as too riski to compromis a steadi state of exist and establish livelihood . but over time it becom necessari to chang , adapt and tri new thing becaus there are alway other who would be will to do the same thing in a better , effici way or for a lower price . the onli way to combat becom redund and remain success is to embrac chang , experi with new thing and take calcul risk . as an exampl , if you look at the tradit telephon compani or the media busi , they have not chang in their behaviour or in their busi process in the past centuri . the busi owner believ in their own perpetu exist and were continu to do what they had been do all along . but , with the advent of new technolog and the internet , their world ha been rude shaken . the number of adult who read a newspap ha been steadili fall . most new telephon connect are now of the `` wireless '' varieti . unless these tradit compani shake up their busi and take a few risk on their own , they are doom . infact , the cycl of chang and innov ha significantli crash over the past few year . even the internet compani and wireless telephon compani have to constantli reinvent their busi and continu tri out new thing to stay relev in today world . the concept of tri new thing and take risk is also import from an overal `` evolut '' standpoint . imagin if bill gate or michael dell had not continu to experi in their garag , or had given up on their dream and idea , we would still have been use the abacu for ad number . all success busi and idea are base on the bedrock of `` new idea '' and `` new concept '' and it take brave , commit and passion individu to keep take such risk and expand the boundari of knowledg . while the reward for take risk are typic huge , the reward are not quit obviou till such time a risk is taken . in conclus , the appetit for risk and tri new thing are the defin trait for success individu in thi world .
