it is veri tempt to give a straight answer like `` ye '' , young peopl today are veri selfish , they just care about themselv . howev befor do that , i would like first to understand what is behind the word `` young peopl '' . personnali , i will separ thi word into two categori : first , teenag between 12 to 18-20 year old , i mean peopl in high school or begin univers and second the young adult between 20 and 25 year old . let 's start with the first group . i do n't realli think they are not help their commun . everi day , tv show exampl of a school do good thing for peopl like clean the tag in the subway or sign paper against fur hunt or help state to clean park and street . at that age , young guy just see life in black and white , they are not yet interest in their job and how much money they will make . in addit , at school , their teacher realli tri to motiv them to understand what citizenship mean . sometim , as i mention abov , they do n't have choic and they are enrol in school project . so , in conclus , for that particular group , i disagre with the statement . then , the second group is differ and i think they are right to be differ in a sens they are or will becom soon activ member of the societi , chief of their household and they have to care more about themselv than the previou group . howev , i do n't mean in ani way that at 25 you are right to becom selfish . unfortun , what we can observ is that , a part from social worker , thi group is not reali will to particip in help commun . to conclud , if think it is veri import that befor jump into conclus that we set clearli the defininion of young peopl becaus in function of the categori they belong to the answer will be differ . for the12-20 year old the answer will be `` no '' and then for the 20-25 group the answer is `` ye '' they do n't give enough time to commun .
