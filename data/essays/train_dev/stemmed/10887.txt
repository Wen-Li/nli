it is gener agreed that a way of succeed in life is to take risk . live one 's life fear is know as a loos of time . peopl who do not dare experi new thing are said to be coward or looser . i think that thi question is debat and that we have to be careful with stereotyp . it is undoubt that sometim in life you have to move on ; chang your way of life to suc . for instanc , two year ago i had to leav my home , in pari , to aix en provenc , in southern franc . i have been accept in a polit scienc school to pursu my cursu . i wa afraid of live alon in anoth citi but i take the risk and move to thi new place . nowaday i am happi of have done the right choic . even if there are posit point in take risk rather than do what you alreadi know sometim it could be riski . risktak are often self-confid . my grandmoth alway say that too much confid is danger . in my opinion take risk becom danger when you loos sen of realiti ; when you think that all is easi . sometim dare new thing turn well , but you have to keep in ; ind that also it could turn bad . for instanc , my aunt wa tire of her job , one day she decid to leav think of all the excit new experi she would experi in a new job . unfotunatli it wa not so easi to find a new job and she wa unemploy dure 3 month . the risk she take had tremend consequ . to conclud i want to say that take risk is a good think but it ha not be systemat . fear is a normal feeel and it contibut to self protect . a balanc between dare new thig and live care would be a ggod compromis .
