i think to be specialis in one specif subject is good , but is not enough for your personn develop . first of all , i think it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus it is better to improv your commun with peopl . i mean , if your knowledg is realli broad , you will certainli be abl to talk about a lot of differ subject with a lot of differ peopl . be open mind in your knowledg lead you , most of the time , of be open mind social . it is import to be interest in sever thing , that show your abil to adapt yourself to differ situat , and i do believ that be abl to adapt yourself to a given situat is alway a good point ; whatev you actual want to do in life . furthermor , the more you learn , the more you want to learn ( and need to learn actual ) . the wiling to learn can be found if you are special in one specif subject , but a singl subject may lead you to isol youself in technic consider that non one can actual understand , wherea plural of subject make your mind breath . it is no longer a question of ` academ '' knowledg , it is a question of curios . accord to me , acknowleg goe the same way as it goe for food , that is to say if you eat the same food everyday , you will just be quickli disgust . therefor , if you just studi one singl subject , even if you go deepli through it , you will be disgust one day somewhat . to summar , i rekon it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus you can thu talk about more thing , and it make you so much curiou as if you were major in one specif subject . i agre to say that learn about a specif subject is a good think , becaus everyth can not be superfici in your life , but if you have onli that in your life , that not enough to make thi one fun
