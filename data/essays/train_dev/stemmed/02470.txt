understand idea and concept is more import for student than learn fact . i am agre with thi statement . there are sever reason for thi . one do not have to wast time for learn fact and also experi can help student to learn fact . just understand the idea and concept can also help to be more creativ . it is a wast of time to give student everyth about the topic . they need to run their own brain to understand what the whole lectur is about . for exampl in an art class , theacher want from student to creat a new tool for kitchen . he give the idea about what he want but if he give the fact they do not have to search anyth to increas their knowledg and abil as well . they can not look from a differ perspect . experi is one of the most import point to learn someth . for instanc , you studi your lesson and you had your drive licenc . without have experinc how you expect to drive as good as the other can . experi is more import than learn fact . you give the idea and concept . afterward they experinc it in the real life by face them . be flexibl in our creation depend on how free we are . just have the ida can help be more creativ . in order to think well , sometim we should learn fact by search about them . in conclus , tri to learn fact is a kind of wast of time and without experienc the concept we learn do not help us to improv ourself . accord to these reason i am disagre with thi statement .
