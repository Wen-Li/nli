i am agre the most advertis make product seem much better that tehi realli are for follow two reason , the most of advertis make their product look better then they are , the advertis hire good look and bodi to deceiv the special peopl , first of all , most of advetis make their product look so fine . for exampl , mc donald alway show the peopl eat energiclli food in the more and it will provid the nutrit in a day . but they did n't say how fat per chicken , if you eat two meal in the morn , how much weight you will gain . moreov , the nike compani they hire the sport star to do exercis and show it on tv , but it is not to demostr if we wear the special product , we will becom expert in thi area . second , most of advertis , they alway foucu the distinguish gruop of peopl and show the grest idea in it . for instanc , in my countri , they have an organ for fat peopl , they made a special plan for each person and promis it will sucess to lose your weight in a month . they hire the model who have good look and bodi and claim if you take thi plan , you will have good sheap like them . howev , it alway not exactli to follow the plan they made , so they su each other . in summari , most of advertis make product seem much better than they realli are is the ture . the orgainz , nike compani and mc donald are just the few exampl that i meation it .
