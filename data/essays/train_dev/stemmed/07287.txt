i do not agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl to . while i would conced that older peopl are more like to be struggl with health problem or to have experienc hardship over the cours of their live , these factor are not exclus to older peopl . moreov , one can enjoy life inspit of such neg experi . given the right circumst , hardship paradox might increas your abil to enjoy life . if you have a posit attitud , misfortun can teach you - at ani age - to valu the good thing and the happi moment , to count your bless . if , on the contrari , you have a pessimist outlook on life and alway find someth to complain about , you will experi less joy in life , regardless of your age . in addit to age , other outsid factor , in my opinion , also play a much smaller role than is commonli assum . at first glanc , enjoy life would seem to come easi to peopl that are in good health , independ wealthi and feel love by a signific other or a close set of friend . but on second thought , when we tri to rememb the time we have felt happi and enjoy life most , what come to mind are usual littl preciou ( and fleet ) moment in time that had littl to do with money , for instanc . none of these posit outsid factor hurt , of cours . nevertheless , i am sure we have all seen friend with chronic ill and empti bank account have a blast , while other have a tough time find joy in seemingli rich and full live . all in all , i disagre with the statement becaus enjoy life doe not depend on age or other extern factor as much as on one 's person and attitud . a littl lucki star , of cours , doe not hurt .
