broad knowledg and specifi knowledg are both interest to have , and i could not say that one is definit better than the other , actual i rather think that it is good to possess these both form of knowledg . a broad academ knowledg is use at school , and for your studi , sinc it allow you to start studi ani specif subject without have to learn the base . thi type of gener knowledg is also use in everyday life , when you talk to peopl : you can cover a wide rang of topic , have an interest convers with mani differ peopl , and make mani friend . anoth thing which goe with talk to mani peopl and know the base of a wide rang of topic is that it open your mind , and help you understand how thing work , which in turn help you reason more effici . all of that is veri use in everyday life as well as if you wish to becom sharper in a particuliar topic you studi . but onc you have becom veri good in a specif topic , onli then can you achiev a success profession career . some believ that we all have a talent to develop ( like in the bibl : `` what have you done of your talent ? '' ) , and most peopl tri to fulfil their ambit by get veri good in one particular thing . although a lack of gener knowledg might not help you evolv a lot in your social life , a specif knowledg can assur you a job , and if you like what you do it will not be hard to improv yourself until you are veri good at it . in conclus , i think that an allianc fo both knowledg is the best choic , even though it may be hard to achiev becaus it take time and money as well as manual and intellectu skill . still if i realli had to choos i would go for the gener knowledg , becaus nowaday you can easili find extens of thi knowledg for free , on the internet for instanc , and if you have an open mind and a social life it should not be too hard to get some more specialis friend of your to help you with particular issu .
