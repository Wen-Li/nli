i agre with thi statement that sucessful peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . consid scientist einstein who had develop the power and light sourc for the world becaus he had done hi experi sixteen time and he saw the same result that is failur . but he never giveup himself and conduct the same experi seventeenth time and at thi moment he acheiv a result and becam one of the most recogniz person in the world . there are so mani peopl in thi way who tri until sucess meet them . now we look at the present technolog and the innov that are happen in the world . befor the centuri if a person want to develop the power there is no way for obtain it . but anoth scientist name as edison who is famou for hi wooden block model bladeless trubin which is use to develop the power from the water . he might not be a sucessful person at the begin of the era but he conduct mani experi and reveal the result form greater risk and won an intern award which is given by the american societi . i disagre with those peopl who will do the same thing that they have alreadi known . becaus god had gift the peopl with superfici knowledg and one ha to aspir that knowledg and one should increas the potenti skill to develop the new model . when the peopl do the thing that were veri known to them they will never obtain some thing differ in their life and they are alway seem to be in the same posit . one should tri for new thing which involv risksand mani huddl , but when you pass through the risk there will be a result wait for you . so everi one should tri for a new thing . let us consid an exampl the person name as newton , becaus he wa unawar that he will be the most sucessful person inth world in the feild of scienc . he wa just sit down the tree and suddenli an appl fell on him and he question himself immedai that how it fall and then as a result he discov the newton law of motion . so i would like to conclud that when a person take the risk and pass through the difficulti and hurld instead of do the same thing that wa well known he will meet the sucess .
