in my opinion peopl do n't have success becaus they had tri new thing and taken more risk , but becaus they had done what they knew they do well . to becom success peopl it 's better to focu onli on what they alreadi know and are strong in . if you have a veri good prepar either for your experi or for your academ knowledg , you will be success without take risk or tri to do someth you are not good in . thi , becaus you can sell yourself in a better way , for exampl , if you have to find a job , special when you are just graduat and begin to appli for a work for the first time in your life , it 's import to demonstr what you are abl to do thank to your skill and know-how previous acquir . in addit , if you are veri strong to do someth becaus it 's not new for you , without accept risk you 'll show a great capac to do it , although you 're do that just for person satisfact . in both case the more you are sure in what you 're do becaus you know how to do well , the more peopl can trust you and obvious they also will ask you some advic . on the whole , be success peopl becaus you are veri expert in what you are do , will be easier than when you are take risk even to do someth you are veri weak . in thi way you can reach a person satisfact just do what you are strong in and i think it will be sure a big person satisfact becaus what we know how to do well is what we like to do .
