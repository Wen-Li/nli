nowaday , car are one of the most import featur of our live style . they make our exist easier by let us move from one place to anoth faster than walk . they also let us travel to place far from where we live which otherwis would be imposs to reach . howev , car have disadvantag such as the difficulti to find somewher to park the car , the amount of money we spend on fuel and the pollut they live behind . in my opinion , in twenti year there will be more or , at least , as much car as there are today . but , the opposit could also occur . we can find evid for and against both statement : on the one hand , the number of car have increas at an import rate last year , at least in the countri where i live ( spain ) . the differ sector of the economi have had good result and the situat right now doe n't make us think that thing will chang all of a sudden . so , the trend we have observ on car growth could be remain the same and make the total number of car in twenti year bee bigger than it is today . on the other hand , as car are veri pollut , lot of peopl have start be conscient about the damag we are caus to the environ and have start use public transport more often . in addit , govern are creat law that restrict the use of a car in some citi or even they are tax peopl who drive their car in the citi center . these fact could have as a result a reduct in the number of car in the near and even the far futur . anyway , public transport are not usual as good as they should be and a lot of peopl , special those who live in rural area , do realli need a car to go to work , go to the supermarket , etc . use a car is someth confort and we all know that peopl like to be confort . so , i wo n't go as far as to say that the number of car in the futur will be bigger for sure but , at least , that 's what i believ right now .
