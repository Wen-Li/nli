nowaday student have lost their interest on the proced of idea and concept . as time goe on , there are fewer student interest in answer question such as `` how newton 's law wa conceiv and what is it mathemat basi ? '' or `` how steel wa first creat from it natur constitu ? '' student are loos that curios in how fact are conceiv due to lack of interest in thing they think alreadi exist and do not need to be studi again by them becaus it wa alreadi clarifi centuri ago by someon els . inste they rather learn and understand the final result obtain year ago , which have been put under evalu sever time through all these year . to explain further thi point , let us take a look at the two exampl mention at the begin of thi essay : newton 's law . back in isaac newton 's time it sure wa sure import to prove hi second law of motion by measur the time a bodi last in free fall motion frorm a determin height . nowaday student do not care for prove thi theori by implement their own experi : they rather studi the formula develop by newton and appli it in a physic problem with onli one purpos : to get a good degre at the end of the cours . now let us take a look at the second exampl : the manufactur of steel . there is a big theori on thi field and research is still carri out on it . mani cultur were involv in the earli year or the iron era , and a lot of experi were carri out to studi how iron react with air to produc steel : mani manufactur thecniqu were studi to come with the idea of use high temperatur furnac to produc steel . thi last result is the one that matter for student ; they are onli interest in understand how steel is form in a chemic reaction in order to get a good grade onc again . they do not care on prove themselv that steel can be manufactur in such way . the reason whi student act thi way ha alreadi been mention : they are told to wori onli about a degre , and they are not allow to let the mind think about what they realli like . it would be better if student were allow to studi what they realli like . in thi way , a student who realli like chemistri and physic will be sure wonder about the fact , while a student who want to develop an artist talent such as paint , doe not have to worri about thing he doe not realli care .
