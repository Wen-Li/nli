i agre with the statement . in my opinion it is more import to understand idea and concept , than to know fact and just repeat them . you can talk about an idea or concept if you realli know the background of it . so if you have the knowlegd about a topic and you take part in a discuss you realli know what you are go to talk about . also fact are import to understand point but they are better to underlin your knowledg , but if you just know fact you can not express yourself . so you have to link the fact you know with your own knowledg to build a concept . with a concept you can express yourself so that other peopl will understand you . it is not like tell them some fact they will not understand if they do not realli know what the topic is about . with the concept you have you can explain everi small detail they want to know and they will understand , becaus you know what you are talk about . anoth point is about idea . in contrari to fact you do not have to copi idea , you can make your own mind of someth . understand an idea mean to understand someon opinion , you can support the opinion or you reject it and build your own opinion . thi special point is veri import to me , i realli unlik peopl who do not even have their own opinion , becaus i can not talk to them and they just agre what i tell them . to come to an end i want to say that it is veri import to give idea and concept to student , becaus they are go to learn to think on their own and to build an own opinion . we should not leav out fact , becaus their are good to keep in mind but not to express yourself .
