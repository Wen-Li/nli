i think young peopl do n't give so much time for commun as age ago , but they still give enough time to help their commun . nowaday the commun have lost a lot of their import . year ago , commun were much more import , becaus a person spent the whole or nearli the whole life in the same commun . today , in a global world , one live for some year in one commun and for some year in anoth commun . peopl chang much more their place of live and they are not so depend on commun as in earlier age . for thi reason peopl , especi young peopl , do n't identifi themselv so much with one commun and becaus of that they are also not interest in spend a lot of time for a commun . anoth reason is , that young peopl do n't have so much time as in earlier age . especi school and univers becam much harder . becaus of that , young peopl have to spend much more time studi and do n't have a lot of time for their commun . also at work , young peopl are more and more under pressur and have to work more . they also have to improv their skill and therefor have to go to an even school or someth similar . nevertheless , it 's not the case that peopl do n't spend time to help their commun . in my opinion they do it in a more indirect way . they support organis as `` wwf '' or `` amnesti intern '' which do n't work in a particular commun ; they work global . but their work contribut to the whole world and also to the commun . it 's import that somebodi care about the environ and happen in the world , which in fact influenc all of us , also the local commun . becaus of the abov mention point i think that young peopl give enough time to their commun , even if it is in an indirect way .
