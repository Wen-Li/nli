enjoy life vari from one person to an other . it differ also from one stage of life to an other . such an issu remain controversi , becaus it impli a varieti of factor and element that should be taken into consider . nevertheless , i do agre with thi statement due to a number of reawson . first of all , the stage of life ( the age of a person ) play a pivot role in determin one 's interest and tendenc . it provid a person with vision that enlighten and lead one to make the suitabl choic one ha to pick befr pursu a certain activ that will gener pleasur and entertain throughout the whole life span . young peopl have got a lot of choic in life , becaus they are support by their abil to do and pursuit a varieti of pleasure-gener activit . on the other hand peopl who are advanc in age have got a veri short list of option becaus they are govern by their advanc age and can never pursuit some activit that requir certain trait such as energi , mobil and agil . so old peopl are hamper by the age factor . in fact it is the main obstacl behind their limit pleasur in life . young peopl are usual abl to get engag in so mani activ of activite and hobbi that are pecular to young peopl such as athlet activit and particip in differ competit that entail young bodi and mind . old peopl can practic such thing in a rather differnt mannerdu to their limit phisic and mental capabilit . so , young peopl will find the chanc to entertain themselv fulli , and thi will eventu lead to full pleasur and enjoy in life . howev , the issu of enjoy remain controverti , becaus no one can defin what 's real enjoy ! the real mean of enjoy in life vari from one person to an other and also from one gener to an other . even differnt communit an d cultur will vari in thi context . nevertheless , and in my own point of view , i believ that young peopl do enjoy life more than old one .
