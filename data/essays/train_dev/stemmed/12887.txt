i would love to believ that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . but it is sad to see in human histori that most time we have made the good choic too late . howev two major contemporari problem seem to support thi opinion : the huge ammount of air pollut caus by vehicul all around the world and the fact that we are run out of fuel reserv . which mean that basicli we should stop use our car as much for the sake of the environ and we are go to have to anyway in the futur . at least in what concern car as we know them today . so the question is : whi are n't we chang now the way our vehicul work sinc we are go to have to do it anyway ? whi not find today an energi that would keep our car run but would n't pollut ? the truth is that modern technolog is abl to do that - car that run with electr or solar panel exist - but the finanti intrest of these massiv ga and oil compani seem to come first . i onc heard a sentenc that resum thi attitud . two oil investor , one say to the other : `` one day with all the money we make from industri we will be abl to clean up the environ '' . but thi is simpli not true . at one point it doe becom too late . we have to act now so that in twenti year there will be inde fewer car that caus pollut . thi transit can be done today with signific chang . for exampl , whi should everi member of a famili have a car when one is enough ? we should all start take the bu .
