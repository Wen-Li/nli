nowaday it becam realli easi to travel around the world , thu a lot of tour guid propos to travel everywher for cheaper . for thi reason , i think that thi market is interest for some peopl who prefer to be surround but in my opinion i 'm still convinc that the best way to discov a countri or a cultur by myself is more interest and more benefit . they 're sever reason wich can explain my choic that i 'm go to show in thi writ . the discov of a new countri is an amaz thing becaus when you arriv in those countri your are oftent surpris by the differ between how peopl who live their are and how you live in your countri . you meet an other way to live becaus you 're in vacat for the most of time ; as result , you could n't see how is their life realli becaus you 're more interest by sunbath or by the activ offer by the hotel . that is the badest way i think to take benefit from the countri wich you visit . i think that you loos much time to stay in your hotel instead of share great moment to learn about the popul and their coutum . in order of thi exampl i think that to travel in a group led is realli lost your time . the other way to travel and visit a countri is to trip by yourself . when you arriv in a countri everyth is unknown and you have to do like the local popul , to use the commun transport , to eat like them and in fact to adopt the same life dure your trip . howev , some peol could be scare to travel alon becaus they have ani idea about the place or about the rule . but that 's whi thi way to travel is more interest than a group led becaus you discov more interest thing about
