we can alway hear peopl say that life of some old peopl are becom more and color , even more that some of their grandchildren . thi is true . howev , bacic , it is no doubt that the old peopl can enjoy less fun than the young , we can just deduc it by look the old peopl around us . first of all , as gete older , it is inevit for the older to have more problem on thier health . so they can not do what they what equal as the young , they can hardli play footbal danc the hip-hop , or even just ride a bike around the park . moreov with the decay of vital , the older peopl do n't even to do such kind of thing , which in my opinion is obvious the happi that life ha offer . second , the young are not onli physic stronger than the older , but they are more open-mind and have curios to tri someth new . the joy and satisfact that one can get should never be underestim . thirdli , as for the older peopl , one allig often made is that they do have much more sparetim , to do whatev they like . they can spend the whole day sit besid the river bank wait for some ignor poor fish to eat their bite , or take care of their plant and veget in the garden . but i my mind , thi is onli one kind of enjoy , which can not compar with those what the young have when they achiev great accomplish . althoght it would be hard for a scientist to discov a new theori , or for a busi man to make their compani larger and more well-known , yet the satifaciton thereaft are an not be underestim . althought it is hard for some older to accept that fact that they can enjoy less enjoy , yet they have to face to realiti .
