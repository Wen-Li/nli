mani peopl tavel by a group led by a tour guid today . i have trvele both with the guid and by myself . when you travel alon , you will be abl to do thing that you would like to do . howev , i think it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guid . when you travel in a group led by a tour guid , they give you a lot of inform about that countri . you will get to know abot the histor event that happen , and learn the thing that you did not know by listen to the tour guid . for exampl , when i wa in elementari school , i went to franc . we had a tour guid . sinc he explain thing realli detail and humorusli , i listen to him care and i got to know a lot of detail of franc after the tour . next , you do not have to care about where to go for restaur and if you will get lost while travel . when you tour with a tour guid , they will lead you to the one of the nice restaur and where to go . if you travel alon you might get lodt often , sinc it is the place you have never been befor . final , the tour guid will probabl know the langag of the countri they are guid . if you do not know the languag of the countri you are visit , you will have hard time talk to peopl . but , when you travel in a tour group , you do n't need to have hard time make convers to peopl , sonc the tour guid translat thing to you . to conclud , i think it is much better to travel in a group led by a tour guid becaus you can get a lot of use inform , you do n't have to care about where to go or fet lost and you do n't have to concern about the languag .
