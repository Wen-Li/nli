ye , i do think that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . after all , it is one object of public and i think it is well achiev , especi nowaday . today , there are ad everywher you look . on internet , on the street , in the metro , on tv and even in public washroom . big compani have the power to buy a lot of public space and by place their advertiss everywher it can definit make you think that their product is better then it actual . thi can make you think that a certain product is the new trend . it is everywher so whi not in your home . mani realiti tv show use such an approach . they talk about it dure the news , the ad are everywher , you can chat we the `` star '' , you can support your favorit star . .. but the show is usual not that great . also , a lot of advertis featur star . most nike product refer to a profession athlet for exampl . they want you to think that if you are wear the new jumpman basketbal shoe , you might be as good as micheal jordan . peopl do not think that they will be as good as the star of cours , but at least they will be equip just like they are . but have a product relat to a star doe not tell anyth about it qualiti . there is also a huge focu made in public on the fact that a certain product is new . most peopl think that a new product or a new technolog is alway better than the previou one while thi is not true . just think about the ski market . each year a new type of ski is releas : parabol ski , mini ski and on top of that , they are design with new materi . thi impress of new make the product look better than the previou one while mani scientif research often prove the contrari . becaus advertiss are everywher , it featur star and focu on new , i think it look better than it
