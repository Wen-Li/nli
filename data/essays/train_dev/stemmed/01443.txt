as i have to respond directli i 'd say i agre . but actual it 's a bit more complic to answer thio question . if i think a littl about the statement i would say that younger peopl could and should enjoy there live more . there are so mutch possibl to have fun when you 're young like sport friend and activ like that which we actual do n't use enough . i 'm say thi becaus when i look at my life it sometim seem as it could have been much more fun and sometim i can think of passag in my life where i probabl did the best to have fun . when i think of the thing i have to do and of those my parent have to there is a huge differ , especi when i get in mind my father day . he work so long hour five or six day a week so that when he come home he ha dinner , mayb take out the dog for a walk and then goe to bed becaus he ha to get up veri earli again . that 's whi i think our young live are mcuh more fun and not so hard as adult 's live are . the main point of thi is the free time we can spend also dure the week after school is over . but often i think of especi thi time and i look at what i 'm do in the afternoon or what my friend do . i can see a lot of fun here when we do someth togeth and when we go to sport club and so on , but on the other side i can also see a lot time wast by comput , drink and those useless thing . probabl there are children and mayb also youth who actual never or at least seldom do such thing but even those who spend there time with thi still have more great hour togeth then adult do . of cours , there are advantag do be an adult , also when you look at the fun you have . if adult then after the lonk week have fun togeth thi fun probabl is `` much more fun '' then our `` youth fun '' and mayb it 's weight is just the same as that one of work .
