young peopl could be the most encourag member of a commun but not all are the same kind of person . i grew up in a small town with approxim 36000 inhabit . i attend a youth club that wa lead by the church . we did a lot of thing for our commun . first , we meet to discuss problem in our citi . everi wendsday there is a discuss round about current problem , e.g. about vandal in our old town . moreov we organ parti and event where we collect money for differ program to help other peopl . it is a veri good feel to have fun on a parti and at the same time help other . we also make trip to help underpreviledg peopl to renew their hous . these are some exampl of our commun work and i hope that they show whi i am disagre with the statement . but i also know that such a commun work is not generel . i think especi in big citi it is a great problem that young peopl do not spend enough time to help their commun . but i think thi is quit normal . they are not as close connect to their commun as i am . i suppos that they even do not have the chanc to be directli involv . there are to mani problem in big citi that hardli can be solv by youth . but i also believ that mani young peopl are not interest in their commun becaus they onli think about their own wish and problem . they are not abl to connect these two thing . i mean own problem and commun problem . i think they often stand close togeth . i would summar that thi is a difficult problem which is not easi to solv but i think that not all young peopl are lazi like it is maintain from mani adult . youth club event help elder peopl
