personali , i prefer to learn broad knowledg , and i believ that broad knoledg would be help for a person anytim . therefor , i agre with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specip subject . of cours , i guess other might explain equali valid for learn one specif subject onli . in fact , i am plan to enter the phd cours in a guradu univers . for phd studi , we need specif knowledg and it is better to know specif research area deepli than to know wide area thinli . howev , even if i consid the abov good , i believ that it is better for all peopl to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . whi i believ thi is follow : first , i think all most all peopl do not deep knowledg so much . on the contrast , broad knowledg is neccessali when a person face some troubl which are unfimilir to solv it . whenev we live , we can not do well if we do not our variou knowledg . that mean we are children . a child can not live alon if their parent do not help her or him . second , i believ that it is essenti for research also to have wide knowledg . for exampl , when i could not write a research paper well and stope my idea , i will read book or watch tv . sometim i can get use idea from media . in addit , if i have broad knowledg , i would be abl to discuss the problem on research by variou aspect . that 's whi i prefer to learn wide academ subject . consid the abov all reason , i agre with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specip subject .
