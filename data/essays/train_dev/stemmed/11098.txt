in these societi , most peopl will spend for 6 to 12 year in differ school to studi . the main purpos is to gain konwledg . while some student think to understand idea and concept is more import than to learn fact , so they just learn to understand . i do n't agre with that . i think the fact of konwledg is importand as well as the idea and concept . the two con not be without in the process to studi . first of all . we should konw the purpos of studi realli . everyon konw that the purpos is to gain konwledg . but what will we do use the konwledg ? we should use the konledg to becom out skll and abilitis , which could use in the work and real life . for exampl if a student think understand idas and concepst is more import than to learn fact . he will easli ingor the signific of the fact . and then do n't like to learn them . after the student graduat , they just master mani differ concept , but he is difficult to find a good job . becous he can not use hi konledg in the work . so learn fact is veri importan for the student ' futur . on the other hand , learn fact is also a good way to help the student to understand the idea and concept . as we all konw , most of the idea and concept are consist of word and fomular . they are verg bore for student . while when the student lear the idea and concept , the teacher tell them some fact about the concept . the student will becom more interest and understand the bore concept more quickli . so the fact ii good for the student to learn . the last but not the least , student can learn some experis and lesten from the fact . the fact are some event , someth happen in the past or some exampl of unsuccess . these is veri import . if the sutent do n't learn some experi from the fact , they will learn in the futur by themselv , mayb form the falur . from all abov , i can draw the conclus that learn fact is veri import for student . everyon can not ingorn them .
