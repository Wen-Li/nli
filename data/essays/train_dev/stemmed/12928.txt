i completelli disagre with thi statement . but befor support my opinion i should defin what i understand for enjoy life . for me enjoy life mean selfawar , be awar of what we have and be abl to feel pleas with it . accord to my definit of enjoy life , the onli requir to do it is to have awar . that mean that not onli young peopl can do thi . adult could enjoy much more than young peopl . after all , they have accquir more experi dure their live and have gain more independ . peopl with more experi have , gener , a clearer idea of what they want and are in a more settled-down possit . while young peopl are just about to discov theirselv , and their sort of freedom caus a lot of anxieti . they are not sure what they want for their live . they have to live day by day tri to find out wheter they want to studi or not , where they want to live , etc . and thi kind of situat bring them sometim more stress than pleassur . young peopl have yet a lot to learn , about their live and themselv . there is a well-know quotat that say that we do not valu what we have until we have lost it . thi usual happen to young peopl who , for instanc , do not valu their time live with they parent , think that life would be much easier or better by their own . and after they lost their parent , they regret not have enjoy more time with them . onc again , if you are not awar of someth , if for some reason you can not valu it , and thi reason could be lack of knowledg or experi , how can you enjoy it at the most ? in concluss , i believ everyon can enjoy life as much as anyoth . it is an individu task and ha noth to do with the age , sex or cultur . it is import for me to explain that with the exampl i gave befor i am not say that adult actual do enjoy life more .
