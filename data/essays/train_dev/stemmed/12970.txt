have knowledg is alway good . knowledg give us cultur and also show us differ point of view about thing . i think it is better to know about mani subject than just know about one in particular . peopl live in a societi and interact with other peopl . in my opinion , the onli way to understand peopl is to know about them . when you have the knowledg about a varieti of subject , you have a wider mind and it is easier to understand peopl 's behavior in almost ani situat . if you are a doctor , for exampl , you need to know about your patient ' behavior . you need to talk to them when they are in pain . it is easier for you if you have studi psicholog , for instanc . so , it is better if you have knowledg not just in medicin . knowledg about differ subject give us cultur and can be helpul in some case . it allow us to know about art , literatur , and mani other subject that are import for our charact . if we studi art and literatur , we can be more creativ . if we studi technolog , we can repair some applianc at home . it is practic to know about differ subject . in my opinion , the more we know , the more complet person we are . if we have time , it is better to studi differ subject than just one . in thi way we can easili interact with the peopl , we can be more creativ and , at the same time it can be usefuf for our daili activ . as a conclus , we are learn everyday about differ subject . it is good to do it for our own good .
