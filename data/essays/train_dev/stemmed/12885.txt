we can assum when we read thi that it would be right to say that young peopl enjiy more life than older but how can we be sure of thi ? when we are young we do lot of thing : like to parti see our friend , go abroad , but we do n't enjoy more life , no ? for exempl young peopl can be born veri quick and often do not take time to do thing , or spend most of their time watch televis , or on internet . and sometim are not awar of the chanc they have to be young and to do lot of thing . some peopl alway want more and more , the more they have the less happi they are . at the contrari older poepl are knozn to have the notion of what life realli is and know that time is precis . we can see that in gener older peopl schedul all their time and are realli organ . the older peopl get the less they want to loos time , they want their life to be like a calendar . we wish we can suppos so that they enjoy life too but in differ way but we can not be sure that they enjoy life as much as young peopl . what is nice when you are young is that you onli think of what you do at the moment and not of teh consequ you are often less respons , so have more fun . we can see that in disco for exempl or dure vacat . to conclud we can assum that young peopl do not enjoy life more then older peopl but in a differ way .
