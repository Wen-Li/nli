i agre with the statement that it is import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . basic our mind is like a fire which need to be kindl and not a vessel to be fill up . idea and concept are the right catalyst to set our mind wonder and think on those topic . famou scientist albert einstein use the age old calculu to deriv the theori of rel . our invent and discoveri have relat to the past . the present technolog owe a lot of it origin to the earlier gener . we can not do thing abstract and all of a sudden out of the blue . it may appear to have happen that way , when we superficailli go through the matter . a deeper studi reveal the connect , which are veri interest . fact are simpl statist . they are veri import . they need to be collect and kept for ration refer . we take decis base on fact not on idea and concept . so that is the role of fact in our life , i feel . for exampl , if we need to know whether a specif diseas ha becom an epidem and if the govern need to msuter more support and put in more effort to curb the further spread of the diseas , we need to know the number of patient regist at the hospit with the symptom of that diseas recent . these are essenti in lead us to make a crucial decis . fact can be of variou type . some about the past which would relat to the histori of the land . some relat to who did what etc and some good to know inform . they have their import in the societi . a student life is veri import phase in hi career . we need to choos care what he need to understand to keep hi inquisit and mind in search of quest . thi will take us a long way in buil a societi where there will be no deficieni of innov , discoveri and invent to accler us toward further growth and develop .
