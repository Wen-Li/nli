in gener public there is a preconciev notion that onc peopl becom older they are free from all problem , and respons henc they enjoy their life veri much but i do not agre with thi idea becaus , i believ that the older one becom the respons and problem they need to deal with increas . for instanc take one exampl of a success person have irrespons children . when he wa young he onli had to look after hi carrer which wa success so he doe not bother about other thing and can actual enjoy hi success , where as onc he becom older he should not onli look after himself , infact he ha to look after hi irrespons child . so he ha anoth respons and as well as a problem to mend hi child way , so he will not be abl to enjoy hi life onc he becom older . anoth exampl is that the older peopl allway have a fear in thier mind that they will die soon or later which would definit hamper them from enjoy thier life . anoth thing is that older peopl dont have physic strength . they can not concentr on a particular thing . younger peopl can actual enjoy their life if they organis their life properli becaus they dont have ani respons . even if they have ani respons or problem they have the strength to deal with these . which come by virtu of their age .
