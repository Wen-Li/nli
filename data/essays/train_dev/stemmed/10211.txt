i firmli disagre that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than special in one specif subject . i would say at ani time that dig in one field of studi as far as you can go is much better than poke other wast time and effort . the reason for thi are lack of in-depth knowledg and difficulti in be success in career . perhap , a famou say in my countri , ` when dig a well , dig onli one , could give a fundament idea about my opinion . i will discuss my reason in detail in the follow passag . first of all , have broad knowledg in mani academ field may seem wonder from time to time but it would onli result in lack of in-depth knoweldg in ani of those field . for exampl , if you studi biolog for 4 year instead of physic for 2 and biolog for 2 , you will get realli deep knowledg in biolog and even be abl to plan your futur academ life more easili . also , thi might get you acknoledg from other and rais a possibl that you will be award for it someday . secondli , for most peopl school are suppos to help them to get advanc in their career . have broad knoweldg in mani field can serious damag your futur career plan . suppos you are be interview by excut for a nice job . they will certainli be look for a person who would do well on the job assign to them . they will want some who know what they are realli do , not just someon with variou , but useless knoweldg on differ field . thi also can serious hamper your promot in the organ , even if you get hire . a person with speicial knowledg ha more chanc to advac in the organ sinc they can realli develop thier nich and know exactli where they stood and are go . in conlcus , special in one specif subject make a person more realiabl as well as knowleg . keep integr person and profession ha alway been repect by other and accept to be better than have shallow in a varieti of field . just look at today 's academ environ , it is easi to know that peopl are head more special direct than ever .
