as an undergradu student i know the import of understand idea and concept more than fact . whi ? well becaus i believ that the idea ha the import inform . sometim it is not necessari to know specif thing about a theme , it is more import to understand the central idea , so that the fact can be use as refer . for exampl , if a topic is a difficult one , it can be easier for someon to understand the idea first , so that later he or she can analyz the fact , solv problem use the fact , or investig other fact . i think that if someon undestand the central idea and if that person is abl to explain it to someon els , in a way that he can understand it too , it mean that he ha alreadi learn the import thing . i am sure that to explain the idea he will use the fact he anal befor , so he ha alreadi relat the fact and the idea . if the person rememb the fact . i am not sure , but i believ that most peopl can not accept a fact unless they understand whi is that . it is not easi to tell somebodi that someth is go to happen in a certain way if someth els . as a good exampl we have kid , they are alway ask whi is thi , or that , and they do not stop ask until they understand the answer , and as they grow up they learn that fact have an explan . i know that there are some fact that someon ha to know , some basic thing peopl ha to understand , like the mean of a green light , becaus thi is a sign that mean the same in the whole world , but fact like thi are few , that is whi i think that it is more import to understand the idea o concept .
