the are a quit mani aspect in favor of the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact as there are aspect against it . i agre with the statement that for student it is a lot more import to understand idea and concept . student not onli need to have a basic knowledg of the fact , they also need to creat a certain abil to transfer their knowledg . transfer their knowledg mean that problem and question that aris dure their studi are sometim not solvabl by pure learn fact and reproduc them . mani time it is necessari to see interconnect between topic or solut , for instanc in a mathemat equat . if a student ha to solv a difficult equat it is essenti to come up with some idea how to solv it . know algebra and calculu is one thing , howev , the student need to know how to appli hi knowledg in order to solv the mathemat problem . thu , learn fact will not lead him to the solut . instead , understand the idea of multipli , ad , subtract or divid equat with a clear concept gehe it will lead him into the right direct . by come up with a neww concept student are forc to think a lot more and make up their mind than by learn fact . it is therefor easier for them to come up with conceptu idea and new strategi . on the other hand it is import for a student to have a profound knowledg which he will onli obtain by learn fact . learn fact mean that a student will most of the time not run into a situat where he ha gap and will not be abl to respond to a fact question . for lawstud for instanc , it is crucial to have a profound knowledg of fact . as a matter of fact , learn fact mean that you train your brain and you will be abl to memor thing better than other . addit learnig fact enabl student to expand their knowledg about all kind of topic . depend on the major it is probabl more import for a law student to be abl to summar fact , wherea a philosophi student is expect to understand idea and concept .
