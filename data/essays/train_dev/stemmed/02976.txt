i disagre with thi statement . when you see the evolut of the number of car in twenti year , is constantli grow . that is whi i do not think that that in twenti year after there will be fewer car in use . car repres one of the most import product of consumpt . the major of peopl in develop countri ha a car becaus it is confort , easi to go everywher and mainli to go at work . in countri like unit state , car are necessari becaus distanc are veri big . mani famili in unit state have two car and american gener learn veri earli to drive . the main problem of car is that it consum petroleum . thi energi is more and more difficult to find and it cost a lot of money . car repres too one of the major caus of pollut and which provoqu environ 's degrad . so with all thi factor can we consid that in the fututr there will be less car in use than today ? i do not thin so . car 's ingen invent prototyp of car which will be differ than today 's car . and i think that in the futur there will be car with anoth type of energi like hydrogen . so as car'constructor find solut to make non pollut car
