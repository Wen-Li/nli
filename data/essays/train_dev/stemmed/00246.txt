i agre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject , becaus one subject is n't enough inform . with all the broad knowledg of mani academ subject we are studi , it 's been experi that we onli use 1 % of our brain . we should know about everyth go on around us , if we special on one specif subject it will affect our futur , the technolog , and we 'd be miss on alot . god gave as a brain for a reason . for exampl if you choos to concentr on physic , you ca n't studi phyic without take algebra . you could studi mani academ subject but concentr on ur favorit subject more , thi way you wont be miss on anyth . imagin a world with no doctor , engin or busi . diseas 's would spread becaus their wont be ani cure for them . peopl would live in the street , and there wo n't be ani street except a sandi dirti place . peopl would fight over anyth they find becaus it doe n't belong to anyon , and there 's no groceri store or ani shop . therefor alot of peopl will commit suicid , becaus there wont be anyth to do . studi mani academ subject is n't alot , you have 12 year of studi in school that is more than enough . then you graduat and go to univers , you will still studi there but less hour . you would be major in ani of you 're favour topic and the rest would onli help finish you 're credit and wast time so you would n't get bore . me myself i 'm a veri lazi person and i would preffer if we do n't studi academ subject , but if you think about it for a few second and imagin how you 're life would be you will imadit chang you mind , becaus there wo n't be anyth to complain on and life would be useless .
