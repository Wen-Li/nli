success doe n't happen overnight , it take lot of work and dedic . i believ that succes peopl are risk taker . in thi paper i will emphas my opinion with three point : to be success , peopl need to make mistak , to be success peopl need to take risk , to be success you peopl to explor and tri new thing . first success peopl are not perfect , they learn from their mistak . by make mistak a person depen hi experi . the person also open hi mind to new way of do thing . often when someon make a mistak he tri to not replic the mistak later on . let 's take as an exampl alexand graham bell , when he invent the telephon , he made lot of differ adjust some work some did n't . second , in order to make a mistak a person need to be will to take risk . if no risk are ever taken there is not mistak that can occur . the same thing happen over and over again . the person is in a cycl . go back to our exampl , mr. bell wa deaf , how could he have invent a telephon ? do n't you need to hear to be abl to speak through a telephon ? mr. bell took a risk in tri to invent abn object that he , himself , could not use . third take risk also mean that a person need to expor and tri new thing . by tri and explor a person acquir experi and is more abl to open hi mind to new thing . open your mind is an import aspect of be succes becaus it allow you to see and experi differ point of view . mr. bell experi clearli show someon who had an open mind and wa will to tri and explor new thing otherwis he would not have tri to invent a phone but he might have tri to invent someth he could have use to commun as a deaf person . in conclus , mr bell wa a success man becaus he wa will to make mistak , to take risk and to explor and tri new thing . mr bell did not just sit around and do what he alreadi knew , he went ahead and wa success . so now what are you go to do ? sit around or jump into a success life ?
