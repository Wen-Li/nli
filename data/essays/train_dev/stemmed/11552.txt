sadli , i do not think that in the futur there will be less car in use than nowaday . although , i would realli appreci that , i realli doubt it , becaus the possibl that peopl all start use the train or even that our govern will prohibit car in the citi , is quit small . still , i think it would be a huge achiev to reduc traffic on our street . the horriblest thing in citi are the overcrowd street , the nois of the traffic and the pollut car caus . still , i am sure car will not get out of favour , becaus peopl are obsess with them . i know sever peopl , who buy veri expens car , they can not even afford to buy . just becaus it is an huge statu symbol and everzon love to brag about it . peopl may argu , that oil prize will increas so much , that the ordinari man can not afford to keep a car , but i think that the industri alreadi ha good altern . natur oil , a ga or solar driven car are alreadz develop and fulli function . but these car are still so expensiev or weird look that peopl do not want to buy them . in conclus , there is no reason whi there should be fewer car in use than there are today . furthermor , sever third and second world countri ( like china and india ) are develop to industri state and therefor , they will even need more car . in an utopian world there would not be ani car and all peopl would have access to train , which would provid the transport .
