the question if young peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl is hard to answer gener . i would not say that thi is alway true , but for most of the case i agre with the statement . i think that young peopl are more free in their think in the way that they are often not think about the consequ first . they put mani thing not in consider . they just do it . my younger brother for exampl , he is 19 , is often go to travel without bee worri about what come next . i think he is a quit happi person who realli enjoy hi life . older peopl , in contrast , see the same thing often with differ eye . they have much more life experi and anoth view on mani thing and i think thi is often a more neg view . older peopl think about consequens first and are often more worri about what could happen in a neg way instead of how could thi be enjoy for me . my mother for exampl wa grown up in the communist system and wa treatend badli . nowaday she is a veri pessimist person and ha mostli bad oppinion about thing which i see actual posit . sometim i think she is not enjoy her life that much . my brother and me are grown up in anoth environ than my parent . we were grown up in a surround of freedom and had less worri in our young life then my parent had dure their youth . thi is one of the reason that i agre to the statement that older peopl enjoy life less than younger do , in most of the case . sure i think that in other case older peopl are enjoy their live as same as younger do or even more .
