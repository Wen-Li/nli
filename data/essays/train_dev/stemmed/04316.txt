i think that is mani import understand idea than learn the inform on memori . first , when you understand a concept you forgot it onli if you want . in fact when you learn and understand an inform , you put it in your mind . if you can live a particular situat about thi inform you can make it up and you understand better what you learnt . for exampl , sometim you have learn on memori a lesson becaus you have had an exam about it . at that time you have cought a good vote . now , if you think , it is possibl that what you learn that day , you do n't rememb it . i have got it . but in the other end , when you have studi for an exam with interest and you have understood the concept , today you can say that you have learn it becaus you rememb it and you can make them real . second , if we speak , in specif , about scientif argument , i think that you must understand it becaus , if you do n't get it , you can not applic scientif theori in the realiti . for exampl , my friend wa n't abl to pass the math exam . i must say that she doe n't like math and she doe n't understand it . in thi way she make mani time thi test and she can onli learn all the theori on memori but in the exercis she wa n't abl to show the result . when she studi math and understand it she wa abl to make her exercis and pass the exam ! she got it becaus she learnt the math theori , but also she applic it in the good way for look for the result . often i think that is difficult understood idea but if we applic it in the known situat of our live , we can understood better and do n't forg
