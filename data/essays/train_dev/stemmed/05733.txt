'' as thi exampl demonstr , peopl probabl do n't forget the lesson from the experi . i have a friend who is bestfriend in korea . when he had a free time from a compani for a 1month . he just wori about whether he should go in a hi compani group or lede by a tour guid . final , he choos that go to travel by a tour guid . he went to california . actual you know there are a lot of beauti place in here . such as ` laguna beach , seal beach , hill and so on ' but then , the tour guid lead to him and hi famili to disney land , and la downtown , korea downtown . they got a frustrat that tite schedul which made him . as we have seen , although they get a difficult physic , he should have go to travel with famili in a compani group to sum up , given the between travel is in a group and lede by a tour guid . i would choos to first thing . overal , the experi that i went to sanfransisco becam part of my life . i whole heartedli agre with the idea that go travel is in a group .
