car ha becam a part of life in the modern life . car is veri much essenti today to do the thing in the right time . i disagre with the given statement that `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . in the olden day man use to travel from place to anoth by walk . the invent of the wheel chage the evolut greatli . after the invent of wheel man introduc mani new vechicl for transport . he initi use bullock cart , tonga which were pull by anim . in the later life he introduc bicycl , which serv him in travel later he introduc motor cycl inord to reach quickli with less effort , inthi process man thought for luxiri way of travel and he start to introduc vechicl run by fuel . he design some of them for transport of good , and some for human , such as truck , buse respect . and he later thought about the luxori and privaci , then brought the car . car were luxiri mean of transport in the earlier . but it is a compulsori now . thi chang had occur becaus of globalis and necces . in the intial stage there veri less number of car , peopl use to see it veri intrestingli . but now day in the develop countri mani are have more than one car . the main problem with the car is they creat alot of traffic problem and also pollut . for thi reason mani govern are tri to decreas car by demand for more tax , parkingamount . but pepol are readi to pay that becaus they veri much edict to it . the question is that there will be less car with in 20 year than now but ithink it will not happen . the peopl possess car will not throw them out . there will be mani technolog come which will reduc pollut alreadi some are use car run by solar power . the other reason is that popul is increas day - day . and iconclud from the abov reason that after twenti year the number of will not be decreas instead the go on increas .
