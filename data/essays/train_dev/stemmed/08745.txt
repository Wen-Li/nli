in my opinion , understand is the key to the educ process . while teach , a professor not onli transmit hi knowledg to student , but he also give them the key to comprehens . the most import point is not what we learn , but how we learn . for exampl , educ system deepli chang dure past year . if we take the time to ask our parent how wa school when they were kid , we would probabl be astonish by their answer . inde , they were use to learn their lesson by heart , and thi wa a veri mechan exercis . sometim they did not even know what they were talk about ! educ system realiz it mistak , and chang it techniqu . nowaday , an import role is given to interact . inde , student have now the possibl to ask question . the answer they would get would help them in easili understand the topic they are discuss . as they get the mean of an idea , a concept , they rememb it in a better way . moreov , thi interact between student and professor allow them to show their interest in some topic . they are not passiv listen , they can bring their opinion , their idea . thi can lead to new issu , and open their mind . a concept can be spread from one to anoth , illustr the veri basi of develop . the thing not onli about knowledg , moreov about reflexion . school teach the power of think by ourselv . as the student understand idea , they learn fact , wherea the opposit doe not work .
