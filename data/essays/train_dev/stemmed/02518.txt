i think i am a kind of person who like do what i alreadi know how to do well and i think i am a successful person . but i well know some of my friend who becom so success by tri new thing . but i think these peopl are not too much . there are good reason to tri new thing and it must be excit to take risk in some situat . but i think peopl should concantr in just one aspect and should do just one work in a best way . peopl can be success onli do the work that alreadi know how to do well . becaus you must spend some time and effort to learn new thing . for instanc i decid to learn play viola at the began of the univers instead of play piano . i use to play piano when i wa in primari school . i have never play viola befor . therefor i wa unsuccess . if i had chosen to improv my abil in piano i am sure i would becom more success . i think thi statement is more about the trade . becaus my father have a compani and he prefer to do diffrent work regard hi own work . he alway choos to take risk . but sometim he becom success and sometim he doe n't . i want him to go on do he alreadi do . becaus he is well awar of thi work and also he ha good experi in thi work . but there is no insur in the new work . he doe n't well know whether he will be success . becaus of the reason that i state abov , i do n't agre with thi statement . accord to my experi i can say that , onli the peopl who tri to do thing that they well know are success peopl .
