some peopl might think learn fact is more import than understand idea and concept . howev , i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , it may not all that you are see . for exampl , there are so mani movi out there such as charley chaplin who made veri famous movi and histori of movi , and you might think that movi is stupid and just funni but nowaday peopl ca n't deni that it is one of the best movi so far . becaus he representit that gener with the funni behavi and peopl understood what he want to express of that movi . so umderstand is veri import . moreov , it 's not worth it even though you see somth an if you do n't understand the idea . when i see the prida callo 's self - portrait , i thought it 's so auful becau there is not even ani human 's face and there is onli blood and anim . but after i learn to understand idea and cocept , i total agre and satisfi with her art wark . if peopl see onli fact , they will miss so mani beautifu and sifnific thing in their life . final , think about see disabl . even though they ca n't see at fact at all , they feel everyth . so , i realiz the fact are just part of our a cleari , i stronli believ that understand idea and cocept for discov inport mean which is hide and have acknowleg to enjoy our life .
