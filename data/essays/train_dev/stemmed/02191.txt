with the introduct of mass media into modern societi , advertis ha develop a new , import role in modern life . as it becam import , it also had to develop new way of attract peopl , becom more and more similar to a work of art than to a businnes-rel expedi . one of these new way wa to present the product in the best possibl way , in order to attract more peopl to it . some compani dure thi process have also made the decis to lie about the real characterist of their product . person i do n't consid thi part of the game , eventhough sometim it can be realli annoy . advertis are suppos to show a product in the best way , and i can understand if a compani decid to hide the bad characterist of the product in order to make it more attract . but i realli ca n't accept when advertis boast about someth that is not true . i 'm not talk about children 's toy advertis , where product are shown in a `` fantast '' way in order to attract the children . i can understand that in thi case we are talk about a product that is in some way relat to the child 's fantasi , and the adult who are suppos to buy it are well awar of the fact that the toy will not , for exampl , fli , as it is shown in the ad . i 'm talk about advertis that are direct to an adult audienc and lie about the real characterist and possibl of the product . thi is in my opinion a real fraud and these ad should n't be allow to be broadcast or print . fortun in these day , new law about thi problem have been creat and hope advertis compani will not make a fool of us anymor .
