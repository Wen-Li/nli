in our societi , we have a lot of famili which have more than two car , wherea onli one car can be driven at each time . in addit the oil is more and more expens and to drive a car might becom a luxuri . that is whi we can wonder if in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first i will show whi there will have alway more and more car in use . second i will explain whi i think that there will have less car in use per famili . first i think that in the world , there will have alway more and more car . nowaday there still have a lot of poor countri . but some of them will becom reacher . for instanc china and india are countri which have each one billion of inhabit . and as they have a quick growth of their standard of live , that is whi in few year mani famili which have no car will buy one . but if i am sure that there will have more and more car in the world , i am convinc that there will have less car own by one famili . inde if the price of oil carri on increas ( it is quit sure that it will carri on increas becaus oil becom more and more rare and difficult to exploit ) and if ingen do not find a new technolog to replac oil ( for exampl electr or hydrogen ) , it would affect the budget of a famili and peopl would prefer ride a bike or take bu to go to their work rather than use their car . in addit more and more peopl want to preserv the envron and that is whi there will have more and more peopl who will take the bu to go to work . to conclud i can say that , even if the price will be probabl veri high in twenti year , it is quit obviou that the develop of countri like china or india will be respons for the increas of the number of car all around the world . but it is quit obviou too that , if we do not discov anoth technolog , the number of car in a famili will decreas becaus of the neg impact , of the price of the oil , on the budget of famili .
