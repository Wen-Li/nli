i think that young peopl today have a lot of time for all . today gener a child ha a good famili , a good clean hous with a beauti garden , he ha money and much time , gener a good situat around himself . the tipic day of the young peopl is more or less thi : first , the young peopl today go to school in the first part of the day , they stay in classroom for 4/5/6 hour and then they are freedom . second , in the first part of the aftenoon they make a homework for a small time and then ? they play footbal or go out for a shop time or play with a bad machin that they call play station for all time and they do n't observ the world around us . and so in thi day the youth live and the time pass . in the world , a lot of countri are in difficolt . onli the 8 % of the global peopl live like a normal peopl but the most part of the global peopl die for no food or no water . thi is a great vision of the world situat but in everi citi there are some problem that young peopl could to see and help . everi commun organ the group to bring food to the peopl without home or a poor peopl in gener in the street or for organ the local event to stay togeth for few good moment . but the young peopl have a better thing to do . in my person experi i think that help my comun is good , some peopl are in difficolt for eat or sleep and with my group of friend we help thi peopl . when ? when we are free , after school or after homework . i do n't spent my time in a bad way i want to help someon . finnal i hope that in the world much more peopl help their societi with their time with their money and with their love .
