some peopl think that it 's better to have a broad knowledg of mani and differ academ subject than to special in one specif subject . both the opinion present sever strengthen and weak but i 'd rather agre with the former posit . first of all , i think that broad knowledg is realli import in the modern world . in the busi world for exampl , you have to be abl to talk both about busi and about product . to talk about the former you have to know someth about econom ; but if you have to talk about the latter you should probabl know someth about sociolog and custom satisfact . that 's what i thought when i had to decid what to do after the high school . on that occas i decid to studi engin and among the differ major i chose civil engin becaus it did n't provid me with too much special . second , i also think that it 's veri difficult to decid which particular subject to focu on . in thi sens , it 's much better to studi and cover mani academ subject in order to be flexibl . in fact , flexibl make you abl to focu on differ issu and on differ subject dure your life . that 's what ha happen to me . i am an engin but i actual work for a famou econom consult firm . everyday life ask me to focu on differ problem in differ field and that 's whi i say that flexibl is an import valu . in that sens , have a broad knoledg of differ subject can help you to keep your mind open . consid all the thing state abov , i think that special doe n't consid the social evolut of the modern era . in fact , in today 's world , peopl must cover differ field in order to reach success .
