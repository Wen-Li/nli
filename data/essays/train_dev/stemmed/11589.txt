there are mani aspect that are done on the the student to make them learn and tow essenti way that student follow and do while they are learn . one way is understand concept while the other is learn fact . i agre that it is more import for student to got idea and concept than learn onli the fact without understand for mani reason like the believ of the subject and aquir the abil to appli the concept with the understand . if student learn inform without understand how it come , there would be apossibilti one day the inform would be chang accord to the weak understand of it concept . for exampl , i know an old man who think that the earth is a sphere and he kept thi inform for mani year . after decad the man chang hi mind sinc he saw proov that the earth is a sphere even he believ in the past that it is not a sphere ! . so the understand of the concept would make stronger believ than if the inform wa just learn to the student . the abil of appli ani thing that is in our mind will vari depend on the way that we got the inform in it . it woud not be easi for the student who just learn fact to appli them and imagin how the fact would work on the realiti while it would be so easi for the student who know the concept to deal with ani topic regard it and it would be enthosiast for them to dael with it and appli it sinc they alreadi konw where and whi it came from . for instanc , there is tow student who want to do research on particular topic . the one who know the reason of the topic deal with the research perfectli with the other student doe not . in conclos , understand concept is much more better than learn fact sinc the believ will be higher and the appli would be more when the student understand idea and concept . i advis all the educ compani to show the fact to the student rather than onli learn fact .
