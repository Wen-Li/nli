i think there are two kind of peopl : the first kind is good in know gener topic and so thi kind ha a good broad knowledg . the second typ is good in know specif inform about one topic . we need both kind of peopl to manag the live on our earth , becaus expert are need to make new discoveri in scienc , natur or anyth els . without thi expert our technic evolut could n't be continu . the human bee who have the gener knowladg are good to `` tidi up '' our world . they can creat a system in which we can put the lot of inform we get everi day . such men or women are also neccessari for our cultur , way of live and organis of the live . without the expert we would n't be so far in techniqu and social statu , probabl we would live with the dinosaur , but without the other group , we would n't be abl to understand all of the new thing that are invent or discov or die under the mountain of idea , new topic and invent . the most specialist are not good in explain new thing , becaus the most speak in their own languag . everi topic ha it ' own languag so you are not abl to know what 's go on . .. we need a good balanc between specialist and peopl who have a good broad knowledg . i ca n't say the one is better than the other ! i think that i 'm am specialist who know one or to topic next to anoth reali good , but not the rest . and my brother know much more topic , but not so deep like me . togeth we are a realli good team wich can solv a lot of problem in a veri effici way . so thi is a good exampl for what i ment in thi essay . everybodi onli have to know what he want and mabi a littl more and nobodi should be discrimin becaus of hi knowledg or unknowledg .
