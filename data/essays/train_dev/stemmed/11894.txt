the futur of the countri lie on the shoulder of youth . it is the respons of the present gener to lead the countri to the path of the prosper . i disagre with the statement that youth do not spend enough time in commun servic . mani success commun program in the citi where i live are associ with the activ particip of youth . take the exampl of the cleanli drive that wa undertaken in my citi to get rid of the rubbish accumul on the beach . student and young work profession show up in larg number and work eagerli in the activ . not onli that some peopl even went to the extent of put up sign board to educ the peopl about the hazard of pollut the beach . it can not be said that youth do not particip in the commun program due to lack of time . one of the reason could be lack of proper advertis of program . last year the local program in my citi to protect the turtl dure the breed reciev minim respons as hardli anyon knew about it , includ me . howev , thi the local corpor offic gave widespread public about the program and a larg number of peopl sign up for it ( it includ me ) . the respons wa tremend and there were actual more number of peopl than requir . youth also need notset apart a specif period of time for commun activit . they can incorpor them in their daili activ , like drop the neighbour child at school on their way to colleg , bring the neighbour groceri while they do their own shop or take out their garbag along with their own or in a number of other way that can be done paral along with their own activ . so , the notion that young peopl today donot allot enough time for commun activ can be rule out .
