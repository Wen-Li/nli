indunstri use advertis to make their product well-known to the possibl custom . they make seem product in the advertis so perfect and useful for peopl mayb more than they realli are . altough thi , few peopl remain so attract by some product that they realli think they need them . thi is caus by two main reason . first , the frequenc present of advertis in tv , newspap and magazin . peopl who is read a newspap or is watch tv is quit forc to see and see again the same product where they are rappres so perfectli . second , the use of advertis trick to enphat the product ' use . in my opinion nowaday there is too much advertis everywher , we can watch a movi and it is continu interrupt by advertis spot , we can read a magazin and everi two page there is one dedic for advertis onli . even if we walk around in our citi ; they are so full of advertis sign . everyth we do , we are torment by advertis , we are forc to watch and watch again how product are : one cheaper than other , one the best of all and one whom we can have less . but is it realli true ? i do n't think so , if a product is realli good there is no need to be so advertis becaus the best way to make peopl will to buy a product is show them that it is realli perfect in the realiti and not just in spot or sign where some magnifici product seem to be so necessari for a peopl 's life . for exampl nowaday mobile-phon are the most advertis product becaus technolog continu to envelop new model with new function that are advertis like useful for peopl . but i do n't agre that we realli need a mobil phone that can make video or photo and it is so expens while we alreadi have mayb old camera and videocamera that do the same function . mayb it is better to buy a normal mobil phone , cheaper than the brand new model becaus it ha the main function that a phone should have and thi is realli what peopl need .
