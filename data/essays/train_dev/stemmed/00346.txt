we can wonder how the amount of car in the next twenti year will evolv . in the one hand , we can think there will be less car in twenti year . we can imagin that the develop of public transport will keep go in the two next decad . thu , peopl would avoid take car for buse , metro or train . moreov , car need energi to work , and thi energi come at the time be from oil . the cost of oil ha been increas for the last ten year and it is absolut possibl that it will be the same thing in the next twenti year . if the situat of oil price will be worst and worst , so peopl will not want have a car ani more . it would be too expens . final , the environment matter will forc govern not to promot car sell , despit of automobil firm . in the other hand , there also are argument which tell the amount of car will increas . one of them is the possibl of car use high technolog , as electr instead of oil in the motor . these car , if they exist , could be cheaper becaus they would need a common energi . besid , in mani countri , china for instanc , have current a big increas of their economi . a huge medium class is be form in china and china is alreadi the third market in the world . if the purchas power keep grow in the next decad , it could have more car than now there . the exampl of china can be appli in mani develop region . one complic question is difficult to answer . will peopl move more and more , and by the same use their car more and more , in the next twenti year ? i think that it depend on the coutri . in europ , where the popul will be older in twenti year than now , we can think that peopl will work by be retir , and use more their car . in develop countri , the popul may work less than now , thank to best social condit of live . there would therefor use more a car . so , i global disagre with thi statement .
