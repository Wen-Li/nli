in my view i say that young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl do becaus the young peopl be at the age of teenag will have have a spici life which is more color and interest , whre as the life of old will be bore . for exampl if we take a human life he or she will be more activ and happi at the age of teenag , becaus that time bodi will be in a posit to react to everi respons occur . at younger age the respons are not known to him like the valu of money , think the futur of hi children , have greed on mani item , thi all situat make the him unhappi and bore hi life . at the younger age we dont have ani desir like thi just seek the desir of enjoy . at younger age there are also problem but compar to older they are less , younger age problem are minor relat to hi surround in school and colleg . younger age peopl are free from mental tension and they are free bird . older peopl give all their respons to the younger one after he becom a famili person , so then the younger one feel happi and interest in solv all the respons given . the older wont give up their feel if younger get suffer due to some reason , they also take the paral the respons of the younger . but at the same time if the older get a problem the younger may not take that much seriou . in gener , older peopl ha much love and effect on the younger but revers it is not true . so older peopl take all the respons of the younger and give happin to them , so i conclud that younger peopl enyoy a lot in their life then older peopl . and the younger ha more color life than the older .
