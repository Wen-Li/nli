i certainli disagre with the statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . i will explain my point of view along with some exampl . first of all thi statement can not be gener . there might be some young peopl that do enjoy their life more than some peopl that are older . although i do not think thi is connect with their age but more with a gener attitud toward life . for exampl an older person could be more pessimist than a younger person . but thi person might have been more pessimist througout hi hole life , even when he or she still use to be young . i do believ that there is differ way of enjoy and differ area that old and young peopl do get enjoment from . in my opinion thi is connect to the different life span peopl are in at differ age . each life span , like the toddler 's , the teenag 's or the adult one , bring along differ task . let 's say a teenag doe live more on the riskier side of life and doe take drug from time to time or have more liber sex habit than an adult would practiz , thi might be due to hi wish to experi independ or to defin hi own person by test hi own and the societi 's limit . that is a normal behavoiur for hi age and role in our western societi . in today societi a more liber way of life and express is often taken as a symbol for a happier life . thi doe not neccessari hold true . some of these teen , ask about their amount of joy in life , might not be happi with what they have at all . on the other hand an older adult , live more quietli with hi famili and have a satisfiy job , might not look as happi at first but if ask migth show a quiet high level of life satisfact . thi so call joy in life could mayb better be describ by the word happi or life satisfact . also anoth point is that there is a confus between see the older peopl 's life style , that inde might look a littl bore an less enjoabl to a younger person , as connect to their age . even when the realli old peopl of todaz were young their valu were differ to our . thez just continu live them until today . thi is not bore for them , but to us it look b
