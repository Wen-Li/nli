i strongli disagre with the statement that young peopl are not have time to help their commun . we can see mani concert come up that are manag or coduct by young peopl for a great caus like below . they strive hard to help by rase fund . for exampl , take our commun we have all togeth three club for help them ; home for the age , home for the blind , and orphanag . these club are found by all young peopl with the help of local author around our commun . firstli , home for the age wa found in may 21 , 2003 . in thi we have 34 club member who not onli help the activi of daili live for the age , but also work partim to help them financi . they also help them by give moral support which they are not get for their children by listen to their agoni . secondli , home for the blind wa found in decemb 1 , 2004 . thi is a veri talent club fill with teacher and musician . in thi club , we have all togeth 25 member who help them in mani way . they teach the blind how to read their note and help them in pali music instrument . they not onli help them educ but make them feel the natur by explan through their eye . thirdli , home for orphan . thi is also a veri smart and talent club . it ha around 18 member . these peopl go on street and search for orphan who are child labor , sleep on pavement , railway , bu stand , etc . they help them to get admit in some school by recommed for the local author . they not onlyh do thi they educ by help them in their homework . in our commun , we are go to start a new foundat soon . they do not do thi as a pass time or pleasur . they do with real concern . if they are not concern about thi , i do not think there is a need for them to do part time job , conduct concert , take help from the local leader to get chariti , etc . thi exampl show how young peopl are spend their time to help the societi and spread awar to other .
