car are one of the most wide use vehicel for travel today and whether their number will increas or decreas in twenti year is a veri polem topic . accord to me , ye , inde there will be fewer car twenti year from now . firstli , the pollut caus due to combust of fuel in the car 's engin is pose grave threat to the enviorn . govern and the peopl are increasingli becom awar and concern about thi fact and hop new rule will be formul on limit the number of vehicl a famili can own or the the number of car an offic is allow to have . peopl are make conciou effort in reduc pollut due to car by make car-pool or travel in public transport such as buss and metro train . thi way , the number of car will reduc and more peopl can travel in the same vehicl instead of each one go seper in thier own person car . furthur my opinion i would like to suggest that the number of car will also reduc due to the acceler fuel price . the fuel price are inceas day by day due to inceas scaric of petroleum . it is a non-renew resourc which is deplet rapidli and thu it scarciti will result into price-ris . so afford a person car will becom increasingli difficult for the common peopl . with the advent of newer technolog such as comput and the internet the basic motiv for peopl to travel is becom less import . peopl can now download their offic work on their comput , at home , and can work in the comfort of their home instead of drive and go to offic . student can also attend lectur on their comput and submit assign which reduc their need to travel to school everyday . they can interact with their proffesor and peer on the internet through text or voic messag with the help of a comput . thu i would like to conclud that due to all these reason car will becom redund and , if use , will pose a threat to our enviorn and thu will becom obselet shortli .
