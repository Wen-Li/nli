i think it is much better to speiclal in a certain subject . for the follow reason . first , in modern soceiti , as the scienc have depelop countless subject like cloze techniqu have been creat . in addit , the subject can be classifi to mani branch that contain a lot of infomatrion . so if you tri to have broad knowleg of mani academ subject , you will end up skim onli the surfac of them and you will not practic know the subject . on the other hand , by choos one or two speicif subject learner can focu on them . if you special the subject . you might improv and develop the subject that wll provid a great benefit to the societi . second , if everyon want and tri to have broad knowleg and avoid special a subject . there will be no futur in each subject . they will lose the heir of reseach and not onli be develop but also begin to regress . as the result , the societi will no more expect to gain benefit form academ subject and reseach . third , if each person special one thing , he might interact with other who have other specifict inform . tthere are mani case that a ceatain subfect will requir some inform on other suject . for exampl , take a look at an erectr dictionari . you can benefit from it veri much . but what if there is no specif techniqu to desigh and produc an erictr badg could onli good translat and interpret make en erectr dictionari ? it will need both the tranlat and erectr engin and even more expert on differ subect . i definit suggest that peopl should special one and help other in case
