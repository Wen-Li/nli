some peopl think that have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than special in one specif subject . the rest of the peopl disagre with thi idea . i belong to the second group of peopl . becaus special in one subject is more reason for me due to the reason of that one can not be consid as special if he or she know littl from everi subject and one can get confus by tri to deal with multitask . firstli , know one topic with it everi detail make a person special . for instanc , two research assistan of chemic engin studi can be thought to clarifi the point . one of them ha research in mani area includ , fluid dynam , heat and mass transfer , thermodynam and complic process control system , while the other one search a special subject relat to heat and mass transfer . he just want to know more about the design of plate heat exchang . final he will an extens background , wherea the first guy loos himself in mani area . so a special compani interest in heat exchang can offer a job to the second guy . nevertheless first guy can not be thought an expert in ani area to be hire by a special compani . secondli , manag multitask at the same time requir anoth knowledg and capabl not to be lost in mani area . first guy in the exampl befor may get confus when he see that a perfect design of a heat exchang is not as good as the inventor think . it may lack a control equip from the process control point of view . howev , he is not awar that it is unneccessari to have thi properti for a heat exchang sinc he ha not enough inform in both area . as a result , know one specif subject well gain a person special . with thi special properti , he or she can differ other peopl dure hi or her life , although thi person ha not extens inform in other area .
