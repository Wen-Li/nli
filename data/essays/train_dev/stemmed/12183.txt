if one would not jump in to the water one could not learn how to swim . ye i agre with the statement that to be a success person ane should be will to take risk in life and tri new thing rather than just do what he ha been do . mani of our ancient ha gone unorthodox way and had been maverick . thi is the reason we hav seen the new age aris with better life . abil of human to think and do new thing make him differ from anim and there make him to achiev new mileston in life . if a person would just follow a same routin or the same fashion what hi ancestor ha been do there would be no progress . peopl would not be abl to find solut to the problem they are face and therefor could not be abl to make there life more comfort . scientist , architectur , doctor , engin are few of those peopl who contribut a lot to the develop of the societi and if these peopl just keep do waht they know and been taught , i fear we could not see ani further advanc in our present age and the progress could onli happen if the worldmak tri new thing in life and take risk . take risk in life and therefor tri new thing probabl help human to learn and gain experi . might be that he may hav to face the faliur and dissapoint in initi stage but sooner the success will kiss the feet . no one is born perfect it is the practis and the determin to tri new thing make the person a better one . if manni of the great freedom fighter had not taken the risk and had faught for the freedom of there countri we would not hav seen manni of the great nation . also if the faomou astrolog ha not stood against the religi belief and hav said that it the sun which is in center and not earth we would hav been unknown about the mystri of univers . if man had not taken the risk to step on the moon there would hav been no neil armstrong .
