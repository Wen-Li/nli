i agre with the statemnt that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . have broad knowledg in one subject confin you onli to one field of studi . not onli that but it also confin your mind to not think about anyth els except thatsuject . the other disadvantag is that have in depth knowledg in one subject also confin your futur job oppurtun becaus of lack of knowledg in other field . so it is alway benefici to have knowledg of mani academ subject . by have knowleg in all suject the individu is more accomplish to solv ani problem in ani field . it also increas the fleibil of the person . hi futu will also be veri bright as he will have sound knowledg in all the subject though acquir knowledg is tough and also a time take process it is definitli worth the hard work as u are presnt with fruit reward . for exampl jon and smith work in the same offic jon ha knowleg about all the subject where as smith onli special in technic detail of the compani . when a prolem aris in the technic depart . both of them can solv the problem easili . but when a problem aris in the managemet depart onli jon can solv the problem . so jon can solv both the manag and the technic problem . where as jon can solv onli the technic problem . so jon is more flexibl in hi work than smith is and ha a definit edj over smith not onli thi have knowledg in differ subject also increas the effici of a human be . he can definit do more work if he ha sound knowledg in differ field . so i conclud that it is alway better to have broad knowledg of mani subject rather than special ion specif subject .
