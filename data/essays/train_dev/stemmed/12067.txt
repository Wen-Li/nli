someon think it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to sprcializ in one specif subject . in my opinion , but i disagre it . i think it is better to special in one specif subject . to have broad knowledg of mani academ will caus mani neget result . firstli , if you want to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , you must spend much more time to work hard . you will hvat to give up mani other import thing . you will not have enough time to play sport and your health will be wors . otherwis , you will not have enough time to commun with your famili and friend . you will fell lone after a long period . secondli , even you have spend so mani time to work hard and you have broad knowledg of mani academ subject final . but probabl , you onli know some common inform of mani academ subjedt and are not good at one special subject . for exampl , a physician who know mani knowledg of histori , comput , plant and so on . he must have not enough time to studi hi medic knowledg , so he will not a good physician . otherwis , if everyon all have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . in the result , they can do all kind of job but they can not do them veri well . in a conclus , i think peopl should have special knowledg in one specif subject and review broad knowledg of mani academ subject but not spend too much time on them . becaus broad knowledg can give you more idea of your special subject .
