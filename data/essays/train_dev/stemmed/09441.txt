i disagre with the idea that travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best way . there are two reason to support my opinion . first , in a group tour , you ca n't visit place freeli . if the place you want to visit is not veri popular , there are a few plan you can choos . when i wa a high school student , i visit kyoto in a group of my school . then , i want to go to sanzyusangen templ . howev , the plan of the tour doe n't includ the templ . therefor , i could n't visit there . second , although the time to look around the place is usual limit in a group tour , you can spend time to look around as much as possibl . you would n't be abl to understand the histori of the place if the time for sightse is limit . when i went to todaiji templ in my school trip , i could't check care the explan of the templ or statu of god becaus i did n't have enough time . furthermor , when you walk around the place or the town , you may notic good thing that you could n't find in a group tour , for exampl , the kind of peopl there or delici food . when i travel to tokyo alon , i got lost . then peopl there help me . thi is veri import exper
