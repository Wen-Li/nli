ye , i total agre with thi statement say that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . it is a shame that be a consum is get harder becaus there are too mani advertis present their product in the most attract way . i think the reason is that there are mani compani and manufactur out there make the same type of product . therefor , they all have spend a great amount of money on advertis so they can compet with each other and surviv . and due to the advanc technolog those advertis agenc use , almost everi product they present look like the best on the market . but veri often , consum do n't realli get what they expect after purchas the product by just look at their ad . for exampl , few week ago i saw a digit camera ad on fri 's electron that wa offer a great discount on thi featur model . it the pictur , the camera got a great metal textur and look veri well built . although i own a profession digit slr camera ( by canon ) for a while , i want soemth inexpens , small , and easier to carri around in the campu . i purchas the camera without do some research onlin or tri it in the store . when i took it home , i realiz it bodi wa not metal but some light ; cheap plastic . the fulli charg batteri die with in just 30-40 minut of photo shoot after tri it . i final got frustrat and decid to return it . the return line wa veri long and the guy behind me wa return the same camera too due to the same reason . we talk for more than 30 minut while wait and we reach a conclus that never purchas someth just base on the ad or pictur . from now on , i do studi onlin or read some consum review befor i purchas . even the old say goe `` a pictur worth more than a thouthand word '' , it doe n't appli on all product we see on advertis nowaday .
