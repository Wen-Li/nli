some peopl think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . but i do not agre with thi statement . i will first give some reason whi one could find young peopl 's life more enjoy and then explain my reason to reject the statement . one could think that the life of a young person is funnier and that young peopl are happier , becaus in gener young peopl have a lot of freetim . they often particip in sport and art . in addit , they go to a lot of parti meet a lot af friend . furthermor young peopl do not have as much respons as elder peopl have . they are not yet compel to earn their own money and sometim they even live in their parent 's place and therefor have also less duti . but one should not forget that while have less respons young peopl have also less right . they are not yet allow to take all their import decis on their own . in addit , they have lot of problem to resolv , such as pass exam , discuss with parent , make plan for their life . especi the latter might yield a lot of struggl , doubt and fear . therefor , one should not forget that also for young person life is not onli fun . in my familiy i have two veri good exampl of peopl who seem to be more satisfi and happi now than they were year ago . first i have to mention my parent . in my opinion they are veri satisfi to see their children succeed in life and they take advantag of the opportun a life without small children offer to them . they are travel much more today than they did when i wa younger . thu they are also happier in their relationship . the same account for my grandpar . sinc my grandfath ha retir they are travel a great deal and i think that they are realli appreci it . therefor , i do not think that peopl are less happi later in life in comparison to their youth . everi age ha it advantag and it disadvantag .
