knowledg is someth that the more you have the better it is . it cant neither be rob nor taken away . it is someth that is go to stay with you forev . though knowledg of all the subject is requir but i disagre with the statement and believ that special in one subject is more neccesari . though i do not disagre that broad knowledg of mani subject is requir but accord to me broad knowledg knowledg of mani academ subject is requir till say a bachelor degre when you are young and need inform in all subject . i agre that that if u have knowledg in all subject then you will over all be a more educ person and have a better impact on peopl that you meet when u talk about a variou number of thing . but accord to me special is much more import when you reach a master degre becaus today world is more of special and onli those type of peopl are valu that are special in their field . see todyay if you are special in your field then you have a better chanc of make to the top in thi field and you cant earn a lot of fame and recognit in that field and you can also becom a dr in that field but incas of tri to know a lot of subject would you might not be abl to as good in either of the subject . for exampl we can see the indian presid apj abdul kalam who is said to be the father of indian rocket scienc but if he would tri to have a broad knowledg in mani academ subject like say histori or geographi or ani other subject then he wouldnt probabl be as good as what he wa in rocket scienc and therefor he would not have been as famou as what he wa then . so that is whi in my opinion special in one subject is more import then tri to be good in all subject .
