that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well is a quit inters question , in fact it is relat to intrins human attitud . all the human want to be success peopl , but realli it is alway necessari to innov thing of to risk the life or someth to have success in life ? whi i can not be simpl myself do the thing that i know to do , ever in the same way , and becom a success peopl as well ? probabl some exampl could help us in aswer to thi question . in human histori there are mani exampl of peopl who becom success onli becaus they tri new thing and took risk . think about cristoforo colombo , he wa the first sailor to have the idea to go to india by the sea inst that by land . he decid to tri a new thing and he becom veri success , in fact he discov america . natur he take a lot of risk for hi own life in do that . in the veri recent histori we have the exampl of bill gate who becom a success peopl , the richest man of the world , do someth that no man have never do befor . he invent comput and he invest all hi life and all the money that he had at that time in found hi compani , microsoft . so he decid to take the econom risk . howev we have also to consid that not alla the peopl who tri new thing and take risk are success peopl , in fact in choos thi way it is common to fail . for exampl mani peopl die in the tent of bee the first man who fli from america to europ . in my opinion , as the abov exempl show , you can not be a success peopl just do what you alreadi know how to do well , without take ani risk . in thi way you probabl can becom a respect worker or perhap an affid person , by i think thi is not the definit of `` success peopl '' in which most peopl are interest .
