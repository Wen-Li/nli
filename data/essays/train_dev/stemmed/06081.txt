when peopl go to travel , some peopl llike to travel with their own plan while other prefer to travel with a tour guid . a trip with tour guid provid a conveni journey in that they provid much inform about the place and plan sechedul , howev , i do not think the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guid . in my opinion , to travl with our own plan is more excit experi becaus i can go to the place where i can want to go and i can enjoy a trip with my friend . if i plan my trip schedul , i can go anywher i realli want to go . in case of travel with a group led a tour guid , i should go to the place where i realli want to go , howev , if i am place in the center in my travel , i do not need to wast time to look and work around which i do not interest in . with my flexibl schedul i can enjoy more my trip . moreov , schedul my travel plan is quit excit and from do that , i can get some use inform about the travel place . in addit , in case of travel with a group by a tour guid , i should get along with other peopl particip in the trip . howev , i do not realli want to enjoy with them and there are some peopl who are interfer the trip with their own conveni . i never want to be interf with those situat becaus i realli wish to enjoy my trip and also have a opportun of take some break from hard work in school , stress out , and refresh my self . to travel is a excit and so memor experi . sinc i do not be involv in such situat which i realli want to and i hole to enjoy my trip fulli , i prefer travel with my own plan .
