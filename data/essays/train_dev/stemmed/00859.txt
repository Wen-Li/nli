i thik thisstat is wrong . it is right that there are more thing youg peopl can do are in the societi . and the old peopl bodi can not do hard sport or excersis . but for both youg and old peopl , if they thought that the life is borng , the life will not be fun even you are youg or old . it doe ot matter . for youg peopl , there are thing that onli young peopl can enjoy . and for old peopl , there will be thing that onli old peopl can enjoy . the thing you want to do will chang gradual you get older . i think olni youg peopl think that yong peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . becaus they have not experiec the life of old peol . young peopl say thi statemet onli from the vidual part . they shoud talk with their grandpar . when i talk to my grandmoth , she is not boredwith her life . she say oposit thing , she is have fun with the slow life and use her money that she got from workink hard when she wa young for have fun . i am seeig my grandmoth have a happi life time now and hear thi talk from my grandmoth so i do not think that the old peopl are have abor life and they are think to becom tyong onc again . and i do not care for be old . i want to enjjoy the life with slow time talk with my grandson or granddought . from these reason , i think thi statement young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl do . i think everyon will think the life in old age is fun and enjoy it when thay becom old and forget that they were think thi statement .
