consid the popul of the world today and distribut of incom rate among countri , it is hard to give an immidi answer to the question about the number of car in use in twenti year ' time . let me brirefli state whi i have chosen to emphas an ambigu instead of an exact answer . first of all , the popul of the world is grow rapidli which might creat the impress that there would be more car in use as there would be more peopl live on earth . it is true for the case of turkey for exampl . i came to observ that automobil galleri in turkey are the best profit maker and also the number of car sold increas dramat each year . but taken from anoth aspect , it could quit be the opposit . the rapid growth of popul is observ more in underdevelop or develop countri whose gross nation product or incom per capita is veri low . then it would be more like for the citizen of such countri to tend to use buse or train which would be a much cheaper way of transport . in india for instanc , one can easili notic thi situat . secondli , the increas in the number of peopl live in a citi might push it dweller to make use of public transport . not becaus that these peopl can not afford to buy car but becaus that they do n't want to lose their valuabl time on road , stuck in the middl of a never-end traffic jam . let 's take the exampl of new york citi . even the mayor of thi citi is said to be use the subway in order to evad from the traffic and promot the use of subway . yet there is also the case of california where we can see anyon at ani age to own and drive a car . becaus of it geograph characterist , it is almost imposs to live one 's life without a car in lo angel . not that the citi is overcrowd such as new york . but becaus there are mile in between ani two destin . as to my person observ , there are a bodi of reason both to agre and disagre with the statement . in the end , whatev the sing and predilict are , we live in a world of unpredict and supris . who know wheter a geniou scientist would come up with a more time and energi save invent than a car , or not ?
