accord to what all govern say , that all car must onli be transport from an countri to anoth with in a five year of date of due from the compani . everi countri must make a roul about control the number of car that is come year after year . everi new car that is made , it bring with it more pollut and more traffic to the world . the govern must have a limit or a regul to prevent the addit of car year after a year . i think that in five or ten year they will be more fewer car then there is now , but i do n't think that after twenti year they will be more . becaus technolog will prevent it and they will stop use car . they will use new technolgi rather then car that bring us problem like pollut , car accid , more traffic , death penalti etc . .. in the newer world they will find a solut for it , becaus if not it will be a catastroph and a disast . becaus logic world is not gonna get bigger in twenti year but car are gonna get much and much more fewer then it can contain . i think technolog will take place in twenti year from now , it might use plane besid car or huge escal through build , mayb even escal underground . no one know what is in the futur or what is wait for us then . life is much harder then we think we ca n't just imagin it with in a few word it much more complic . i hope for the best in our futur life for all whom gonna particip in it. , and i hope that tecnolog will prevent the catastrophi probelm of car and stop it from grow into the world and multipli by billion . of countiti . everyon look for hi best and good . life is life .
