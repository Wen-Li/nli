i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . one particular exampl is what i am current observ in my commun . i live in a residenti area with my famili which is close to shinjuku , a sort of entertain center of tokyo . a month ago , the plan to build a huge studio-typ apart complex next to my place wa reveal . thi new apart is mainli target to peopl without famili who work and studi in shinjuku . as the area is veri close to the entertain area , it is much assum that mani of those who work as host and hostess at bar may live in the apart . then , the big disput occur and mani peopl live in the commun start to organ a movement to oppos to thi plan . they say that thi apart will greatli damag the live condit of the peopl in the commun . they meet regularli , prepar poster and frier and consult with local politician and lawyer in order to figur out how to stop the plan . howev , none of the young peopl live there , includ me , have not join or even help thi community-wid opposit movement . peopl who have been activ involv are those who are over 60 . given thi person experi , i wonder whi young peopl nowaday are not eager to help their commun . first , i think young peopl have less attach to the commun they live in . for exampl , i know i will live at a differ place when i have a job somewher els . for young peopl , commun are not perman , while for older peopl commun are where they live until they die . second , i believ that young peopl simpli do not have enough time to help their commun . they work long hour and have variou commit to other `` commun '' they belong to , such as work place , school , virtual space on the internet and friend . and they know that use their preciou time on these `` commun '' can make their live more excit and interest than they do so for their real commun . to sum up , i agre with the statement and i also think thi is not someth that we can easili chang .
