in my opinion idea and fact are both import and link by a relationship of caus - effect . the fact is a descript of what some peopl thought and they have had the power to traslat an idea in an action . when i wa attend the high school , i rememb i told my mother that the school gave us just some inform about the fact that ha happen and not the possibl to understand new idea . for exampl , in my opinion , the histori ha two interpret : some peopl think that it is use to learn fact , while other think that begin from the past fact , you can understand the present histori . the histori is like a circl , sometim it repeat the same situat , the same mistak , the same fact . to learn fact is the better way to understand the idea , and honestli i scare about the peopl who ha got the idea without know the fact or without give to them the right relev . so the fact is import to understand the situat and to analys which is the best idea to use in that moment . it 's true that the analys of fact is use to start think and it permit to stimul more the brain of the student , with discuss with the teacher . i hope that in the school there will be dure the histori class ( or other subject ) , the time to discuss whi some fact happen .
