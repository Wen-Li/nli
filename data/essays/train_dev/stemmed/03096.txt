i agre that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun in these day . peopl have to work individu , but they also should work for the group that they are a member of . not a spesif group i mean , they have to particip in public , for exampl in a school , or in a famili . teenag are not familiar with their respons as a student and also as a famili member . usual , peopl start learn to be a part of commun in a famili . children should studi lesson , show respect to older member , when parent should work for the famili , and help their children to becom a better adult . besid the gener idea , they also have to love each other and should have a good relationship . unfortun , young peopl avoid to be closer to their paret . they do n't listen the advic an experienc adult can give , instead they start get away from their home . teenag even want to be with their unknown friend , rather then spend time with their brother or sitster . anoth exampl where young peopl show respons is their school . they have to particip to class , studi for exam and also studi for the futur to get a good job . recent , student think school is somewher to get away from home , or have fun without ani prepar for lesson . they see the rule as challang that they have to break and get attent . then school diciplin have more strict rule to control them . so the commun they tri to work fell apart . teenag should give some of their freedom to have a peac school life . to conclud , young peopl should sometim act like a grown up to control their live better . if they can be a good student , friend , sister/broth , daughter/son , they can creat a better commun and they also can enjoy where they are and what they are do .
