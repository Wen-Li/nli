i can eas imagin that there will be much more car in use in the futur compard to today . there are sever argument whi i agre with the statement , that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all the world popul is still increas veri fast . thi aspect lead to an simlp conclus . more peopl need more car . especi the popul in the citi are grow , becaus there excit an movement from land to the citi for the last year . for the peopl live in thi big citi or the littl town neabi , it is usual to own a car . so for thi reason more car are need . furthermor there is anoth veri import aspect . the global buis is get much more import today and will be the main buissn in the futur . i infer from thi aspect , that in the futur buis peopl , or work peopl in gener will need car and plain much more than today . i can not imagin buis men without a car even today and in the futur it will be much more neccessari . it is said , time is money ! and so it will be in the futur . the third aspect i am think of is , that peopl do not have much time today to reach their destin , becaus of the veri tight schedulethey have . thi will not chanc in futur . today thi mainli stand for buis job , but in the futur even thi will chang . peopl work outsid the citi on the field will need more car to get in the next citi to provid their product on market . i think in the futur even farmer will tri to sell thing onlin , so a transfer form the land to the custom must be guaranti . you will need more car for thi , too . final these argument are the reason whi i think thee will be defent more car in the futur .
