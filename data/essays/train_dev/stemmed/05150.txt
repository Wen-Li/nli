well , to see if i disagr or not with be travel with a tour guid i have to explain first the advantag and the disadvantag . well , let 's begin . the advantag we can say that primarili there are four advantag to be travel accompani by a tour guid . 1. they have the experi that they know well the place in which you are travel , most if it 's a differ countri or even a differ citi . in case it 's a different countri in which there 's a differ languag talk , that 's a realli benefit . 2. they know import fact that mayb one will not know in case you do n't know histori or do n't understand the languag . 3. i think , that the primarili advantag of be guid by a tour guid ii that you do n't get lost ! it 's normal that if you are vist a citi or countri for first time you can easili get lost , so , ther 's a great advantag ! 4. a tour guid know the princip place or the most common , the famou one . the disadvantag about the disadvantag , there are also four , 1. the first one is that you have to pay money ! ha ! ... mayb you are travel with exact money and you do n't have enough to pay a tour guid ! 2. when you are guid by a tour guid you depend on the fast he move , mayb you want stay more time in some place and get out faster in other one , but it depend on him , the tour guid . 3. even the tour guid know mani place , one can get into servic offic and ask for inform , you do n't have to depend on other ! 4. and one import and final fact is that you can meet a lot of peopl by your own . you can make a lot of friend , know lot of place you realli want to visit , not onli place all visit , instead mani other ! conclut i prefer travel mayb with onli a friend and between he and me i think it would be a great experi , without wast and meet a lot of peopl .
