in gener i think that both understand concep and learn fact are the two face of the same medal . i tri to explain here below all the connect between concept and fact especi in scienc metter . all the big scienc discoveri depend on the observ of fact , but on the other side is import to know all the theori relat to thi observ to give a coher and logic explan of fact we are observ . to give an order to thi matter i think that first ( in a temporari order , not for it import ) student need to learn the instrument they must use to observ fact , so in the first part of student format is necessari for them to learm as much as possibl about all theori and idea which are the core of the metter and after they can understand and rememb much more eas all fact connect with their studi . for exampl if you are studi the atom structur , of cours you need to know everith about the chemistri and relat theori . thi exampl feat quit well to thi assey especi if we think about the discoveri of nuclear fission . it happen that the woman , who wa of cours a phisyc and have studi a lot of theori , wa observ the fact about acceler neutron push against the nuclear part of a not stabl atom . dure the observ of the fact , she expect that , use enough energi , the neutron would link with the atom , instead it heppen that the atom divid produc a larg quantiti of energi , and thank to her previou studi she understand she had discov the nuclear energi and atom fission . in last analisi , i can say that the deepest concept knowledg would be unus if it would n't be use to learn how all these theori are connect with fact , and at the same time it would be unus if we know a lot of fact but without know how these fact lik togeth .
