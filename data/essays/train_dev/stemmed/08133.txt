there are peopl in the world that prefer do what they have alreadi know how to do well . fortun , there are also peopl that prefer tri new thing and take risk . thi second type of peopl is , in my opinion , the exampl of who is a succesful person . a person , that base hi work onli on do what he ha alreadi know how to do welll , ha few probabl to emerg in hi field . thi kind of person , without person idea to improv better hi work or hi like , ha no possibl to be a succesful person . for istanc , a worker that ha n't idea to improv hi situat , ha no possibl to becom an execut . on the other hand , if an employ ha innov idea for do better hi work , it is possibl that he will becam an execut ora chief worker . so to becam a succesful person is necessari to have new idea and tri new thing , but is not at all . there is an other thing to condid , the luck ! tri new thing lead to take risk . the luck is in import compon of the risk . in gener , if a person ha innov idea and take risk , he or she ha veri good probabl to becom a succes person . if a person ha innov idea and take risk , but doe n't becom an execut or a chief worker , i presum he is veri unlucki !!! in my opinion , thi person , howev , is better than a man who doesn ' take ani risk in hi life , a man that doe n't live fulli .
