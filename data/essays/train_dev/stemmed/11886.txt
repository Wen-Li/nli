nowaday , anybodi can tavel anywher and i think that choos to travel with a group is a person chose and it also depend on where you 're travel and what you want to do while your travel . if you are plane to travel to europ , i think that go with a group led by a tour guid is a good chose . the main reason that peopl travel to europ is to visit and to learn about all off those town , musem , castl , bridg and monument . the tour guid will probabl satisfi your will consern those kind of subject , that 's hi job . use a tour guid is when your tavel to visit . you can also choos to travel with your famili or wife just to relax , get away from town and have a good time . for that kind of situat , you do n't need a tour guid . you take your vacat in nice resort to relax , to lay down on your back on the beach . what 's the use for a tour guid if you plan to go on a trip under the sun to just have fun and to chill at the pool with a drink in your hand . also tour guid can cost a lot , you 're alreadi pay a lot of money to travel , whi pay more fore a tour guid . i think the chose to travel with a group and a tour guid will alway depend on where you are go and what you want to do in your vacat . what 's the fun of get in a group with a buch of peopl that you do n't know and not have all the right of go where you want and do what you want . travel is to have fun and for me , somebodi that tell you what to do , at what time to get up and that decid for you where to go is not have fun . choos the way you want to travel is person and choos whit who and whit a tour guid is also a person chose . it 's for those reason that i disagre with the statement .
