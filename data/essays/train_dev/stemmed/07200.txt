althougth i woud like that it is not true , i am agre with thi statement , becaus it is that happen nowaday . in fact , the major of young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun , becaus they are not enough interest of their commun , and of the probelm of them . i think that the peopl of the gener befor thi have not the same behaviour , and i do not know whi now that happen . i suppos that the parent ha not learnt to their son the import of help their commun . therefor , mani young peopl are interest onli of their problem , mayb veri littl problem , and of their , probabl , few friend . they do not consid the commun 's problem , and the problem of each member of the commun . therefor they do not keep part in solv that , he do not give their preciou contribut .
