the world chang veri fast . the peopl chang with the world and they have to adapt them in the societi on the best way . young peopl nowaday have differ task to do from the peopl who were young in the past . today the life is veri frenet and a huge number of the action and activ are realli differ respect 20 year ago . a young person have to go to collag or univers , mayb he have to work if he want to pay hi studi or other activ . the free time is not a lot so , when a student is free , he use to go out with hi friend and to think about the enjoy activ like to go to disco or listen to music . someon can think that it is selfish but i am sure that a young person must have a leasur time . howev the time can be spent for the commun . it 's quit true that a lot of young peopl do n't like help their commun . the young newaday peopl are not all lazi . i can explan thi point by a clear exampl . last week i went to a rock parti which wa organ by one of my best friend . he work a lot becous thi event wa wonder , but he did it with other guy . the parti wa a music competit . the peopl were a lot and everyon wa veri happi becaus the player were fantast and the organ too . in conclus i think that today young peopl are differ from the young peopl in the past so a comparison is not so easi . the free time is less and the thing to do are more . the young peopl mistak is to think that to do someth for the commun is bore . fortun there are some peopl who think differ !
