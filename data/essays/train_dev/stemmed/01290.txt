i agre that the mean and way of help in a commun ha chang , but i total disagre that young peopl do not give enough time in help the commun and societi in gener . a group of peopl come togeth on a share idea or opinion is call a commun . befor the advent of the internet person had to be physic present to be in the commun , now is not so . i think that with the expoent increas by which young user are releas the benefit of the internet , there is a lot of time to creat , expand and cherish the commun . inform age ha given us more commun then there were ani previous . if you just brows yahoo . com and orkut . com , you will find a commun alreadi present in which you are interst . be it on music , softwar , movi , entertain , fund rase and so on . young peopl not onli creat these commun but also make sure that they take activ part in it by updat the latest and remov the rest . with the increas number of user help is assur to be given to the need . also , in today world where peopl are live in high-ris build , i am sure everi member from each of the hous in the apart wil come togeth to form a commite , to atleast make sure that they know each other . when they come togeth they also find way in which to solv each other problem . youngster who care for the societi will make sure that commun festiv are held with their utmost digin . for exampl the ganesh chatur festiv in india , there are more young peopl than old one and the festiv is celebr with full vigor and enthusiasm . in a typic colleg environ , there are mani commun form by young peopl who make sure that mani weaker student get the necessari addit help that is need . commun can onli exist if there is a share interst , but now a day there are so mani choic and as young mind chang everi now and then we think that they are not help the commun in which they had taken part .
