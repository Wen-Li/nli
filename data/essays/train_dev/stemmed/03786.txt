idear and fact can be thought two differ part of a song . idear like the melodi of a song and the fact like the lyric of the song . both of them are import , howev , if we chang the lyric of a song , it seem it still a song and just with differ mean , but if we chang the melodi of the song , sometim , it may not be a song or it is alreadi anoth song . compar with these tow differ part , i agre that it is more import for student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , i believ idear and concept of knowledg is the main core as the most import part dure our learn . there are million and million fact of each subject , and it is imposs for us if we want to get ench specif aspact of the fact , even though we spend our whole colleg life to learn them . so the best way of learn knowleg is to get the main idear or concept in the first step , and then pick up some rel fact to help us understatn it and empers it . on the other hand , there is no nesseari to learn all the fact but we must to get the idea and concept , even when we do the extra-act . in the extra-act that we orgainaz in colleg , we usual need to prepar a lot of detail thing in oder to keep it go as we expect . but , there are still more or less new problem emerg dure the activ . if we onli focu on the fact that we learn or we prepar , we will never ever find the right way to solv it immedietli . howev , if we have a well-understand of main idear on thi compain , we will do everyth quikli and in the right derect . that is whi i think get the main idear is more import than learn fact .
