everyon live in a communti that consist of peopl , in which , all the peopl , old and young , are suppos to join the commun activ , and to help their commun in mani of aspect . howev , nowaday , it is argu that young peopl do not contribut to their commun than in old day i agre with thi opinion , sinc i believ the young peopl do not have enough time , do not have enough chanc to commun with other in the commun , and also lack of the good motiv to help their comun . first , the young peopl now experi more presssur in their job and studi than befor , they have to work veri hard to compet their peer , which make them realli lack of time to have other activ instead of work or studi . they spend all the time in the classroom or offic . and even when they go home at night , they will be so tire that can onli go sleep at home instead of go outsid to help their commun . the other reason is that , nowaday the commun in human societi seem have less chanc for the peopl , especi for the young peopl , to commun with each other . for some stupid reaon , such as secur , all the build in the citi are built like prison . all the door are lock so firmli that even the mice could n't get in . the peopl live in these `` prison '' are usal not familiar with their neighbor even their are live in the next door . thi make the young peopl do not consid their commun as their own , and thu might not show up publicli so oft . that 's whi they do n't even have the chnace to help their commun . final , the peopl of all societi , includ the young peopl of cours , becom less and less motiv to help their commun . as the econom develop of our societi , the peopl more and more focu on money as the valu of the life , while disregard the good reput they might earn from the societi . usuali the young peopl will obtain noth except some apreci form their commun if they do contribut to it . thi make them feel valueless to help the commun , and thu spend less and less time to take part in the commun activ . to summer , the young peopl inde contribut less time to help their comun , and i think it 's the problem of our cultrur nowaday , which actual encourag the peopl disregard their commun , and do not allow the peopl have enough time to paticip the activit of their commun . i think it would be better for our futur , if the young peopl can do more for their coummniti .
