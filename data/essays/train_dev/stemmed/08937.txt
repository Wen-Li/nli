the humankind alway need knowledg to reach good life standart . everyon ha differ aspect of thi idea . some assum that it is more iport for student to understand idea and concept , in contrari to thi some assum that it is import for them to learn fact . i total agre with second idea . these are my follow reason . firstli , the reason the knowledg from learn fact is import is perman . when peopl learn fact with experi , they do not forget easili . so they use these fact through all their life . for exampl , i had an car accid last year . befor thi event , my parent advis to not drive fast . i understood the idea , howev it did not help me avoid to make accid . now , after accid i learn my lesson and drive my car slowli . in addit to thi , the reason that the learn fact is more import rather than understand the concept is to show an exampl of it in real life . the understand the concept can be so abstract . for exampl , the concept of commun seem like so perfect , howev in the real life thi concept can not be work well . so student can be confus by thi abstract concept . as i mention abov the learn fact is more import for student than understand idea and concept accord to these reason : it is both perman and real . i think the teach system should modifi with these reason .
