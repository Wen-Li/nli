i total agre with the statement that it is more import to understand idea and concept than learn fact . firstli , onli learn fact is someth which is kind of simpl . everybodi is abl to do thi . it is not a special featur of student . just lear thing by heart is someth which you have done in primari school , and of cours it is good to do that there but not at highschool or at univers . besid it ist not import anymor to know mani fact becaus there are so mani book , and of cours the internet , where you can search for everyth you want to know . secondli , as fast as you can learn fact as fast you will forget them again . so it is much more of interst to learn where you can find them than know them in detail . that 's whi i think it is enough to know the book or the homepag where you can find the inform you are look for than know the inform . thirdli , learn how to understand idea and concept of thing will help the student to come along in there life after their studi time . when they will have a job they will not be ask for fact such as how mani peopl live in ohio , but they have to come along with more complex quesion where they have to use their abil to understand the idea and concept of for instanc a new project oder product and to combin thi knowledg . lastli , it is not onli good for the student ' job-lif but also for their privat life to understand the gener idea of thing . for exampl when read the newspap it is much more of interest to verifi critic statement than learn the exact number of the peopl who die in the iraq war . so all in all you can see that the abil to understand the gist of thing is more relev than just learn fact .
