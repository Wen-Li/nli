person , i strongli believ that an academ educ which span over a number of subject is to be prefer to highli specialis knowledg of one singl topic . the first reason for thi is that , accord to my experi , extrem specialis academ profil can bear to selfish and bare interact person . thi is the case , for instanc , of highli technic degre such as engin or physic , which in a number of case bring , along with a remark level of technic prepar in their respect field of interest , the develop of a veri specialis and unflex mindset which is ideal for solv problem in that particular area of activ , but can prove to be rather ineffici when issu outsid that particular field of special aris . howev - thi be the second point in support of my opinion - situat in life are more often multi-facet than single-facet , and thi is even more true as long as one 's activ and respons grow in import - which is exactli the case where academ educ should play a key role . just think about the issu which manag of corpor and institut are call to face everi day : most of them do not refer back to one singl topic or field of knowledg , but requir a mixtur of skill and qualif span across a wide spectrum of subject . the more one 's educ ha been vari , the more he will feel confid in such a situat . last - but not least - i see a point of person opportun in support my opinion state abov . life is so interest , and the field of knowledg are so vari to be virtual unlimit : therefor , whi should one restrict himself to a veri small portion of such a treasur ? i would therefor conclud with a statement which i recurr hear from the gener manag of my compani when he is discuss about the ideal profil for an execut , and which sound like `` special belong to insect : whi should we stick to it ? '' the field of human knowledg is fortun so larg , and it boundari are so rapidli broaden , that it would be a real piti to voluntariliy limit ourselv to know and appreci onli a small part of it .
