i agre to the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do and support the follow belief of mine with the follow view . firstli , be young mean full of energi and the biggest advantag is physiolog . a young person is fit and healthi both . thi make him to be open to new thing , he experi , innov and take risk which bring achiev and sens of accomplish . the high amount of adreanalin help him to work hard and enjoy harder . secondli , at younger age you have less respos . you dont have children to bother about , you need not to worri about your pension , provid fund and all that , all you bother about is the present . you have a long way to go and suspens about the futur keep you on front foot . thirdli , at younger age you are on the verg to build new relat , you love rain , you love danc in it , you experinc the first touch and get to introduc yourself to a new sensat call love , it make your world colour , you wait for night to pass on and wait for dusk to get a gilmps of someon you love . you marri and enjoy the life with your partner , you becam social , you becam care and bother about anoth person . all thi make life more colour . and when time pass by and you notic physiolog chang within make you weak , you start worri about a lot of thing to do befor you say goodby . you fear the ultim truth ie death approachinhg toward you with a lot of thing which are still pend . you feel either you are run out of time or you have noth to do and just wait for the judgement day . you are worri about your children and their futur . thu , at some time at the later stage you feel that life wa veri joy when you were young therefor i think that young peopl enjoy life more that old peopl do .
