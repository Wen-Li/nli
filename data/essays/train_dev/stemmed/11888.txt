i agre with the statement , i believ that young peopl do enjoy life more than older peopl do . i think that innoc , ignor and worri free young individu do enjoy life more that experienc , learn and concern adult do . onc we are born we have no worri , in fact new born babi do not know anyth about their environ , they are totali innoc expos individu at the merci of well , adult , who care for them . if there were no concern adult who had to care for the feed , care and well be of those children , human as we know it would not exist . it is a natur thing , babi eat and cri whenev they 're hungi and adult provid nurish and care for them . ignor is bliss some poepl say , and you know what , i actual think they are right . onc you are ignor , mean do n't know of someth you do n't worri about it , for exampl . if i have never heard about cancer or diabet i will probabl not wori about it , as in the old age where they believ it wa some ill caus by spirit or demond , but onc i know about i can cut of the sugar in the case of a diabet or have chemo or radiat for cancer and worri about it . adult know about respons , about money , about safeti and all the possibl outcom of a certain situat . kid do n't , it is actual a kid job to have fun , and it is an adult job to marvel at that miracl of joy that burst from everi child new discoveri . some poepl might say that older peopl enjoy life more becaus they know that there will be few moment that you can actual enjoy , but , how is it possibl to enjoy more than a young child who ha no idea of hardship or sorrow ? life is a wonder thing as the song `` i 've got the world on a string '' say , but it also say `` as long as i hold on to the string '' . as adult , we can never predict when that string will leav our finger . while young peopl , babi , kid in gener dont even know that it is they , who actual hold the whole world , and our destini in their tini littl hand .
