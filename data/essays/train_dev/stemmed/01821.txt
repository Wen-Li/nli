although it 's essenti to have a car these day , it seem to be hader and harder to afford and caus mani enconveni to those who own a car . it 's not onli becaus the money but also for enconvin that peopl encount so i think that in twenti there will be less car in use then today . firstli , oli price ha gone up so high in past few year and it becam big problem not onli for the driver but also to the economi . i rememb when i first start drive in 5 year ago . it wa n't cheap but it wa still ok for the convin that i got from drive car but when i go to the ga station to fill the tank now , it cost almost doubl than what it use to be . becaus of it i tri to use public transport when i go to school instead of drive . secondli , nowaday one famili own more than one car so there are so mani car and there are n't enough space for park . especi korea , which is veri small with high papular , it is a huse problem now . when peopl get back from work at night they have to have anoth `` war '' to find a spot to park . it is veri annoy becaus you are alreadi near home but ar n't abl to go home becaus you ca n't find a park apot . to conclud , have car is not as good as what it use to be , peopl will decid not to have a car or have less car in the futur . i think that to solv that the problem abov peopl will buy more bycicl or motor-bik in the futur . it cost less money and more convin than have a car . when peopl start buy them instead of buyinh car , the number of car will gradual decreas .
