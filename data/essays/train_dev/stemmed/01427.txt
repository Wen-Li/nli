what a person statement for an advertis man as me ! i absolut agre with the initi statement , especi for two practic reason . the first one is that advertis is a market arm , and we know that princip market mission is to place the product in the market , give the consum the most wick detail to buy them , which mean a right price and mani other benefit . the second one si techinc . today , photo , tv commerci , web site and promot activ are deliv by veri high digit techiniqu , and almost perfect resolut . actual , we use the most effect comput program , our sofist machin and media opportun . we are also professsion , so we use word and bodi copi in order to attract the client . final , it is obviou that ani product is present in a better way . we can work on a simpl still life photo for long time , reach the best imag with perfect light and colour . and again , we post-produc each film we realiz , set the most emot point of view , the right song : you will experi few fantast second think to . .. an insur compani ! i mean , we repres the `` dream machin '' , an industri that help firm to convey their own product in the better way . we are make thi sinc one hundr twenti year , and day by day we improv ourselv . but in my opinion , the real import task is to be alway honest , commun with a cute , catch method with ethic sens . we are just give a special make up to chocol , car or beverag . when we will do thi , we will aim all our mission : make the compani client happi becaus of sell and say the consum the truth , with fantast word , far beauti landscap , fast imag on the screen , incred solut through the net !
