alon , the best way to travel it i disagre with the statament that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i consid that it is better to travel alon . i believ that when peopl travel in group , they have to be account to the group . thi can be veri stress and could affect the way they enjoy their vacat or trip . for instans , if anyth happen to ani person of the group , the other peopl have to wait or spend time assist thi person . in the contrari , i believ that when we travel alon we are abl to develop our own schedul and to enjoy more freeli without ani interfer from ani other person . thi will have a possit impact in our vacat or trip that it wa ultim taken in order to relax and enjoy as much as possibl . also , we will spend the time in the best manner without wast time . moreov , when we travel in a group with a tour guid , we are not abl to decid our trip 's plan , but we have to relay on the guid for ani step to take dure the trip . in the opposit , if we travel alon we know that we can make ani decis regard our trip 's plan or to decid the lenght of our stay or visit depend on our own circunst , which defenitev is more suitabl and appropri for me . the goal is to enjoy the trip . also , travel alon seem to be less expens that travel with a tour guid . the fact that we have to hire a guid will increas the cost of the trip . furthermor , i believ that if travel alon , we will have more time to see the thing that realli interest us . for instanc , in my own expenriec , when i visit a museum i like to spend enough time look at the pictur rather than the other thing . if i have to follow a tour guid dure a trip , it could happen that he or she will show the group the thing that he or she consid import for her/hi own , but it could be less import for me . thi could be dissapoint in the case that you can not move forward to realli enjoy or see what you realli want to do . moreov , if you want to take ani break dure the trip , you will allow to do so if you are alon without ask anybodi for permiss . we know if we travel with a tour guid in a group , you have to fulli cooper with everybodi , and if you take a break will affect the group and their schedul . in conclus the best way to travel is alon , without a group or guid to follow as per all the abov mention reason . of that
