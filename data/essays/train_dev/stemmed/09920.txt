the issu at hand is that learn through understand idea and learn through fact , which one is more import for student ? thi issu is veri import , becasu learn knowledg and studi trough differ method are veri import for the student futur career . i believ learn fact is more import , for some reason . learn fact is prefer becaus fact offer a lot of experi that are veri rare , and also easili understand . those experi are from outsid of the classroom , they come from the real world , use these experi fact , student can learn knowledg faster , they will save time to studi other knowledg . thi is veri import for the student ' futur career , the reason is that most of the employ are glad to hire employe who can work immediet , sinc thi kind of employe can bring the profit to compani as soon as they are hire . for exampl , oper a machin should n't be veri hard for the student , becaus they have alreadi understood those idea and concept , but when these student begin to work in the real factori for the first time , they are still confus about those oper , becaus they do n't have the experi of oper those machin . base on thi reason , learn factor is superior to understand idea and concept , becaus learn concept can onli offer student gener knowledg , concept can not give student more skill about the real work . addit , i believ learn fact is a right option becaus fact are usual more interest and activ , so , they can be rememb easili by the student . tri to think about thi : concept that onli present on the paper with black charact and video show the real product process in a factori , which one is more attract ? which one would you like to choos ? i believ the answer is veri obviou . so , i like learn fact over just understand idea and concept due to the fanni that i can find in the learn the fact . to sum up , i believ learn fact is the correct choic , i would choos thi becaus i believ student can rememb more knowledg when they learn fact , and also , fact includ a lot of real experi which is rare and veri import for the student to start the futur work .
