in advertis endustri ther are sevral thing that you do to show the product differ than what the way they realli are or look . but it is someth that you have to do . to be honest advertis ha noth to do with honesti it is basicli about sell the product to the custum and to do that you have to be creativ and mayb a bit unreal . it dosent matter that much wheather you believ everyh you see or dont it is all about the campain and how you brought it up . the way it seem in real world we can say that advertis is the one of the bigest multimedia pover which can basicli control our need . but on the other hand the need we need can be clasifi by advertis so we cant say that they are bad or wrong . the main reasen whi they make product seem much better is to take custem attent . no one seem interest whit regular stuff that the basic of human habbit . so they make it shine and glow so that we would want to have it . as a resbonc to that potenti custem suchc as our neighbor or firiend saw it and atract to it then have it and afterword we peopl have someth to talk about such as `` have you seen what salli got ? ye i did i saw it on tv `` than the chat goe on . the advertis can make peopl talk . in my point of view sure they make product seem much better and sure it is the onli reasen we buy them that is how it goe or how it suppos to go caus we all know that peopl wont concid buy anyth unless they see it in somewher els . if advertis can reach to them by shine and glove the product i am afraid that as a sosieti thi is who we are and how we deal whit the thing by runnig to a shini object . we should defenitli give them a credit for what they are realli do . to me have to show thing better if they want to sell their product . thi is buis .
