i do not agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . first of all the advertisor and the compani have the main goal to gain new and a high amount of costum by advertis for their product . so the main reason whi product are advertis is to show the potenti costum or consum that thi specif product might give them a nicer time or a better or even an easier life . off cours the advertis product need to be present from it best side so that the consum feel attract to buy the product and to test it first . if the costum is satisfi with the product the product wa worth it bee advertis . but if the custom is not satisfi with the product he or she ha still the right to return the product and get the money back . in gener nowaday the costum have a lot of right to defend them selv from cheater and compani sell product with bad qualiti . to increas the compet in the capitalist market all compani tri to produc product with better qualiti and more attract to the consum . the second import reason whi it should n't be in the will of the advertisor to present the product better than it is in realiti is that their compani and it exist depend on the a posit `` oral propaganda '' among the peopl . for exampl if one costum is not satisfi with a product he or she will tell her friend , neighbour , rel or famili not to buy it and so the compani will loos costum and off cours money . the third point is that becaus all these given reason a compani would n't sell and repres a product if it is not hundr procent sure of the qualiti of the product .
