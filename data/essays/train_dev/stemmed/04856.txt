i can not say if there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today , becaus there are a lot of thing to take into account to have an opinion . on the one hand , there are more and more regul about car in big citi to avoid pollut and make inhabit of town feel better . peopl want to be abl to walk on the street without feel oppress by the car there are around them , the nois they creat and they want also to smell other thing than petrol . in addit , nobodi know whether there will be enough petrol in twenti year so that everybodi can use one 's car as much as one use it today . if petrol becom less and less avail and , therefor , more and more expens , peopl will have to find new solut to move from one place to anoth . i think it is total possibl becaus there are a lot of mean of transport which wast much less petrol than car . for exempl , peopl could take the train or the bu , or even their bike . the main problem is that they are use to drive their car at each time they need to go out from their home , so they do not think to take their bike instead , or to walk . when drive will have becom too expens for the major of peopl , one will learn to live without one 's car , and peopl will probabl enjoy it . on the other hand , the car industri is still grow and brand are develop new model which are more comfort , better design and possess all the new technolog . they want peopl to keep buy their new car so i think that they are go to do their best to attract custom , especi if the trend confirm that peopl give up use their car .
