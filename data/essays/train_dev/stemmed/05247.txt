i dont realli agre with thi statement that `` most advertis make product much better than they realli are '' . becaus it away happen in the other way , that they will not be much better than they realli are or they realli seem to be . here come the differ , they will advertis the product by show it good qualiti and the way it work or so on , but they wil not show it defect , they will not count on those . perhap they seem much better when they advertis them and they will convinc us to buy it , it after that all happen that we will come to know about the actual perform of it , which is realli wors . but sometim it happen that the product seem much better than they realli are , but note it , sometim onli , it just veri rare . i will give you live exampl which ha been experienc by me in the past . onc i bought a video-cd player , convinc by the product advertis in which it wa shown all it good qualiti and said it perform better than the remain one in the market . so i bought it think that it will be a better option to buy the product of that compani . but i wa complet wrong in my choic , becaus it wa alway subject to repair and it wa not work properli . i went wrong in select , by see the advertis . anoth exampl is an experi of my friend with a cosmet product which promis to glow your skin , bought it by see the advertis and think it will make her skin glow , instead it left itch of the skin and allergi of skin . so , i strongli stick to my opinion that they are not as much better as they seem to be . i conclud by say that i disagre with the statement .
