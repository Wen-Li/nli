i disagre with thi statement as we can see the incereas in traffic day to day . if we see the graph drawn between number of vechil on the road year wise , we can see the increas rapidli . thi show how the peopl are use the vechil . nowaday we can see everi famili own a car and it ha becom a must-hav thing . most of the peopl use their car to go to the offic or work place , and you can use your own car to travel to differ place instead of hire a cab . the cost of car have come down in recent year make it easi for common peopl to buy them and most bank and financi institut provid differ scheme to purchas a car . through these scheme most of the middl class famili buy a car for their person use . if you own a car , you need not worri in a emerg situat like call the ambul for sudden health problem of famili member . the other reason is if a famili is plane to go on a vacat to a differ state , they can use their own vechil instead of hire a cab . they can move around the citi and go to ani place they wish to . if they have their own vechil they wo n't be ani problem for a late night parti . they wo n't have ani problem look for a cab in the late night to get back home . and as resal market have come up , peopl sell their old car for a new one . i strongli beliv that in the next 20 year , there would be doubl the amount of car you find right now on the road . everi common person use the car for all hi activit like goign to the park in the morn , goign to hi offic or work place , and goign to a late night parti , and go out for shop of household thing etc . so i disagre with the statemen that they would be fewer car in the next twenti year .
