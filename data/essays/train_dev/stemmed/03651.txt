in twenti year i believ that the number of car in use will have fallen . thi is mainli due to increas expens link to own a car coupl with the fact that public transport is becom easier , cheaper and more effici to use . not forget , of cours , grow awar in the damag caus to the environ . own a car is becom more and more expens . at thi rate in twenti year time a lot of peopl will probabl no longer be abl to afford such a luxuri . petrol price are spirel evermor out of control . the stock market price is at an all time high and noth seem to be indic that thi trend will chang and that price will fall back down . add to thi factor , the price of insur , of car repair , of the car itself as well as park . number have actual shown that in franc the number of new car be sold ha drop dramat these past few year . the number of car alreadi in circul be so high peopl can easili find what they 're look for at a conveni price on the second-hand market . i think that public tranport also ha it role to play . as fuel price rise , traffic jam and pollut increas , peopl seem to be turn more and more to public tranport . public transport ha evolv tremend the past few year . bu lane have been privileg in order to avoid traffic jam , train are go faster and faster at extrem competit price and a grow number of citi are loan out bicycl free of charg . all thi plu the huge public campaign in order to promot public transport and reduc the number of car . the fact remain that , especi in big citi , peopl prefer use public transport to the hassl link to use a car . take pari for exampl , it is cheaper , faster and far less stress to use the metro then to spend hour stuck in traffic jam with parisien yell at you from all side and then have to look for a park space ( which you 'll also have to pay for ) . not to mention the impact on the environ . the grow awar and support for environment issu is also slowli begin to reduc the use of car . in my opinion , as the year pass thi factor will play an evermor import role in the number of car on the road .
