the statement say to predict the futur after twenti year about the posit of the car . as per my veiw and my perceptoin are concern and i would like contradict thestat and i guess that there would be a increas in the number of car than at present . i would like to give the follow veiw in order to support the issu and they are as follow firstli the peop are grew richer and richer than are today and all the rich peopl feel it is a prestig to own a car and and it not a matter for them to own and maintain a car . in the metropolitan citi it ha becam a common sourc of travel . journey by car are more comfort than the public mean of transport for local need . secondli i would like to emphas on the incresas in the technolog advanc , there are mani a car come and some of them are a cheap which encourag even a normal person to own a car . thirdli the same increas in the tchnologoc invent lead to search for altern fuel sourc which are ecofriendli and cheaper than present day fuel such as the ga and electr car which oper on batteri sourc are also gain import as they donot pollut the environi . we must consid a reason for decreas in the number of car which may be by impos a ban on the car , but the govern will not impos becaus the automobil industri would collaps mani factori tend to close lead to unemploy and financi crisi may also occur lead to a disturbensc in the economi . some peopl may also loos their there live hood like the cabdriv and so the govern will not impos the ban . statisticali , it wa also said that an increas in the number of car from the past year wa tremendr and the growth will continu till after twenti year indic the rapid increas in the number of car . in a nut shell i want to conclud that with all the abov state factor there might not be a decreas in the number of car in the come twenti year .
