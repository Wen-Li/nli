in my opinion , most advertis should not make product seem much better that they realli are . thi is becaus , it will be more confus , and the consum will be disappoint . if the advertis are much better that real product , it is same as the compani told a lie . i you bought the product affect by the advertis , you feel the product are differ from the product which were shown by the advertis . therefor , the product actual differ , and the advertis , in fact the compani , must be fake . if the avob situat wa happen , what are you go to feel ? i think probabl you get upset . thi is becaus the product which you bought are wors than the product which were shown by the advertis . so you must feel the compani are lier . i have an exampl of such situat . one day , i bought the elextron souc , and the advertis of the product show `` the electron souc are keep for 1 year '' . i look the sentenc befor i bought , and also i decid buy it from the sentenc . at first , the electron souc work comfort . howev , about 1 month later , the elecron souc did not work , it meant the product becam empti . in fact , the product wa not keep for 1 year , it wa onli keep for 1 month . then , of cours i got upset , becaus the advertis wa a lie . in conclus , when the compani make the advertis , they should not show the product much better than real product , becaus it is absolut a lie .
