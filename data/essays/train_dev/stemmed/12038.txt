event though it is realli import to understand idea and concept becaus they repres the basi of knowledg , i disagre with the statement becaus i think that learn the fact is as much import , as well . i have sever reason for my statement . first , i think that the fact enabl student to understand a concept , becaus it is more concret , it is a kind of illustr in a lesson . for instanc for concept in scienc , such as chemistri , it is not possibl to understand a concept without experi a fact that illustr the concept . the concept of statu modif for solid , liquid or gaz can onli be assimil when we have learnt that water evapor at 100 degre and is frozen at 0 degre . secondli , student rememb easier the fact than the concept , becaus it is more interest and less academ for him . for exampl , dure field trip , student have good memori of their trip becaus they consid it as an entertain even if the purpos of the trip wa to teach an academ lesson . afterward , student would remain the concept becaus they would remain the trip and what they have seen dure it . final , it is more practic and effici to learn fact than learn idea . idea and concept are abstract notion that are difficult to learn and to repres in the mind . becaus they are veri exhaust in book , it is difficult to learn and to understand it without fact . if we take the exampl of children that learn idea and concept all the time at school , we notic that they know their lesson appropri but final they do not realli understand what they have been learnt in class . so in my opinion , the best way to studi is to learn fact as much as understand the idea becaus they depend on each other .
