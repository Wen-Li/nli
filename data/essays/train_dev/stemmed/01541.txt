i do not agre with the statement , mainli for three reason . the fist one is that old peopl have live much more than younger peopl have and thu they have more experi in life , the second one is that the are more matur and for thi reason they do not have extrem attitud chang as youngster do and the last one is that old peopl have more money to spend sinc they are work . with the experi that old peopl have in their live , i mean that they have experienc mani feel and have been in mani situat that young peopl have not , and then , they can take the maximum of each day , the enjoy ani moment becaus they know that certain situat will never be repeat , they use to see the futur and prepar for it while young peopl just want to live day by day , not wor about the futur . my second reason is that older peopl are more mattur and thu they do not have that radic chang in attitud that young peopl have . enjoy of thi stabil provid old peopl with a great advantag that can be use to dedic the exact ammount of time to each activ , not wast time like youngster do . also , thi characterist is import in order to keep risk away by make the correct decis and to avoid do stupid thing . final and not less import is the factor of the money . i would like to mention the import of have financi stabil in order to enjoy the life do what we like . an old person ha the opportun to wok hard and save money to take some vacat or tavel around the world while a young person rare ha thi opportun becaus they are studiyng and it is hard for them to work and studi at the same time . becaus of thi reason , older peopl can realli enjoy life by do great activ that will enrich their person . as a conclus , i would like to say that old peopl enjoy more the life than younger peopl do . the reason i have present are just three but there are mani other that can confirm that a matur person can enjoy a lot the life while the young peopl can be just live an illusori hapi .
