i partial agre with thi statement . i think that have a broad and wide knowledg is a realli good thing : if you are open mind and can discuss about mani topic , you can get mani opportun , and you can also have more immun to market variat . for instanc , in case of macro-econom problem in a certain product area , you can be abl to chang your work more freeli , and more rapidli respect to the one which are veri deepli special . otherwis , worker ( and here i refer also to manag , and peopl who have great respons ) also need to be special in a certain field . accord to my opinion and to my knowledg , today the market need peopl who are special , but also need peopl who can share their knowledg with their colleagu , in order to obtain revenu by sinergi and cooper practic ; for thi reason i think that while you are a student you need to widen as much as possibl the spectrum of you knowlegd , investig as mani field as possibl ; accord to me , it is reason to improv a specif tecnic abil just after finish your studi ( or dure the last year of your academ career ) ; behav in such a way , you could have both the basic wide knowledg to effort chang , and also the special , which could make you the best worker in a certain field at a certain time and in a certain region . for exampl , worker with a low istruct level , may have mani problem in case of chang in the strategi of their compani , or ( and thi is a more dramat problem for worker involv in the process ) in case of market revolut , which make a certain product obsolet , or gener the so call `` killer applic '' . so , in order to be an attract worker for the labour market , you need to special your knowledg , but in order to minim risk , and to avoid market chang , you have to widen your knowledg ; you also need to improv your capabl and knowledg after you have finish your studi : thi is the so call `` life long learn '' , which i believ is the best model in modern societi .
