i dont agre with the statement that `` there will be fewer number of car in use than there are today '' . the abov may not be complet ture becaus of the point that are given below . to stop the usag of car either the petroleum should get scarc and the price should go so high that onli veri rich can efford to buy to use car . and come to technolog point of view as the technolog is develop the part of car are becom cheaper as a result mani peopl can afford to buy a car for their own use . so , thi indic fairli increas of the number of car than the number that persent now . also as the newer model are get in to the market to attract peopl . the peopl who ha car alreadi send their car for lower price as a second hand car and go for the new one . there might be a possibl that if govern want to control the pollut producd by the car . it can increas the tax so as to decreas the number of car . but still the peopl may use the car becaus the govern cant lay too much of tax . so , as far as we can see that number decreas not like to occur . but the growth can be predict becaus of the abov point . the number of car reduct cant be possibl becaus as the popul grow mani peopl are settl well would like to have a car . also now a day mani colleag student are use car a lot so decreas number is not realli possibl as the statement state . also now a day mani peopl who use two wheeler want to buy a car next . so we can see that the popul are orient toward buy car to have luxuri life .
