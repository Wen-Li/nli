some educ expert claim that the role of school and colleg is to teach pupil fact . other believ that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept . i believ that make student understand idea and concept is the most import role of educ . yet it can not be done without the student learn the fact . understand idea and concept is vital in the world we live in today . technolog and scienc are evolut so fast nowaday that the knowleg of concept is extrem import . without understand the idea and concept behind these technolog advac , a student will not be abl to resilv problem face him in that area . in fact understand idea and concept offer student the possibl to face ani problem in each and everi realm of their life . it give them a certain logic and methodolog that widen critic think . on the other hand , concept and idea are imposs to understand without the learn of fact . the good knowleg of fact made the great inventor and thinker of histori ( leonardo davinci , galileo , albert einstein , loui pasteur . .. ) discov and develop new concept and idea . fact are to concept what wheel are to car . a car can not drive without wheel ; a concept can not be accur or even invent without the knowleg of the scientif fact . thi is whi student should be taught the fact . yet their educ should not be limit to fact . an educ limit to the teach of fact will produc student with rigid and limit think . the fact ought to be the academ packag that will allow student to understand the concept and mayb come up with idea of their own .
