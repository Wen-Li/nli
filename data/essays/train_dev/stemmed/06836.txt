broad knowledg of mani vs special in one . in my opinion , it is import to have knowledg of variou subject that are inter-rel with special in a specif subject . thi is in contrast to have broad knowledg of mani subject or have special onli in one specif subject . thi ha to be seen in the perspect of the interrel of variou field to each other and the impact they have on the develop and progress in anoth field . mani theori in physic could onli evolv becaus mathematician could find solut to the complex problem that such theori or hypothesi pose . if howev , mathematician and physicist work in isol , they would not have been abl to find solut to the problem that they encount . infact , mani of the greatest physicist were great mathematician aswel , right from archemedi to newton and more recent einstien . these person are physicist , but if they did not have exposur to mathemat they would never have been abl to prove mani of their theori . even in modern time , advanc in comput technolog have help in innov in all sphere . howev , the requir of other scienc ha also push the comput scientist to make better and faster machin . for e.g. , weather forecast requir comput to carryout complex mathemat calcul . thi ha push comput scientist to make faster machin and ha help mathematician and meteoroligist to collabor to develop forecast model to predict weather pattern and simul the same . these would howev , not be possibl if the peopl engag in such research were total ignor of the advanc in other field . they may not have special in everi field but would need to have broad knowledg of the other field to be abl to interact meaning with each other to achiev their goal . at the same time it is abudantli clear from the exampl abov that the mani advanc in scienc and techonolog have come about as the person engag in these had special in their own field and ha enough knowledg of other to call up the expertis of other or their own faculti to help them in their chosen field . thu it is import to have knowledg of the subject which can have an influenc on one 's core area of work and have special in the core area .
