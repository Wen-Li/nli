i would disagre with the statement , `` in twenti year there will be a fewer car in use than there are today '' , for mani reason . firstli , i believ that the automobil industri is burgeon and the number of car manufactur by them is increas in an exponenti manner and therfor the use of the car is increas as well . the popul of the world ha increas and henc the demand for own a car as increas as well . in the present world peopl who even earn a mimim annual incom are also buy car becaus of the offer such as pay in instal , avail to them from the variou car vendor . henc the use of the car have gone up and will continu to rise as there will be better offer avail to middle-class peopl . anoth reason accord to me would be that , the varieti of the car avail in the market keep get upgrad frequent . everi new car ha a newer technolog or some addit featur that make it better than it predecessor . thi attract peopl to buy a new one in addit to the one they might alreadi own . thi lead to more car on road and therfor ad to the use of them and we can imagin much better car in twenti year from now as well . anoth exampl i would like to sate is that in a countri like india there is no law against car older that 15 year . thi add to the fact that sinc the car are not be recycl or carsh , the number of car on road are just ad up and so is the use of them . therfor the number of car would reach a veri high level in twenti year . conclud , i would like to say that , accord to me the use of the car will not decreas in twenti year from now but rather increas in an unusu manner .
