i disagre with the statement . for me , be success ha veri littl to do with the amount of materi thing one ha accumul . to be success , one ha to be happi . the two thing go togeth . one might say it is possibl to achiev both thing , but i thing for that one would have to dedic most of hi or her time for that purpos . to tri new thing and take risk rather than do what one alreadi know how to do well , time will pass one by . therewil be no time to enjoy the success . success is do what one love , do it well , make agood live out of it while enjoy the rest of the time with the person you love . what will be load with materi thing if you do n't have time to supervis your children school progress / definit , i would rather be veri good in what i do , do it well , make a good live from it and enjoy life afterward with famili , friend , love one instead of tri new thing over and over again ,
