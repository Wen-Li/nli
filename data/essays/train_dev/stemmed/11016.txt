recent , it is more common to have a tour guid while travel than go a trip without a tour guid . while some peopl like to have a tour guid to see mani attract site , in my opinion it is not the best way to travel in group led by a tour guid becaus of it ha lot of restrict . first of all , peopl travel with a group led by a tour guid have a time constraint while travel . suppos you want to spend more time in a museum than in anywher els , but you are given onli 20 minut to stay in the museum . how possibl is it for you to stay when the bu leav after that ? if you have the flexibl of your time , you would not have to encount thi kind of problem . second of all , travel with a tour guid with a lot of peopl will more like give less person experi . i would like to give my experi as an exampl . last summer i went to a trip to the rocki mountain in british columbia canada with around 30 other peopl and a tour guid . we went to so mani place in such a short time so that i could not rememb where i went . when i wa check the photograph that i have taken , i could not say ani differ about the lake and mountain that i have went . even though i have seen onli lake and mountain for the whole three day , i could not rememb one of them in special , becaus we had spent onli short amount of time on each place so that i did not have ani special memori or a feel in one site . to conclud , i would rather travel with my few close peopl without a tour guid than have lot of restrict while travel . a famou poet said , ' travel to discov yourself . ' i would rather have more time for myself in one site while travel than visit mani space without ani specail memori .
