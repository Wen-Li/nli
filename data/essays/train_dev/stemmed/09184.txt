no one would be abl to stay in a specif countri fopr the rest of hi life . let assum that there some1 donst want to travel and leav hi countri , well i think he lifeless and he doesnt wanna enjoy the tast of travel and life . it not neccessari to travel in a group led by a tour guid , travel alon or with a coupl of friend is much adventor as long as u dont cross the limit of adventur . a trip would make a person learn more about other contri , differ cultur and experi hard time a normal person would gop through . travel alon would provid a person with a chanc to stand up n take respons of himself . travbel alon would provid a person with a preciou oppurtun to plan , manag , and learn more about the obsticl he go to face dure life time . life is not all about joy and pleasur it is mainli to experi the rough time a person would go through .
