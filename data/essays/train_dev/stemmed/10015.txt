it is alway a controverti issu over whether it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . in my opinion , i prefer to be a specialist in one academ field dure my univers life . one main factor is the limit time . in my countri , our colleg educt last 4 year . dure that time , you should not onli do your studi but take part in some extra-curriculum activ as well in order to get a good job in the futur . therefor , it is imposs for a student with an averag intellect to learn all the knowledg of everi subject in such a short time . anoth factor is that the energi of everi peopl is limit . you could n't expect the peopl to sleep less than 4 hour in order to be a generalist . also , it is a truth the some peopl onli are suitabl to some certain subject . if you forc them to learn what they are not good at , it 's just a way of wast their energi . last but not least , the purpos of school to educ the peopl is to serv the societi . that is to say our educ should meet the demand of the current societi . what is the rightnow situat ? thank to the develop economi and stabl world enviro , the quantiti of the labour forc is not the problem . what we want now is the improv of the qualiti of the labour forc . that mean our societi need the peopl with a strong background of one certain area instead of those who know onli a littl about everyth . admittedli , broad educ is veri import in today 's educ so as to help develop a student properli . but that doe n't to say we should put all our limit time and energi into learn everyth . with the structur of the labor forc becom more and more reason , i believ those who is a master of a certain area will have a promis futur .
