i agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . to tell the truth , to say `` the best way '' is veri difficult for me . becaus to travel in group , and to travel in alon or a few companion , both have advantag and disadvantag . actual , when i wa student , i look down on group travel with a guid . i visit mani countri with my best friend by ourselv , we had realli great experi . to make a itinerari , to write a reserv form in english or the other oreign languag , to enjoy talk with local peopl in some foreign languag with dictionari , to tri ethnic food . .. and so on . but , some museum did n't have an explanet in english !! consequentri , we did n't understand the exposit at all . we had mani cultur and histric question about thi countri , but we could n't get an answer . the guidebook wa n't enough for that . on the contrari , group tour with a guid is veri differ . when i particip in group tour , i wa realli impress in the knowledg of a tour guid . she ha a long - experi of a tour giug , and her talk of the countri wa wonder . sometim i cri when i heard the histor stori of the countri . still now , about the countri i visit with group , i have much inform . but in group tour , we ca n't comun with the local peopl , ca n't choos the hotel . it is a disadvantag of group trip . anyway , the group tour is n't bad than we thought . especi for peopl who want to know about the countri .
