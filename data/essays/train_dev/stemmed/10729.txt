from my own experi , i will have to agre with the idea that older peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl do for differ reason such as money , time independ , previou life experi and even wisdom . peopl usual say that money can not buy happi , but i say that money can certanli help a lot . older peopl usual have pay job that allow them to safe money through life , money that a young person can not easili obtain . one can use money to buy ticket to music concert , to go to expens restaur or even to travel all around the world . these activ enhanc the experi of life . time is anoth good reasong whi old peopl enjoy life more than young peopl , becaus when young , someon ha activ that can not be avoid . for exampl , a kid can not choos to go or not to go to school , the parent do . time is an asset that onli old peopl have lot of . older peopl can engag in activ such as art , travel , cook and stude becaus they do not depend of a school or work schedul to live their live by . old peopl also have more experi , a qualiti that i person believ that increas the possibl to enjoy life . for exampl , if a young man travel to pari , he will see thing in a way that may differ from the perspect of an old man . the young man will probabl see onli an old citi full of old bouild and museum , but under the experi eye of an old man , pari is full of art , cultur and histori . the old man will enjoy more the trip beacus hi year of experi . final , wisdow may not apper to be a good reason to support that older peopl enjoy life more than other , but i think that wisdow can help a person to take the right decis in life , thi will contribut to a more rich life experi .
