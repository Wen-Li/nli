i do agre with the statement . i think that peopl who take risk and tri new thing are more successful than peopl who do onli what they alreadi know how to do well . the first reason whi i think that way is veri simpl . when i look to a babi i am automat sure of my answer . if a babi do not tri new thing such as walk instead of go on hi arm and leg and if he never take ani risk such as eat some warm meal he will never walk and will never be care about the heat of what he eat . he will never becom a man . then i think to innov . i think in particular to the man who invent the electr . i am sure that when he tri hi machin which produc the first watt he took great risk becaus of the possibl of be electrocut or kill by the oil compani of that time . i also think to pierr and mari curi . when they discov the new element , radium , polonium and the other , they were confront to an high rate of radioact . it is also imposs to say that they were not success peopl . final i think about art . art could not have develop if some crazi - as they were call in their era - artist did not think about paint in new way or paint differ thing than those paint until them . for exampl picasso invent the cubism , and when he did it he wa just tri new thing and final he ha beco ; e famou all over the world and hi paint are nearli the most expens piec of art on the world art market . that is for thi three reason that i believ that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
