base on my own experi and on other peopl comment about thi theme i agre with the statement . especi today new invent are made so quickli and life is often chang so fast . these fact bring new question and problem to be solv and although a certain knowledg is of cours necessari in everi field , it is most import to be abl to adapt to new situat und to be flexibl in most job . everyon can look up inform , especi sinc the internet is avail almost everywher . but knowledg and skill like `` soft skill '' are kind of individu and import in everi part . i myself experienc thi throughout my internship at a tourist-compani last summer . nobodi ask me about number or specif knowledg about hotel or sight , the question were if i could outwork an interview or if i have experi in moder and work with group . in addit , i read about thi topic a few time know . there wa for exampl an interview with a popular german journalist . she explain that she studi histori and polit but what she realli learn at the time of her studi is how to search for inform and present them to the reader or viewer . to write a paper you have to find reliabl literature-sourc , which is n't alway easi , but a skill you may need later as a journalist or if you want to manag a project of someth specif . all in all , i think it is better to teach idea and concept to today student than make them learn fact becaus that way they get the `` tool '' to succeed in manag new situat and challeng .
