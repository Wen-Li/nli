to answer thi question in an adequ way we need to analys whi societi use car . base on thi consider we can tri to figur out if there would be less car than today . the histori about the car began last centuri . car increas and are still increas our mobil . i beliv that there are to differ mobil : the person and the econom mobil . the person mobil is someth peopl want to have . it allow us to move from one point to an other point at the time we would like to . we do n't need to have a look on schedul . we are independ from other . to give up thi person freedom is hardli conceiv . on the other hand , car are so import for the world wide economi . they provid the mobil of person and of good . it is a cheap oportun to move . consequ the whole economi would not reduc the usag of car if it 's not forc by other circumst . use car increas the air pollut , reduc the world wide storag of fuel and accordingli rise the fuel price . thi might be an effect to get the societi consid their behaviour . recent the price for fuel went up dramat . i do n't think that at the moment the societi is use the car less then befor . in switzerland , where i come from , there at the moment sever dissus about how to declin the air pollut and to improv the enviro . thi discuss is meaningless if just some peopl on the earth are look for solut and are realli will to do it . especi for rais countri it is quiet hard to think about such a problem . the need someth to eat and have other problem at the moment . all in all , it need a world wide solut . i do n't think that the societi would be abl to find one without forc from other
