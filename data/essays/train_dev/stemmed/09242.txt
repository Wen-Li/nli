in my limit experi , it is quit true that more and more youngser neglect their own commun and pay scarc time and attent on hepl their commun . person speak , i think that there are three possibl caus of thi result . first , more youngster are taught to studi harder and focu on their schoolwork , and thi may make them more self-cent becaus teacher and even their parent requir them to pursu their own accomplish or higher grade in everi contest . thu the younster surroud onli by thi inform gradual accept thi thought and are less will to attend the publich issu , like help their commun . second , it might be possibl that the youngster spend their time with their own friend play the basketbal or basebal , studi and prepar for the exam , or someth ele . whatev they do , they alway take activ togeth , and stay in their own group ; therefor , if the origin goal of their group is not to help their commun , they will never touch such issu . we all know the power of the group to constrain the member to obey and do those thing recogn by other member , so thi would be one of the reason that caus them unwil to help their commun . last but not the least , such event may be caus by the lack of their passion to help other . our educ system alway use the acheiv in the school perform or the grade in the exam to assess the potenti of the student as a refer of select in univers entranc exam , and therefor both the student and their parent place thi event a top prioriti , so no wonder there are less and less youngster who devot themselv to the public issu and are happi to help other , includ their commun . in summari , i think it is the ignor of public issu that caus them pay much attent on help their commun .
