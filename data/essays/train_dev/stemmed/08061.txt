person speak , i do n't think the best way to travel is in a group led bt a guid . firstli , travel is a cours for relax and feedom for sight see . if we do everyth in the trip follow by someon , it just look like work as usual . when i take a trip by myself or with my friend , we could go everywher we want , we could eat everyth we like . we talk and laught loudli , and we enjoy myself . secondli , in the jounri , the time we spend in the place we love is depend on how much we like . if we find some place beauti , we can have a good time there for long . onc we feel tire dure some part in a trip , we can stop and have a rest , we can have a drink in the cafe in the way , too . no one could stop you . thirdli , it is said that the tour guid may show you manyth so you would learn more in the trip , howev , in my opinion , it is not neccssari for me to know much by hear the guid said , also , it make me tire , dure the holiday , we should enjoy and learn thing by tring and see by outrselv . we will find more while we take a tri in everth . the best way to travel is to travel yourself or with your few good friend . it will give you a hard forget time , and your frinendship would be deeper . i am not here tosay the other choic is bad , but i think , not as good as mine , you know , travel in group may make you tire . . so , i do n't think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , enjioy yourself in the travel .
