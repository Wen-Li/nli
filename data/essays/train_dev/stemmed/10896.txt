i agre with tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . the world is chang veri fast . do you think that you can live without the advanc of skill or technolog ? i do n't think so . the poepl are becom more intellig and talent than those of 100 year ago . human be are alway want to be advanc . first of all , even primit peopl invent a lot of thing to eat , hunt and retain the stuff . at first , they probabl did n't know how to turn on the fire . they tri sever time to get what they want to have . if they had not tri to get the fire , nobodi would have gotten it . second , to live twentyfirst centuri is not easi , and theseday the competit is veri fierc . the technolog is advanc veri high and everyday new product are come to attract the custom eye . even if someon ha veri uniqu skill , sooner or later the other person will imit these skill or invent new skill . everyday is differ , we have to invent new stuff and think of new idea . if no , we will never win other . final , as i just said , now is veri hard to be success person without invent our skill . we must know one thing befor invent someth . we probabl will fail sometim while we are do someth . it can be happen . even though we fail , we have to keep make an effort to get what we are think . to invent news thing or skill , peopl have to be veri brave and take risk . for the first time , they might fail to invent but they do n't have to give up invent . if they give up becaus of the scare of the fail , they will never be grown and get what they realli want . be a success person is not esay , we have to keep do until we get what we think .
