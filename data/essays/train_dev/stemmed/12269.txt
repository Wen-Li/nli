nowaday , and as it is spread in the mass media , a popular misconcept is that young peopl have a far more interest life than older . inde , they make parti , they drink alcohol , contrari to the '' old men '' who spend their time play card , talk about busi . .. i am deepli opposit to thi vision . i consid first that there are a lot of differ way in order to '' enjoy life '' , then i would like to point out that young peopl have oblig too , and final i want to highlight a substanti thing : it is older , those who have the mean to enjoy . but let 's talk first about differ leisur . to begin , i would like to say that enjoy is not necessari connect to parti . inde , you can enjoy life in your work becaus you make an interest job . for the sake of exampl , i think that a singer like michel sardou , or a busi man , like steve jobb , can have fun be at work . moreov , when you are older , you get experi which allow you to enjoy other thing : a teenag can not understand the same thing visit a museum than a senior . and play at trivial pursuit when you are 12 year old is not so pleasant . then , even if i can not deni that young peopl have usual more time for leisur , they have oblig too : for a lot of work peopl , they have finish when they come back to their hous . it is not the same for a student who ha homework . and it is notic that adult chose their work , whether pupil and student are at school becaus it is an oblig . so , they can feel less involv in what they do . final , we can not forget the fact that , for a lot of leisur , you have to pay to enjoy . speak about sport , about cinema , even about attract parc , noth is free . and in order to earn enough money , you have to spend a certain number of year , so you are older . to conclud , and be a student myself , i do not want to complain about my situat , and i know that my parent wo n't let me without money , but i do think that , with the age ( so with the experi and the money ) you can enjoy your life in a differ way , without becom a veget in a chair !
