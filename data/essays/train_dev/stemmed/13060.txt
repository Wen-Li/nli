i do not agre with what the statement becaus i think that the young peopl are not matur enough to realli enjoy what the life offer day by day , while the old peopl can do . let 's go to talk about the level of matur in the young peopl . most of the young peopl think onli about materi thing like cloth and do not realli pay attent on the other thing that are present in thier life . for they , how they look like is most import that anyth els . they think that the cloth can defin how they are treat and how importan they are . howev , it aspect doe not have the same impot for a old peopl who is more focuss on see what are behin the cloth . the old peopl is more interest in know the other person and enjoy it . anoth thing that i can mention to support my opinion is that the young peopl just wast their time without think on the consecuen of their behavior . they want to enjoy their life as they want and not as they shoud . the old peopl , on the other hand , have more time just to admir what they have done , they have done everyth alreadi when they were young , so their time is better invest . in conclusit , i think that consid the differ interest that move to the young peopl and the old peopl , and also their differ level of matur , the second one have more capac to enjoy more what the real life offer and can be abl to notic the beauti of the thing that surraround them .
