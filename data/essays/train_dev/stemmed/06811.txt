much of the travel that take part in the world is in new site for the one that undergon the trip . although direct of the travl could beneffit from some expert , with some tour guid , i defenitli preffer not to travel with one . my main reason , is that i like travel to the unknown . with thi in mind , the use of a tour guid will ruin thi fasin . two year ago , my girldfriend and i went to europ and in the airplan met other coupl that were travel to the same destin . even , we stay in the same hotel . they decid to walk freeli on the street , enter the place they want , go to event that the veri same day were anounc or hear about , among other action . all thi decit alow them to presenc veri excit thing that happen in the citi , and that make news all over the world . in contrast , we keep secur , complet safti , noth excit schedul of go to the museam and castless . second , is that i like flexibl in my vacat . it is enough the time constrait in my job , the unflex schedul , to bring it with me to my hollyday , the time of the year i travel . for exampl , in the second year of collag me and my friend went to chiapa , mexico , to visit the mayan piramid . at that trip we were lead with a tour guid with a veri unflex schedul . thi make us imposs to enjoy the trip becaus of the time and the place we alreadi want it to spend the most . after thi experi , i decid never travel with a tour guid again . that is way i enjoy travel without a tour guid .
