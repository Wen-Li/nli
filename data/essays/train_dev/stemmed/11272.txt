a hundr year ago nobodi thought that these day we would have million and million of car in use in everi countri . i do n't think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use . in fact , i do beliv that the number of car in use will increas dramat . one fact that may caus thi is that there will be more singl peopl than nowaday , and they will all need a way of transport from home to their place of work . anoth reason whi numer of car will increas is that rich peopl love car . they think they are better person if they have more car than anyon . that 's whi they will keep on buy them and use all of them to tri to show how rich , power and great person they are . in addit , car are may be the best way to get from one place to anoth : it is the cheapest way to travel , and you are free to decid where you want to go , even to chang your opinion dure the travel . but car do repres a big problem to our environ . they produc toxic gase that affect the ozon layer . due to these gase our lung are pollut too . now there are more peopl with cancer than back then . in the futur , car will face anoth problem : the matter that there will not be enough oil to all of them . is there anyth that we can do to protect ourselv and our environ from pollut and also still have the chanc to travel whenev we want , wherev we want , anytim we want ? ye , there ir . but the solut , unfortun , ha not been develop yet . we need new way of transport , such as vehicl that run thank to electr instead of oil . that 's whi i realli believ that when these ` green vehicl ' get to be develop , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . howev , it wo n't happen in twenti year .
