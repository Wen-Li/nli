although mani peopl think that onli dure youth we can reali enjoy life , i do n't agre with thi statement and i will now give some reason to support my idea . first , i think that in the last year youngh peopl do n't have ani more time to spend in enjoy life . the stress cours of moden life do n't allow them to stop a minut and tast it . inde they have to studi hard and a lot to be abl to find a job . on the countrari retir peopl have a lot of time the they could spend by make holiday or just do what they like to do . for exampl sinc i wa ten year old , i dream what i will do dure my retir time becaus sinc that age i have onli studi to manag to suc in my futur job without , thu , have the time to enjoy the best year of my life . second , i think that even though mani physic problem add gradual dure life time , they allow old peopl to do what they want . nevertheless these physic problem are n't invis and with the pass of the time they becom a problem , sometim a seriou and bad problem . howev , as cicero said , the age is n't a ill . inde if physic problem come inesorabili nevertheless they take with them more wise . an age peopl is wiser than a young peopl who ca n't understand the real and beauti mean of some littl action or experi . in conclus i think that old peopl are abl to enjoy life more than young peopl . inde they are albl to know the real sens of life thak to their wise . on the contrari young peopl stop to the superfici and physic level without achiev the deepest one .
