understand the idea and concept is import in ani learn process , but if the student ignor or were not abl to learn and focu on the fact , that will be reflect on them in understand the whole topic or subject . from my point of view , i think that studi and focus on fact is not less import than studi and learn concept and idea and thi is becaus of mani reason , first is the need for the implement of idea and concept , so when we take the nujrs student as an exampl , nurs student read the concept of some medic terminolog throughout the cours of their major but if these student do not implement what they read , thi will be reflect neg on them after they graduat and start their career , second is the need to observ the applic of these concept and idea , and for thi point i will mention the medic surgic student as an exampl , when the student onli studi and read the concept of sutur and wound dress and onli look at pictur in the book , they will never be abl to practic these concept , anoth reason that indic that the fact are import , the pyramid in egypt , mani of the student in the school of engin learn about the concept of archtictur use to build the pyramid and as these concept confisc the most of us it will be more confisc to some of these student as will , except if they watch the illustr video for the structur and archtictur of the pyramid , and the fact of build these pyramid in the insid and the outsid will be more clear to them . as a conclus , learn of idea and concept will be confus for ani student in ani major or feild of studi and will not be convinc enough , so the level of satisfact for that student will be lower except if that student wa expos to the fact of the topic he is learn
