i disagre with the statement that argu most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i think most peopl are mislead by few aggress opinion and blame advertis for wrong reason . howev , i admit that there are some advertis , especi in food , hotel and restaur , that tri to make fals impress on consum by ad color or increas the volum or show pictur of long time ago . but in most case , i think most advertis are honest about their product . especi thank to the aris public awar , compani are be more care to be truth and honest when commun to consum through advertis . the main purpos of advertis is to make peopl want to consum or buy a product or servic . in order to do that , advertis focus on get attent to draw interest from consum . that is whi they use famou actor and actress or flashi visual or loud and upbeat music . but that doe not have anyth to do with make the product or servic look better at all . if a pair of cloth look better when it 's put on by famou actress in an advertis than by yourself , it is onli your imagin that it look better in the ad . these effect make peopl feel happi or imagin someth fun which lead them to think that the product look good or beauti . but it is import to be awar that it is not becaus they did someth to the product . advertis are onli ad context to the product to let the peopl imagin someth fun or beauti and have that imagin relat to the product . when peopl watch or see advertis , they should be awar of thi effect to protect themselv from fals impress caus by their own imagin . in addit to that , partli due to regul , there are advertis which describ not onli the strength and benefit but also risk and weak associ with the product such as prescript drug . it seem contradictori to the main purpos of advertis but in the end , honest commun should be paid off by trust and loyalti from consum . i think the import of honest commun between compani and consum are be recogn in the corpor world .
