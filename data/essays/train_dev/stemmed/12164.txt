sinc car were invent by human , each gener get more and more car . my grand-par had one car for the famili , both of my parent had their own car and now i get mine . thi situat underlin a lot of problem that we can discuss in thi essay . i will talk about the resourc such as ga or petrol , about the environ , about the public transport , about the new technolog and i will conclud with my own vision of the futur . the first argument that come to my mind when i think about vehicul is the problem of the natur resourc . inde we are more and more on thi earth and we use more car . but we do n't have unlimit resourc . there will be no more petrol in less than fifti year and we will have to find a solut . the second argument is the one of the environ . car reject a lot of carbon in the air and that 's so bad for our earth that is suffer more everyday . with less car there will be less pollut . but are we readi to stop that situat ? those two argument are a realiti and in the fact , they will contribut to say that there will be less car in the futur . but there are two argument that i want to talk about and that could show the contrari . first , public transport are not veri develop except in the big town . for exampl , i live in anger and if i want to go to my school it will last 40 minut by bu against 5 with a car . to finish , i 'd say that there is new techolog for the car resourc such as the clean diesel that contamin less and that consum veri less . that make economi for everyon . to conclud , i think that there is a fatal for the car industri , with no resourc there is no car but i think that we will develop new technolgi such as oil carbur or thing that could provid a cheapest and cleanest resourc for our transport . my conclus is that there will be more and more car in the futur .
