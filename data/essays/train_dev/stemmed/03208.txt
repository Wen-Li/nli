how mani place that everyon want to visit ? and whi everyon want to visit a differ place than the other ? there are alot of reason for travel and the most import reason is to go to the place that you realli like and to find out everyth in thi place . but you need someon who is expert in thi place to show everyth . so accord to that i would rather have a tour guid for differ reason such as show me everyth , save my time and to provid ani problem that might happen . first of all , if i am go to travel to somewher i will have chosen a tour guid who know everyth . so i can go everywher and i will have a good background with alot of infrom . for exampl , my friend went to itali for visit without a tour guid so he could n't mani place becaus he knew noth . otherwis , my brother went to spain and as soon as he got there he got a tour guid , so he visit most of the place in spain with alot of hestor inform . second , if i go by my own to everi singl place and figur out about those place how much time that i will spend . for exampl . friend of mine went to fllorida for visit without a tour guid and he spent three week to visit most of the of place . howev , my other friend went to florida with a tour guid and he stay there for one week and he visit mostli everyeher . third , no one know what could happen there sometim you get sick and you dont where you are so you ca n't go to the hospit or if you get rob by someon you dont know where is the polic station and what you should do . in conclus i would like to say that you should have a tour guid instead of have troubl in ani place , so your trip will turn to be a bad trip .
