as far as i am concern , i neither agre or disagre with the statement abov . so far , both consid approach are okay to me . it depend on differ aspect , which way is much better . i am go to describ some aspect and some base inform , how everyon should decid in term of `` broad knowledg of mani acadam subject '' versu `` special in one subject '' . at first , everbodi should make sure , what kind of futur career aspir they tend to have . therefor , you should ask yourself the follow two question : - do you want to becom an expert in one specif subject or knowledg area ? - or do you prefer to becom a generalist ( person , who know mani differ thing about differ subject - but majorli on a high level basi ) over some differ subject without a deep knowledg in detail ? if peopl are abl to answer these question , it should be quit straight-forward to find a solut on an individu basi . if you want to becom an expert in a specif area , you should focu on one or perhap even two ( but not more ! ) subject and drive yourself into an expert role among your peer over the year of studi . if you want to becom a generalisit , you should studi sever subject to approach a wide horizont of knowleg . unfortun , at the begin of a studi , mani student are unsur what direct they should prefer . in thi situat , i am go to recommend to make follow choic : as long as student are abl to keep the generalist role without the need for special , student should tri to get into differ acadam subject in order to find out , what is the best approach for each of them . if student are go to choos thi way , they have to be awar about time manag . if student tend just `` to studi around '' plu loos time and no learn plan , they are go to have a disadvantag dure applic for a job . recruit depart of compani ask applic about the length of their studi time . if there is an answer with no target direct , it is veri hard to get a job .
