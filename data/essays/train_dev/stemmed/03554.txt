i agre with the statement that ` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . ' the present situat of the man demand hi time and full energi wherein he is busi all the day with hectic schedul of hi work . as the say , ` man is a social anim ' depict that , today 's man live in the societi , for the societi and with the societi . so he want to just go along with other peopl to grab for the oppurtun for hi better of need and better of hi futur . if he do not do thi for himself , he will definit lag behind and keep on wait for the chanc to go along with the societi . with all these tension in the mind , today 's man is unabl to give time help hi commun . let us take my exampl onli , i am a doctor by my profess and i wa an athelet when i wa in my colleg day . i use to play cricket at nation level . that time i had a thought in my mind that i should pick up some beauti player and train them perfectli and send them for nation and intern game . i start with collect the member of variou colleg and i made a real strong group of cricket team . but later when i wa busi with my hectic schedul , i could n't concentr much on my particular small commun and i left them alon which pose a remark effect on my mind . there are mani commun like physic handicap and oldag peopl , where the young gener should realli look into and tri to spend some time help them out . they can spend littl time for them and littl money which would make them mental relax and feel well that there is someon who is care about them . i final conclud by say that `` what goe around will come around '' . when you do someth good for the better of the societi , that will definit help you out atleast in later stage of your life .
