i am desagre with the sentenc that the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guid becaus i have travel without a tour guid and i have have so beauti experi i mean it `` ve been so cool . of cours i have travel with a guid tour too but when thi happen the guid tour is alway under presion of the time and you need to follow him all time and if you want to stop some time you ca n't and i do n't know but i do n't like to have tour guid . in other hand when i travel without tour guid i can stop wherev i want and i can do wherev i want , and if i do not know what place are the famous of the citi i can ask to the peopl who live in that place or i can go to a librari and look in the internet the direct and then get a map and then i am readi to go wherev i want thu it is so funni becaus if i get lost i need to ask how to return and at the same time that i know the citi i know more peopl . i know that it is a risk , becaus for exampl my friend an i are go to travel next weekend to quertaro to visit some friend well they are member of my church , but i never have been there and no bodi that know how to arrriv to the citi want to come with us , so we decid to take the risk and we onli have the map , the car and money , well i want to tell you that some time i feel afear to get lost or someth like that but someth insid of my is tell my `` you can do whatev you want '' ( and i know that voic is good , and . .. he is go to care me ) . so we decid that we will travel without tour guid . in conclut despit is too riski travel without tour guid it is better becaus is too funni and you can learn of your mistak .
