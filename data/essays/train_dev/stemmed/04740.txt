i think that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in three reason , it can be prove , exazager , repeat , and use famou person . first of all , exager is good evid . some compani can not lie about the it product . howev , they usual use other factor in advertis . for exampl , there are mani heathi peopl and they alway smile in the madicin advertis . even though peopl usual get a medicin when they sick , the advertis alway shsw healthi and happi peopl . the consum might think that they could be healthi if they get the medicin . but , it is wrong . thi is exager of advertis . second , mani compani usual use famou person for advertis . if a famou person say '' thi is good product . and i am use thi product everyday. '' , peopl believ it . peopl believ it becaus they are famou person . but , usual the product is not concern with the famou person . peopl think that they can be nice if they use it . but it is wrong becaus it is just advertis . third , repeat is one of method mani compani can use in their advertis . when peopl hear a prase again and again , usual peopl rememb the word and prais . it is not necessori to say that they will buy the product when they see it . for exampl , my wife and i usual go to shop togeth . when we see the same product which we saw in advertis , we usual buy it . becaus the product is onli one thing that we have a inform about it . even thouth it is just the product 's name or prais it often make an import roll in my decis . in conclus , i think that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . becaus mani compani use exazager , a famou person , and repeat , peopl buy the product .
