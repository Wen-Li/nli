i do not agre with thi statement , although i would be glad if it were true . in my opinion it is too idealist to assum that the number of car will decreas . it might be possibl if a new technolog were discov and brought into use , or if sever societ around the world learn to depend onli on public transport . unfortun , twenti year is not enough to come up with a complet new way of person transport . there would have to be a phenomen invent like a littl individu airplan for everyon to replac the car . as i said , i do not regard thi as possibl . concern the public transport , it would be necessari to reorgan whole citi or even countri in order to make the car a less practic mean of transport . one could argu that becaus of the concern for the environ that peopl have they would not buy new car anymor . especi becaus of the increas pollut of the air . howev , i think that the number of those who are realli and honestli concern about the futur of our environ are too few . there are still those who do not care about pollut and who regard it as more import to be abl to possess an individu car . a lot of peopl might have ideal of a cleaner and less pollut environ , but as soon as it come to their person comfort they are not readi to give away the car . anoth reason whi there will not be fewer car is , that the biggest part of the world 's popul consist of peopl from poor countri or countri that are now grow and increasig their wealth . it is most probabl that in these countri the number of car will increas immens . for exampl china . more and more peopl gain money through commerc , peopl that befor live in poor condit . these peopl will now be abl to buy car , so that in the end , the number of those who buy car is by far bigger than of those who decid not to use them .
