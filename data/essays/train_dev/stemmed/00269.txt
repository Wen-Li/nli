i absolut agre with the statement that , success peopl tri new thingh and take risk . i think that the most import characterist of a success person is the want to better oneself , and thi is made by the want to learn new thing . the best way to learn new thing is work whit other peopl . of these two kind of work , either work alon or work whit other peopl , i prefer work in group for the reason that i 've just mention abov . work whit other peopl give us competit , and i think it 's veri import to increas our knowledg . on the other hand , when i work alon , i can decid when start and finish my work . i have more freedom than when i work in group , but ther is much work to do . i also think that , the word success mean risk ! in fact , if you do the same thing all day , noth will be chang ! in conclus , the best way to tri new thing is to increas one 's knowledg , so , work whit other peopl even if you do n't like them . -
