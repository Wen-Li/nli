as far as i am concern , i total agre with the statement state that have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to special in one specif subject . the reason that whi i think like thi , are the follow : gener academ knowledg within a broad rang is a requir item for the increas interdepend between certain academ field and provid the abil for the peopl in order to adopt the common languag in the academ environ . firstli , nowaday , academ field begin to be veri correl with each other . for instanc , i am an undergradu student in a bioinformat major and i am take cours from comput scienc , biolog , electron and statist . sinc there begin to be believ that integr approach may be more successfrul from pure biolog , comput and statist approach , lot of academician from differ field come togeth , share their idea and effort to provid a product effort . in my internship , i wit thi work environ veri close in stanford univers , becaus we are collobor with the medic school as the statist depart . in order to understand these common approach , i had to gain a knowledg about both medicin and statist . apart from thi increas connect between certain field , there is a common languag in the academician . for the peopl aim to be a academician in the futur , it is a must to have a gener knowledg . sinc they have a lot of friend of academician from variou area , they have to interact their colleagu in the academ environ . they must perceiv even a littl about what their friend are talk in their field . they must express their idea about variou field in an academ talk . they can obtain thi abil by tri to learn about differ field . becaus of the abov mention reason , i would prefer to have a gener knowledg than special in a specif field .
