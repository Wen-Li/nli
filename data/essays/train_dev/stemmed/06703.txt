it is import to have an idea of mani academ subject , but i think it is more import to special in one specif subject , that you can collect a lot of inform about thi subject , and you becom more effici in your work , that you can discov new knowledg about thi subject and new field in it , so you can get a good posset in your work and in your life , and you becom specialest in you field . that person who have knowledg of mani academ subject will not collect all the inform about the subject , and he will not becom a qualficat person to work in spesif jobe and to use hi knowledg in thi job , compar to that person who have special in one subjct . we can think also that the person who have special in one subject should have some knowledg about some subject , caus he may use them in hi life and hi job , and he will be more qualef in ani field , at the same time when we think about that person who have knowledg of mani academ subject he can got ani job he want , and it will give him more opprtin in life , that the person who is special in one specif subject may not have a lot of oppertionti to have good job especali if he ha a special in a feild which is not popul or an old subject , so he will lose the opertion to have job , or to work in hi feild . at these day the life is more develop and thier is a lot of knowldg all over the world , and no one can collect all the knowleg , so the person should ask about the new special and which is effect dure a lot of year and becom special in thi subject , at the same time tri to collect and read about differ issu and differ subject to develp hi knowledg , and to have more opportin in life .
