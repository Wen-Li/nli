learn is a never end process . but it is veri import for one to know `` how much to know '' . put forth my disagr for the statement i would like to present my opinion about the topic . in my opinion have knowledg of mani academ subject is fairli justifi to a veri primari level , till the time one get 's to know the basic of that subject . but it is veri import to have detail knowledg about one subject in particular . to elabor thi point further i would like to detail the factor of one aptitud that come into play . it is not necessari for a person to have strong affin for a whole array of subjet than compar to a subject in particular . thi affin can be potenti put to use by furher breed one like for a paticular subject . thi can onli be achiev by gain detail knowledg about that specif subject . let take an exampl of a creativ field like architectur , where the primari educ that the syllabu provid give one a rough idea about lot of subject pertain to histori , evolut and practic implic of architectur design . but the entir cours focus and deal with these subject at a veri primari level . the amount of contribut a good architect can make to the societi can be veri crucial in defin the era a societi come from and to be in a posit to make that level of contribut and ha to have a veri deep root understandng of the strata of societi , the natur and behavori pattern of peopl . and thi can be achiev onli when one understand the nuanc of a subject in concern . thi not onli provid a zest and encourag to do better but can set exampl for the com gener . thi understand ha to be inculc at a veri nascent stage so that right decis can be taken by individu which broaden the horizon not onli for one person develop but could lead us into a refin and a resolv tommorow .
