i agre with thi sentenc , becaus of alot of reason the first thing is that advertis help show the new product to peapl so they can decid to bye it or not . for exampl i wa search for a new tredmil so i can exercis on it and decreas my weight , and i saw one that it is so unexpens and verri effect . but when ibought it i found that it need a lot of person power to make it work , the thing that idid not recogn from the tv . in the other hand advertis doe not give the tast of differ food and meal , and just leav it to our imagin w hich make our mouth water and that is faraway from the real thing finali it make all of our dream is possibl by find everi thing we thought about befor , but thi is not true becous we dont have the money and even the warante for all these thing . in short i beleiv that advertis are a veri power way to make peopl bye product and some of them reflect the real thing about the putchas .
