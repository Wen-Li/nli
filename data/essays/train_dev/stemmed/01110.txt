i agre that in some situat thi statement is true , but there are case where `` success '' can be defin do a veri good job in a specif area where you have veri strong an well known abil , without to do somet new . i explain thi idea make three exampl : 1 if you are a technic engin that need to maintain a refineri plant in north sea dure a normal activ period , you need to have veri deep understand on how it work and what kind of action you need to do to maintain it oper safe and effic . so tri somet new is not requir in thi case , and you will be success if you have minimum accid and maximum product . 2. if you are a businessman that need to compet in a veri crowd market you need to exploit somet new to succeed . in thi case tri somet new both about the conduct of the busi and so on your person abil is a risk but can be the onli way to gener new busi and so bee success . 3. if you are a doctor that need to help to recov from a cancer you can use new tecniqu but have a solid background of protocol to be sure that the patient will never fall again in thi ill . so your success come from a combin from new thing and well known procedur . so at the end i have expos three way where bee innov , in the sens take some risk and do somert new , can be a way for success or not . what is known is that the pepol work at best when the are work one somet new where still they can use hi own previou experi , but thi is more about effic rather than success . success is depend from the situat and so we need to take care what is the environ where we made our mesur about success .
