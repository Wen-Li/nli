i do not agre with the idea of '' the bast wa to travel is in a group led by a tour guid ' . mani peopl go on a travel by agenc with a tour guid wharea , i prefer go trip by self with specif gruop like friend of famili as follw trason . first , privat travel with the close mamber can make deciss by self while travel with a packag tour are not abl to and have to follow other peopl and the guid . for exampl i went to thailand to travel by agenc and it made me to tire . i want stay citi and want to get a masag instead of watch gay show but it wa not aloud . so i had to wait until gay show finish instead of get a masag becaus other peopl want to watch it and it wa in the schedul ! . so i felt annoy by tight and thogh schedul . secondli , packag travel doe not give worth feel . when peopl go packag travel , they just follow their guid . guid doe not make mistak and do thie best to travel safe and also are proffesion . yet , doe thi travel give adventur ? not realli , travel feel upset to the unknown world and by expact of itand also worri about how it will happen . some time peopl can miss the bu or the place can be wors than they expect . thi look bad but after some year or after finish travel travel would find worth feel as they have done and mistak and daunger thing make more worth memor . last , thi is veri sensit reason . go travel with tour guid is rel more expens than go by self . when i wa travel to an island in the korea , the tour guid alway lead us to the shop . like jewel shop , food shop , all the shop and forc us to listen shop owner advantag and ask to buy them . i bought some at that time . in addit , i went that island again just by myself and went that shop agiain and . . what ? the real cost wa 5time cheaper ! thi happen is veri common happen when peopl travel in a group by a guid and it can even happen at price of entri ticket or hotel fee not even at the shop ! i went some place to travel by sever way and i found mani disadvantag of packag trvel . and i recommend that peopl have better to trvel by their own
