we live in a era in wich everi product ha an advertis . for exampl when i watch tv , or i listen to the radio , or i walk on the street i can see , and listen a lot of advertis . usual the media describ the product like they are the best but , unfortun , in a lot of case thi is not true . for exampl i 've just bought a new televis . i saw on the tv the advertis and it describ thi televis like a realli beaufi product with a lot of new technolog detail and , for thi reason i decid to buy it . when i arriv at home and i decid to use it a realiz that all i heard , unfortunaleti , is not true . i 'm veri sad for thi chois becaus i spent a lot of money for a bad product and i think that i 'm realli stupid girl . on the other hand , there are also advertis that explain onli true advantag and tell true inform , in order to garante the qualiti and the good name and reput of the brand . for exampl my brother bought a car last year and nowaday he 's realli happi for thi chois . i think he 's a realli fortun boy ! i think that the advertis shall say onli the true and in thi way peopl can choos the differ product whitout the fear to buy a bad item . the right of the consum are not respect by the media and i beliv that thi problem can be risolv soon as possibl . peopl spend a lot of time to studi the product , becaus they do n't want to spend a lot of money for item that are not like they want . at the moment , i think that is realli danger buy someth without a corret inform about it . i trust , that in the futur , the law can chang thi situat that not advantag the citizen .
