nowaday we live in an era were the use of car seem to be veri use and that we can not live without it . in my opinion , i think that in twenti year there will be more car than there are today eventhough the public transport will develop enorm . firslti , the popul of the world is grow consider , thi mean that on the next twenti year there will be more peopl reach the age of have the drive licens . secondli , as the year go on , the price of the car will be lower , the new technolog make posibl to produc car at lower price . thi will make posibl that a major number of peopl achiv to buy a car . you wont need too much money to buy a normal car . mayb , luxuri car wo n't reach to acces price , but normal car i think that will . thirdli , it is shown that go on motorbik in the street of the citi , the avenu , the autopista is veri danger . everi year the number of dead peopl drive a motorbik increas enorm . peopl is taken conceuou that drive a motorbik is danger and that the possibl of have an accid is high . moreov , peopl will tend to prefear to drive a car that drive a motorbik . fourthli , eventhough the public transport are bee improv in comfort , price , distanc , etc . in twenti year it wo n't have develop so much to be abl to not have a car and move around the citi , countri , world by public transport . car will be yet necessari to do day a day thing , and to move around the street . to sum up , i think that twenti year are no so much to decid not to have ani car , mayb in a futur , if thing chang , and the public transport improv and make more facil to peopl may reduc the number of car . but in a deadlin of twenti year i think that all the factor that i have mention befor will make to have more than today .
