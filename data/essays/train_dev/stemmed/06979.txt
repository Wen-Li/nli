gener speak , i agre that it 's more import for student to understand concept than to learn fact . howev , both studi method present advantag and disadvantag . first of all , though memor ha the advantag of requir less concentr and less effort from the student , it 's more like to forget what you learnt by heart after a short time . on the other hand , though understand idea in depth take a longer time and impli more effort from the student , it is easier to rememb the concept you adequ understood , and to relat them to your background knowledg . for exampl , when i studi math , i realis that i ca n't simpli memor inform , and that i realli have to understand everi detail in depth . on the other hand , i admit that sometim it might also be use to learn fact by heart . for instanc , when i studi histori , it often happen to rememb histor event accord to the chronolog order they occur . in thi case , i think that it 's not necessari to spend time tri to understand idea , as i am just expact to learn a list of event by heart . thu , though i realli prefer to understand idea , i think that my posit is between these two extrem . in fact , i choos my approach accord to the subject i am studi . when deal with a scientif subject like math , i prefer to understand everi detail in depth , as thi is necessari to solv exercis and to be adequalt prepar . on the other hand , when i am just expact to memor inform , i prefer to learn fact by heart . for these reason , i believ that my approach to studi is between these to extrem method .
