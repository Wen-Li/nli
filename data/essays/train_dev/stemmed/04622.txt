ye . i do agre that most of the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . advertis infact in today 's world do not onli mean the disposit of the product 's essenti featur and it look . instead they are suppos to be a glorifi dispay of the product with the fake promis that it is and will prove out to be a veri valuabl product , which will inde provid enough custom satisfact . in some case the promis may turn out to be true as it total depend on the the compani and the `` product '' , the real one . advertis are suppos to be in some case onli heart winner ! i say onli becaus the product of that same field , competit product are all but equal in term of qualiti or quantiti they provid . it onli upon the market and advertis faculti of the organ if it can make it look `` much better than it realli is '' . and onli when it make a place in the custom ' heart would it be sold and the profitsfor the compani flourish . in a world of competit , the manufactur is compel to make the product perciev as the best it can be . and inde as support by the studi of the current market , the product that are well advertis are the most sought after by the particular segment custom . inde if you add a bit of sheen to your product or make it look bigger , better , `` tasti '' or tempt to the public on the t.v , magazin or ani other mean of the media , chanc are that the custom in and except your clientel would be atleast somewaht lure the product . and though they might buy it onli after care examin of the product and consider review from there friend , they are atleast usher to go to the market and check out how and what it realli is . now the actual sale of a product would obvious depend partial on how well it realli resembl the advertis `` glorif '' and partial on the competit it face . so in my opinion the advertis in today world is a neccessari part of the market process . as real it can be kept , it should be . but i would consid it compulsori to give a bit of weight to the product adn it featur .
