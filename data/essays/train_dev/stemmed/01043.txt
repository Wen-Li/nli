when peopl decid to increas their knowledg , they decid either to do thi on one specif subject or the choos to extent their knowledg in differ area . in can be argu that in nowaday steadi grow and chang industri a broad knowlegd is essenti to adapt to the ever chang market . i am also a propon of a broad knowledg of m academ subject . firstli , busi is chang at a rapid pace . numer job that have been there for year , and have given labour to peopl are bee subsecid by machin . for instanc , if a worker onli know how to do a task that can now be done by a machin , the worker would probabl loos hi work , due to the fact that for most compani machien are more effici . what other job could he appli for if he onli had the knowledg need for one kind of labour . replac of human labour forc for machien is someth which happen frequent nowaday , due to the evolv technolog . in fact , mani peopl have react to thi by extend their academ knowledg . thi bring them the advantag , of easili adapt to chanch circumst in the commerci world and they will less fear chang in their profess . secondli , i favor a broad knowledg becaus it it is less bore . specif can bring along boredom over a long term . for exampl , if someon ha onli one task to reli on , in order to keep him satisfi with hi work and knowledg , he might get tire of the routin , ascrib to hi work . he could not easili switch into anoth field , without educ himself all over again . he would might have to attend extra cours to learn about a new field of interest . if he had extent hi knowledg to differ subject in hi academ career , he would not need extra cours or even a new format . to conclud , have a broad knowledg is more favour to nowadaz market , it rapid chang and new innov . furthermor , it is key to keep oneself satisfi in hi or her labour life , sinc routin sometim is a critic factor for unsatisfact .
