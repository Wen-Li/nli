doe young peopl enjoy life more than the older peopl do ? the answer to thi question , in my opinion , is `` no '' . the follow three reason support my opinion . everyon in thi world enjoy life the way he want to depend on the avail resourc . the young peopl are work full-tim and have much more money in hand as compar to that of older peopl , who are live on old age pension or work part-tim for the littl amount of money . moreov , as they are old they usual do not have good health and lot of their money is spent in hospit and medicin bill . therefor , old peopl have less enjoy resourc as compar to the young peopl . we could find almost all younger peopl go to resturaunt , club and on holiday frequent and think that they are enjoy life . on the other hand , older peopl might have also done the same when they were young and might not want to do same at thi stage of life . they might want to travel to a peac place like templ or church and spend some time there in peac , which they think they enjoy the most . the second and most import point is the physic strength . the older peopl have veri less physic strength as compar to the energet younger popul . therefor , the older peopl want to stay at home and enjoy life with their famili , which doe not mean that they are not enjoy life but their mean of enjoy is differ from that of the younger gener . the younger gener actual show to their peer and other that thi is the stage in their life and they should enjoy the most now and tend to show their peer that they are enjoy much more than them and we usual get the percept that young peopl are enjoy more than the older peopl . for exampl if a twenti year old guy goe to the best and most expens disco in town , he will be tell thi to all of hi friend to show hi superior to hi friend . therefor the differ is not who enjoy the life more , young or old peopl , but the differ is how both young and old peopl enjoy life . their prefer and mean of enjoy are differ but both enjoy life equal .
