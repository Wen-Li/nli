i do not agre with the statement that in twenti year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today due to the follow reason . firstli , i believ that in the futur , peopl will travel not onli to the region in the neibourhood but also for the far remot area , which includ foreign countri . it will bcome possibl in line with establish of highway , construct the huge bridg between countri and conveni carri system such as huge ferri to transport such car in passag of time , more and more peopl need to move by themselv for their own purpos becaus busi will be expand to the wordwid and it is essenti to keep mobil for individu . car could be desir and obtain per person like as is the case for mobil phone . therefor , the situat could be happen that each individu will have own car per person . secondli , i beliv that there should be some technic enhanc to the car and the subsistu energi of petro oil will be invent and introduc to the car by the engin and research of automobil compani . the exampl of such fuel are electror , energi creat by natur such as sun or oxigion and so on and it is also good for the environ . such introdut of new energi will decreas the cost to maintain the car than today and i presum that more and more peopl can have an access to car with smaller initi invest . i am insist the abov oponion on the assumpt that the form of the car could be chang and transform like the one now develpo by some of japanes compani and current concept of car would chang . the car could becom much smaller one which allow onli one person to ride and safeti is assur in order that peopl could move place to place by such own veihcl . with the abov three reason , i person beliv that more car can be introduc than today in the futur .
