no bodi can deni that advertis are veri useful and import for us nowaday becaus it help us to know about the new product and which are good and which are bad . some advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in fact , i disagre with that the advertis cheat the custom and tell them that product are useful and they are not for mani reason . fist , thi advertis make me spend my money in wrong way instead of tell me he truth and help me buy appropri thing . if i am poor man and see by the tv or radio that product are useful , i will buy it and if it is not good i wast my money and can not buy what is useful for me . in addit to that , thi kind of advertis effect the good product becaus when the custom see the bad product is better than good productm , he will buy the bad product and do not buy the good product , so the compani will be lose their money although it product is the best . furthermor , they will encourg bad compani to produc the bad product becaus they know that if they advertis for their product well , they will not lose ani thing but they will collect a lot of money which lead to encourg peopl to cheat and be dishonest in their societi . moreov , when the peopl know the truth about thi compani of advertisemnt , they wil lose their credabl with peopl and will not trust them ani more . in uae there is compani which do thi for some product becaus the compani of thi product give it a lot of money but when the peopl know the truth they told the author and they close thi compani . final in my opinion , the compani of advertis should tell the peopl the truth and work to help them not to cheat them and then they will have alot of money for sure becaus all peopl kmow that thi compani work for peopl and know their credabl .
