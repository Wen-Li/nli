i fulli agre with the statement that succes peopl tri new thing and take risk . in our everyday life , we have mani exampl that confirm thi opinion , but the most import one is given by our interpreneur . interpreneur are alway risk a lot in term of money and time . moreov , enterpreneur are alway innov , tri new thing in order to surviv in the market , to be competit , to improv their posit on the global market . the main result of thi behaviour is the success that everybodi can recogn as tipic of enterpreneur . on the other side , we have the low level employ . they onli do what they have been teach to do at the begin of their carreer and they do thi work for all the life . veri often , thi kind of peopl are realli veri good in do some specif work and they usual work for all their life for the same compani . gener , they never take ani risk and the compani fulli protect and support them becaus they have a veri strong know how . but if we analys the life of these peopl we can see that they never achiev ani success . to conclud , i think that to be succes in the life , we need to take risk and tri new thing . moreov , in thi way we can keep aliv our mind , we can train our creativ , we can better express ourself as human be . i think that we need to live as deep as possibl our uniqu life , therefor we musttri as much as possibl new thing !
