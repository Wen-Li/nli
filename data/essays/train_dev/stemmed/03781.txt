special in one specif subject might be consid more like a person that can do better work than a person with broad knowledg due to the deep they have in their own field of educ . howev i think that broadli educ peopl are more use and well made becaus of the trend of the present societi and how the mind of an normal person work . first , the societi these day requir a wide rang of knowleg . that is becaus almost everi work done by peopl ha someth to do with other subject . except for some except such as research someth scientificali . for exampl peopl who learn onli about manag do not understand other affair that well even though those affair are essenti to busi such as law and other stuff like that . for an anoth exampl , when someon want to make a websit on the internet , he or she need lot of area of educ such as design , comput use , and some other thing . secondli , a person 's mind is n't appropri for do someth that is same over and over again . the person will think the subject as a bore subject after a bit of time flow . it 's like eat the same thing over and over again , and it wo n't be effici compar to studi some subject wide . think of studi math for four year and not anyth els . it will be real frustrat . but if she or he studi someth els when he get bore about studi the same subject , that will refresh him and let him studi math some other day with a replenish mind . in conclus , i think that it is better to have a wild field of knowledg rather than to concentr on one subject too much . that is becaus the world need it is better for studi effeci .
