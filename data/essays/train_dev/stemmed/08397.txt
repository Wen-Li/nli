i am of the view that the number of car which will be employ in tewnti year from now will be lesser than the amount present on our road today . global fuel price inflat ha reach an all time high . the price of transport fuel have becom exorbid . buy a car will no longer be a provid option . thi inflat will onli compound in the next twenti year and henc the idea of buy a car to the common man will no longer be an attract option . the environ is decay by the minut . peopl have begun to realiz thi threaten trend and are inclin toward a more environ friendli exist . car , with the pollut they eman do not help the environ at all . with grow awar , peopl will recogn th danger and abstain from buy car which are sourc of great air pollut . the world 's poplutaion ha increas rapidli and will continu to incres over the next twenti year . unfortun , the size of the earth will remain the same . thu , traffic congest will be a major problem and a hurdl in year to come . the onli prudent method to tackl thi problem will be to introduc effect public transport system . peopl will prefer to take the bu or the subway rather than have to wait for pain long period of time on the road while commut . thi will therefor lead to a dwindl in the number of car be purchas . the cost of raw materi need to contruct a car ha also risen alarmingli and will continu to do so in the next few decad . for exampl , metal price have soar and metal form an integr part of the car bodi . thi will lead to a hike in the car price . . manufactur will have to increas their price to accomod the high cost of raw materi . the high price of car will discourag common peopl from buy a car . thi is also one of the reason whi peopl will refrain from buy a costli commod . in view of all the abov reason and illustr , i feel that they will be fewer car be driven in twenti year from now .
