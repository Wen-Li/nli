in older time , there were complet civil that will see older age as the crown of life , the time when the spirit is free from the earthli passion and the brain is final let alon to think , as oppos as younger age when uncertanti and emot dictat peopl 's behaivor . in old greec onli old men would have an opinion in polit and law . in china and in some muslim countri onli the elder can solv day to day problem and their opinion would be respect even when oppos to common sens . someth happen to our cultur that invert the place of old peopl in our societi , place the young and brave on top while older peopl is seen as dumb and slow , to the point to pretend that they do n't enjoy life . there are a lot of activ that can be enjoy onli when peopl is young , like snowbord and play most sport . other thing requir a veri young age ( at least to start ) like ballet danc and gimnast , but the fact that older can not enjoy thi activ doe n't mean that they can not enjoy other activ , like travel , read , talk to friend , play chess ( and i can tell my grandmoth is a great chess player ) or visit the famili . there are still few sport that they can play regardless of their age like golf . therefor i disgre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus i think that there are mani way to enjoy life and it may not requir the adrenalin rush obtain by extrem sport nor the abil to danc in the disco all night . life enjoy can come from simpl ting like smell flower , fold paper , paint , chat and visit old friend and far away countri . i hope that when i grow old , i will still have the habil to love my wife and enjoy life with the mani activ that i will be abl to do , but i also understand that for other activ i have a limit amount of time and i hope to enjoy them as long as i can , becaus the day will come when i will need to stop if i dont want to get injur , and i will need to find new way to enjoy life
