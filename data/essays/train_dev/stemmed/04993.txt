busi mean of advertis is to show what you are not . so i complet agre with the fact that advertis tell speak ` bad ' product ` good ' . mostli advertis talk about the bad product . today advertis are everywher . turn on your idiot box , it will show you advertis mainli with certain gap which are call program . you turn on your pc , cross a busi road , or do whatev ; you can not get rid of an ad . now come the busi aspect . whi there is need of so mani advertis ? two word have the answer . ` purchas ' and ` profit ' . all advertis are the brainchild of some unsuccess product which the creator want to make it success . so whi one person need to advertis hi product ? to make it famou ? ye mayb but the most domin reason is to sell and to make profit . whi you need an ad if your product is so good ? i wit the same situat when i wa young . i love one chocol of a particular brand . i never saw it ' advertis in tv or in ani journal . now suddenli oneday i saw it ad which told me that it ha chang . joy i went to a shop , i bought one , onli to discov that price had increas and the cover pack becam more glossi . that the magic of an ad , when the product is right you dont need to advertis it . advertis are veri lucr becaus of it ` free ' offer . i have seen thousand gather in front of mall to get a free offer with a particular product . so what is the motiv of the free offer ? noth come for free . free is the word that is seen by all , we need to see some invis inform such as decres in qualiti in place of free . onc my mom bought veget oil after see a wonder new ad of the reduc price product . later she discov that the expiari date is alreadi over . in some case what an ad tell are complet lie . our favourit actor and actress dont bath with that particular soap which they advertis . these are just to promot sell . i mostli got worst product whenev i wa prompt by an advertis , so my suggest is ' do n't be fool by ani advertis ' .
