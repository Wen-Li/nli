sinc thi statement is not veri definit it is not easi to say if i agre or disagre . what i am say is that not all young peopl are the same . neither old peopl are . at first , i ask myself the question : who is young and who is old - how old is old , how old is young ? if you ask a teenag he will propabl tell you that everybodi over 25 is old and if you ask a 40 year old he will say that 60 is old . in the follow part of my answer i will thing of young peopl been up to 30 year and old peopl are all the person bee older than that . and there is still one big problem : not all peopl under 30 are the same , neither are the peopl over 30 . i think young peopl alway had fun . young peopl go parti , they enjoy `` sex , drung and rock'n roll '' , they travel the world , they play sport and enjoy their live . young peopl alway have done such thing . my gener did , my parent gener did , my gradpar gener did my kid will probalbl do too one day . it is differ with old peopl : in past day the peopl work a lot and onc they retir they die soon . they somethim went on vacat , but that wa it . today old peopl start to enjoy their life , too . sinc the popul get older and older there are so mani old peopl who can spent their remain time with nice thing . some move to a nice warm place in the south , some travel and do cruse , other start go to univers again . in today time peopl of all age have the chanc to enjoy their life . there are alway peopl who do n't know how to enjoy life , but that doe n't depent on their age . in the mainstream both , young and old peopl , enjoy there life . i can not say who doe more becaus they do it in a differ way .
