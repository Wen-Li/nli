i do not entir disagre with thi statement but i do disagre to some extent . in my opinion , success peopl do not just tri new thing and take risk but they also work on improv what they alreadi know . for ani person to be success they should build there success on experi . what i mean by experi is take time to make mistak and learn from them . thi also mean work hard in order not to repeat previou mistak . thi is where success is built on do what we alreadi know . on the other hand , it would not be veri smart to keep our same old inform as thi would not improv us in ani way . therefor we should take chanc , take risk - but within limit which we set for ourselv of cours - and learn to experi day by day . success can be recogn in mani aspect of life , and as time pass we could be success in mani differ area . i mean by that : success is not necessarili relat to each individu 's area of expertis . a person can be success educationali , as well as in there work field as they grow up and also in there person life . success in school is base on studi , comprehend and practic in order to achiev good result and ace test whenev we can . in school we could learn to be success for exampl by keep the same effici way of studi that we got use to in order to achiev our best . where risk are introduc could be by tri some new way of learn perhap suggest by a classmat or by take the chanc to learn a new languag or studi a subject which we do not guarante to like but whi not take the chanc to be success in somth new ? ! in conclus , one should alway learn to do their best in order to succeed whether or not that involv tri someth new .
