i agre with the statement , that success peopl tri new thing and take risk earlier than other peopl . in my opinion success peopl know what to do for a well do busi . they are more confindet becaus of there success . i think onli the develop of new way and new technolog can make you successful for a long time and that is what the they want to have . success for the rest of their live . they know that when they stay at there level , mayb the other will enforc them and then they fall down at a lower level . so the invent of new thing is also a defens mechan . i think , if you are success and you do the same work everyday than you get bor on what you are do . for good and success work you have to enjoy it and if it is bor you even can not enjoy it . anoth reason for take risk is that the peopl maybe will not loos there job when they are unsuccess . that give them the possibl to improv new procedur . propabl the fact of bee restless and of take risk is the key for bee success . and when you are succes it is easier to tri new thing . think about a person how sell newspap the hole day , if he tri new thing for sell more newspap , it can have a bad end for him . if hi plan fail than he might loos hi job and even that is the reason for him to not take the risk . all in all , i think the main reason for tri new thing is that the person who take the risk is much more self-convid like the other and self-convid make winner .
