i think is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject intead of special in one specif subject . for exampl let say that maria wa invit to dinner and unfortunali for her , she wa the onli youngest person on the tabl , so the other peopl would start talk about differ topic and time to time maria would hace to disscu with the other , but if maria onli ha the knowledg for one topic , that would be embars for maria becaus she would be not abl to answer or disscu with other peopl that had the knowledg that she doesnt have . current in our societi a lot of topic need to be discuss , anoth exampl would be refer to mathemat , we use mathemat all the time and daili in our life , but the word math not onli envolv one topic , also is relat to our daili life , when we go shoop we use math to buy thing and calcul the prize , or buy food . like i said math is not onli one topic but is also relat to everyth that sorround us . nevertheless , a lot of peopl think that if they studi for be a biologist , they are also studi the enviroment life and some topic relat to natur , anim and their behavior , also includ math becaus they not onli go to learn about the enviro but also they need to calcul the popul of anim , plant . inde , we can see the import of know more than one subject becaus is veri useful in our daili life , instead of special in one subject for those peopl that onli had the knowledg in one topic or subject their life would be not easi than the other that at least have a gener idea and they can discuss some of the topic that present in our daili life .
