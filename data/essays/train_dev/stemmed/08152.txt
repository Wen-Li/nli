`in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . ` i do n't agre with thi statement for mani reason . the first one is that there is an import car cultur in most of our societi today . the second one is the develop of new technolog which will have a big impact on the use of car . first , the car cultur is someth veri develop today . in mani societi , the car is the symbol of mani thing . for exampl , on the social aspect , it 's realli import to own a car . the more it 's big and expens , the more you show your high social statu . moreov , for teenag , the first car is veri import : you want to show everybodi that you know how to drive , that you have a car , ... in fact , you just want to show that you are becom an adult . anoth reason of thi car cultur is that take your car is realli easier than take ani other mean of transport . you can take it when you want and you do n't fear to be late . moreov , mani citi do n't have enough effect mean of transport such as buse or subway and you are oblig to take your car . the second reason whi i would never agre with thi statement is the develop of new technolog . first , new health technolog allow peopl to live better and later than befor . that 's a reason whi the popul is go to grow rapidli and own more car . moreov , some countri are also grow econom so that their popul will bewcom wealthier and will be abl to afford a car . anoth fact is that there is begin to have a lack in the petroleum resourc of the earth . howev , with the develop of new renew sourc of energi to make the car function , it will not lead to a decreas of the number of car . these are the reason whi i do n't think that there will be fewer car in twenti year than today . howev , i hope thi statement will becom true becaus the problem of the pollut ha to be taken serious . in the bottom line , i would say that , if we do n't find solut quickli to thi problem , thi statement will never be true and thi will veri harm for our planet .
