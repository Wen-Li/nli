young peopl and older peopl do not have the same point of view of the life . they can not enjoy the life in the same way . i do think that it is not a question of the age . in thi essay , i will tri to explain whi i believ that young peopl could enjoy life more than older peopl do and vice versa . first of all , i would like to say that you can not do a '' generalis '' . there are , in thi world , happi and sad . on the one hand , they are young peopl who live it up and young peopl who are veri sad and do not enjoy their live . on the other hand , there are old peopl who enjoy their live and other who do not . for exampl , my grand father , he ha work all hi life . he ha found a compani and he ha spent forti year to build thi compani . he never went on holyday with hi son and hi wife . he wa a kind of workalcohol . he start to enjoy hi life at sixti . now , he is veri happi . in thi rapidli chang world , money is relat to happi and unfortun all peopl do not have enough money to live . i realli do not think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus it depend on much more thing . there are money but also the health , the environ where you grow up , where you spend your childhood , your condit of life , your famili life , your job and social life and so on . person , it is for me incred to think that . even if you have 80 you can live it up and enjoy your life as young peopl do .
