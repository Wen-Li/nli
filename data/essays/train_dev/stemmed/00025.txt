i agre with the statement becaus most of the the subject you have to understnad idea and to learn fact but some you gust need to understand the idea of the subject . most of the student understand the idea and most the gust learn the fact for my popenion it 's better to understnad the idea t 's easyer and it 's more helpful . some subject need to be understood and some need to know the fact like math you need to understand the rule and know how to use it and in biolog you need to know to need to know the fact and then understand the way let 's say they way of peopl live . most of the peopl understand they way liek when you work you gust need to know the way of the work for a person who work as at a compani and he 's a programm he just need to do the programm got they compani like that you gust understand the way you should do it . there is alway they way that peopl use there way of know the thing for me it 's better to understand what you should do and not to learn the fact , let 's say i have a physic class i have understand the rule and i have to know how to use them but most import is that you use the way that is most easyer for you .
