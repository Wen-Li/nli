i love to travel . .. and in my opinion travel by yourself and by make your own plan one can enjoy better than travel in a group led by the guid . there are sever advantag of do so . .. first one can plan there trip for how mani day they want to depend on the time they have avail . second they can decid how much time they want to spend in each of the place . they can skip place they are interest to visit similarli they can spend more time in place of interest . moreov if i am travel by car i can enjoy the road side beauti of natur , i can stop and spend some time at the place i find attract on my way . there is noon to rush me . .. or my trip is not depend on other . certainli , if i want to leav a place in just few minut i can even do that . on the contrari , if you take a tour led by a guid i cant be my boss . .. i have to follow the tour schedul . which would be veri difficult for me as i am a veri independ person .
