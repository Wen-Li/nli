i feel that it is true that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do thing they alreadi know how to do well . if it were n't for peopl readi and eager to tri new thing , or way to do thing , they would never discov that there were better way to do them . some way may be time consum and a wast of energi , but success peopl find a way to bypass the wast , and get to their goal in a shorter , more effici way . imagin someon plod along the old path go around a mountain overtak someon who ha risk go over the mountain , or perhap even go through the mountain ! it seem highli unlik ! risk and new thing lead to better product and better outcom . if we had n't had peopl will to risk a new method of crop rais , or use of pesticid , we would n't have the increas quantiti of grain that we do today . their success in tri someth new ha led to an outcom benefici not onli to themselv , but to all of mankind . thi thirst for new way in success peopl ha result in the discoveri of new medicin , test tube babi , foray into space . it ha result in the creation of industri giant . a famou compani in india , relianc industri limit , ha it root in a tea stall . the late owner use to run a tea stall in a small town . due to hi vision and hi dare to dream big and tri a new way of refin petroleum to creat use by product , dhirubhai ambani ( the late owner of relianc ) wa exterm influenti and rich and famou by the time he pass awi two year earlier . it is becaus of hi veri will to do new thing that the compani is now one of the most formid in present time , so much so that it can toppl or rais the stock market by the way it move in the day 's trade . if it were n't for the dare of success peopl to be differ , to tri someth new , they would n't be where they are today . i hardli imagin that dhirubhai ambani would have been anyth but a tea stall owner if he had n't dare to tri hi hand at someth new .
