i do not agre that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than today , becaus in western societi there are a lot of resist to the decreas of car . first of all , the governmet and the car compani do not support technolog reserach on new mean of transport or on new type of car ( as electr cear or hydrogen car ) . although some scientif research announc that petrol will finish in fifti yer or less , the car compani continu to produc car and to sell them . besid , some govern are support by petrol compani and so they had to defend the interest of these compani . second , in a lot of develop countri the govern doe not implement the public transport servic , so everi person ha got one ore more car . third , the public opinion is not realli interest in environment problem . if peopl realli fought against car pollut , govern would have been oblig to develop other technolog . in conclus , i think that until petrol resourc are avali , the use of car will not decreas . onli when petrol compani realli finish to expolit all petrol , and that could last a centuri from now , other technolog will be introduc .
