from my point of view , i see that most of commerci make good more attract and better than realli are . and i found that from my experinc and from what i hear from my rel and friend . although advertis sometim are necessari , but still there are a lot od deceiv and mislead to custemor . also for me is wast time to see , hear and read advertis . from my own experi i saw an advertis in the tv about a medicin that will realiv the pain pf feet and it wa veri attract , so i call for it and after use it for a long time noth chang . and i hear a lot of stori from my friend and rel and the same thing happend occat to them in other stuff that they bought . i know it is sometim there are advantig from commerci , they will expos as to the new and develop technolog , materi and a lot of thing . but still i there are anoth way to know about these thing from other sourc like deped research and from the experi of other . i believ commerci wasr my time a lot for a lot of reason , it take time from me when view prgram on tv , like news , show , sport and almost in everi thing . and commercail also in radio , newspapa , magazin and everywher . all that a real wast in my time . so i am sure of the fact that advertis mask the fact of the product and make it much better than it is . i realiz they are not for me those commerci , it make profit for me , so i do n't agre with the abov statement .
