know and learn fact is import , but it is not everyth that is necessari to live a success life . the statement `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn facts. '' is absolutelli correct . what advantag do i have , if i can name all presid of the us , or if i know all distanc from the earth to the planet if i do not know how to use thi knowledg or where to refer it to . factual knowledg , in my opinion , is simpli useful in quiz show . on the other hand , if a student understand the idea and the concept of a problem , he or she is go to succeed . if the student understand the problem or the idea , he or she will be much more like to solv it . factual knowledg may onli underpin the action but it is not go to lead to a solut . an other aspect state the import of the understand of idea and concept , is the fact , that those student will rememb thing easier , becaus they are abl to refer it to a specif topic . they may also be abl to use thi earn knowledg on other thing and be abl to understand those thing faster . by understand idea and concept it will be much easier for them to rememb fact , without even point them out as fact . as an exampl , let 's have a closer look on two student take a histori test . one student ha simpli studi the fact , ha learnd the year and the event , but doe n't know how those event connect and refer to each other . it will be hard for thi student to answer a question that ask to summar or give an own opinion about their action . the other student on the other hand , focus more on the `` why-quest '' , such as whi did they do thi or whi did it end like thi . even if he doe not rememb the exact year , he will be abl do answer difficult question becaus he know how everyth is relat to each other . it will be easi for thi student to settl back in thi time and act accur . take everyth into account , i think that student who understand the idea and concept will rememb fact automat , becaus they are abl to refer them to someth they are familiar with . those student who simpli learn fact , are most like to forget them as soon as the test , etc. is over . and in my opinion , that is not the goal . the goal for each student should be to understand the idea and concept and rememb them as long as possibl .
