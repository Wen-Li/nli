will be in twenti year fewer car in use than there are today ? i think there are two side for thi statement . on the one hand there is the oil , oil is a limit fossil product whitch doe not excis endless and the result is the hugh oil price . in a few year can onli the rich peopl pay for ga and oil . the next point is the air pollut someday it will be so dirti that the peopl go back to the bike or drive by bu or train . the last point for the statement is the space . in big citi like tokyo or lo angel , new york etc. is it imposs to drive by car becaus you can not find a park space and you are alway in traffic jam and not veri fast . on the other hand there is the actual price war in the automobil industri that make it possibl for poorer peopl to buy a car becaus of the cheaper car . the next point i will mention is that the car becom cleaner they do not pollut the air like car 15 year ago and a few model are small enough for citi . so the air becom cleaner and the park space can be use more effici . but my last point against the statement is the grow world economi . countri like china or india becom richer and the peopl there wound the same life as the rest of the world . peopl in old industri countri have their own car but peopl in asia or india do not have their own car and if they earn the money they would like to buy a new car . the number of these new car buyer increas enorm . howev , my opinion is that in twenti year are a lot more car in use as today becaus onli china and india have nearli 2 billion peopl without a car and if onli 10 percent buy a car they will chang the number of car in use that much that i can not imagin it .
