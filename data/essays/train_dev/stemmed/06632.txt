base on my experi i disagre with the statement . from my point of view organ tour trip are more expens , they lack of flexibl in order to arrang unexpect activ , and they loos the emot of travel to a differ countri and discov the real life and cultur , two aspect you can not find out in the tourist schedul tour . i have travel twice with an organ tour guid . in both ocass the trip cost me much more than if i had organ it by myself . it is true that you can get veri good group discount , howev the hotel they take you are more expens than the one you can find by yourself for exampl in a guid book like ` lone planet ' , through internet or friend refer . the lack of flexibili in a tour guid is anoth reason that made me organ the trip by myself . organ the trip by yourself , you can custom your rout , visit onli those place you are realli interest in , without have to visit everi singl place the guid believ as interest . final and for me the most import reason , it is the discoveri of the countri 's cultur . normal , the tour guid trip follow a rout which take the tourist to the most tourist place in the countri , place plenti of foreign and few local peopl . travel alon , you can can decid to visit total unknown place for foreign where you can speak in a natur way with the local , learn how the realli live in a dailybasi . as i mention befor my experienc made me organ trip by myself instead of hire tour guid trip . my economi , the flexibl of custom my rout and my interest for other cultur made me choos these trip as the best way to seiz and enjoy a trip abroad
