it is import for the student to understand the idea and cocept and also to learn the fact about those idea . thi is becaus onli know the idea doe n't help them to understand the theori accur . the fact help them to get the live idea of the theori they studi . for exampl if we consid the lighten and the sound which will occur dure the time of rain give them the idea that the sound is heard befor that the light appear . thi is the idea that everi student know . but the fact behind it is that the sound travel faster than the light so it happen as such . so it is import for the student to know both the idea and fact of ani theori . just know the idea without the fact make it wast as they could n't appli ani where . as experi is the best teacher , the fact they come across in their day to day life even help them to understand some new idea that they learn in their class . if the student just understand the concept of the way of arrang all the part of an automobil in the mechan class and if he or she do n't know the fact base on that that is how to do it practic , it is not possibl for them to arrang it in the real life time . in all the way it is necessari for a student to know the idea and concept as well as to know the fact . as i am a student do a project now and as i see my friend who know onli the idea but not fact suffer becaus of their lack of knowledg base on it and i myself do the project and answer the question relat to my project without ani difficulti as i know the fact of the subject on which my project is base on . so i can say that if the student know both the idea and fact then onli he or she will come out with fli colour in their real life .
