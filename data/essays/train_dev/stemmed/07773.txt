i complet disagre with the statement as a lot of young peopl who are the next leader of the nation are not put in enough effort in to help their commun . life ha becom so fast in the twentyfirst centuri that peol are alway busi run around not understand what they want at the end of the day . they are so busi with there studi there career and there futhur and the day to day stress they forget the veri import of build a commun which would look after each other instead of place were there is a lot of crime , drug abus etc. which would intern effect there person life . young peopl these day are so self obssses that they dont have time to even think about there next famili member . they have a lot of time to go to movi or coffe place everyday and cant afford to take atleat an hour in a week to help their commun . thi can be chang as in my case were proper guidenc from the older gener and determin make a chang in the commun . with proper motiv from the older gener thi can be chang as wa the case in my commun when we in first move to the commun where i live now there wa no proper wast dispos , peopl would just trow there wast in front of their neighbour hous are on the road which intern affect them with fli and mosqutio . to over come thi problem we were advis by older peopl to come up with idea to solv the problem , thi led to sucusful chang in the wast , few of my freind and me join hand to collect fund in the coloni bought a larg bin that place at one corner of the coloni and everi hous had to dump there wast there and there would be the garbagg collector to dispos the wast . thi wa achevi due to the involv of youth from the commun . if it made by law that everi week a certin number hour are be spent do commun work by the youth i think the there would be a larger unders and respons would be develpov . thi is follow by the commun in stay everi month we donat fund to chariti organist like `` cri '' from screen of movi , organis event etc .
