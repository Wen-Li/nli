thi statement is true to everi singl word and at the same time equal convinc . i strongli agre that success peopl tri new thing , indulg in innov activ and are risk-tak . first and foremost , the proverb ' no risk no gain ' support thi idea . had our forefath not tri new thing and taken risk in their lifetim , we would not be sit on our sofa watch a big-screen tv , talk on the phone with someon from a differ contin , eat microwav food and get an automat massag to our feet . all these comfort at our dispos are result of the effort and risk peopl have taken to bring on chang . peopl who alway tri new thing and take risk are like to open the door to fresh idea , novel result , widen scope , broader perspect , new domain of think , and most importantli , a profound intellectu comprehens of what is around us and what can be done to make thi world a better place . such peopl are not onli success themselv but actual help the societi to be a role model . on the other hand , do what one know how to do well is almost like live in a confin area with limit scope and result . not that these peopl are not part of the societi and do not contribut to the well-b of the societi and becom success , but they lack fresh perspect and idea to anyth that is unexplor and unexploit , in term of it valu . a good exampl would be the invent of airplan . if the wright brother did not take the risk of fli , we would not have airplan today . therefor , i firmli believ that in order to be success and be abl to help the mankind , one must be readi to cross boundari , explor the unexplor and make thi world a better place .
