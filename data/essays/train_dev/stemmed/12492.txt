i agre with thi statement . i believ that in life peopl have to chang their normal habitat and go through differ chang in order to succeed . when peopl are accustom to see the same thing everi day and lack chang in their live , sooner or later they will develop a sens of insecur and may even get scare to the chang . i am not tri to say that peopl should make increas or sudden chang in their daili , basi of life , but instead , to be more endur and accept chang if it is possibl . for exampl , in the movi `` homeless to harvard '' , the protagonist , liz , wa born with a drug addict mother , and a father who doe not take respons of her . liz inli face neg aspect of life and doe not even go to school . for exampl , instead of her mother take care of her , liz is the one who take care of her mother while be a teenag and ha a lack of respons parent figur . after her mother die , liz is left lone and the onli thing that give her secur is her encyclopedia becaus is the onli key she had to learn , after never go to school . liz goe through a shock chang in her life that probabl no one would imagin becaus she get rid of that aw past and decid not to be like the familiar world she see , but get educ and go to school . after two year of studi , she enter harvard univers . liz goe through a chang in her life that bring her from complet unsucces to complet success . she is abl to complet her dream and what she want to do most in her life an would never have imagin . peopl who have neg feel among their live should use chang as a defens mechan . peopl should not dwell among their past or present , they should endur it and seek for possibl of a better life . take risk may be a huge factor and also difficult becaus peopl alway see a chang as someth insecur . thi is whi , as state befor , succes peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
