i agre to the statement that in twenti year tere will be fewer car in use than there are today . i can support my statement with few explain or reason and exampl . i strongli believ that peopl use car as their mean of journey instead of taain and buse . i believ that peopl would prefer for person , sophist and joy journey . all thi is possibl onli by have person car . let me explain with a reason reason . peopl work through out the day . dure weekend they feel to have ecstaci or euphoria to get relax from the enervatin job donr by them trough out the week . so they may spend their leisur time with their parent or friend . when it come to spend time with friend or sibl than they sure prefer to hav long ride or long journey . so the best way is to have a person car . becaus if an individu go for tain or bu as hio mean of travel than he or she ha to wait for the train or bu until it come and he or she can visit onli those place where the bu or train can go . he or she can not enjoy the pleasur that the natur give . but when an individu ha got a person car than he or she can go to ani beauti corner of the natur . there is one more advantag . whenev an individu get exhaust through hi journey than he can stop somewher and relax for a while and can visit ani mani restaur nearbi to have some stuff . is int advantag ? ofcours it is . we can have lot of privaci in our own person car . final one damn advantag by have a person car is we can reach our destini in time instead of wast time in wate . the destini may be anyth like offic or a parti etc . so if we are a bit cautiou in drive than person car are more advantag and i conclud that in the come year everybodi prefer car .
