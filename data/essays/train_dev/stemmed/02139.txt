the number of car in use rappres a complex variabl to studi . actual we can describ thi variabl like a constant expans as nowaday we can consid car as a statu symbol . most of the peopl use car everyday and for ani reason , such as go to work , to shop or to holyday . in my opinion now there is not a valid altern to chang thi way of life . public transport , like bu , metro is not effici as peopl requir : not all citi block can be easili reach without wast too much time , and vehicl are less comfort than own car . for these reason i think that number of car in use will continu to increas without a seriou and global transport polit . if i go arond i can see the highest percentag of car occupi from the driver onli , famil that have more car than person in hous , and on the other hand a bad plublic transport .
