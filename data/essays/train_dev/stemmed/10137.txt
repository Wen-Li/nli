i believ that both thsese point are import at certain level of studi . if a person is go through hi postgradu or phd studi . he should be more specif toward hi subject and intrerest . while dure undergradu studi , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . while studi in undergradu program , we should have knowledg of mani academ subject . it help us to immpli that knowledg in our special subject . i have complet my bpharm . in thi under graduat program i studi all the subject like pharmaceut analysi , pharmaceut , pharmacolog and biopharmaceut . now i am plan to do my master in pharmaceut subject . and these other subject will help me in ani instanc . becaus basic they all are relat with research . pharmaceut is relat with new drug research but pharmacolog deal with the effect of the drug on human bodi . so there is one kind of interdepand present between other subject and special subject . now if we think about master and phd program . it is neccesari to choos one specif subject . it is better to gain deep knowledg in specif subject if your aim is toward research and develop . without the depth knowledg of subject , it is not possibl to make our carrier in research . at thi level of studi we are given special train for work . if we take the exampl of doctor . the onli doctor and surgeon with the master degre in chemotherapi can cure the patient from cancer , which is not possibl for the gener practition . doctor with special in anesthesia in medic field ha decreas the death and and coma case , which use to occur due to improp introduct of anesthesia . if we take anoth exampl of proffesor . the proffesor in histori subject cant give knowledg about the mathem subject . so i believ that the both kind of knowledg is requir at differ level of studi . both have import at differ level of studi .
