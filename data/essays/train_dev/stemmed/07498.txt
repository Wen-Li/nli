each person would have differ point of view whether he or she agre or disagre travel in a group led by a tour guid , but in my point of view , i do not agre with that for thi statement . there are sever occat that the travel in a group led by a tour guid would have some problem . first of all , there is not enough time to spend individu for group travel . most of the tour guid dure the travel need to spend time with the group accord to the program that the tour guid suggest and consequ there will not have an opportun to do whatev the the tourist want . the tourist just have follow what the tour guid ha schedul . second of all , there will not be someth special dure the trip . the group led by a tour guid usual made a program in which the tourist have alreadi known and studi from the media or from the internet . of cours , it could be less danger to travel and spend time when the tourist are led by a tour guid , but it could be bore for the tourist who alreadi view from the media or the internet . consequ , there will not be someth fresh and new dure a group tour guid . travel in a group led by a tour guid could have differ point of view in each person and of cours it is true that it also have strengh , but in my point of view , i want to spend more time with myself and want to face someth special in which a tour guid have never face befor in order to have uniqu experi which could be unforgett for the rest of my life and that is the main reason that i prefer to choos individu travel rather than travel in a group led by a tour guid .
