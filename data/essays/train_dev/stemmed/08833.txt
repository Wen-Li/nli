i complet agre with the statement that it is more import for a student to understand the concept , the idea behind what he is read , than it is for him to learn fact . i state that on the basi of two reason : 1 ) understand the concept is the onli way a student , and a person in gener , ha to help hi mind not to forget . 2 ) it is impli that an idea , a concept , can be adapt to sever other situat . concern the first argument , there is no doubt that a lot of student today , mayb stress by the exam and by the fixat to obtain the best grade , tend to learn a subject even without understand it until the end , i mean , without go behind the word and the mere fact . it is not difficult to affirm that thi is not the best approach to the studi , becaus it gener lead to forget in a short period of time whatev that person have learn . on the contrari , accord to me , onli when a student manag to have clear , to catch the concept of the subject , of the differ argument , ha reach hi goal as a student and satisfi all the effort the teacher ha made . everyth that is well understand is unforgett , and it is confirm by my person experi , consid that i wa not a good student , in the sens i 'm support , until the begin of the secondari school . in fact , whatev i learn dure these year is still present and clear on my mind . understand the idea that is behind the mere fact ha also a second advantag : the concept can be easili adapt , and in thi sens we can say that it ha a wider `` field of valid '' . in fact , it result almost natur to think that a concept can be use even when the fact at it basi are complet chang . and thi is what all the student in theori should do : learn someth alreadi known , abstract the concept that it contain and adapt it to fact and evid that are still unknown !
