there ha been a on go debat whether it is better to studi a wide rang of academ subject . some peopl do not support the idea becaus they can not focu on one subject so they can not acquir deep inform . howev , from my perspect , it is better for peopl to have wide rang of knowledg in sever academ field becaus it will broaden their view to world and they can have a lot of experi that they can appli to other field . first of all , they can have wide perspect to the world we live in . thi will lead them to have more open mind in societi . especi when they are with other peopl , they can understand other peopl 's live better becaus they studi divers academ subjcet so that they know how differ opinion do each individu have . not onli can it help them to accept other peopl 's view better , but also it is benefici for them to have ration thought . they will not tend to be bias . addit , for exampl , if i studi scienc and histori at the same time , i can think logic concept and moral valu at the same time . thu , it allow me to get along with everybodi as i am well-ground on interact with other . moreov , by studi a varieti of academ subject , they can acquir numer experi which they can appli into other field . for exampl , if i onc had studi about comput and now i want to get a job in mathemat field . inde , my experi as to comput skill can be appli into math too . in order to collect data for survey , there will be a lot of comput work requir . as we can see , learn divers field can help peopl to get their knowledg onc and they can use these inform in sever form of their asset . although some peopl prefer to concentr their studi in specif field , i maintain that it will bring out more benefit to peopl to have wide knowledg of mani academ area . thi is becaus that it allow them to obtain wider view and they can have more experi which can be use in order to success in modern societi .
