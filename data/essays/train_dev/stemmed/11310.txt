over the year , use of car ha increas to an enorm extent . it is realli not difficult to find road jam pack with car . it would be interest to predict the usag of car in futur when the number of peopl requir them would have increas tremend . in my opinion , the number should definit go up . twenti year from now , world popul would have increas by atleast 15-20 percent of what it is today . the number of car user would also increas accordingli . it would thu be expect that the number of car also increas proportion . howev , there might be certain counter argument challeng thi simpl hypothesi . one would suggest that the advanc in aviat in come futur would promot use of air transport at the day to day level and would be use for move around even for veri short distanc . thi would tend to decreas the usag of car to a great extent as a lot of space ( in term of volum ) is realli unexploit in thi regard . i believ that the advanc in aviat would not counter the difficulti in air traffic manag that would eventu come up and so , air vehicl as move around mode of transport , are far fetch for twenti year from now . howev , thi might be a healthier argument for say fifti year in futur when system for air traffic manag could be devis . anoth contradictori opinion would be forc decreas in car usag as the traffic and capac to accomod car is near it threshold world over . i feel that way would be devis to counteract thi problem and some of them could be flood citi with flyover and subway ( citi administr ' initi ) or make smaller and more compact car ( car manufactur ' initi ) . anoth line of thought would be to suggest decreas in car usag as a consequ of increas pollut level . thi can be either forc by law or as an outcom of consciou awar of the problem among the user themselv . i feel that technolog advanc would make it possibl to have car oper by energi sourc other than the convent petroleum product , e.g. , car oper by solar batteri , wind energi and so on some of which are current at the experiement level . thu , it seem highli probabl that twenti year down the line , number of car use would be even greater than what they are today .
