i 'm not agre with thi sentenc for differ reason that emerg from my person experi . first af all , i see that my grand-par enjoy as well as me their person time becaus they do a lot of thing , they travel and they do some littl work . they are veri busi with the famili becaus they also care my littl young cousin . i could be agre with thi sentenc in a differ mean like the possibl for young peopl to do more like sport for exempl . mayb some old peopl do n't have envoy to do becaus they are also old in their mind . my grand-par are veri young in their way of think , in their soul . despit the pass of the year , they are alway the same and sometim i say to my grand-moth to be calm or quiet becaus she doe n't have twenti year and she ca n't do transport some heavier thing for exempl . it 's funni to describ that becaus i realiz that i 'm lucki to have them , a veri good exempl for my futur . of cours i think that other old peopl do n't want to do the same thing of when they were young becaus they are tire or they have some pain . it 's difficult to be old becaus you have to minim your activ and gener you do n't want . i think that all the `` epoch '' of the man 's life have someth interest to do , to accomplain . .. old peopl could for exempl go to a univers to obtain an educ that they ca n't acquir when they were young , for differ reason like to war or the poor condit of the famili . i have a cousin that go into a univers of the `` terza eta ' ( third age ) and he 's enthousiast of thi possibl . i suggest also to my grand-par to save their free time to organ beauti trip or travel around the world becaus they have work all the time in the past and in thi manner they can enjoy now their life better than they were young .
