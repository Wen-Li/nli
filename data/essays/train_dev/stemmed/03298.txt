success peopl do thing differ than a common man . '' i agre to thi `` maxim '' . i believ succes peoppl have the abil to do same thing differ and in differ way than a comman man can do or think of . in my opinion , do or tri new thing make a person more courag , activ and dynam . these are some of the thing that make some of them enterpreneur . entepreneur are the one who tri out differ thing , they donot like to be tie down by the convent norm of life , they are free spirit and gener follow what their heart say them to do . these peopl enjoy thier work better than a person who doe thing he know to do or is expect to do . for instanc , a clerk he doe not do anyth novel in hi day to day life , he mere come to offic everi morn , attend the custom , goe back home , collect hi paycheck at the end of the month and thu lead a dull , monot life . wherea a life of a research scinetist is differ , he tri differ way that can lead him to a solut , hi mind is more activ or the life of an entrepreneur or a busi man , who is thrive to satisfi hi basic need , hi thirst for innov . ofcours these peopl can mani time experi a lot of frustrat and up and down in their career . there may not be ani monetari stabil or the comfort that i m go to get a certian amount of money by the end of the month . thu , they can expect to have lot of fluctuat . but their basic nture , their soul alway search for novelti . these peopl also in their process of find good thing do a lot of god for the gener public as well . some of the exampl of peopl tri out new thing and take risk are scientist einstein , newton , van slyke etc. and mani other busi man like , dhirubhai ambani , bill gate . mr s. bhatia , the internet guy becaus of hi risk take abil and hi search for new thing , the world got introduc to the silicon valley . so mani time , the gener public reap the fruit sow by these risk taker in my opinion , it is import to tri out new thing in life , if you wish to have more creativ and nobil in life , that way one can keep onself from becom a laid back and a laggard . keep oneself amidst the modern technolog and tri out new thing as they are introduc in the market can help a lot . if one get stuck to the age old thing and technolog accord to me , one is not move with the world and is hinder one progress . i strongli believ , tri out new innov thing and take a littl bit of calcul risk would do no harm to a common man but would rather act as a step stone in hi progress thu , the key to success is to adopt or tri new thing and to take calcul risk inord to climb the ladder of success in one 's life .
