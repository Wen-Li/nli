i disagre with the topic . young peopl nowaday do give enough time to help their commun . even though the system is becom more and more mechan the help natur of the young is not degrad . they realli show up and help when the time come for do that . consid the exampl of katrina hurrican . the hurrican left mani peopl homeless and made mani children orphan . dure that time student and other young peopl through out the wourld gave the help hand . student have eshtablish mani camp around the victim area to help the poepl . mani peopl from foreign nation have also help their best by donat their pocket money . even though mani of the student are busi in their colleg schedul , they devot some time for social sevic . mani student from club in there collg for help the under privelag kid and other . thi i am state from my person experienc . i am a member of rotract club in colleg . me along with some other student have arrang a camp in colleg to encourag the under privelag kid . we went a orphanag and brought few kid to our colleg and gave them train in sketch , fabric paint , clay model etc . we have thi program onc in a semest and the member of the group work for two to three day on it . even the employ mani of compani do have a chariti trust to help the commun . these trust or most commanli call as ngo have a lot of young member . they are more activ and enthusiast when it come to some adventer job help the piligrim who visit templ which are veri difficult to reach , set up the first aid camp in such locat etc . the youth even though is get busi with their daili routin , they are give enough import amd time to help their commun . infact it is the youth which think less selfishli when it come to help . they alway want to show their enthusiasm in help other .
