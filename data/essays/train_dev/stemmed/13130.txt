the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' is an import point , which play a big role in societi , especi in educ . on the one hand you can agre with thi statement , becaus it is veri import to have a basic background of educ . you should know the basic fact in differ academ subject . thi way of think we can find in school . at school the pupil are eccept to be good in everi subject . the souhld be good at math , languag , biolog , chemistri and sport . so a pupil ha to concentr for everi subject to achiev good result after school . on the other hand critic peopl would ask : `` whi should a pupil , who is good and veri interest in math be also good and interestesd in sport ? '' thi would be the other way of think . some parent for exampl think that is enough when pupil are talent in certain subject , becaus after school they go to a univers , where they also concentr just on a special subject , which they choos to studi . i am of the opinion that a mix of two way is the best solut . i think , peopl and espacci children , should have a basic educ in erveri subject . it make no sens to send a child veri earli to a school , which is base on a special subject , like a scienc school for exampl or a sport school . pupil should learn the basic inform in poltic or in geographi and other import subject . i think it is a good way to send children firstli on a normal school and after graduat pupil have to decid on their own , where they want to go and wich univers mostli agre with their own interest . so the pupil would have a basic knowledg which you need in societi and after thi they can concentr on a special subject .
