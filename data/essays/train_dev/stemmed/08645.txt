korean parent , who ha tradit shown huge interst on childern 's educ , seem to be compet to send their chidren to most munber of privat academi . i should admit that childern should accumul a lot of knowleg to understand the world , or the lead a success life in the futer . howev , i believ that more emphasi should be put on understand the idea and concept . first of all , compuls of acquir lot of knowledg will make the student lose the interest on the subject they 're studi . when a student is forc to go to sever privit academi by hi mom 's wish like one of my student , she wo n't have chanc to consid what i want to know the most . as a matter of a fact , the student spent lot of time studi english , math and scienc but all she wish about the academi is to quit them . moreov , just gain more knowled beyond the student 's understand is not effici at all . for exampl , anoth student of the academi where i teach , should take 3 cours everi day . of cours , it is not by hi will but by hi mom 's wish . in spite of the amount of time he spend at the academi , he fail to show decent understand for ani of the class . becaus he take too much , he is have a hard time understand the lesson . undoubtedli , have a lot of knowledg is veri use and import . howev , i believ the studi process should follow the step need to be effici . student should have chanc to learn about what it is like . for that they should understand the field .
