i do agre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . the first reason is becaus you could know exactli what is your schedul about time and place . it is import becaus i could obtain , befor the trip , some inform which will help me dure my tour . for exampl , if a tour goe through a few museum , i could have inform relat to artist , paint and sculptur . it will help me to understand in a better way what thing i am discov and look at . furthermor i will have a foundat to ask some question for achiev a deep comprehens . anoth reason to take a tour is i could take advantag of the trip moment by moment . it permit me to know more new thing and citi into a short period of time . therefor i will not miss ani detail of a tour . besid to travel into a group led by a tour is more confort becaus i will not be worri of certain fact , as for exampl : book hotel , arrang travel ticket , look for the best transport way , contract , among other . the last reason , and mayb the most import for me , is that thi kind of trip allow me to meet other peopl with the same interest such as to discov new cultur , to admir beauti citi and countri , and to increas our gener knowledg about the world . furthermor i cou a tour guid ha a special prepar of sever subject and if we have a question , we will have alway hi support dure the trip . these are import reason to support whi i do not like travel by myself and how much i could enjoy a trip by share my time with other peopl without to be stress by certain thing which could be in the proffesion peopl 's hand .
