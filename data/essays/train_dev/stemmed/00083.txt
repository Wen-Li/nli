some peopl say that in order to be success you must `` tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what you alreadi know how to do well '' . personn , i do not agre with thi statement . i am go to give you two reason whi you should do onli what you alreadi know so as to be success . first let 's defin ` success ' . in my opinion , the ` success ' characterist should be given to someon who is good at what he 's do and even better than other . in thi context , we must admit that the onli reason for success is train . in fact , train lead to success . but what exactli is train ? actual train is all about do what you alreadi know over and over again . let 's take the exampl of sport . in everi sport , you spend the main part of your time train in order to be success at the next competit . therefor , thi is exactli the same idea in everyday 's life busi . anoth exampl is the success of fordism , back in it time . here , peopl were meant to perform the same task over and over again which lead to an improv in industri . firm which use fordism are now known to have been success . anoth idea of the statement is that if you want to be success , you must take risk . actual , thi is complet wrong and the reason is simpl : if you take no risk , you are less subject to failur . and know that failur are the exact opposit of success , you should take thi advic : if you want to succeed , never take risk . instead , you can let other take risk and watch their result . thi way , you will see if it is a safe and effici way to do the thing . final , success can be achiev use two moto : `` onli do what you alreadi know '' and `` never take ani risk '' . look at how sport champion prepar their competit : they train a lot whithout take ani risk . then you will succeed like a real champion .
