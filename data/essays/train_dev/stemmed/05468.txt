`` knowledg is ocean '' - is a popular say . thi knowledg is accquir by read mani book , watch variou news etc . and there are mani more way in which thi knowledg is accquir . i opin that have knowledg on one specalis subject is better than to have knowledg on the variou academ subject . it is becaus , it is our specalis subject in which we are much intrest and carri on our own research work in futur . if we arnt have a proper grip in the subject it is imposs to go further in our research . thu it is better to have complet grip over the subject . if we take our academ subject their may be mani and differ subject like mathemat , scienc , social , english etc . but if it is an specal it contain onli one subject in depth . for exampl : take if a person 's specal is english . it need lot of grammar , sentenc construct , tens and much more . if u need to carri on with the subject it is necessari to go into the depth of the subject where the knowledg on the other subject may dosent work . if the person is much intrest to carri out hi research work in hi own specal then it is necessari that he should have complet knwledg about it . even when we take mani item dure dinner doent fill our stomach , but one item which we like a lot make our belli full . instead of jo for differnt subject . it is better to have a quit good knowledg on one subject . have knowledg on differnt subject dosent go in vain , but have complet knowledg on one make you gain a , lot no matter what is your special . though how much knowledg we accuir in the subject it is drop in the ocean inst of make it uncomplet with have knowledg over differ subject it is better to make it a complet full drop with knowledg in one specal subject .
