i agre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i believ that the reason behind thi statement are the parent . the child will grow up depend on how the parent rais them . it is the parent respons to give their children the knowledg of the commun they live in and what they have to do in order to fit in their commun . i strongli believ that the young peopl nowaday are veri spoilt . they are not taught the valu of money . famili give them enorm amount of money and the freedom to spent it as they want . as everi young person they think that everyth in life is money . becaus of thi , young peopl have no moral left . they grow up learn how to spend money . parent do not give as much time as befor to their children . even the celebr of the holiday are not the same anymor . young one care about their moral much less than the older gener . for exampl , i live in istanbul , and accord to our religi holiday the whole famili , from youngest to the oldest , come togeth . if not the young one go to visit their elder . but , nowaday unfortun thi is not happen . younger gener do not care about these thing . they prefer be with their friend . life to them is about drink , drive the most expens car , go out with the pretiest girl or wear onli brand name . as a conclus , i blame the parent for thi situat . everi parent is respons for their own child and it is up to the parent how they brought up their child in to thi commun . young peopl either will be welcom by their commun or be reject .
