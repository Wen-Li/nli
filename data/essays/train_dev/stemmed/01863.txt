i agre that the , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , for sever reson . first , thi is the way of stude . if the student want to be seccess in their studi they must to understand the idea and concept first . for exampl , if the student ha a giugraphi class and the teacher gave hime or her the inform what he or she need . but they are idea , and they agnist the fact . then , the same studen ha an exam in the same class . and he or she face a qustion about the inform , which is the teacher gave him or her . then , he or she want to write the answer to that qustion and the answer wa an idea , which is agnist the fact . if the studen wrote the fact , he or she will miss the point , but he or fhe wrote the same onformationn , which is the profassor ha given her or him , he or she will get the point . therefor , thi is veri import . second , it be helpful for student on the futuer and incress the knowlg of them . how it is come ? learn the idea and the concept is lead to fact . for exampl , if the student learn the idea and the concept , then they knew there are fact about the same thing that will encorg them to find the fact . and if they kept in the same way , which is understand the idea and the concept , then they will have realli great knowlg and that will help them in the futur . therefor , the that will incress the student ' knowlg . in short , it is nice to learn fact too but i still agre that wa whi i agre that `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is fot them to learn fact . '' so , idea and concept then fact .
