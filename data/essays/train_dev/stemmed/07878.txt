i disagre with the statement that `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . there are so mani reason and exampl to support my opinion . it is each and everi one 's responsibilili to help their commun . young peopl have to spend some time to help their commun . in so mani commun there are so mani poeopl do not have minimum requir like food , cloth and shelter . youth peopl should take forestal to prevent the spread of thi to futur gener . my person experi is that i saw so mani peopl who are young in particip the social develop activ . even though youth is busi with their work they know that the nation 's develop depoend on the individu develop of all commun . gener young peopl inspir by their patriot and the social worker . for exampl in our citi i observ so mani poeopol who are tri improv the literaci and amelior the live of fetid slum area . realli i impress by them alot . so it is necessari to young peopl to help their commun . . then onli natiion 's develop will occur . nowaday life becam veri busi . but it should not affect our particip in help our commun . we have to share our time for all the thing . young peopl are spend their time improv the way of life of poor and they also increas their time to involv in social developo . final i conclud that it is necessari to give enough time to help their commun .
