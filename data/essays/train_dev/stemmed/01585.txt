i think that the over the time period the number of car be use today will sure declin . thi is becaus of the increas concern over pollut , shrink fossil fuel base , avail of better way to commut , cultur shift in depend or associ with car and increas traffic . all these factor are now evid to anyon who use or see car everyday . pollut ha emerg to be a major concern over the period of time , and now , in comparison to older time when car were consid to be a symbol of freedom , peopl have start to see them as major caus of pollut . air pollut is done becaus of the usag of the common fuel , gasolin , even though we have modifi the structur of gasolin to do less harm , e.g. high octan fuel , and have even equip the car with better technolog , multipl stroke engin etc , still the safeti limit are be press to edg , and we have experienc the damag . e.g. deplet of protect ozon layer and increas respiratori diseas among urban popul . next , the crude oil sourc use to suppli fuel for car have been contin decreas and have reach at such an alarm low level that scientist have caution to start look for altern fuel , which are either not that effici or are not econom as viabl as gasolin . also , over the period of time , peopl have devic better way to commut like bullet train , peopl in japan commut almost 500km each day to work , which wa not possibl with car . also , in other major citi altern mean of transport such as metro rail and high capac buse are experi and are well reciev by peopl . moreov , these day we are move away from the need that gave rise to thi effect mean of commut such as go to work , compani are experi better way like work from home option which do n't requir employe to come to offic , anoth exampl is reach out to facil such as convini store , now you can have everyth deliv to your home on one phone call . thi will eventu wash away the need of car . increas traffic and it effect like accid are bother peopl so much these day . they are more conceren about the time lost in the traffic and their safeti , after all who will want an everyday commut to offic or school to becom an adventur ride . so to summar , with the increas awar and decreas in the caus that lead to the use of thi mean of transport , coupl with environment and health factor the car will eventu becom an old mean of commut .
