as we finish high school , we start have an idea about what path we would like to take for the rest of our life , so as we begin to attend colleg we have a , more or less , detail idea of what it will be our field of studi for the follow year . i person disagre with the statement , becaus i believ that we need to special in a particular field . what i mean is that , as soon as we have a clear idea of what our major is , there are sever reason to special in one subject . for exampl class from our major make us more competit in our field , becaus we gain knowledg on what it will be our futur work environ , and at the same time it will make us more prepar to face problem dure our career . at the same time in a constantli chang world , the more our knowledg goe deep in a field , the more we will fit higer level job posit , or the more competit we will be in the applic for graduat school . i am a materi scienc and engin major student . what distinguish myself from the other student of my major are the elect class that i took on specif topic , regard nano-materi . take high grade in thi class enhac my curriculum and make me more elig for scholarship for the next year . at the same time a compani interest on develop a nano-materi technolog would be more will to assum me than anoth materi scienc and eng . student with anoth kind of background . at the same time from a non-scientif point of view , i have to say that i lack prepar on human knowledg , and i do not feel confort when other friend of mine speak about art , histori or literatur , and if i could i would go back at colleg to take a coupl elect class from histori of art major .
