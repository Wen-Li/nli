be committet to your commun can have variou form . it start from help your famili in it daili chore , take care of the neighbour ' hous while they are away or spend some time in chariti organis . at the core of all the abov is the recognit that we are not just individu , but part of a commun . there is also the sens of gratitud for one 's gift in life , such as youth , health or ani skill , and the sens of enrich that come from share those gift and make them use to other . overal i agre with the idea that young peopl do not seem focus enough on the need of their commun , and i actual think that they are fairli detach from the concept of commun altogeht . i think thi is a veri complex phenomenon and link to a great number of reason . first of all , it seem that our societi and cultur put a high valu on time , especi spare time . partli becaus modern life is veri demand , partli becaus the offer of entertain and outdoor stimul is so vari , we prais our time as a suprem luxuri and feel veri frustrat when we can not use it in complet frredom . secondli , i think western societi have develop more and more in a hedonist direct . in other word , we feel it is our own right to enjoy ourselv , feel free in our choic and simpli follow instant gratif . i think thi is particularli appar in young peopl , as they claim they right to play and have fun , and resent ani request of help or support as a form of injustic . in a domin cultur of self-absorpt and pleasur , take the time to commun with peopl that are differ , for background and frame of mind , seem unjustifi and thi lead to anoth worri trend . it seem to me that there is a gener detach between young peopl and older gener or peopl in need . these are gener the peopl that need more time and support within the commun , and it would be the duti of the younger gener to look after them . in conclus , i think that valu that have becom more and more present in our societi are now central in young peopl 's vision of life . as a consequ , there seem to be a more selfish concept of one 's use of time and gift , that unfortun lead to the neglect of part of teh commun that might be in need .
