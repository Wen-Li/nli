one of the most import thing in humann life is to have a hope or a goal that he achiv to do . no one can live without a dream . but the dream of peopl are differ from one to anoth . some peopl all there dream are to have a person benefit while other peopl - who love their land befor theirselv - alway want to do anith to benifit the human . well i thing that everi one must to have a dream to benifit the human for sever reason . the fir reason for me to say that there is n't ani person who can live without the modern life advantag . noon can live without a tv , a comput , cold water etc . imagin that the famou scintest adeson-who invent the electr light - ha said that `` i do n't want to invevt anyth , all my hope is to relax and rest '' . if such a convers had happend so you would find the earth now dark with no light . so thi great scientest sacrific hi time to do somth to hi commun , and therfor you hear hi name in everi where . the second reason i think is that , you everi day take from earth and from sociti . thu , you must pay back those thing by think about other peopl and think about the futur of earth and tri your best to improv it . finali , and for the reason i list abov , i think it is veri clear that everi boday must think about hi commun and do hi best to give him everi thing that you have to mark your name in the book of earth histori , and to pay back a small part of the huge thing that the earth ha given you .
