i disagre with the statement , accord to which there will be fewer car in use in twenti year . it is true that the use of car increas the problem of pollut , especi in big citi , where live thousand of peopl . in thi citi often peopl have traffic problem . you are not abl to go becaus of the excess of circul car . and when you reach the place you were go to , it is alway hard to find park . anoth thing is the rais of the cost of oil . some scientist say that oil on earth is go to finish . but it 's also true that car produc spend a lot of money in order to find new fuel , less expens and cheaper . then i think that mani peopl consid car the most comfort way to move from one place to anoth , and they wo n't adapt themself by take the bu or the train , even if it would be cheaper . anoth thing is that train , buse and airplan doe n't cover all the goal that a person might have , and have precis time , which they have to respect . with the car you can go where you want and when you want , and for thi reason mani peopl prefer take the car , like i do . then there are also the emerg countri , like china . car sold in thi countri ha increas also by two-thre hundr per cent , becaus of the industri . i think that twenti year is too littl to see a decreas in the use of car . mayb it will happen , but it will take much more time than twenti year , also becaus of the interest of big industri , which influenc most of the decis taken by each govern .
