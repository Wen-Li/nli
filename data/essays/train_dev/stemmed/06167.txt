i think that both life are so much differ from each other . young peopl live in a completli differ world . and the idea of `` enjoy life '' that old peopl have , most of the time is not even close to what young peopl consid `` enjoy life '' all depend on what is your own idea of live the life , for some poepl no matter young or old , the idea of `` enjoy the life '' can be parti all the time , on the other hand for other peopl it can be , rais a famili . the differ between a young person and an old person are so big . those two differ group have differ style of live ; and even in those group there are mani differ sub-group . these differ are base on what you believ or think . sometim the deffer between a young guy and an old person might be few . let 's just say that the life of a young person goe around hi colleg , hi friend , parti , and basicli do what they do , they would n't be abl to do no longer when they grow up . and in my opinion the old peopl 's life goe around have peac , and most of the time around famili . we all know there are young and old peopl who do not enjoy their life at all , they have a pretti much bore life . we all know that young peopl are alway get in troubl , they are alway have issu and complain about evertyth . but now if we just stop a moment and think for a second , what move old peopl 's life in my opinion is young peopl 's life . just like cop , in most part of their job they have to deal with teenag . and who is alway there to get us out of troubl ? ye , old peopl . as a conclut i can , say that both young and old poepl can enjoy their life . as a young guy , my idea of enjoy the life is : studi , parti , and basicli hang out with friend . but also i know old peopl who share my idea of enjoy the life . i ju trutli believ that my time to enjoy the life in some way is now , after thi will come a differ style to enjoy my life .
