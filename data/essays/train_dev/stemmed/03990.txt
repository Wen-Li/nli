i whole heartedli disagre with the statement that younger peopl enjoy more than older peopl . enjoy is a feel which is felt by peopl in all age group . there are certain time when each age group enjoy more than the other , all depend upon the problem face by the age group which are differ in magnitud and time of occur . both younger as well as older peopl have problem to face in life . each age group 's enjoy is curb becaus of these problem , but the enjoy is never far away . let take the exampl of a young boy . he doe not enjoy when he ha to give exam , studi , or go to school . howev , he enjoy when he goe to play , or when he watch televis . in the same way an adult ( middl age ) doe not enjoy go to work , or work around hi or her hosehold . but they do enjoy when they come back from work , when they are on a holiday , or when they go to a parti . in case of old peopl as well , they enjoy as they do not have much work to do and live comfort on their pension fund . but they face problem regard their health . so thi way everi age group ha it own share of enjoy and problem . we can not draw a fine line compar who enjoy more or less as there are variou factor such as time and societi which decid that . along with thi there is also the fact that one 's enjoy can be anoth 's problem . in case of children , they enjoy play more and studi less . the adult ( parent ) have problem with that , which curb their enjoy to see their child studi . when the child is forc made of studi , then the parent enjoy becom the child 's problem . in case of old peopl , their enjoy is that they do not need to work . but thi is a problem for the adult ( middl age ) as they becom a burden on them . due to thi the old peopl are sent to shelter home where it is a problem for them , but enjoy for the adult . thi way everyon 's enjoy is interlink , becaus of which we can not state who constantli enjoy more and who constantli enjoy less . therefor , use these two reason , i support my stand that it is a fals statement that young peopl enjoy more than old peopl .
