i strongli believ that for student understand idea and concept is much more import than it is for them to learn fact . unfortun , student are often forc to studi mani fact and event that they will forget in a short time and wo n't be use for their futur career . on the other side , when they understand the main concept and the basi of a phenomenom they 'll like rememb it for a long time . in my opinion the goal of an effect school system is not not fill in the mind of student with mani insignific tini detail , but to teach them how to develop their own think and how to deal with difficult situat . thi is what i 've learn from my person experi : when i went to secondari school , i had two differ art professor ; the first one want us to know when and where a paint wa made and the tecniqu use by the painter . i wa n't interest at all in thi kind of inform and as a result i didn ' put a lot of effort in studi that subject and now , after a few year i do n't rememb ani of the painter that i studi with that teacher . the second teacher wa complet differ ; she use to put a lot of emphasi not onli on the singl paint ; but especi on the idea and the feel of the author ; she want us to learn not the detail but the most importantn characterist of each artist movement . i wa realli fascin by the method of teach of the new professor and i think it wa also effect becaus now i can still rememb what i studi with her . therfor , from both my believ and my person experi , i can say that it is more import for student to untderstand idea rather than learn fact .
