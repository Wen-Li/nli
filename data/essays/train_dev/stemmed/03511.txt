i think that there is a differ between how young and old peopl express the way they enjoy life . not everyon express thi kind of emot by accompani it with the stereotyp connot of `` enjoy life '' such as carefre day , endless laugh and no respons . for thi reason i do not agre with the statement that younger peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . as a matter of fact , i think older peopl can develop subtler , more refin and , whi not , more preciou way of appreci life . young peopl , most of the time , are bound to a definit of fun that is impos by the media , which involv concert , all-night parti , strenuou lifestyl and the idea that `` someon , somewher , is have more fun than i am '' . thi make most young peopl feel compel to do more and more in order to show other that they are enjoy themselv rather then actual cherish their experi . older peopl learn in time that enjoy life can be associ with more relax and `` tailor '' activ , such as hobbi or brief holiday . i think that it might be even easier for some older peopl to enjoy life firstli becaus they can count on more financi stabil and secondli becaus they have a lot less time to dedic to themselv , which make thi time a lot more valuabl . hobbi are activit peopl cultiv over long period of time , and the passion with which they nurtur them is a veri good exampl of how much a person can enjoy him or herself . i consid holiday as anoth good exampl . when young peopl go on holiday , they tend to lead a lifestyl veri similar to that that await them at home - if not more stress ; go out everi night , stay up veri late , `` tri a bit of everyth '' . older peopl have less time to travel but more money to spend on their trip , which enabl them to choos destin and vacat type that will make them get the most out of that limit time and , at the end of the day , `` enjoy life '' more .
