although young peopl tend to have more phisic advantag to enjoy life than older peopl , i disagre with the idea that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl becaus of the follow reason . first , older peopl have more free time becaus they are retir . on the other hand , young peopl are busi in go to school , do assign , and work to support their life . for exampl , now i am attend at a law school and i spend most of my timer for prepar claas . also , i do some part time job becaus i need money to social . howev , my parent are retir and they spend most of their time to go to travel , plan for trip , and so on . second , older peopl tend to have enough budget to enjoy their life . for exampl , my parent love travel and they went to peru and west europ last year . i also like travel abrod , but i do not have enough money , so i end up travel domesticli by rent a car and stay motel . third , older peopl are more like to have concret object regard what they want to do in free time becaus there were mani thing they could not do when they were work as a result of insuffici time . for exampl , my father 's dream wa to visit peru which he could achiev becaus he wa unabl to get enough long vacat to go to abroad . it is true that young peopl are more healti and some older peopl can not do what they want becaus they can not move . there are , howev , mani oder peopl who are organ poem club or read club and enjoy their life regardless of their immov . in conclus , older peopl are enjoy their life much more than youg peopl becaus they have more free time , more financi resourc , and have stroger desir to do someth they could not do when they were young .
