i think that learn is an everyday process that is determin by peopl 's attitud , interest and experi . for thi reason i think that a student can increas hi knowledg throught differ studi method . i think that it is veri import for student to have a gener knowledg of as mani topic and possibl . analyz gener topic present under the form of concept and idea , it could be a good way to learn new thing without have to studi everi detail of that particular topic . thi is the case of subject relat to the human . it is not necessari to learn to exact year in which a particular theori ha been develop . simpli know the period and the concept of a particular theori , it can be use in everi field . when studi it is necessari to consid the topic analyz . in fact there are mani subject that can be explain by professor use main idea and concept . there is no need to go deeper explor all the caus and effect . in some cours the professor onli requir a gener knowledg of a particular topic . on the other hand there are subject where learn fact is essenti . some exampl can be histor event . learn the fact is determin in order to increas the knowledg on the topic . scientif disciplin are anoth exampl that underlin the import of learn fact , more that gener concept . think that when a scientist doe an experi he realli need to know about fact . to conclud , i think that everi subject need to be treat differ , becaus i do not think that there is a geren rule that determin if it is more import for student to learn from gener idea , than from fact .
