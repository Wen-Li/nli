i agre with the statement . in korea , all the highschool student work on onli studi . also their parent forc to them studi . as a result , all the student lose time to help their commun . they do not even help their famili . most of korean live in apart . onc upon a time , everyon knew all the member in their town , and there wa not someon who do not know in their town , becaus they alway care about their neighborhood . howev the apart do not give ani chanc to meet their neighborhood . one more , the job are get more proffesion . everyon engag in differ part of job . so they do not have chanc to think about their neighrhood and commun . so the reason i think are studi , apart and proffesion of job . first of all , the studi cultur made student do not help their commun . in highschool , all the student compet eachoth so badli , they do not have anytim to think their commun . they will have to go to academi after school , and they will be so tire . after the academi , they will fall asleep right after arriv at home . thi cultur make thi societi like that . second , live in apart is one of the reason . apart is a seper place . all the peopl do not care about their neighbor and do not know who are their neighrborhood . the apart are get so big , and they will not rememb who are the neighborshood . then no one will help each other , becaus they do not know each other . thi is big problem of apart . third , i think proffesion of job is the biggest reason . origin , peopl engag on same work in korea . everyon grow crop . the agricultur wa develop in korea , so they alway help eachoth . howev , these day , everyon ha differ job . so they will help onli peopl who are in their compani . neighborhood will not have ani chanc to meet each other . help commun is realli import to live thi societi . if we need help , no one will help us . we need to help each other and make good realationship with all the peopl in our commun and societi .
