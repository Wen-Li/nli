travel in a group led by a tour guid can have disadvanntag and advantag . i prefer travel without a tour guid or even without a group . what i like about travel alon is that you can make everi decis veri spontani . you can choos where to go next and what to visit each day depand on the weather , your mood or your financ . in comparison to travel with a tour guid , which contain a veri rigid schedul without ani leeway , travel alon is prefer if the target of your trip is pleasur more than obtain as much inform and fact as possibl . a differ perspecitv is travel with a tour guid provid you with detail inform about cultur and histori that onli expert can deliv . and you do not have to invest as much time to plan out your whole trip . the trip ha alreadi beplan by the tour guid . thi can ceas in a deeper insight with less effort . on the other hand travel independ could open opportun that tour guid can not offer . for exampl , two summer ago i travel to spain fore two week . in those two week i learn more about cultuer than everi expert could have brought to me . i got to know a local girl my age and we becam good friend . she invit me to her famili hous for dinner and even to a wed of her sister . i gain a deep understand of the intrins cultur differ as well as differ in everi day life . a neagtiv point of travel independ is that it involv more effort . i you want for exampl not to stay in one specif town , it need a lot of encourag and knowledg to find out bu schedul and upcom fee . and at the end the trip might not even be worth it sinc you do not know what to expect and where to go .
