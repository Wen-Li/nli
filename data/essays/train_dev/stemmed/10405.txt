i definit think that is veri good and essenti for an individu to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . by know about mani subject one is more comfart in interact with all kind of peopl becaus it will not be difficult to have a healthi convers as we will not be total unawar of what the other person is talk to us about . anoth import reason whi we should have knowledg about differ subject is that we never know what bad phase in life we might go through . to be abl to stay put in all situat and to be abl to work our way through all difficult time we should have at least the bare minim knowledg requir in everi field . thi broaden our horizon to work and not be strand in variou situat in life . if we have onli specif knowledg about one field it is not alway necessari that we may have enough luck in our fate to make it big in that field . to keep that door of opportun open for us at all time we should have knowledg about a varieti of thing in life . let take the exampl of a simpl clerk who ha been use to enter data into a regist manual all hi life . with the develop of scienc and technolog there will come a time in hi profession life where hi compani might instal comput to manag the data . the clerk would now be requir to work on thi new marvel invent . if the clerk had alway been satisfi throughout hi life with hi manual labour and would not have updat himself in thi new technolog he would have been blank as the the knowledg of comput and thi would in turn lead to him lose hi job where someon who is comput savvi might get the job ; but have been updat with happen in differ field the clerk would find it simpl to navig throught the system in turn make hi work easier for himself . thi wa a veri small but ver effect exampl as to whi we should be in touch with thing that are goin on around us . as they say ` littl knowledg mayb danger ' . keep thi in mind i firmli believ and state that it would be in our best interest if we knew more thing about other field as well rather than just known everyth about one .
