the statement given to me is `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' i complet disagre with the statement becaus without learn fact it mere wast on spend time on idea and concept . learn fact help us to grow knowldeg and to know what is right and what is wrong . .. fact is a power word use in thi societi . without know the fact we can not know or we can not take a step forward to start anyth new until and unless we r told about that fact . it bulid the curios of an induvidu . for exampl recent we see that sunitha rao an astronomist went into space and she is resid over there for 6 month to know all the so call fact over there in the space . .. she state that she ha seen the planet earth from the space as that of a small star . .. as such student they should know the fact about everyth around themslev . .. if a fact is known then we can understand the idea behind it bring out all the concept in that particular fact . .. they help us in bring out the univers truth into light . they help us in bulid up our knowledg and our skill too . we get interest to invad most of the fact hidden in particular thing in which a fact is there . .. come to the part of idea and concept of understand as im aganist to it . they help in just bring out the idea or concept behind that . .. that all . but know the fact is veri essenti . last but not the least fact play a veri impor role in one induvidu life and curios is increas for a know the fact . ..
