i do agre that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . infact it is a art that ha develop with new era and new technolog . it is a mean of atrract their costum to buy their product . advertis industri ha grown for decad and still grow today . with the invent of comput grafic ani product in the market can be made veri beauti and irresist . the advertis is eye catch and it get regist into your mind . so when you go to the market , even if the product is not use , you end up buy it onli becaus the beauti side of the product ha been inculc into your mind . let take an exampl of a perfum . in the advertis the perfum bottl wa in a shape of a ladi and it wa be use by jenif aniston . t hat had registerd into my mind and i wa want tho buy the perfum for a long time . one fine day i final got a canc to go buy it . the price of the perfum wa unbeliev , it wa so expens . but i want it at the imag of jenif hold the bottl just di n't go out of my mind , and guess what ? i final end up buy it . even today i regret to the purchas that i made that day as till today the perfum bottl is onli half use as i no more like it smell . but that wa a lesson for me , and today i keep control on myself and donat get wave away by such fantasi creat by the advertis . i realiz that i am not the onli one , there are million of peopl who ha had thi kind of experi . but the key thing to ask is , do these peopl realis how they are trap by the advertis industri . i guess there would n't even be 1 % of the entir crowd who understand thi strategi use by the advertis agenc . thi is one of the major reason for the fast growth of the advertis compani . but ` ye ' i do agre to the fact that the advertis agenc are do a veri good job and ha a great effect on peopl 's mind .
