it depend , i think that some old peopl enjoy life more than young peopl becaus they are matur to know what they realli have in their life , they have live mani thing , they have manag mani thing . some old peopl want to enjoy their life more than when they were young becaus they have all the time for , children have left and they do not work again so they have the possibl to travel where they want they can go all around the world whithout think about the other , they can live for themselv . i know a woman who is 70 year old and who like everi sport with sensat like she said to me , she like go in contri to fli in a small plane and she like take her moto in the forest , she would like particip at a moto competit in the desert but her doctor forbid her to do that but i think that she will do that when she could . thi woman is a real phenomenon , i love her veri much as my grand mother . she is veri amas . so old peopl can be veri unpredict , they have mani resourc in them when they realli want . i think that if she wa young again , and whith a awar , she will be a great volcan and we can not stop her . and on the other hand , some young peopl can think that they enjoy life more than old peopl becaus they have enough time for life becaus they are also young , they have strength to practic everi sport , they can go everi where becaus they do not have respons yet , they have the beauti of skin like old peopl are too old they can not practic everi sport so i think that young peopl are too young to pretend enjoy their life more than old peopl but it can be possibl for some old peopl who have never have fun in their life like peopl who have never moov out of their citi and who do not like young peopl who have fun .
