knowledg `` it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . '' i agre on thi statment becaus knoeledg save alot of peopl from a lot of danger thing . `` a littl knowledg is danger . '' i have faith in thi say let take the medicin such as pain killer as an exampl . peopl with a littl knowledg mite think that take more pain killer will help kill the pain faster , in the other hand well educ peopl will rializ that take over dose of pill will have a lot of side affect on the person who take these pill , that whi a person must have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . thi doe n't mean that the person must be well educ in everi thing becaus the say say : `` a man of all trade is master of none . '' it 's hard to know each detail of everi thing in life becaus thi will rouin your focu at the import thing in each subject in life . my advic to everi one is to tri to educ your self in everi thing and thi doe n't mean to go through detail in everi thing . but each person must have a specip subject to know everi thing about , and tri to gain inform from differ peopl you meet in your life with differ educ becaus : `` christma come but onc a year .
