i alway tri new thing in my life and i risk , becaus i do n't know if i will do these thing veri well . in fact i have n't alway success in the new thing that i tri to do . but i agre with the statement that say that success peopl tri new thing and risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well and i have some reason to sustain thi statement . first of all , i think that if you do n't tri or do n't risk , you 'll never know if you will be good to do a thing or if you will be happi to tryi thi thing . for exampl , last month a friend ask me `` whi do n't you tri to sing in my music band ? '' . i though that mayb i had not the abil and the experi of sing and becom as a leader in a music band , but he said me `` in my opinion , you must tri or you 'll never know ! '' . so i trust him and i decid to tri . now i 'm veri glad of thi decis becaus i love sing and also if mayb i 'm not a veri good singer i enjoy myself ! thi is absolut import . anoth exampl i can bring is about my sister . she 's veri insicur and she ha n't much self-confid . she like read poem , but she did n't want to tri to write one ! so my mother said her that she would be a good poet if onli she want to tri . now the poem of my sister are the best i ever heard . in conclus i think that tri to do a new thing is never a bad idea . in fact if also you will not have success you mayb will be happi !
