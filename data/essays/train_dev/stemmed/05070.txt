i agre with the fact that most of the advertis that we see on televis , on magazin , on the news paper and on the radio make the produt that they are tri to sell so much better than they realli are . first of all becaus they know exacli what would attract the men , the women , the teenag and the kid . they would adapt ani product for the client by tell them what they want to hear . it 's like a brain wash . we are all in thi centuri , in thi bubl were there are icon and thing we do just becaus everyon doe . we just all follow . the worst is when on the televis or the magazin they use model for the public just to attract the most they can . and as a matter of fact peopl actual fall in thi complet , of cours they will rather buy a orang top that they saw on a celebreti than a radom top bought in the supermarket . it 's noth we can do about thi right now becaus we are in the middl of it , i 'm myself influenc by the trend and everyth . i admit it . but there is a limit to thi becaus soon or later we wont be think ourselv , the peopl that decid and rule all of the trend , public will control us , will set up what we think is nice or good etc . .. hope we are go to stop look up at the advertis and choos from ourselv within we like someth or not and not to be influenc . i 'm not drastic about thi i just get a bit mad when i start to think about all of that becaus the product with the best advertis are much more expens nad there is a lot of kid that ca n't follow up with the trend and that will anyth to .
