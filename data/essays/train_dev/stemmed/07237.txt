some peopl think that to learn fact is more import than to understand idea and concept becaus fact make student easi to decid someth to do . but person , i think that there are a lot of factor when student decid someth to do therefor , i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first of all , it is sometim difficult for univers student to enter a certain compani . for exampl , i work at ntt , the biggest telecommun compani in japan . when i wa a univers student , ntt wa a top rank compani in japan and veri difficult to enter . mani friend of mine gave up tri to enter that compani onli becaus of the difficulti . if i just care about the fact that the compani is veri difficult to enter , i might not tri to enter that compani . but i had a huge dream that i want to chang the world by use the internet , and at that time ntt wa the most power it compani in japan . i just believ my idea and enter the compani . thi exampl clearli show that idea is more import than fact . second of all , it is hard to get a scholarship . for instanc , i got a scholarship in my high school day . my high school wa veri famou and one of the highest level in my region . when i decid to challeng to get a scholarship , all teacher in my junior high school told me it wa imposs . howev , i never gave up my concept that i got a scholarship and made my parent less burden . if i follow the fact that it wa hard to get a scholarship , i never got a scholarship from my high school . thi exampl is the typic case that to understand idea and concept are more import than to learn fact . in conclus , i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
