i rememb an tv-ad about some kind of perfum which , onc appli on your bodi , could bring you all the beauti girl or boy that you may have dream of . i bought it and i can assur you that it doe not work ! mayb i wa abus by the advertis but for sure , but in my view the advertis tend to overst the main featur of a product , and i will give the main reason for that . first , the main goal of an advertis - and it is also the aim of market - is to promot a good or a servic in order to increas it sale . as a consequ , the present of the product could not be fair in a sens . inde , i am quit certain that if a tv-ad show the weak of a good or servic , in order to be partial , thi good or servic would be as appeal as the same present by an ad which show onli the good aspect of it . second , advertis tend to reach the imaginari part of our person to increas the attract of product . by do so , consum are dream about such product and idol them . for instanc , you may have the strong desir to buy a luxuri car becaus you have seen it on the tv and it wa shown in an ideal place . or you want to book your holiday in a pleasant place becaus you find the photograph you have seen veri beauti . but in fact the real situat could be , at least , normal . as a conclus , i do think that the advertis doe not provid a fair imag of the product it support . but it is worthwhil to mention that it depend on our own mind to distinguish between what it is true or not .
