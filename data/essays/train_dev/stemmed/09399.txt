actual , it is not my belief that it is better for an educ person to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . in today 's chang societi , it is far from enough to be just an `` expert '' . when we watch televis or read newspap , we think that to have an expert talk about a subject is reason or even that onli the expert ha the author to talk about the subject in public . base on thi psycholog effect , we tend to support the idea that the societi should produc more `` expert '' , so that peopl will get more reliabl inform from the media and their live . howev , when it come to educ , it will be a bad idea for the student nowaday . for exampl , i 've alway want to be an simultan interpret . but be an interpret requir a lot more than the knowledg about translat . he ha to know `` someth about everyth , and everyth about someth '' . if he ha to go to a confer which is dicuss the oil crisi . he ha to know the basic inform about oil , all kind of oil in fact . therefor , a success profession should n't be limit in the arena of hi special subject . otherwis , hi success would n't last veri long . for exampl , if you are an employe work for an insur compani . the basic rule for you to success is that you know how to sell . that is a skill that involv with a lot of other subject . you 'd better know how the hospit work , so that you can sell your insur to it patienc . then you need to know what kind of patient can make protenti custom and what kind of patient can not ( like those who have develop uncur diseas ) . so , after year of stude in colleg , if you know noth other than what insur is , you are definit doom . so , in my opinion , be an `` expert '' is not a bad thing , but what we realli need in today 's challeng world are peopl who have their special and also the broad knowledg about the natur and the societi .
