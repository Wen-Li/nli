ye , i do agre with the statement , that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are some develop in societi , that corrober thi statement as well as my own experi in the local commun work . let me first outlin the social reason that support thi current situat . we are today live in an egoist and materialist societi . peopl usual just live by and care for themself . thi can also be seen in the increas number of singl houshold . make carrier and live a hedonist life is just what is promot by the public media and our econom and polit agenda . we are live in a societi that is largli base on consum and that subsequ produs a lot of product and possibili to consum . suffic to say that thi creat a condit where peopl do not even have the impress to have enough time to engag themself in selfless commun work . they work much to make a live and to financ all the pleasur the entertain industri is advertis as the mean to live a happi and succes life . but it 's not onli that enjoy all the entertain is so time consum , but there is also a lack interest in help other , due to a miss moral educ . in the past thi moral educ wa largli done by religio institut that where just a cornerston of everi societi . you can agre or disagre with the develop to a rather secular societi , but one can hardli deni , that our societi is pain lack an institut that would overtak thi import moral educ . polit and the media certainli do not fill thi gap , but actual are increas it . my own ecperi as a leader of a youth group in my commun is - also talk to the older member of our commun - that it is get harder and harder to motiv young peopl to engag themself in help other . also the number of young peopl that are activ in our commun tremend decreas over the last 50 year .
