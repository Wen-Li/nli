i agre with thi statement . in fact i think that learn fact is use , but not the import part of the studi . if you learn onli fact without understand the concept of what you are studiyng , you will not have a complet knowledg about it , and so you will have onli a superfici one of the theme . then , have a superfici knowledg about the theme mean that you are not abl to make yourself a critic opinion about that and that you wo n't be abl to discuss it in a complet way . anoth reason is that fact are forgotten rapidli , with the result that in a short time you will not rememb anyth about the topic , wherea concept and idea remain more deepli in the brain . i know that there are mani area of knowledg and in some of these area , such as engen for exampl , it is more import to learn fact and number than to understand fact . but also in these case a learn onli base on fact is not effect : for exampl if you do n't understand a physic process you wo n't be abl to make exerc base on it , or howev if you would find an exerc a littl differ from the one you have studi , you would n't be abl to solv it . thi is import not onli at school but also in work , in which if you understand deepli a process , you are abl to manag it and the peopl who have n't understood it
