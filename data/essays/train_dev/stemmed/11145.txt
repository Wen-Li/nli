do i think that in the next twenti year there will be fewer car in use than nowaday ? it will be marvel , but it will not be happen . there are sever reason that substain my thought . a ) past year ' trend . in the period 1980 - 2000 , the number of car bought in the industri countri ha increas . everi year new model are sold , car are cheaper than in the past , new tecnolog are built insid ( airbag , ab , an so on ) . new law have be iuss by gover requir more specif characterist . all these reason have increas the number of new car b ) new countri are becom industri and rich ( see china , india ) . those countri have million of habitan that in the futur will requir the use of new car . do you immagin what doe it mean a new car for each chines ? how mani car will be sold ? what kind of busi will be ? c ) oil energi is not consid to be finish . in the past year the issu of oil reserv wa consid a world 's great problem . but now , new drill tecnolog have been discov , more reserv have be found , so at the moment thi issu is not consid immin . d ) peopl have to move faster than in the past . veri often , peol find a job far form their own hous . for that reason they have to use train , buse , plane and car everi day . how will they be abl to get to work without their own car ? it 's a great deal , how can be solv if we would want to reduc the number of car ? on the other hand , if the number of car will increas , enviroment issu will grew up . pollut is the most import . new form of energi will have to be found to move the new car .
