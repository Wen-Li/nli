my job bring me to differ part of the world all the time , and everi day of my life i see young and old peopl enjoy their life in differ way . who enjoy better ? young or old peopl ? i would start say that young peopl have an advantag over older peopl . they have more energi to spend and , appar , they never get tire . thi energi make them to do a lot of thing , for exampl stay up late at night , go to differ parti all the time , sleep as less as possibl , drink and have fun constantli . young peopl , though , do not have one direct to follow ; they move in all direct . i see them sometim rush into thing . for exampl , i use to have a friend that never had a moment to spend toghet with me becaus he had to go to so mani parti that he did not have time for me anymor : that 's someth that i do not agre . have fun all the time seem to be the main topic for young peopl ; they do not have a clear goal in their mind for the futur and sometim thi can lead to a disast . go to parti , drink and mayb smoke look like a good deal at the begin , but in the long term it can ruin your life . i had anoth friend that unfortun die becaus he wa have too much fun ; he wa total drunk after a parti that , unfortun , die in a car crash while drive home . from the other side we have old peopl that have differ way to have fun . let 's start say that old peopl , usual , have less energi than young peopl . they take life at a slower pace and that 's whi i believ they can enjoy better what they do . take , for exampl , an old coupl in an island in the bahama ; they can relax all day just watch the beach at the sea and that 's all . a young coupl , in the same situat , would want to do someth : snorkel , fish , etc . . they enjoy the same situat but into 2 differ way . still both coupl have fun . i consid myself still young but with some experi so , i start think to have fun like a young crazi teenag but , when i start , i slow myself down and realli enjoy everi moment in what i am do . no matter if you are young or old , i think that have fun is part of our daili routin to enjoy our life in thi world .
