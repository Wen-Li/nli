to choos between have knowledg of mani academ suject or to special in one specif subject is difficult due to the fact that it oppos two differ way to deal with it academ background . on the one hand , mani peopl think that it is smarter to focu onli on one sole field of studi sinc one will soon becom a specialist who can have more job opportun . on the other hand , it is also true that have a broader knowledg of mani academ can provid a broader job spectrum as well . person speak , the fact remain that it is far better to studi sever academ subject in oder to be abl to choos in which one realli want to be special in . the first reason i believ that is that peopl enter colleg are mostli too young to know precis what they will wish to do when they will be adult . have the possibl to have a glanc on sever academ fie can help help them to sharpen their convict and personal in order they can choos what area they prefer the most . onoth way to justifi my point of view is that for person matter it is better to have the larger possibl view on the world . as a matter of fact , if one want to tri to understand it own life and the world around , the best way is to know a piec of everyth rather than to know precis one thing , which would be to much narrow mind . in conclus , my strong convict is that it is better to keep a broad knowledg as long as it remain possibl befor special in one specif field . in my opinion , the us school system that provid the choic of one major but also the possibili to discov mani other field of knowledg that can be veri differ is a veri interest and accur way to deal with thi topic . if i may , i would call it a win-win situat .
