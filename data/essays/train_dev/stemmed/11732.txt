i agre whit the statement below . the reason of my afferm is that a person may not , in the actual societi , know onli a specif subject , becaus our job employ may chang in the futur . infact our societi is more flexibl than in past , and then we must to be prepar for all thi cheng . in other , i think that is interest have a gener cultur . for exampl we should know sometim about histori or scienc , about math or philosophi . of cours we can not know all in absolut . it is imposs ! a gener knowleadg may be theach in some kind of school , or by stude at home for ourselv . in other , i think that we can learn more of gener subject by talk whit other person who are more inform about a specif subject . howev , is not wrong to be special on a subject . infact mani job have need a specif knowleadg , as the professor or the engign . to project a machin do n't need to know latin ! thi is my case becaus i studi electron engign and my futur employ will be about the onli project , who do n't requir other knowleadg . in other , person i think that is veri interest know all the paticoular of somethink . without thi way to think , in the past it wa posibl invent veri complic and sofist machin . final , my gener idea about the statement is that we should learn ( at school , at home , with friend ) the more possibl about all subject , but is import , in mani case , have a specif knowleadg onli about one .
