i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i have three reason for it . first of all , it would not be good , if you have some kind of specif thing that you want to see . becaus of too mani peopl , you have to come back within a time and you can not spend time what you want to see or experi . i think it is better to travel by yourself or with small number of peopl , if you do have . therefor , you can spend , experi , as much time as you want . you do not have to care about time or other . it will be your own travel , not for travel for everyon . second , if you travel in a group with a tour guid , it mean that you can not do whatev you want . you sometim follow order , such as time and go to bathroom . for exampl , you have to see what in the tour . you might not in interest in the thing , but you have to walk around and see with group . anoth exampl is when everyon goe to a bathroom , you should go there , too . otherwis , you might want to go to bathroom later . but it would bother other and kill time for everyon becaus you travel with other . you alway have to think and caqr about other . on the other hand , if you go by yourself , you will be abl to skip what you do not want and spend more time what you want to see . i think you can enjoy your trip more without care other or stress from other . lastli , i think it is good for you to travel by yourself befor trip , such as when you make plan and studi about the place and cultur . becaus you have to travel by yourself , you might have to research about the place in detail in order to make your travel better one . you also might have to studi about the languag they use beforehand . then you will get opportun to use your research and languag over there . i think after the travel , you will becom more familiar with the place , cultur and forth . i am sure you will never forget the travel becaus you creat . ! if you travel with other plan , through the agent , i do not think everyth will be perfect or satisfi you throughli . i guess you will complain with someth at least onc becaus you do not make it . in conclus , i think the best way to travel is individu . then i think you can spend as much time as you want , studi about whatev you like , whatev you want to do . also you willl be abl to make a trip more enjoy and better one than plan that other make . becaus of those reason , i would prefer to travel by myself , but not go with a group led by a tour guid .
