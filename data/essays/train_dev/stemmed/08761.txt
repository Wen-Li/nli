the topic state that `` it is better to have knowledg of a number of academ subject than have special in one specif subject '' and i tend to disagre . the reason for take thi stand is thi - although educ system through out the globe support both the mode of studi yet a specialist is ani way prefer over a person who is a kind of `` jack of all trade '' . befor go into depth let me remind you about a normal prcedur of educ these day . when a child goe to school then in order to make him acquaint with all thing in the surround , he is tought a varieti of subject . later on , in hi teen , he is taught the basic of all the major stream , so that he can choos hi major . final , thi all goe in the direct of choos one subject , and all the subject are touch so that he can find out the flow of hi interest . now let talk about `` special '' . the specialz is requir for depth knowledg of a subject . to work over a subject you alway need that and all the subject ( avail for major ) are have enough depth to spend your life work on it . i rememb one veri well said line `` practic make a man perfect '' . in the same way a specialist is alway have hi concentr at a subject and is work out with that subject all the time in order to get best result for the well-far of the societi . here , i can also take exampl of myself . what would i do in case i get a heart problem ? i would definetli go to a heart specialist . the similar situat can be appli in all the problem you encount in your life . it true a basic knowledg of each and everi subject is requir to sustain your life without get stuck at everi other hurdl that come but broad knowledg of mani academ subject will make life a mess . you would not be abl to comentr on one thing . henc , i would alway prefer go for a special instead of mug my head in a number of subject at a time .
