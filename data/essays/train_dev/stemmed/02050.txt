not all that glitter is gold . a veri gener statement yet veri true . a statement that should be hung in everi compani 's market and advertis depart , becaus i think that most of the dvertis polish up their product . evid to that are the polici that some compani in the unit state have concern the `` refund , no question ask '' polici . for exampl , the famou depart store found all across the u. call target oper under thi polici , give it custom a three month time span for return and get a refund for a purchas product . had the product been fairli advertis consum would be return less product as they would onli purchas a product that they are sure of . i onc watch a five minut advertis on one of the advertis channel concer a certain product for the complexion . in the commerci they show sever befor and after pictur of peopl who claim to have use thi product . it wa veri clear to me , as it would have been to ani comput user , that so much of the picr shown of the after had been alter on the comput . with the new advancemnet of technolog and high develop in the comput manufactur industri someth like that can be easili done . the product wa over estim in price and qualiti . i can say that with confid , for my friend fell for the smell of fake rose and bought the product , the next day she sati home becaus she had a horribl rash all over her face . so it is not surpris that i strongli agre the fact that most advertis are over done and do not reflect the true valu of the product . as i said earlier , the advertis and market depart should be more truth .
