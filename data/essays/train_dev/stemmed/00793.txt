it is more import for student to understand idea than learn fact , the human ha long memeris and short memeris . when we tri to rememb someth whether difficult or simpl , final we hope that it will be the long memeris . the opposit is that just know the fact . i am go to have three my own exampl and opinion for show that to understand idea is more better than learn in fact first of it , i use trigtion algebra or even a sentenc in english class . when we are go to understand about how to use or calcul . we should understand the idea of it or the question dont have limit in ani situat . if you just learn fact , then you are go to figur out noth in the math , becaus it too mani thing you learn in fact , or it too mani thing you dont tri to understand idea . second is about a sentenc or a new vocabulari that you have never seen befor . if you tri to understand what go on in thi sentenc or tri to know what the definis about thi vocabulari , then as soon as you dont need to rememb or even '' learn fact '' , you can understand or to know how to use it , becaus you understand idea , and the sentenc or vocabulari will becom part of your bodi and in your mind for the long time . third opinion about understand the idea is when understand what the mean of the stuff then it more easi than just rememb it , becaus the question or a sentenc will alway be chang whatev or anytim , if we learn fact in algebra you will rememb for your all life , if it english , then you will rememb at first second or first two day , but after the day then you will forget , then your studi life will be alway in rememb and forget . my conclus is we should studi to '' understand idea '' not to learn fact . and abov those three opinion i
