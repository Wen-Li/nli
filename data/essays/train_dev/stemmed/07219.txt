person , i disagre with the gener statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peolp do . it is of cours difficult to make a gener decis here and there may alway be except to the rule , but i would even say that - in revers - older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl do . there are variou reason for that . while young peopl often tend to prefer a lifestyl which impli a lot of parti and go out to have fun , older peopl usual have gain enough experi to be abl to estim what realli count in life . that is : not go out and get drunk but basic thing like a secur job , a hous , famili and friend you can reli on . older peopl have learn about characterist that are realli import , wherea mani younger peopl may still stick to superfici idea . in make hard and difficult decis , older peopl may have an easier time than younger peopl . adolesc will approach a difficult situat differ : they may be more naiv , simpli becaus they have never face a problem like that . older peopl can relz on their life experi and see more easili which would be the best decis . they can evalu situat better and are more sure of themselv . moreov , older peopl can look back on the accomplish of their live and see what they have done . they do not have to worri ani more about career thing and - hope - about money . they have work all their life and earn enough money to be abl to travel where they like to . with their partner , they have now the time and opportun to see the countri they use onli to hear of and read about . young peopl have to think of their educ and career . they have to think about their incom . older peopl have the possibl - and should - transfer their knowledg to younger peopl in order to help them get on with their live .
