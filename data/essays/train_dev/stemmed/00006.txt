i disagre that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . whi peopl use car ? becaus car is use . it doe not care time schedul , go somewher directli , and can carri somet more than other trancepotaion . if peopl go someplac , peopl use some trancepot . usual they have to care some trancepot `` s time schedul , but if they use car , they do not care it . thi is veri use . in addit , if peopl use a car , they can go somewher directli , but if they use train or bu , they have to walk or transfer after arriv station or bu stop , so car is more use than other transport . furtheremor , if peopl have a lot of luggag or someth , they difficultli carri on the train or bu . howev , car can bure these . also , car can bure other peopl . for exampl , their children or friend . car is more use then other transport . it can decid use their request time , go someplac directli , and can carri mani thing . therefor , i think in twenti year there will not be fewer car in use than there are today , but if someon find new transfar system , it will abl to chang .
