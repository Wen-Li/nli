first of all , we must consid that the two thing , learn of concept and learn of fact , are strictli connect . i think the ideal way for a student to obtain the best result from hi studi , is to learn fact and then analyz the idea and concept surround that fact . for exampl . it is veri import to know the fact that there ha been the first world war , but it is necessari to understand which have been the idea and the reason which lead to start someth highli danger and that would have caus thousand of victim . the real problem , i guess , is that is often confus the mean of `` learn a fact '' . dure school , for exampl , teacher requir us to learn by hard date , name , citi and so on , and thi lead to forget the princip fact . moreov , while less import thing can be forgotten ( i will not rememb the exact day of the end of the frist world war ... ) , the contrari is for the fact . ( i will alway know that there ha been a grat war around 1915 . .. ) furthermor , idea and concept may be more difficult to understand , but onc you do it , it 's almost imposs to forget them . besid , they can also chang your thought , your way of live . they can make you spend your polit vote for one or anoth parti . .. they can lead you to becom a politician just to tri to chang someth you learn . it ha been the idea of freedom which took gandhi or martin luther king in the polit world . it ha been the concept of racism which lead me to hate adolf hitler , and not the fact of the second world war . there ha been the idea of ra tafari to give strenght to jamaican peopl reach their freedom . in other word : some fact are import ; thi is sure . but the learn system should not be base on them ! it should be base on motiv and reason which caus that event and on the idea that were born by the event . if the system wa organ in thi way , i think we would have less `` mechaninc '' student and more consciou futur citizen and politician .
