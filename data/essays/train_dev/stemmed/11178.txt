i partial agre the idea and to travel in a group with a tour guid suppos to be one of the most effici way to visit a place , especi when peopl go to the countri where they never been so far . as for me , i usual travel with my friend and i have no experi to compani with the person , such as a tour guid becaus i believ that there are follow disadvantag to do it : i do not wast the time by visit the place which i am not so interest in ; and i hope to have a look real aspect of the countri or place . the peopl who particip in a gruop travel must be various to age , interest or sex . to fulfil the satisfact of everi visitor , travel compani would take them mani sort of place regardless think about what or in where they actual would like to experi in the trip . the travel time is limit and at the same time i realli want to make it fun , therfor i should go or do onli what make me have interest . further , travel compani tend to emphas onli good aspect of the place to a travelor , in order not onli to make them have a fond of memori there , but also to make them come back there . i am tire of see a place where most of tourist visit and have a meal which most of them have eaten . taken togeth , for the person who hope to know the place where he or she visit deepli , like me , should have a coonect or freiend who dwell there for a long time and they diffinet take he or she the restaur or bar which tour group rare visit .
