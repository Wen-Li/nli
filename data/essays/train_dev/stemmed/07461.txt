i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they are . but i am not upset by thi sinc the first goal of an advertis is to make peopl like and buy the product . in my opinion , the real problem is that alot of peopl believ that some of these advertis tell the truth and that is whi we should provid some clear and object inform about the product in other to keep the consum inform . it would be realli hypocrit to say that advertis doe not li . sinc it goal is to make the consum purchas a product then it is logic to onli tell the advantag of the product and not their drawback . for exampl imagin an advertis that show a car . if it say ` thi car gener a lot pollut and use a lot of oil ' , nobodi will buy the car . but if it say ` thi car if one of the fastest one and is extrem confort ' , then a lot of men who like speed will buy it . that whi it may be logic to make a product look as good as you can if you want to sell it . nevertheless the problem is that consumm have to be awar that advertis do not alway tell the truth . the key point is that they do n't provid a part of the inform . that is whi i think that it should exist some independ compani which goal is to compar the product and provid some object inform about them . for exampl we could imagin a studi that compar all car with the same criteria and would say about the car of my first paragraph : ` ok , thi car goe fast and is veri confort but it is not ecoloc at all and you will moreov need a lot of ga which is expens ! ' . thu , the men who like speed but are concern with ecolog would mayb buy an other one . as a conclus , i think that advertis will alway make product seem much better than they realli are . in my opinion , the real problem is that consumm should be awar of the real caracterist of each product and that is whi the role of independ organis that keep the consumm inform are veri import .
