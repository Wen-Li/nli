i fulli agre with the statement say that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i will base my essay on my person experi in order to consolid my posit . as a child , one 's normal forc to learn all the concept by heart . thi appli to when we learn thing such as letter , number and color . howev , thi system onli work while peopl are realli young becaus when they grow up , the scenario chang dramat . when i began my first physic cours , i wa use to learn everyth that wa written on a paper or a text book . the problem appear when i had to solv an exercis ask me to calcul the impact that graviti had on athlet . i wa unabl to solv the problem with all the formula and theori that i had learn the night befor . i wa completli block . i realis then , that understand the idea could be much better for me than just learn fact . i forc myself to get the idea from the sourc i had and share the inform found with my colleagu and teacher . thi ritual or studi method allow me to have a better pictur of the problem and find a better way to solv it . sinc then , i start forget about the tradit way of studi but begin to understand where the main idea wa come from . thi way of learn is now help me to solv the problem that i normal face when i 'm work . when my manag ask me to answer one of hi question , he is not wait for me to repeat everyth that i 've learn from the school but for a quick respons and solut . if you do n't know what the main idea are , you will not be abl to interact with other profession . onc again , my own experi make me confirm what i state at the begin . teacher and professor should take thi new way of studi in order to teach their student accordingli . whatev they teach today could help their student in a futur .
