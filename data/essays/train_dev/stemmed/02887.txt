understand idea and concept and learn fact , that two differ way of lean new thing , but which one is more import may lead peopl discuss about it . in my opinion , to understand idea and concept is more improt for student than just learn fact . becus mani problem-solv are base on the idea , concept or theori . firstli , when student understand a idea or a concept , they can use what they know to appli to viour of situat , to analyz the problem , to think of them and solv them . mani thing happen in the world are base on some theori , such as how a object move , whi some time comput do not work etc . for exampl , when a car is design , engin need to follow the rule of physic , and chemistri . howev , when engin know the theori of the dynam , they can use same theori to appliy to other manufactur such as ship , plane and so on . in contrast if student onli know the fact that a car can move in thi way but do not know whi , they can not deal with other problem , becaus they onli know the fact , but reason . secondli , fact are onli restrict in few aspect . student who learn fact are usual can not analyz some situat inde . student know what are happen on some thing , they know the appear , but they might not know whi that is happen . sometim they might know the reason that cours the condit happen , but becaus there are not idea and concept in student mind , they would not understand the reason fulli , they can not analyz correctli , therefor they might not solv the problem , the problem is still on there . to sum up , in my opinion , to understand idea and concept is more import for student them to learn fact , as i mention be
