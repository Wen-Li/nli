a veri famou say goe as `` be best at what you do '' . have excel in a particular is more benefici than have surfac knowledg about mani subject . we will onli be respect if we excel in our chosen field . my first exampl will be from our academ life . even our educ system follow the aproach mention abov . as we reach eleventh standard we are ask to make choic from mani subject becaus it is realli import that we concentr our mind one particular field . at the colleg level we further need to determin in which subject we want to do detail studi . thi make our field of studi narrow so that we put the best of our effort in one particular thing we want to pursu . my next exampl is from our social life . in a group discuss we should be adept at one topic about the issu in consider rather than guess littl about each topic . argu with peopl who have expertis in the similar area also increas our knowledg . anoth exampl is from the world of scienc . while do the research work scientist do not need to know someth about everi subject but complet knowledg about what they are research . thi is even true for lawyer . fight a case in a court doe not requir you to have knowledg about how atom divid but eveyth relat to law . tri to know about everi subject wll lead us to nowher . therefor in light of the exampl mention abov i conclud that it is better to special in one specif subjct than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
