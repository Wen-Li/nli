wisdom is usual associ with age . the older we get , the wiser we becom . i agre with thi idea becaus experi teach us what to do and what not to do . for exampl , a child could cut himself by pick up a knife from it blade rather than the handl , but he will learn not to do it again . in other word , young peopl do not enjoy life more than young peopl becaus they learn through pain . thi doe not mean adult do not experi pain , but they know how to avoid it better . in some way , adult have learn to distinguish the road that lead to joy event rather than pain one . a perfect exampl would be the use of alcohol . young peopl tend to binge-drink becaus they have not learn to distinguish how much alcohol their bodi can toler . on the other hand , grown-up have alreadi learn thi after repeat hangov , and instead , they learn to experi the tast of a good wine . someth potenti harm becom a pleasur instead . howev , it is not a rosi pictur for grown-up becaus they have more respons than young peopl . yet , respons usual come hand in hand with more freedom . thi gift of freedom is not a blank chequ becaus one ha to work hard to earn money and be respons for oneself . but on the other hand , kid depend too much on their parent ' time and money . they may have a lot of fun , but their freedom to move and do as they pleas is limit . if kid and teenag live in big citi want to go to the movi , they usual need their parent to drive them to the cinema . they could do it alon by bu , but parent are sometim afraid someth could happen on the way . to sum up , youger peopl do not enjoy life more than older peopl becaus as the year go by , one acquir independ and experi . these two element in my valu system are not a magic key to instant happi but they are key for do whatev make us happi without fall into pain situat .
