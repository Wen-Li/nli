inde , advertiss is one of the best way to reach peopl . but some advertiss seem the most time much better than they are realli are . in my opinoin , i agre with thi statement for these two reason : the use of veri good commerci and also the use of the celebr person in the commerci . first of all , mani advertis have a realli good commerci which can convinc the people. , like one of the biggest problem in the usa is obes , mani of those commerci which want a sell a product can use a natur skinni person to make peopl believ that as soon as htey will get thi product they might looklik thi person . for exampl the increas of the product of numer medicin to loos weight in thi contri is a proof that is work but at the same time the usa still one of most import contri which ha problem with weight . second of all , ther is a huge use of celebr in the advertiss that give a fals imag of what a product is realli is . for instanc , the last campa of proactiv solut which is suppos to help to reliev acn . personnali , i love jessica simpson who is a singer and actress . so when i saw in the commerci , i thought whi not use thi is my idol use thi ' it might work for me too . so ' i use the product and im still use it but there is not such a big chang like i tought . thu , i think that a good commerci and a use of a known person make more product look better than they are realli are . peopl should start to stop believ in those advertiss at hundr percent becaus sometim it can work and sometim it might not .
