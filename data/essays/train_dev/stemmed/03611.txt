from my point of view i do n't think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . even if the price of the oil is enorm increas nowaday , twenti year is such a small period of time to forese that car are go to decreas in use . as far as i am concern the car is the transport that most peopl use to get to the work , the school , the univers . .. i am disappoint with thi choic becaus i think the car can tremend damag the enviro . everi day the pollut in the citi are grow and the citizen have the respons of thi . if we were concern about the consequ that the car can caus in the natur i am sure we would chang our point of view . most peopl take the car becaus they think is the easiest way : they ca n't stand the queu in the metro or at the bu stop , they do n't have to fight with the peopl to get in the train etc . instead of see the advantag of public transport they onli see the disadvantag of it . howev they are wrong becaus when they take the car there are a lot of peopl who take the car at the same time , therefor nobodi will be abl to avoid the traffic-jam in the peak hour . i ca n't understand whi peopl keep on take the car in the morn if they know they will find traffic-jam , they will get nervou and mayb they will be late . nevertheless at least there are some peopl concern about the enviro problem and they usual take the metro or the bu to move from one place to anoth . i would advis the citizen to avoid the car if they do n't realli need it . it is a piti that we are damag our planet due to our selfish and careless . i wish the car in use would be fewer in twenti year but i think thi is a marvel uthopi . i will look forward to see the road without car .
