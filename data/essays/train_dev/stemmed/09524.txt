in my opinion young peopl do not support their commun as much as they should . i have sever reson for thi opinion . young peopl today are veri much care about their own free time and the activ they do . they do not see the commun that is around them but onli their own benefit . for exampl , a lot of young boy use skate rink to skateboard , howev veri few of them actual help build the site so that the kid of the commun can enjoy the rink . reason number two is rather obviou as well . do volunt work that is an unpay job and at the first glanc bore to do , is not veri attract to young peopl . they fail to see the bigger pictur and are often not encourag by parent of other respect person to help and give some of their time . i think that it is thi lack of encourag that caus such a low rate in volunt activ of young peopl . at the same time i am assum that young peopl also do n't see or get ani incent by engag in the commun . thi problem can be solv by creat special programm that will spark the interest of young peopl . they need to be design toward the need and abil of the youngster in oder to fulli work out . the creativ of the youth need to be address in possibl project or incent . if they can get an opportun to present their talent , say they like to spray gaffiti and get the opportun to spray a wall legal as a trade off for help out at a nurs home , i think they are much more like to consid help out in the commun than they would without thi incent . in my opinion young peopl would help more than they are do now , if the job assign and the incent given are more suitabl to their need today . the problem and idea i have state could be a start .
