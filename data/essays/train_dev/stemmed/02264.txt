person i agre with the statement that in twenti year there definit will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are quit a few reason to my opinion . the most import one are : first , the global demand on non-replenish resourc such as petrol and diesel , is ever increas , perhap the overwelhm growth of the world economi , industri , car , etc ha caus such an increas today . howev in twenti these resourc will be spars or too expens to buy . thu , without the necessari ingredi - fuel , i think there would be fewer car than today . second , phenomin advanc in technolog and commun will defint give way to other sourc of transport . perhap air travel , fast and effici metro ( train ) and other more effici and cost effect way of public transport may be the norm twenti year from now . third , the increas in car and other mean of road transport is a major caus of air and nois pollut today . thi is not onli caus seriou environment damag but is the caus of damag to the whole ecolog - be it flora , fauna , anim , human , etc . such mis-endeavor are caus the govern bodi of the world to wake up and take notic . i suppos stringent region and global law will either prevent peopl from buy car or at the least will restrict them from buy a singl car twenti year from now . thu unlik today when perhap a singl person own multipl car , such a thing will perhap not be possibl in the futur . a lot of peopl may not agre with my opinion . perhap becaus today none of the abov seem possibl i.e. more car per person , no law , etc . howev if we all take a pragmat view and think logic i suppos all of us will come to the same conclus that there will be fewer car twenti year from now .
