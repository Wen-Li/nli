take risk and get to know the unknown is an import part of bee abl to move forward and experienc new thing , which is whi i strongli agre with the statement . where would the humen race be if our ancest would n't have taken risk ? the curag to do someth new unexperienc or unknown allow develop . if columbu would n't have taken a risk no one would know about amerika . mani of our scientif achiev are the resulst of taken risk . if no one would have tri to fli ( at the begin with some strang look machin ) and with that would have taken the risk of break an arm or a leg we would still travel with ship ( if we are will to take the risk of sink ) . person who took a risk are those who are stand in our book and those who achiv someth in life and for the humen race . but let just look at a more person level . if we are will to take risk we are also open for new experi . if a person is will to get to know differ cultur and view and is leav her/hi comfort zone , that person will learn someth beneficial to her/hi life . i would say that take risk is one of my basic humen need . my life should be exciet and full of experi , until now i have alway been more sucessful with that additud than those peopl not will to take risk . sometim i mayb burn myself but the thing i lear from those neg experi is someth noth els would have been abl to give me . how is a person abl to get life experi or to becom wiser with age if that person is not take risk ? it is not at all admir if someon is onli do the thing he know how to do , to some extend it es even sad .
