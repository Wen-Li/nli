despit the fact that each peopl ha hi own way of learn and understand , in a gener point view , i think that best result can be obtain by focus on idea and concept . that doe not mean , howev , that fact should never be dealt with . the best way is certainli find a compromis between the two approach . idea and concept are , to my opinion , the most import part of learn , like the foundat of a build which is grow bigger and bigger . theori is the first brick you can build on . moreov , idea and concept tend to be univers - i think a good theori is evalu to it degre of univers . in a way , we could say that theori preced the fact in that it aim at explain , and sometim predict them . therefor learn and understand idea and concept is import becaus it permit to think from a gener point of view , without be tie by circumstanci condit for instanc . it give student abil to adapt to a broad rang of situat . on the other hand , i think it is not possibl to onli reli on theori . fact must be use to endors - or refut - theori and , to my mind , theori alon is worth noth : everyon can build theori but we should be onli interest in one that have direct link to observ fact , one that use those fact to give more credibl to the gener statement they posit . fact are essenti in test theori sinc they repres what ha actual happen which give them strong credibl and thu they are key element of a theori 's valid . as a conlus i would say that both are import - idea and concept on one hand and fact on the other hand - becaus they are part of a gener process , they do not exclud each other and one without the other is worth noth . howev , i think there could be a chronolog aspect : it would probabl be more effeci to work on idea and concept befor deal with fact .
