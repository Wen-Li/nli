i do n't agre with the statem . i do n't believ most advertis make product better . one exampl of advertisem is to happen in my couontri , japan . there is a pretti popular compani of vinega . the vinega 's color is black . it is said that it is better than normal one . actual , it is better , but the compani said that black one contain mani time nutirit . it wa wrong . i ca n't believ avdvertis . anoth exampl is when i wa in japan . i sometim brought someth on the internet . i ca n't rememb what i bought , but i just rememb it that it wa terribl . i decid to buy someth when i saw a advertis on the internet . it wa said that we sold the product with the lowest price in japan . but , one of my friend alreadi had same product , and he bought in tokyo with lower price than mine . i do n't believ advertis sinc that . last exampl , in japan , we bought by advertis , we could n't get better product that on advertis . avdvertis just show that how product is better . so , actual advertis are not better than real product . i never believ it .
