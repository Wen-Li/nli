i disagre with the statement . student have to understand the main idea and concept on the one hand , but have to learn the fact aswel . if student understand an idea , they should be abl to work the fact out in ani case they need them , but onli if they know some fact . when a student onli learn the fact he will later onli know them and might lose the view for the whole topic and thu not be abl to anwer the question . he might lose himself in detail . it is import to learn the fact aswel as the gener idea , becaus you can not answer a question without have ani fact at hand . in case a student onli learn the gener idea and forget to learn the fact he oppos the problem of not be abl to answer a qouestion onc again . he might have understood the whole thing , but is not abl to present certain fact that are necessari for explain a specif topic . therefor an answer wo n't be possibl . when a student ha learn aswel the gener idea and concept as the fact he should be abl to answer everi question on a certain topic , without greater problem concern hi prepar . he might have other problem , but they are not to be discuss here . in my past school time i gener learn the fact but sometim it occur that i had n't understood the whole idea and concept and therefor a classtest wa realli bad . if i onli had understood the main idea and concept but hand't learn the fact i wa n't usual not abl to answer quoestion accord to the given task . when i had understood the idea and concept and had learn the fact , the classtest wa n't a big deal . so i have experienc just what i have state abov . server friend of mine have experienc someth quit similar . bad grade when they had either onli learn the fact or idea and concept - good grade when have learn and understood both . thu it is most import for the student to learn the gener idea and concept aswel as to learn the import fact concern the topic .
