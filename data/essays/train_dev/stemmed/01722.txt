some peopl think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl , becaus then think young peopl may have more energi , howev , in my opinion , both of them enjoy life veri much but in differ aspect . first , to young peopl , they consid life to be excit and full of enthusiasm . therefor , the prefer to express their enjoy behavior extern , like play some stimul sport , go hike to some danger place with thir cooper and friend . futhurmor , they may eat spici food , wear strang coat whatev they want , it is a approach that young peopl enjoy their life . on the other hand , becaus of their young , they have to vork for their rest of life , which mean they should accumul their properti , do work assidu in order to have a comfort life when they are old . then , to old peopl , they have work for most of their life , and when they becam old , they have the oppotun to spend leisur time on enjoy . moreov they alreadi possess adequ money for themselv to enjoy their rest of life . also , the old know actual about what they want and where they want to go , and their suffici life experi make them full of intellingec , they could obeserv life insightli , the way the enjoy , for instanc , is onli a cup of tea , or look the sceneri out of the window . bigger inspir they want perhap to travel around earth , to see some thing then had never seen , to go to some place they had never went to . old peopl can even enjoy the life more in contrast to the young peopl , they are the peopl who are no longer interf by earn money and strain life work . from my point of view , in summari , we can not say who enjoy more , becaus all the peopl acquint themselv with theway of enjoy life , and know the crucial mean of enjoy life and releas themselv , though they do it via differ way and hold differ emot .
