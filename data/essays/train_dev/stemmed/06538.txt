i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl do . both these are the stage of life and peopl enjoy at everi stage . but , i feel that peopl get more enjoy at old age . in young stage , peopl strive to earn their live for themselv , for their children and for their parent . they alway work and work to earn more money , more statu etc to earn live at that point of time and to save money or invest money for later part of life , which is older age . real enjoy start when they use the money earn for enjoy as they are have more free time for enjoy . secondli , old age is the last stage of life when peopl have seen all the wordli pleasur of life dure their variou stage of life . but , in my viewpoint , peopl get more satisfact when they are with complet famili includ their grand children . that is the stage when peopl feel more enjoy to be with . peopl earn money for get thi phase of life with good time . thirdli , i feel that in old age , peopl can do ani work accord to their like becaus they are under no pressur to earn their life . but , in young age , peopl remain under pressur to fulfil their dream and alway run after life . in old age , life come to a stand still and peopl enjoy the fruit of the tree what they have plant in young age . becaus of thi reason , old age peopl get more satisfact dure that time as compar to young age . lastli , in old age , peopl get more respect in the societi which in turn give more enjoy toward life . peopl at thi stage can indulg in activ like templ work , which help them in sooth their soul . beyond thi there is no enjoy on earth which human can get . i would like to retier that peopl enjoy more in old age as compar to young age .
