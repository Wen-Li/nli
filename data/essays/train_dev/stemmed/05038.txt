time are chang . peopl do not understand that young peopl are not like their father . is true that those young men do not help their comun in the way that in twenti centuri we refer to , but is true olso that they have differ and import job . the first think that , for my opinion , a young person must do is studi for hi futur , and , in a cert way , thi must be seen like a help for the comun , becous a grait educ can improv our futur , can improv our worker , our economi and our life , so thi is import not onli for young person but collect futur too . and i see like my famili beeliv in thi opinion , in fact they support me in all of my decis , they , in ather word , built my futur . and i see alway in them a lot of proud for me . i know that is import make samethink for ather peopl , but there are a lot of young peolpl that make a civil servis , they help comun , for exampl , a lot of them work in hospit without pay . probabl they are not a suffici number , but is wonder that in a time like our there is in them also a sentiment of generoc e chariti , and i do not care if sameon think that thi new gener is without valu , becous for my opinion a generet that make in first place their futur own and their uman feel is a grait gener . of cours there are olso same of them that do not want anythink for ather or for themself , and that do not have respect for parent- sicrific . but i think that they are a littl grup of a wonder generet , which i in it and i can tell thi with proud .
