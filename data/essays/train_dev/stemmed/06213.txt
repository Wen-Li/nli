i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is to mere learn fact . the follow point can be reason made to support the abov statment . to begin with , understand of idea and concept enabl one to realli appreci the mechan of it and to possibl put the idea or concept into applic . take the exampl of an electr motor . without proper understand of how an electr motor realli work , it is imposs for one to creat motor of variou size and for variou util . if one mearli learnt the fact about a motor , we would n't have all the pleasur in life made possibl by all the miniatur motor ! look at the car power window , whose oper is facilit by small motor , or at mani of use the robot whose motion is made possibl by variou sizes/typ of motor , or at mani of the precis tool that use someth call stepper motor to precis control variou oper . further , understand of a concept enabl one to look for way the concept can be extend to other applic , or to find way two or more concept can be combin to come up with new idea that make excit thing possibl . take the exampl of a devic that scan print materi and convert it into type matter on a comput . thi devic is the result of a lot of differ concept put togeth . the scan technolog - which scan the print materi , which is then combin with pattern match technolog - that can look at the scan pictur and recogn the letter base on their shape . simpl learn of fact doe n't realli allow for thi kind of innov . howev , no one can deni the role fact play in help peopl visual thing and in put thing in perspect . take for exampl the saturn rocket that took man to the moon . unless one know the size of the rocket , the amoount of fuel use , how mani invent were requir to make the flight possibl , one may not realli appreci the scale of the devic and the project . but one can still see that the fact help one gain a perspect of thing , but the realli use come onli when one understand the concept that make it possibl for the devic to work . in summari , it is clear that it is far more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn just fact , despit the import role play by the fact .
