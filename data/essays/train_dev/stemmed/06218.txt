have broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than special in one specif subject seem more difficult to me due to sever reason . let me state my reason . first of all , special in one specif event or subject may take a lifetim . i , for instanc , want to special in market and in order to do so , i will have to have my mba , phd and still work on learn . i can not say that '' ok , i have been read and learn about market for 20 year and i know everyth . '' thi is imposs becaus evey year , new book and new method are introduc to the market . learn about one subject never end up . secondli , it is not use to know more than one topic or subject on the surfac . you may have knowledg about other topic but you do one thing good . it is like play basketbal and footbal at the same time . it would be imposs for you to find enough time to sacrific yourself for the well be of ani issu . if thi topic wa possibl , i would have one techer in my whole life , tri to teach me everyth . but i had math . teacher , market teacher , financ teacher and so on . all were special in their field and had depth knowledg of their intererst . to sum up , have broader knowledg of mani academ subject seem unus to me . special is much more prefer . in usa , the biggest economi in the world today , special at univers is the primari method and they owe their success to thi approach . i would go for special .
