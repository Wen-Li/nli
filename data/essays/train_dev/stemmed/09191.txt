in my opinion i disagre with the topic about most advertis make product seem much better than realli they are . in thi new global world and era the compani tri to reach so mani peopl around world by the use of technolog . but it can be sometim harm for the consum who do not pay attent . firsti of all there are too mani way to attract consum about the product . we can use internet , tv , radio , by give advertis . all of them are effect . by use a famou footbal or model you can increas the popular of the product . on the other hand , the compani use camera and light illus to show the product more attract . also thi method can be use for show the big one as a littl and the slow one as a huge one . an addit to thi mechan the advertis given on tv or internet are repeat so mani time in order to persuad and convic the consum . thi made pressur on the consum to tri the product . the last factor for me to attract the consum about the product is it price . as we know if a product is cheap we alway think that it is the best suitabl one for us . it i a quit wrong stetement in fact . thu the compani know thi situat and use it as a most well known weapon . in spite of the state fact below , there are also some advertis reclect the obviou and fair appear and usag of a product . in such kind of situat we can tri to compani mark on it . for exampl some mark like bmw , gener electr , lcw are most well known produc so we can trust their product also advirtis . consequ , in our global and technolog world all compani tri to take a role in world trade and make much more money . furthermor we can say thet world manag is relat with some big compani . so the smaller one tri to be in thi huge budget . and also they can do everyth to get thi even they forc the countri to begin a war . attract product to convinc peopl are an easi piec of cake for them .
