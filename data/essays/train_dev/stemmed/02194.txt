in my opinion i gener believ when peopl want to be success in their life they have to tri out new thing and take risk . i admit that some peopl can be also success when their do their thing in a way that they are familar with and go better in the futur becau of more routin and experi . howev , in my view when you will be reali success you must have the courag go risk and tri someth new for two reason chang the view how to do thing better and decreas the procedur cost . first reason , do thing in the same way can be veri uneffect and it is better to chang the procedur . in my job experi i have heard a lot the sentenc : `` thi have we alway made in thi particular way and it wa good so . '' howev , sometim a particuar work will stuck and nobodi have the courag to chang thing , becaus nobodi will feel guilti for a failur of chang the workingsystem . second reason , chang the procedur of a particular job or decis can declin the cost in a compani . for instanc , to chang the product depart to an abroad countri can be connect with some risk factor that could not predict but the compani ha the chang to decreas the product cost . the risk could be the emplye in the foreign countri sinc they work not so effect like the employe in the home countri . all in all , when you be success in your life and not want to stand still it is better to take the risk and take the chang to thing in differ way .
