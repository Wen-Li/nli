the big industri are famou , becaus gener their product are better than other product of small industri . i think that , the trayectori and the knowledg of the compani permit to identifi if ani product is better than other . for exampl , i went to supermarket and i buy a unknow oil , becaus thi wa more cheap and i did not show big differ between my normal oil and thi , but when i use thi product i show that i loos my money , becus thi product had a less qualiti of my habitu oil . therefor , i think to that there are famou compani , but thi is not a garant for a good product . for exampl , current a famou compani of toy had problem with it toy , becaus the toy have a danger chemic ; thi toy industri is famou around in the world , but thi is not complet garant for tha qualiti of the product . i agre with thi idea : `` most advertis me \ ake product seem much better than realli are '' becaus the market is a war for the consumm . so , the qualiti of the product is determin for the peopl , i think that , the especi in the product of the product help to peopl know that product is better that other , becaus if the compani onli make a special product , the product will be more techniqu and with less price than befor . there are product better than other ju in appar , but peopl should say which product is better when they obtain it , becaus it is better for their option in the market and in the habitu consumm , they have a social function too .
