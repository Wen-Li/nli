i total agre with the statement that `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their communti '' . there are three reason whi i believ so in term of vote rate , improv of the technolog and urban . first , young peopl , especi in my countri , tend to avoid to particip in polit . even though it should be essenti right and duti for the peopl to attend vote , the rate of vote is decreas year by year . young peopl seem busi to work and play and they are lose interest to polit . second , obvious , the number of the young peopl who do not know how to commun with other is increas . it is said that the distribut of comput game and improv of network such as internet caus the problem . peopl no longer need to go out to find someon who would make convers with him/her becaus they not onli can `` talk '' but also can play with their friend onlin . although technoligi enabl interact commun , such thing are not liter `` commun '' . young peopl should go out and see mani peopl otherwis they lose abil to commun and they will never find the way to contribut to their societi . \ third , urban is also one of the factor . recent , most area in the develop countri are urban . even in the countri side , young peopl tri to move to citi and the averag year of countri side area are increas . howev , there are tradit commun and older peopl have wisdom base on their experi . in contrast , there is no `` commun '' in the citi and no one would tell young peopl valuabl thing .
