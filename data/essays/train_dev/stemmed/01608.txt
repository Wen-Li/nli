i do n't agre to the statement . i love to travel alon . there are some differ between travel alon and travel in a group led by a tour guid . first , i think that a travel must be free . if i have an oppotun to my trip , the place i want to go is n't same with my friend or whole group member . join the group and led by a tour guid make it imposs to go to the place where i want to go . a tour is a thing which goe onli to the place where someon select befor start . second , i think that a travel should be flexibl . you may want to go mani place like the place you see from a train window , or you find a place where doe n't print on your guid book . to chang the rout from you thougut befor your trip is one of preasur of travel . in the end , i think a travel give a chanc to meet new friend . i do n't t need group member becaus i can find a new friend who ha same opottun with me . if i had a question , there are someon who ha a lot of knowledg about there . so , i think the best way to travel is go alon .
