everi person enjoy life in hi or her own way . though , i person believ that youngster enjoy life more than older peopl do . firstli , the reason whi i think so is that as we grow older the respons we have onli get more and more . for exampl , when i wa a kid studi nurseri i didnt have ani respos at all or for that matter veri less . when i wa in high school i had to studi well to get admiss into a good colleg . then in high school i had to get decent grade and also had to help my parent in their work . though it wa not a burden for me , it sure wa a respons which i had to do as their daughter . as a person grow their respons also grow , not just as an individu but also as a person in the famili and in the soceiti . also most of the youngster tend to take life in a lighter way than the older peopl . so we enjoy that phase of our lifeth most . the older peopl have alreadi undergon thing in life , that make them plan for their futur in a certain way or save money for their famili . but the young peopl tend to spend their money on luxuri thing or on more enjoy thing . for instanc , when i wa in colleg i use to spend most of my money on shop and stuff . that wa enjoy for me then . but now i realis the import of save money for the futur and i shop onli when i have the need for it . anoth import point i 'd like to mention is that enjoy lie in the way we perceiv it . most of the young peopl do not have anyth major to worri about . they enjoy the life they are live , do thing at their own pace . all they have to bother about is their studi . thi is not the case with the older peopl . their live are more or less veri stress , be it due to famili problem or tension in the work place . in conclus , i would say that a person enjoy hi life the most when he is young .
