i believ that understand idea and concept is more import than learn onli fact . in my opinion , there are sever reason whi idea are more import than fact . for instanc , while i wa attend histori cours , which is often believ to be made onli of fact , i realiz that some event are common in differ period . therefor , when i wa abl to understand the idea and concept , i wa also abl to catalog similar event in big caterogori and thi way of learnig help me in get a good mark in the exam . moreov , while i wa attend the univers i realiz that the way of learn idea and concept is realli impor . for exampl , a cours can explain with some exampl how to deal with certain issu . howev , it may occur that a differ issu occur so , i believ that onli whether you understood the idea you might solv thi new issu . an exampl , that confirm that idea and concept are more import than fact , is what happen last year dure the electron laboratori cours . i and my friend were work on `` led '' , light emit diod , and we were measur the emssion of the light . we were use a particular instrument to get the measur when it stop to work . we were worri becaus we knew that wa the onli instrument to do that kind of measur . what is more we studi onli how to use that kind of instrument and other type . our professor told us that also it wa imposs to repair it . we thought we lost all the experi , but it wa not true . while we were read the the manual we understood that that istrument wa onli the combin of two well known instrument : a '' wave gener '' and '' amperomet '' . we got the idea . we were abl to build our instrument and continu the experi . we were realli happi of what we had done and we understood that the we were abl to finish our experi oni becaus of abliti to abstract idea and concept that we had understood in the past .
