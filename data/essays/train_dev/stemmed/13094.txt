i disagre that in twenti year there will be fewr car in use that there are today . first , the anoth transport that will replac the car ' role have littl chanc becaus of effect . throug mani year , car have been use vari wide . and that mean anoth devicec to support car is prevail . so , to make thi comfort situat peopl have investig mani money . therefor anoth vehicl is hardli to replac . in same notion , if that substitut transport can replac that car , it 's not easi to make comfort to use . second , although nowaday is call ` global world ' , car is use when peopel have to go a short distanc . becaus i mention , nowadya road is veri common so it 's veri conveni to move short distanc . altough now is call global world , peopel rare go to abroad by comparison with peopel use car to go social region . third , peopl 's adjec . for mani year peopl have use car . for that reason , peopl is veri famil with car . so i 'm doubt that peopl will tri to adjust to anoth thing dispit of car 's comvin . fourth , nowaday oil is veri expens . and addit , the altern fuel is not invent that sustain world wide demand . so the transport that will use same fuel , it 's hard to reign the car . although anoth fuel will be invent , it 's price will high becaus of it 's inov right . in conclus , car 's effici , more time to use , adjunct , tangibl , it 's hard car to be reduc in twenti year .
