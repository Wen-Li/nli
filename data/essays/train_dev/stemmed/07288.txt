the statement of what is more import for student either to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact is controversi . howev , in my experi is more import to understund idea and concept than just simpl fact . first , i beliv that by focus entir in fact you are miss the opportun to understund concept and idea surround fact . it is import for student to have a good understand of the situat go beyond fact so thi way they can extrapol these learn to differ situat . second , as a profession chemic engin myself i have alway never seen that a situat is the same twice in my career . it can be similar but not the same , the onli way to tackl new situat is by be clear and understand the idea and concept of the situat . as a result of my background and train as an engin it is almost strang to solv problem base onli in the specif fact you have learn in your career . you need to again go back to the basic and focu on concept and idea to be succes not just fact . also , by have a special focu on idea and concept you can help develop the creativ of student . it is import to encourag student to understand not just idea and concept but from there to develop their thought process and creativ . by focus onli in fact , it can be challeng to develop other area like creativ if the onli thing student are face are fact for particulat situat . moreov , by look at the big pictur you are also help student to understand how in mani situat fact can be differ but the idea and concept are the same . last but not least , it is import to keep in perspect that we live in a constantli chang world and by make for student more import to understund idea and concept they will be better prepar to be succes in the futur which will bring to them newer and more challing problem than what we have experienc in the past .
