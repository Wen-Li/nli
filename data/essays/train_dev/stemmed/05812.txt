nowaday mostli peopl say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i total disagre with thi statement . there are three reason whi i have thi prefer . for one thing peopl who are young have to spent their time with work and learn in order to get a job in the futur . i am student . i have to studi the whole day . and when i have finish my semest i have to work at a ship compani in order to get money . i have so much work and i have total no time at all to see my friend . onli a few time i tri to go out to enjoy my life . furthermor mani young peopl are in concern about their futur . in consequ they do not enjoy life . there is a great competit surround the young peopl . mani of them have no work , they do not get a traineeship or they are not admit on a univers . i have to reach 90 point in the toefl test otherwis i will be exmatriukul . if i fail i have to find out anoth way how to earn money in the futur . i am realli frighten about thi case . a next point is , that i have not as much money as the older peopl have . i get onli some money from the compani at which i work within my free time . becaus i do not work full time i get less money . from thi money i have to pay my appart , the univers fee , the ticket for the train and i need money for food and cloth . there is no further money which i can spend for fun like for holiday trip . in conclus you can see that young peopl do not enjoy their life as mani peopl do believ . the major have to spent their time on work and learn , they are more in concern about their futur and as result they less enjoy life . final they have less money which they could spend for have fun . onli when you are old and you have reach someth wthin your life you will realli enjoy life .
