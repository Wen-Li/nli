for begin thi essay , i just want to ask a question . if you win with a game 100 dollar , you will be happi , it 's obviou . now , if with a game , you win first of all 200 dollar , and afterward in the same game you lost 100 dollar , eventu you will win 100 dollar , but will your feel be the same in the two case ? the realli thing which is veri import , is not a situat at an precis moment , but the evolut which lead us to a situat . thu , even if we are in a veri good situat ( in work , famili or friend ) , and thi situat stay like that for a long time , our feel will not be the same , becaus at the begin there is a changement which do that we are happi , but after there is not thing which influenc our life , so we take the thing differ . for exampl , we can quot , richard branson , who ha a success life , but he tri new thing all the time , like diversifi it compani ( virgin ) , or thing more crazi like do a turn around the earth in balloon , travel in the space ( not yet do , but mayb soon ) . by all mean , there is also peopl who prefer do n't take risk and stay in the same situat . i think that there is not mani peopl in thi case , becaus if there is not evolut in our life , it becom bore . obvious , there is some situat except where it is not right . for instanc , i do n't think that michael schumarr ( ex f1 pilot ) wa bore by the fact that each year dure five year he won the championship . but it is a special case . for me , the most import in the life is the evolut , to come back to my introduct , obsvious i think that we are not in the same feel in the two case ( besid , some studi show that it is right ) . so , i agre that peopl ( not onli success peopl , but in particular ) tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know to do well .
