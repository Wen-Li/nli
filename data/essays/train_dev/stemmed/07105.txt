sinc begin of my prep-school educ , our teacher tri to teach everi thing from differ area , for exampl we had math cours , music cours and also a draw cours . thi situat continu until the the univers educ begin . for the first time , in the univers we start to special our knowledg to specif area . for a person 's academ plan we can think by thi way . howev , when you start your academ life you can special for onli one subject or tri to get inform from differ subject . i think special is more effect way for all the period of educ . the first reason is , if you special in one specif subject and if you accomplish thi success , you will becom an auther for thi subject and you can answer all question about thi subject . howev , if imagin the other choic , tri to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , you will never say i perform success , becaus nowaday technolog is exponenti grow and the inform about all the subject are develop , i want to say that today knowledg can be usel for today . becaus of these reason , folow the technolog and updat inform will be imposs if you want to have knowledg from differ subject . anoth import issu for specilaz one specif subject is , the academican ' first task is investig new thing and gather new inform and then share them with the public . investig is a veri difficult task and if you want to find new thing for a subject and also develop it , you should know everythin about the subject until now . you must defin all the detail of the subject and onli by thi way you can make investig . special is becam veri import for thi approach becaus it is imposs for a person to know everi thing about subject from differ area . as a conclusuon , special is much better than have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . also , in my belief that , we start specila from the high-school or earlier . we should defin peopl 's abil and draw a direct for their futur life . by thi way we can creat expert academican for their subject
