in my opinion , a man should have a special knoledg on one specif subject . the reason , both includ social aspect and individu aspect , are illustr below . for the social aspect , today , more and more compani requir a person to be arm with a spefic knowledg . onli by do thi can help compani stay competi becaus those peopl is the one contribut a lot to compani by use their strong knowledg . for exampl , if a person who want to go to intel to design cpu chip , then he need a strong knowledg of electron engin and help intel stay advac all the time . there is no reason for a compani to hire a person who doe n't have ani specif knowledg , becaus everi peopl ha hi specif job in the firm . even more gener speak , compani , as well as our societi , need those who have a specif knowledg to make chang in thi world and let our world becom better . on the other hand , from an individu point of view . the more he devot himeself onto a certain subject , the more knowledg he will get . for instanc , he who feel like studi law might have the chang to understand hi career direct earili than other . thi help him to stand out of crowd and becom sucess in futur as soon as possibl . bill gate is just a vivid exampl , who love comput scienc so much that even decid to quit school when he wa onli a colleg student . later , he built up hi career as well as thi world 's honor : microsoft . by the same pricipl , a person who concentr on a specif subject could gain a deeper understand on it thu broaden hi view on thi field , by easili meet with a variati of friend . meet peopl , attend lectur , or confer becom a good oppertun for him to even becom better in thi field . base on those abov point , i think it 's better for a morden person to special on a specif subject to give himself a big chang to success as well as chang our world .
