no , i dont agre with the statement that say it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , becaus in my opinion i think that the fact is the most import thing we should understand , becaus the fact is realiti , the fact is what a person is go to face in life not an idea and becaus a fact is onli an idea till you make it a fact . the first reason for me to beleiv that the statement is not true is becaus fact is realiti . idea is onli a thought u think about and that not in ur face , but in the other hand fact is what u c infornt of u and what u face , it the opsitcul in front of you the object you have to learn about and deal with . fact are unchang , unlik idea where a person can chang hi or her idea in differ time in there life and in differ sittuant . the second reason i think that fact is the most import is almost like the fisr reason , fact is what u confront in life , a person should learn the fact and understand them . becaus these are the real thing in life , and they are the opstical you face , a person will never face an idea , or do somth or becom someon with an idea . . but a person can face a fact , a person a person can do someth and becom someon with a fact . the third and finnal reaso i think that the statement ( it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ) is not true is becaus an idea is onli an idea till u do it and it becom a fact . a fact is an idea turn in to an fact after act and do someth about it . so what im tri to say is that it is import for student to understand idea and cocept , but it is more import for them to learn the fact , becaus the fact are what make an idea work , and an idea is wourth anyth until it becom a fact .
