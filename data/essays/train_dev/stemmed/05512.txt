i agre with the statement : i believ that in some year there will be fewer car in use than today . i think that there are a lot of reason to support thi statement . i accept that car are realli necesari and import . it is difficult to imagin a week without car : some peopl need it to work with it , other need it to go to work , shop , travel , etc . furthermor , some car are import tool for differ public agent , like polic , firemen , abul driver , bu driver , etc . car give to the societi a lot of import servic , includ enjoy free time or work everi day . but , on the other hand , car have a veri import defect that make me think that in the futur there will be fewer car . they deppend on an expens and harm materi : petroleum . the reserv of thi fluid are fewer everi year . furthermor , everi day is harder and more expens to acc to the rest of the reserv , and more money is need in orther to obtain it . therefor , i believ that thi fact will make gasolin and diesel more expens everi day , and thi will be the first reason for a reduct of the actual quantiti of car run on the street . the expensiv the petroleum is , the lower quantiti of peopl who can acc to a car and it cost of oper . moreov , there is anoth good reason for thi statement : the pollut . burn of gasolin produc a lot of toxic and potenti danger substanc . if you take a look to the sky in a big citi , you will find a brown cloud of pollut . we breath thi everi day . i believ that peopl will have more health problem in the futur becaus of thi toxic substanc . the gover have began to tri to control thi emiss , and one of the step is to reduc the amount of car on the street . anoth reason that i mantain is that peopl is concern about the import of do research in thi field . i believ in technolog . and furthermor , there are anoth differ way to go form one side to anoth . for instanc , bicicl or littl motorbik are more effici and cheap . to summar , i agre with the statement . i believ that the actual situat is becom quit difficult , with huge traffic jam and health problem . and i think that the first step to solv thi situat is to reduc the amount of car on the street .
