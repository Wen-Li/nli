i believ and i have observ that success peopl alway tri new thing and more importantli do not hesit to take risk . thi is the way how peopl see and meet new opputun wait somewher to pick it up . eventhough tri new thing and be open to chang are fearful to most peopl , i think thi is the one seper those who govern and other who are govern . i also strongli believ that take risk is the key to success espici in busu . for exampl , my big brother resign from hi job in turkey and went to unit state for hi graduat studi . some peopl who never want to tri new thing and alway do the same stuff forev blame dmi brother as foolish becaus he wa tri someth new and take risk . howev , in the long term , my brother complet hi studi in the us and now ha becom a director in an oil compani current run in russia and make a lot of money . those who blame my brother still do the same job with fix salari and close vision . now the world in which we are live ha becom a small villag and is chang in everi hour in term of rule and way which we live \ which we do busi , and so on . even if we do not want to tri new thing , i believ , the current condit are forc us to chang , tri new thing and take risk . i have sever friend do busi in differ part of the countri . i clearli certain that those who did new thing address tast and prefer of custon , for instanc , have been winner at the end of the day . nevertheless , some of my friend who do not like take risk lost their busi . i have an specif but trateg exampl with one of my friend do s'lver busi in ankara . i strongli urg him that he had to tri new market especi foreign market for hi product he wa produc . in addit , he gad to take some risk for lose money . he chose hi old way and avodid new thing . unfortunu . hi busi is noe dead . in summuri , i am in favor of tri new thing and take risk . so that we will be abl to improv our personel attidut and busniss . thi is the way how we can prepar ourselv for futur .
