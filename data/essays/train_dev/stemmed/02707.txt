a more common and well accept say is `` it 's better to be a master of one trade than be a jack of all '' . be a person who would like to special in the field of wireless telecommun , i disagre to the statement `` it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' , as against what the current world is demand . most of the human be is talent in one specif skill . so he can concentr and outperform well on a subject or topic that he ha chosen depend on thi skill . also hi perform will be better when he work on thi like subject or topic . for exampl , a person who like sing can contribut better if he special on music , as compar to hi perform in other subject . speak about academ , a person special on a subject which he like the most . he choos that subject in which he feel he can contribut more . have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , can certainli to one extend , help a person . it will help him to have a wider aspect of think . for exampl , knowledg of mathemat will certainli help a person special in physic . but at the end of the day , it is what he contribut to the societi that matter most . for exampl , albert einstein , famou for hi theori on rel , concentr in improv hi knowledg in a specif subject physic , as against scratch hi head in differ scienc avail dure that era . he wa abl to contribut a lot in the field of physic , though he wa poor in mathemat . so i would like to summar that , have a broad knowledg on differ academ subject will sure help a student , but special in a specif subject will help him to master it and in turn will help him to contribut back in that field . thu contribut to the societi , more than to himself .
