probabl in the past there wa a much greater sens of commun than we have nowaday . everyon , sinc ancient time , had to do hi or her part to help the commun . childhood did not last for long , soon peopl had to learn to work and fight , and get marri . what is chang now ? the time we spend to actual becom `` adult '' is much longer , lead to a new stage of life , in which we are no more children , but not yet matur . young peopl , dure these year have to understand what they want for their life in order to be help for other . not an easi task , but young peopl still do give time to help their commun , in differ way . in the first place , young peopl depend on their famili for a long time from mani point of view . so their resourc are limit . the rang of possibl help actviti is often reduc to volunt . and there are peopl who do that . mani of my friend have been volunt for at least one year . i wa part of sever group , and now i support some associ , like unicef , for what i can . anoth problem is that nowaday you can contribut to your commun by work . thi is someth hard to do while young peopl are stude . i have just one part time job with children , becaus i do not have much time left from univers . but i give my contribut anyway . mani student do . by help themselv , they help societi . final , it is not easi to give a definit of `` commun '' today . in the age of global , commun tend to be more virtual than physic . that is realli common among young peopl . we creat and join commun on the world wide web , almost a second life sometim . do we care less about our commun ? i do not think so . instead there might be a more seriou problem : young peopl feel like they do not belong to these communti anymor . and peopl should think about whi thi happen . we do spend time for our commun , just in a new person way .
