method of studi is alway differ from student to student . mani peopl hold their perspect to undestand idea and concept while other prefer to learn fact . i too beilev that it is more import for student to understand concept and idea than to learn fact . the reason , i think thi way is becaus understand idea and concept cleariti increas the creativ of student and it give better knowledg for further growth . concept cleariti and clear idea provid better foundat for futur educ of student . one reason , i believ that concept cleariti and clear idea give better foundat to a student is becaus if we understand idea and concept then we never forget the subject . take my own exampl , when i wa student i alway prefer to concept cleariti . i still rememb the concept of newton 's law ; becaus my physic teacher of grade 10 had my concept clear about thi subject . therefor it is alway better to clear the concept and idea so that we will never forget the same . anoth reason , i believ that concept cleariti and understand idea is import is that it increas the creativ of student . when we understand the concept of ani theori then we feel more innov to discov some more thing . in fact everi scientif discoveri wa start from fiffer idea . for exampl , when adison had understand the concept of electron and atom then onli he could conclud that electron can be use to flow electr . thi is how understand concept about atom lead to the discoveri of electricti . all these are not to say that to learn fact are all use less . fact are relat to gener past which is also import . but advantag of learn fact can not surpass the advantag of clear concept and understand idea . in short , in thi scientif world , student with capabl of learn idea and with clear concept ha better futur than those who learn fact onli
