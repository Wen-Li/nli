i disagre with `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . '' it is just like advertis tell a lie to consum . for exampl , when my father watch a cm of clearner product on tv , advertis said that it could eras all of thing such as , coffe or ink . after he use it , it could not eras coffe one . it wa not ture that the cleaner could eras coffe . he wa realli angri with it , and he said he would never buy priduct at the compani . as a consum , you can not know about product which you can not use for a test befor you buy it . you just watch some cm of a prodict or look a product in the store . the other view is advertis is to sell product a lot to consum , so it might be natur thing for them to make product seem much better than they realli are . howev , that is realli big crimin at the point of tell a lie . becus of that , consum should need to compar with other product , and you should decid by yourself which one is good . also you have to use our mind and think about `` is that cm realli true ? `` . final , advertis should make product seem they realli are ; otherwis , consum will nerver trast them . also it should be a big problem .
