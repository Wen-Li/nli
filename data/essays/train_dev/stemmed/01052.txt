young peopl are differ from befor . in the past young peopl were work for own commun ; howev mani thing to have fun with friend especi in tokyo . in my opinion , i am agre with that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i have two reason that support my posit . young peopl start to hang around in big citi not near by their hous and they ca n't think about other peopl . there is a citi whose name is ikebukuro . thi citi ha mani arcad park , caraok , poll barn and so on . the citi is best place to hang out or date for young peopl . i also the one who think same way with young peopl think . in my ecperi , i wa alway hage out with friend at ikebukuro and come back home late . at that time i have never interest about my commun . i wa think that it is n't fun at all if i help my commun . is there ani benefit if i do so ? i couldn `` t understand peopl who help their commun . i think there must be more peopl who think same way with mine . i think young peopl becam more selfish than befor . they work just for their live , not for their famili and they ca n't feel ani love from famili . thi lead to hang around onli with friend . in my experi , i wa alway hang around with friend . i could n't feel ani love from my famili . therefor , i could n't have ani interest about my commun ; howev , peopl help me dure examin season for colleg . they gave me a lot of inform about colleg and especi my famili help me to find a colleg which fit my prefer . i wa do thi job by myself but i could feel love from my famili and peopl who are in my commun . in conclus , young peopl startet to hang around onli big citi not to involv their commun and becam more selfish than befor .
