i do not agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i can not support thi idea for two interest reason . first of all , young peol have less free time than old peopl do . think about the develop stage of a human life chronic . when they are student , ereri day is full of someth to do mandatarili such as homework , tutori , lesson . also young parent are so hectic almost everyday earn money , work hous chore , take care of chidren and be social to surviv the difficulti which come into their live . just dure the holiday they can relax and enjoy some time , then they have to struggl again after those certain time . it is hard even to think of themselv and their live for a short time . on the contrari , old folk are quit often seen take a walk , read substanti book , play golf , cruse on a beauti ship and so on . second , young peopl have less money than old peopl do . actual young group make a lot more money than the other one . howev , they have to spend a great portion of money they earn for a varieti of purpos . for instanc , a young coupl with children have no chanc to save their money at the bank . especi , lump sum of money is spent on their children such as child care , food . educ stipend , cloth and so forth . there is scarec a chanc to use some portion of money to be use for the famili vacat . that is the biggest opportun to get away from daili mundan life and spend money to enjoy life includ themselv . on the other hand , old gener are spend money usual for themselv . all the children are independ financilli , so they do not have to worri much about money as young gener do . most of old peopl eat out and make their live even simpler . with extra money in their hand , they can invest to earn more money to use . i strongli can say that life is more beauti when it is sunset due to the abov reason .
