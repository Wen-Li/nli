i definit disagre with the statement becaus , if we look at the present growth rate of car in use , i think we could realiz that we will face a substanti increas in number in the futur and therefor also in twenti year the number will be higher than today . it is possibl to explain my posit with my follow consider . develop countri like the unit state , the major of european countri togeth with japan are experienc constant demand of car sinc more and more peopl are becom independ and therefor need a car for go to work , for their spare time spent in travel , reach other peopl to differ place . if we also think that develop countri like india , china and mayb some eastern european countri and some south american countri are face an import posit chang in their grow economi , we can infer that a lot of more peopl will feel the necess of a car for everyday trip . moreov we can consid that car have becom a symbol other than a mean of transport in the last year , especi for some wealthi societi . thi situat can be seen at the same way for the develop countri in a few decad , therefor thi can be a sign to support my disagre with the statement . my thought is also support by a holiday trip i made in april thi year , when i went to california in the unit state . when i wa there i realiz that more than in itali peopl need a car , becaus of the long distanc and becaus of the fact that they live independ from their famili . sinc the unit state have a veri advanc economi and the other countri are go into that direct , i presum that even the develop countri will face that econom evolut step . in conclus i think that the number of car will increas in the futur due to the fact that can be relat as a consequ and a step of the grow process of the economi of a countri .
