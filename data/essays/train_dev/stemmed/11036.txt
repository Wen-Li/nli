i agre with the statement bacaus , accord to me , the new technolog will allow peopl to improv the qualiti of public transport . thank to thi travel will be faster and will have less impact on the environ . nowaday citi are full with car and thi is not just an environment problem but olso an econom one . in my opinion tramcar and altern mean should be prefer to couch becaus they need , to be suppli , energi and not with oil . mayb in the futur peopl will use their bicycl to move for short distanc and train or plane if they have to cover long distanc . but it is onli an idea . if the nowaday rate of smog keep grow , as scientist warn , peopl will realis that we have gone too far an then we will use our car onli when we are oblig to do it . to make it feasibl the govern should give much more money to the transport sector so that peopl will use public transport as much as possibl . thi prblem is particularli evid in itali where the public mean of transport are dirti , alway late and alway full of peopl : in addict to that , the ticket is too high if compar to the servic provid . so i hope that in twenti time the sector of public transport will be better and that the number of car will be reduc . one of the big issu of these year is that of oil and it price that is grow higher and higher , that is whi i prefer walk or take my bicycl to go to the citi center . thi is a way to see the citi from anoth point of view . in the past fifti year it ha skyrocket and peopl can not afford it anymor : so someth must chang . mayb that of mine is a too optimist vision but i realli hope that the most power men in the world will understand the graviti of the situat and react promov altern mean in to opposit car .
