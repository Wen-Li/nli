i am essenti agre with thi statement . understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact for student . but in my opinion they must learn fact too . as far as i am concern one thing impli the other . if a student doe not understand idea or concept , he will not be abl to learn fact in a proper way . we shall see thi clearli with an exampl . if a student ha to learn for hi histori exam the main event of the french revolut , he can just studi the main fact ( such as king 's prison and death and robespierr 's govern ) but if he doe onli thi , he will forget them easili , even befor the exam . what he should do is tri to understand the caus of the revolut . if he know that french peopl wa almost starv while the queen made costume-parti at palac , he may be abl to understand whi the furiou inhabit of pari took `` la bastil '' , franc 's most import jail and , consequ , he will rememb easili the fact itself : the assault of `` la bastil '' . it is true that in earlier time , when my parent studi for instanc , the student were told to learn fact . professor paid almost no attent to idea or concept . nowaday , it is quit the contrari . at school , and even now , at univers , we , as student , are suppos to be awar of idea and concept , but not of fact . they are misregard , as unimport inform . i think that a realli good educ ought to cover both concept ( which are basic to understand the caus of fact ) and fact themselv . if we do otherwis the onli thing we achiev is a partial idea of what we learn . in order to clarifi it more , i will give anoth exampl connect with the french revolut . if we know that `` la bastil '' wa assault at 1789 , that fact signifi noth , it is onli a number . if we know that french peopl wa upset with the king and queen in the later year of the 18th centuri we do n't know that at thi moment the assault of `` la bastil '' took place . we must be familiar with everyth in order to get a deep , a complet knowledg of the matter .
