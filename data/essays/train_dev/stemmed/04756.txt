some peopl believ that it is more import for student understand idea and concept than learn fact . howev , i strongli disagre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and cocept thatn it is for them to learn fact for the follow reason . learnig fact is faster way to learn for student . for exapl , when i wa a sixteen year old , i had a first part time job , which wa joy an assembl line in a beer factori . i expect to the job wa go to easi and simpl sinc i learn that the concept of assembl line and undersood how the assembl line work . howev , the job is not easi and simpl at all . i had to focu on anoth peopl and think what should i do next . i made a lot of mistak and warn from the boss . even though , i understood how it work and the concept , i did not what wa go to be fact , i did make the same or simillar mistak . howev , one i knew the consequ i said myself i wa not go to make same mistak again . and i could learn to handl the job veri fast . therefor , learn fact is a faster way to learn than understand and concept . peol usual rememb what they learn from fact . when i wa a six year old , i enter to an elementali school in japan . first day of school , i wa not use to attend a school : therefor , i missbehav such as not pay attent in class and talk with friend . even though , my parent told me i have to behav in class room . i had not know what wa go happen next , so i wasnot well bihav . teacher punish and warn me and i final realiz fact of missbihav in classroom . even now , i still rememb and i do not think i am not go to forget sinc fact are realli rememberbl for me . theexpiri abov show that learnig fact are easi to rememb and stay longer than understand idea and concept . student are be abl to rememb idea and concept becaus onc they understood . but they can forget easili sinc they just understood in their brain . therefor , i total agre with the statement that it is more import for student to learn fact than for them to undestand idea and concept .
