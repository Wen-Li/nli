the idea is good to me . i think that the most import aspect for the wisdom is to understand the idea and concept that we have heard in the school . for the student is import too the comun with the porfessor . but no alway the situat is the most comfort for the student and the academ . mani time , the place where the student show their question not is in the classroom . when anybodi do n't understand someth in the class is necesari to explain other time . we know that to learn is not a simpl work , each mind is differ and the level of complex chang in each human . when a professor is not sure that hir pupil have understood the princip idea of the tem he must do question about the exposit , if the answer are correct he can go on but if he comprov the other situat he can teach the problem onc more . but the realiti is n't , mani time , simpl . the situat is complic when the peopl do n't understand noth about the explic but do n't pay attent or becaus a problem of concentr . the pschycolog studi have been demostr us that mind work more slowli in thi centuri . whi , in our centuri , not onli the student , in gener , the peopl have a big problem to understand and learn new thing ? whi our mind work more slowli ? about thi quaestion the pscycologist richard frazer say : the televis and the other machin , product of the xx centuri are the caus of the massiv slowne of the wordl . the human think the comput , the televis , tha game and other ahv been invent to help us , to do life mor easi and fast , but is no true .
