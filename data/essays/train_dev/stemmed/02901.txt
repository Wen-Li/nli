i strongli disagre with the statement that today 's youth doe not spend enough time on help the commun . the spirit of help other , especi those who are in need , togeth with the sens of compass , is not limit by age . there are sever organis that are dedic to hepl the commun that are organis , manag and run by the youth alon . a closer look at the record of voluntari commun servic in most american hospit reveal the major portion of it particip to be in the 12 to 25 age categori . thi could be attribut to the fact that younger peopl have a larger number of free hour to indulg in commun servic , compar to adult who have work and famili respons . the recent tsunami on decemb 26th , 2004 , that wreak havoc on the south east asian coastlin result in unpreced death and destruct . a larg number of humanatarian organis theat provid relief to the victim were youth and student organis . these intern as well as local youth organis campaign to rais money and distribut relief materi and compens to the affect victim and also pitch into the rehabilit and reconstruct effort . the unit nation ha a special youth wing that hold an annual forum , provid a common platform for the youth to meet , discuss issu relev to them and final act on them . had young peopl nowaday not been interest in these caus , such an organas would neither been endors nor been given assist . a peek into everi activ involv commun servic , be it in donat for needi caus , rehabilit of underpriviledg children or anim welfar , the youth is not just present : it is activ involv . in conclus , i would like to say that the young peopl of today have not lost their concern or forgotten their oblig to societi . they strive to put in as much time and effort as possibl to the caus of uplift of the societi . they do their bit and more to help their commun and make the world a better place to live in .
