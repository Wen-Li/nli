i agre to the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . but it 's also import to know fact . bacaus everi idea and concept still requir basic fact which are necessari to realli understand them . you have to declin two kind of fact : fact which are basic knwoledg and fact which are onli import if you want to handl it deepli . mani of today 's student learn fact , but they do n't realli understand it . and so it is better for student and for life prepar to understand idea and concept than onli to know fact . for exampl : if you know how someth work you must not know whi it work . mani student learn strictli all detail of an idea but they do n't realiz the whole . in mani subject you have to learn by hard to get all detail , but it is better to understand the concept which allow student to studi , recogn and solv problem which are still differ but mainli the same basic . but student should know and learn fact , too . becaus in todaz 's life everi problem must be anal and it solut must found on especi fact . to solv a problem without detail fact is veri unprofession kind of work . other person with ground knwoledg should be abl to find failur in your document . learn must consist out of both : found knowledg compar with idea and concept . idea and concept may includ fact which are neccesari to understand them . mani student know and learn onli as much as need to pass an exam or anzth els . thi might be good for the moment but you ca n't pass life veri well . a reason for thi could be also a problem of teach skill . all in all it must be import for everi student to reach a found educ with both : detail knowledg and basic idea .
