the issu at hand is that whether in the next twenti year the use of car is go to be reduc or not . i believ that the use of car is go to be reduc . the first reason is that travel in car is not safe . you need to concentr on the drive . one should not get distract while drive . where as travel through other mean like bu is much safe . the driver are veri experienc and well train . mani peopl know thi and mani are still learn that travel by car is not safe . so i feel that car are not safe . the other reason is that car are less ecomom . we need to spend a lot of money for petrol . present there is a hike in the petrol charg and it is go to increas further . for exampl i go to colleg daili by bu . my colleg is around 30 km from my hous and go by car cost me more . so , i feel that car will be reduc in the futur . the other reason is that we may have new invent which may reduc accid and be more econom . technolog is improv at a much faster rate . so definetli we will have new invent which domin car in mani aspect . so i feel that use of car willl be reduc in the futur . everi one is busi in thi world . while drive a car we wast our time in drive and need to concentr more . by travel by other mean if we can do some other work . thi is go to save time which is the most valuabl thing in thi world . in conclus i strongli believ that there will be fewer car in the futur .
