i total agre with the given statement beacaus i 've taken broad knowledg from my school till colleg . i think it is veri import to have knowleg about the thing around you . stude or special on just one subject is not enough in today 's world . for an exampl , to becom a doctor a student must not onli take scienc class like bio , chemistri , physic and math , but they also have to take some elect class aswel ( polit , economi , human ) , in order to understand how thing work around them . i 'm an engin major studnet i 've complet most of my scienc class , but i 've also taken class like histori , art , socialog , which help me to understand the import of the other subject . these class develop the understand of other topic like polit , histori , socialog and world religion in me . i wa veri supris to know how import these other subject are in order to understand the natur of our societi . after take all these class my way of looking/think about the peopl around me or in other word the societi that we are live in have chang a lot in a posit way . someon who does't get a chanc to learn about the other subject find hard time to get a job , becaus hi knowleg is just on specif subject . in modern world compani are look for peopl who have knowledg of all sort of field , rather than have knowleg on just one field . for exampl there is more chanc for a comput programm who also ha some kind of background in the field of electron than the other programm who just know about hi own program field . in my opinion it is realli veri import for all of us to have a knowledg of all aspect of life . if you go to univers it veri common for a student to have doubl a major that mean to have degre in two field . becasu they know what compani are look for onc they graduat . that a kind of have anoth tool when other doens't work . we should defen have knowledg of other field aswel .
