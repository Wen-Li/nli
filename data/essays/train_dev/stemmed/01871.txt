some peopl might believ that advertis make product look more than what they realli are , but i believ that advertis make peopl wise , they help peopl to make decis , and most importantli save time . so i disagre with the statement that advertis make product look more than they realli are . advertis are the sourc of inform to the peopl , they clearlli explain what they realli are . they clearli mention there adavantag over therecount parst . they can not just give fals inform tri to make busi , the law now are realli tightn , take thisinto consider they can not make ani fals statement , and even if they do they are mani consum forum which will help us to guid through . peopl are usual confus and out of mind about the variou product avail in the market , so advertis help peopl in make decis . we need not be an expert tri to understand what the advertis is all about , they are made in such a way that a lay man can understand and make decis about there product . nowaday as the competit is increas they are so mani product come out in the market , so these will help a lot in choos the product we are look for . they give a detail explan of the variou function that product ha . in thi busi life where we hardli get time to spend with our famili and friend , advertis come into pictur they save a lot of time in choos the product , when we are tri to purchas a product we need not go and look at the whole rack of product . advertis help us to compar with other product , for exampl the price , benefit , use etc . .. so by do so we save a lot of time . i do agre that some advertis may actual see much better than they realli are , but consid the issu like they educ peopl , they help in make decis and save time , i think that the advertis are of great help to the societi . end of the day you are the one who make decis nobodi is forc you into it .
