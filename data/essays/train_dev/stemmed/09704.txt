althogh , some peopl think that student need onli to learn the fact , i total to agre with understand the concept and the idea . there are mani reason for which student need to understand the basic idea . one of the reason is that the student will onli use the concept and the idea from which they have been taught . understand the concept is more import than the fact in that the concept can be involv in ani suitabl applic . for exampl , a student in a physic class will propabl need to understand the formula befor he or she wil be abl to solv the problem . anoth reason is that when the student learn some fact , it is easi to forget them . thi is beacus they need to be memor . also , everi inform that is store in the brain can be lost if it is not use repeatedli . therefor , understand is much easier than memor . an adit reason is that understand is more effect in develop new thing than learn fact . to illustr that , suppos a student in a physic colleg tri to memor the content of the cours without give ani care to understand it . the student sure will find a lot of troubl in hi life if he or she tri to prove a new theori realtiv to the inform that have been taught . henc , if the student understood the cours without memor the content , the student will be abl comperhend with the life challeng . one final reason is that fact doe not provid ani think . it is either right or wrong . on the other hand , understand the concept can be duplic to obtain some other new concept . for exampl , the conflict between the rel and the law of motion can not be solv unless both of them are understood . onc the concept is understood , the solut for such a conflict can be solv . which gave rise into a new concept call `` the string theori '' . in conclus , understand the idea is much easier than just memor the fact that are concret and non-negoti .
