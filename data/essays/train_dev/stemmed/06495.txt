i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . instead , i think the number of car will increas . there are two reason of my opinion . first , the cost of the fuel for car will becom low . in these day , mani scientist are studi about altern energi sourc . there research are larg support by govern and moreov , the automobil compani who are anxiou to meet their custom ' demand . what peopl want is clean and cheap energi . and twenti year is long enough time to discov or invent the altern energi . if it is invent , peopl will not hesit to chang their car from high-cost , gasoline-us car to altern energy-us car . and gradual , the number of car will increas . second , nowaday , peopl are becom more self-cent . i think internet and technolog made thi phenomenon by provid an enviorn that peopl can work , play and rest alon . human be love to enjoy the individu valu and ride their own car is the perfect condit to be alon . technolog is progress and after twenti year , public transport may be incred faster than now . howev , take a crowd subway or bu is not as comfort as ride one 's own car . it is hard to be ` me ' in such a crowd place . peopl need to feel comfort and act uniqu in their own space . for exampl , in one 's own car , he can sing , danc , yarn , talk loudli on the phone , etc . i think peopl will prefer buy their car and enjoy thi kind of freedom . to sum up , i do n't think there will be fewer car in use than there are now in the futur ( within twenti year ) , becaus of the possibl of lower cost of fuel and peopl 's tendenc to enjoy their freedom .
