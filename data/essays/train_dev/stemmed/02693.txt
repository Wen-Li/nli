as far as tri new thing and take risk is concern , it is realli difficult to do someth you do not know but you can say you are realli brave when you have tri do as much as you can . i 'm not a person who is look forward to make new experi , i mean if i have to choos whether to follow a new way or the path i know , i thik i will probabl go through the way i have alreadi experienc . but it is not the right choic . take risk is like grow up face a situat you have never experienc . as a matter of fact you can alway learn someth by do new thing . peopl who do not tri someth new are probabl not sure about what kind of person they realli are . they may think they are not strong enough to suc in new situat . so they continu to live as they do and they do not take risk . what these peopl do not understand is that they should tri do new thing beacus it is not someth that is limit to peopl who have succed in whatev they have done . on the contrari their success is may be relat to the fact of tri someth new . as i wrote befor peopl who make new experi are brave but it doe not mean that they are success . so everyon should take risk becaus it make you learn someth either you will suc or not in what you tri .
