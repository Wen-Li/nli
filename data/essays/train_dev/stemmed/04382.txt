some peopl might disagre that it is more import that student understand idea and concept than it is that they learn fact becaus the fact are more concret and easi to understand and distinguish each other . but person , i think it import that the student learn someth adjust to each environ and flexibl to the problem they will encount . therefor , i agre that it is more import that they understand the idea and concept than learn fact . first , if student learn the idea and concept from their experi , they will be abl to easili adjust themselv to the similar problem in the futur . for exampl , my major wa biolog and i have done a lot of experi relat to the cancer bilog . when i extract the dna , there are mani differ kind of method . sometim each laboratori use a uniqu way to do so . but at the begin , i read the book and understood the idea and the concept beneath the protocol , i did not get confus when i chang the laboratori and encount the differ method of the dna extract . second , if student learn the idea and concept , they can modifi problem and even produc the new discoveri . fo exampl , when i read the vast amount of research paper , some peopl report the differn result from the other and there were a lot of confus . but onc i lean the concept of the reaserch purpos and approch , i could summur whi they produc the differ fact and realiz that all of data were actual suport the same consequ . even , thi find lead me to a novel discoveri . for these reason describ abov , i think that it is pretti import that student learn the concept and the idea of their problem and experi . these concept and idea would be veri use for them to resolv the problem and find the solut of the difficult enviro in the futur .
