i believ everybodi can not know everyth and it not so good to be ` jack of all trade and master of none ' . specif knowledg is veri much desir in both profession and academ field . special knowledg of the subject is mani time indispens . one good exampl would be from field of medicin , where gener physician are valu but specialist like cardiologist or neurologist are indispens and are the final option for particular kind of treatment . too much gener knowledg may becom veri superfici and will not be of much help in solv complex problem in specif subject . for instanc , if we look at the field of scienc , say biolog , a gener understand of all it branch is requir but a taxonomist and a biophysicist have veri less to do with each other and can not help each other in solv their specif problem . howev all thi discuss is not meant to diminish the valu of gener knowledg , as for applic of knowledg from one subject in to other requir understand of both . for exampl if principl of mathemat are to be appli to biolog then gener knowledg of both subject is requir . howev it will be done more appropri if two specialist i.e. a biologist and a mathematician interact with each other . also i believ that human memori ha it limit and one should use it judici . we should confin and focu our brain toward solv problem relat to specif subject . too much unnecessari knowldg will occupi space in one 's memori and will not be put to use veri often . therefor have gener knowledg in moder is good , but have onli gener knowledg is of no use . to appli knowledg for useful purpos one ha to special in particular subject .
