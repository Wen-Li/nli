ye , i agre that student must have to understand the idea and concept . but not by simpli learn the fact . by understand the idea and the concept one can have the abil to improv hi grasp power and the creativ , becaus when a student learn onli the fact he can just have some inform about the topic but he ca n't even know the concept behind it . but by understand the idea and the concept some kind of invent think can be improv by that student . for exampl , while do work on math , if a student just learn the formula to solv that problem but not the concept it make a big differ . but by learn the concept the student can work freeli not onli on that problem but can also have some idea on relat problem too . now a day in thi fast gener student are be veri fast . so they need to know well about the idea and the concept in everi aspect . well by know onli the fact on ani aspect make the student to have some book knowledg but that is not suffici for them they must also have some idea and concept too . in ani aspect like softwar and comput , the student must and should have the idea about the whole system and also the concept for well use of the system and the softwar . it mere wast of matter that if the student just learn about the system and the softwar . it the onli way for build up proper skill in a student is to understand the idea and should have proper concept also . so , accord to me i feel that for everi student it more import to undestand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
