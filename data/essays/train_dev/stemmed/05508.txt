i complet agre with the statement accord to which advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . what make me think that is my reflect on the market strategi use by compani dure my market class . advertis strategi is base usual on the follow three pillar , make the packag of the product agress , by creat a new consumpt trend that do not necessari correspond to the real need of consum , and by make the product look the uniqu one adapt for the costum need . all the abov mention pilar of market concentr the effort on improv the percept of the product not the inner characterist of it . doe improv the attract capac of the packag materi in which the product will be sold will improv it qualiti ? i am convinc that it will make onli the consum choos it even if it ha a higher price or lower qualiti . the colour of packag will attract the eye of the consum from other similar product that could be a better choic in term of qualiti and price . the consumpt trend have to do with a certain imag creat for the ideal consum of the product , thi can be achiev by use veri famou artist or singer in promot the product or by the use of veri beautiful women or handsom men , accord to the product consum target , which implicitli give the idea that if you use thi product you will be act as your favorit actor or singer . again it ha not anyth to do with the product itself , it is onli a creat and virtual imag . the last pilar is make the consum think that the product is done to satisfi hi or her need as if in the mass product era it is possibil to have an uniqu product made for an uniq consum . in my point of view the best way to deal with advertis is tri to consid shop as an activ necesari to satisfi the own need and not like a tool to look more trendi or more modern ,
