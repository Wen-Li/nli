it is an old statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . in my opinion thi is true for all the new old gener . alway will be an old ladi that look at some guy go to disco will be agre with thi statement . but , at the same time , i am total sure that , when she wa an athlet never-stop girl , there wa an old man tell the same to her . so thing are ! in my opinion , for the old gener , is a sort of critic to the run time . it is quit understand that an old person feel a littl envi of the freedom and enjoyful life 's style of younger peopl . of cours they have forgotten how amaz and enjoyful wa their life when they were twenti ! on the other hand , we , the last young 's gener , can not denay that time are chang and that our parent , or granpar , had much more respos and no so mani way for enjo their time . abov all , nowaday the time to enjoy never stop : everyon of evri age can have a lot of funni . it doe n't matter how old are you , if you are twenti or sixti . it is suitabl for everyon travel all around the world , gain , or lost , in to the casino , do bujing-jump , make news friend , go danc , go to concert or do all the crazi thing you want . the age is no more a problem . so the statement , now , should be rewrit as : `` old peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl do '' . support it , there are a lot of statist afferm that old peopl are enjoyng a lot their retir .
