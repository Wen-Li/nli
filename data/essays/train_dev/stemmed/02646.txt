it is often said that tour guid with mani peopl is the best way to travel becaus it is cheap and safe . howev i strongli disagre with thi opinion . thi is becaus that feel satisfact through the trip and spend time well . first of all , peopl have to be satisfi with their trip . peopl usaulli want to see , hear , eat , and feel what they want and have want when they are travel . howev , in a group tour , peopl can not experi whatev they want becaus they have to follow their guid . for exampl , when i went to pari for trip alon i unwillingli took part in a guid tour one time to go to museam . becaus museam entranc fee is cheaper for group . unfortun , i did not have satisfact with the guid tour for museam , becaus there were so mani peopl , so i could n't see all of them what i want to see and could n't get much inform what i expect . in addit , travel individaulli is better at spend valuabl time . time can not return or use again , so it is veri import how to use time . howev , in a group tour , it is easi to wast peopl 's valuabl time . to demostr , accord to the research at harvard , individu trip spend time two time more effect than grop tour . moreov accord to thi studi , peopl who travel individu is also more satisfi with their time consum and whole travel . in brief , the best way to travel is in a individaul , not in a group becaus make feel good dure trip and well time consum .
