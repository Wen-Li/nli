mani peopl consid that it is better to special in one specif subject , but in my openion , to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better . there are three reason to support my statement . peopl have broad knowledg of mani academ subject can make subject more interest , broaden their horizon , and have mani differ perspect to watch the world . although some peopl think that spcializ in one subject will make themself more profession . howev , if they do not pay much time on their studi , or think the subject is so bore , they still can not make themself profession . henc , studi in mani kind of academ subject will make peopl feel more interest , onc they enjoy what they read , then they will real understand what the book said , peopl still can becom profession . next , major in broad knowledg of mani acedem subject can broaden horizon . for exampl , if peopl just major in one subject , they onli know the field , but if they studi in mani subject , they may know histori , the foreign languag or learn hot to appreci the fine art , they will not limit what they studi . `` enjoy what i learn , then i will becom excel . '' if peopl interest in t mani kind of subject , that will broaden their vision , and it could make peopl to have differ respect to watch the wonder world . they may have posit think than those peopl special in one specif subject , bucaus peopl have broad knowledg may also have posit mind .
