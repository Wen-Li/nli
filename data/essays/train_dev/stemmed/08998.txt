mani peopl have assert that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . although thi topic can be reject from some skin-deep reason , it is a topic which is hard to answer due to it complex . in my opinion , i strongli agre thi statement . there are sever reson . first of all , most of young peopl spent their time on studi , play and exceris . moreov , those activ have obivi effect on their futur life . that 's whi most of teenag and men do n't want to spent time to help their commun . they think they ca n't get ani profit from thi action . in my hometown , student onli help their neighborhood when their school ask them to do that . second , some adult think that , it is veri danger for kid to clean or to help the commun . we can read and see mani bad news like murder or violent behavior happend in our societi everi day . accord to thi reason , we seldom see our teenag and kid help their neighborhood . there is a report say that , onli three percent of the kid in my countri have done such of work . third , there are mani worker help us to clean our commun . that is common scene in my hometown becaus our govern ha alreadi hire them to do that from a long time ago . so , young peopl do n't have to do heavi work , and they may be lack of motion to do so . by the way , young peopl also lack of effici on do such of work like clean or protec their commun becaus they wo n't get ani payment from their hardwork . of cours , some peopl who disagre with my opinion also have their own reason . howev , i 'm veri confid that my reason are more import and inde .
