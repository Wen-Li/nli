i 'm agre with the statement . succesful peopl risk , in their life , rather than the other peopl . normal peopl have n't risk in their life and they do n't like to tri new thing . to be a succesful person , instead , you ca n't stop yourself to do what you alreadi know , you have to be ambici and you have to be readi to take some risk . the person , that live their life like a movi , do n't do anyth for chang it . but the person that know what they want and fight to obtein it , they have to take some risk . the strong of the life is in the risk and in the new thing . we 've to tri all the new thing but never forgot the old thing . if you are a champion in a particulari sport you have to continu the practic everyday , but that do n't mean that you have to do onli your sport . the mind and the thought that the sky gave us are the most import weapon for the war of life . the ambici person and the person that doe n't stop himself is the person that will win in the futur . the influenc of televis should be use to talk with the person about thi topic . the movi , the song , even the literatur should be use to teach at the children the import of be ambici and the import of tring new thing . the fear of the common person is the reaction of the other peopl ( friend or even parent ) if they fail their new experi . but it is n't a problem . if you do n't do anyth , you ca n't fail . onli who doe someth can fail . and the sad of a failur is like the kiss of a wife . so when you 're sad for a filur in a new thing , you hold the hand of your wife a your smile will stai on .
