here the statemanet is correct , so i agre with it as the present day doe not have engouh time to think for oneself , how he help the commun ? so he wa not help the commun . first look for the past day , there man ha less inform to know , less luxiri , less work . there life can be lead comfort with less money . that is whi peopl involv in the communitypart , espec student or young one , bcaus life span is short . then look for th present day here the inform to know is vast , so no time to diviat . now th world is in the hand of th peopl i.e everi thing is avail . as the human desir is vast . so he end up in a wild goo chang of thing . no self satisfact , so notim to look for the other . so he never bother about the surrond world . second thing is the excess growth of popul . each citi is have the lackh of peopl , it may vari depend on the type of citi is it metropolitan or capit citi . depend on it the commun sige vari . for the such larg popul . there are mani problem and public ca n't solv iy as it requir more money . althogh collect impact may help , it is a difficult process . as everi bodi look for the govt help rather than hlping the societi is the main rout caus for the less involv in the commun work . shortli it is the increas in the popul and work schedul of student lead to decreas in the involv of commun work . then i can coclud that , the main reason that is infer is incras of burden on the everi student lead to thi . then there is need for the govt to look after thi . as the student must involv in everi thing it is the govt must easi everi thing .
