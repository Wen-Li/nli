nowaday sinc peopl are children there is a sort of competit for everyth , for a footballmatch for exampl or for a run competit or for have a better mark at school . in thi way a person alway tri to do the better of her so i think that peopl who can tri alway to win thi competit in life can have the power to becam a success person becaus they love to risk and they 're proud when they tri to pass their limit . i think also that pass ownself limit mean to make someth that it bigger and more import than do a thing well known . it 's easier to do well someth that we known than creat someth new . for exampl a normal artist can produc an accadem paint well made , that it 's also armon and pleasant to see but it remain an exercis of the hand . instead a successful peopl want to experi new thecnic , new point of view ; new color in order to realli creat someth new that noon had ever seen and in order to obtain thi , the success peopl have to risk , have to abbbandon all hi own knownoledg to adventur himself in anoth unknown world of the creation . at the end i agre with the statement also if often peolpl who risk , ca n't reach success becaus of different caus and on the other hand someon who had never tri to risk becam a success person becaus the raccomand of some import peopl .
