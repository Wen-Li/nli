`` concept are never chang '' accord to thi concept and idea behind ani materi or immateri thing never chang just they modifi but fact will chang so in my point of view i would go with to understand the idea and concept are ippmort rather than fact . in my person experi , when i wa in a school , taught by a techer how to oper the machin learn about the basic princilp and concept in oper but that time i wa not use when i grow young accident i have to oper it but i done it , so thi show how ipmort uderstand concept . it lso impor in mould career of student , onc they get acquient with concept and idea they will never forget for exampl in colleg they conduct demonstr , powerpoint present these are all driven by concept and idea fact may chang in addit to thi practic experi which also come under the categori of understand concept if we learn on ourselv never forget . for exampl in demonstrasin they they demonstr how to use a particular thing but topic may vari like fact here the demonstt is ubnderstand learn fact are not alway desir in some case , for exampl galelio prove that earth resolv around the sun thi is fact but accord to christian thoeri thi shoudnt be for he wa exceut but later on year it prove the same . so fact alway chang never worri about the fact we should understand the concept and idea
