ye , i agre to the statement that is given abov . there are mani reason and exampl , i would like to cite in support of my opinion . in everyon life , idea and concept are veri import to learn the subject . concept help them to understand and know the subject how it is develop . idea help them to get logic reason on the subject . for exampl , in consider of my life , firstli `` i will give import to undersatnd idea and concept rather than to learn fact '' . the reason are concept are key role and import to get the sunject well and good , without concept there is no subject , if we know the concept of the subject we can go ani where to it advanc level . in thi way concept play key to the subject . secondli `` idea also help in understand the subject . ingener , the subject is basic depend on the idea . the person is well recognis on the subject base on hi think abil , logic reason , and creativ . idea and creativ help the peopl to reach advanc level on the subject . not onli on the subject , if we concentr on concept and idea on ani thing we can reach the acm stage on that specif thing . but in some case , for exampl `` to develop or to get advanc level or to add accessori of ani product in the market it is compulsori to learn some fact about that previou product '' . it is secondari prefer onli , it is better to know becaus `` we can attain the best on the product '' . the reason are `` we can know the demand , public , valu of the product in the market '' . so , to reach success in one live understand idea and concept are veri import . therefor , everyon should concentr on those topic . howev , beyond concept and idea it is also import to learn fact as i had given exampl . insum , i would like to reiter my opinion that the statement is agreeabl from the abov reason and exampl .
