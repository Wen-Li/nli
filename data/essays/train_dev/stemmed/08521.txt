the understand of both idea and content are import . there is therefor , a slight differ for me that make one more import than the other . first of all when we learn about fact , whe are use our memori to get some info on somethig that work , exist and doe not requir ani further experi or resaerch . on the other hand , when student learn concept and idea , they may put them togeth with the pourpos of conduct some research . when student are curiou and have enough inform , concept and idea ; the result of their experimet could lead them to get some fact by themselv . thoma edison for exampl did not have the fact about what light repres , he had lot of idea and concept as the result of hi variou research . he wa curiou enogh to be abl to put all these factor togeth ( curios , idea , concept ) to be abl to make a wonder , revolutionati invent . an invent that creat mani everlast fact . all the modern and the new school method zero in on lead the student to the learn through hi idea and the curios these may gener on him . nowaday , i have also have the chanc to test myself and put into practic all these method . i am a person who like learn through experi and get plenti of inform by myself . achiev fact , or learn about fact on my own is import for me , but needless to say that all the exist fact you may learn about also give us abund rich of concept , idea and kwoledg . in short , idea , concept and fact are all necessari , but what realli make the differ is how effect well - structur concept can lead a student to a more self-exploratori environ . thank you .
