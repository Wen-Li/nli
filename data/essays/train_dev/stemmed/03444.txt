most peopl usual tend to tell the fact without have explain the idea and the concept . thi would have a worst impact on student . i think it is wrongli done and it would be a lot more import for student to understand idea and concept than it would be for them to learn the fact . it is so for mani reason : less genius in the world , a non evolut of the world and the promot of a non democrat system . by learn fact , the student will never gain a lot . they do not realli understand , they will certainli know what they are said , will memor it , but will never understand whi is that , make them foolish or machin with no brain . it would even be harder for him to memor the fact . but on the other hand , if he understand the idea and the concept , he would be abl to get to the fact on hi own , without have to memriz them , perfectli know what is go on . understand these concept and idea , the student work hi brain and can even think of someth new and way better . thi is how the world grow and expand and the evolut goe . the student will also learn how to work on hi own , express hiself , hi opinion and contribut to the develop of a stronger and power societi . if they just learn the fact , it mean that onli one or a few person will know the reason , give him or them the entir power over the other , the abil to make decis as he want , even if they are wrong or should not be done . i strongli agre with those who think that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact . we will build a more effect world that way , and promot the world solidar .
