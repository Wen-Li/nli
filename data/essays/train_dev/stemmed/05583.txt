i agre with the statement , that there will be fewer car in twenti year for the follow reason : the first reason is that the price of petroleum is still rise in the long-term , becaus crude oil is get more rare . so , becaus the price of petroleum is get higher , drive is get more expens over time . in twenti year , the price of petroleum will be much more higher than today . mayb , the car then will receiv their power of other raw materi , but today , it is not sure that there will be a substitut for petroleum in twenti year , which is as function as petroleum . anoth argument for the declin of car are citi . becaus peopl still migrat from the countrysid to citi , they are get bigger and bigger all over the world . as the citi are grow , the traffic chao is grow too . today , in mani citi it is much cheaper and faster to use the public transport such as metro and buss . thi effect will get stronger over the year as the citi are grow . the other point is , that less peopl will live at the countrysid , in region , where a car is a necessar for the daili life . the pollut of the environ is the third reason whi the amount of car will be smaller in twenti year . as long there is no other sourc of power invent , petroleum will be use in car . but in these day the concern about the environment chang in the last year are get bigger and it is prove that the burn of petroleum contribut to some effect for exampl the lighten of the ozon . so probabl stronger environment law will be made , which could have affect on the amount of car driven if they make it more difficult or more expens to drive . becaus of the reason given , i think that there will be fewer car in twenti year than there are today .
