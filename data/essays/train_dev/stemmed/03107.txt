some peopl argu as if it wa a gener truth that there would be fewer car in use than there are today , so there wa no need for me to put ani emphasi on what the disadvantag of car were . but to the frank , i did not agre with the titl statement . there were numor reason whi i held no confid on them , and i would explor onli a few primari one here . the first reason for my choic could be obvious seen that the price of the car had been more and more cheaper in recent year . becaus mani car compani reduc their price in order to attract custom and got the ideal profit . and they would not care about what bad influenc the car would bring about . the second reason for thi problem could be involv that peopl had more free money to buy car with the improv of live level of peopl . perhap , a famili with three person had three car for each one . moreov , in some peopl 's mind , the car wa a sign of social posit and power author . of cours , i also design that the vehicl had a coupl of merit , such as convini , save time and so on , these ware the aspect of itself that could attract peopl to buy it . the last fact show that the gover did not have the law which were rel with car and had ever never to restrict the number of vehicl . although everybodi knew that the car would make pollut in our countri , there were still so mani peopl to buy car and the gover did noth about it by law . as far as i wa concern , i came to the notion that i did not support that in twenti year there would be fewer car in use than there are today . i put my standpoint to believ that there are more vehicl in the furtur .
