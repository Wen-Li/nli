the role of a student is learn as much as possibl from older idea to creat is own one . then he need to relat that idea with an older idea to learn it . but to do that is import understand the concept that gave origin to that idea . becaus the idea is base in concept that are observ due to an especif situat . for exampl if we want to creat a research project we motiv our studi due to the knowledg that we obtain from book or past research . but the idea that wa creat due to that knowledg are base in similaritit that we observ or some fact that are present in the area of interest . so , for that reason i think an student need to learn but more import is understand the fact that form those concept but mo for that reason i disagre with the statement present here .
