i do n't think that thi statement is correct . in germani young peopl have the choic between `` zivildienst '' and the `` bundeswehr '' . most young peopl say `` no i do n't wa n't to go to the armi ( bundeswehr ) '' and instead spend nine `` social month '' ( zivildienst ) in for exampl hospit or `` altenheim '' a place where old peopl can go and where they live until the end of there live . in that nine month , everi young person can help their commun and the hole societi . in germani the social sector wouldn'i be abl to surviv without these `` zivildienstleistend '' , the guy who do n't want to go to the armi . i for myself did n't want to go to the armi becaus they could't tell my when i can go there and when i would be finish . so i decid that i make these `` social nine month '' . these nine month gave me the oppertun to help old peopl , speak and listen to him and to give them a good feel . it mayb sound craci , but old peopl are reali happi when they see me come . often they are left alon , nobodi of there famili come to visit them so they are happi to have someon to talk with . i also think that there are mani young peopl who do a lot without ear money for it . in my freetim i play handbal in a club and everi year we organ a big parti where about 600 peopl have alway ( ! ) a lot of fun . to organ such a event you need a lot of peopl and everybodi help to make thi possibl again , year after year . what i want to say with thi is veri simpl . the money that is earn with thi parti is spend for the smalest children in the club . they get new ball or tshirt . all the money is spend for a good use . here thi is call social engag and i think the differ form of engag are also under the young part of the societi still not dead . a lot of young person want to tell the older one there idea to help and to make the differ event much better for everyon . anoth exampl in my opinion is the pope visit in colon at the `` world child day '' . over 500.000 young peopl want to see pope benedikt . that show me that on the one hand religion is not dead ( inst it come back ! ) and on the other hand that a lot of young peopl whant to `` push '' societi and there commun forward . in the last time you can hear much ofter guy that want to publish there opinion to take influenc at the public mean . i think young peopl do a lot more to help there commun as in the past , even if the way young peopl chose is often not that understud as young peopl want to .
