one of the main problem of the scholast system in itali is the huge program we have for all the subject we have to learn . i can say for my own experi that the most of the inform they give us at school is forgiven immedi after we studi them . i complet agre with the statement , it is more import for student to understand idea . a famou italian writer onc sayd that what we call cultur is not what we rememb to have studi at school , but the mix of all the experi and of all the idea we have and it doe n't matter if we do n't rememb some stupid detail about someth we studi year and year ago . in my opinion a good teacher should tri to guid a student throught histori ( for exampl ) not fill hi head with date or name of ancient emperor and fact , but just tri to passion that student talk about the differ between our life and life of that time , tri to bring the student in a fantast world with the wand of fantasi . of cours we can say the same for the most of the subject , but with some except like for mathemat or phisic . moreov , we can forget learn fact , even becaus they could not match with our everyday life so that we could never have the opportun to recal that fact to our mind but we can be sure that if we have learn the idea of someth we 'll never let it out . it is more import for student to have the tast of thing and thi allow to have passion and interest . in conclus italian school ( but i 'm pretti convinc it is a problem felt in other country ) should give valu to it student , just the sens of how mani thing we do n't know and open the door to infinit world student should explor by theyrselv depend on theyr interest .
