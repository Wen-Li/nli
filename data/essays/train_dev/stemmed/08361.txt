i agre thi statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . it is becaus the young have much physic energi , they can tri what they want , and they can make use of that experi for the futur life . first , the young are endow with power energi more than the old . becaus they are on grow in case of children and keep go to live , they have physic energi . becaus they have much energi , they can do mani activ in a day . for exampl , they go to school , particip in club activ , and have other extra possibl such as to talk with friend , to studi , and so on . in contrast , the old can not all of those staff in a day becaus of their lack of energi , compar to the young . becaus they have enough energi , the young can work a lot and get knowledg and experi from there . second , the young can tri whatev they want . for exampl , the young who have dream can tri to make that come true . they can use time , devot themselv , and tri to expand their abil . in such case , the life becom realli effici and briliant . they have what they want and actual there is possibl , and they can tri . the possibl are unlimit and the young can tri those over and over again . howev , the old can not do that becaus their remain life time is possibl limit . last , the young can use the experi to benefit their futur live . after trial , even if they are not succes for that dream , they learn from the attempt and get life experi . in addit to that , becaus they have enough time after that , they can make use of that fruit experi and can make their live much better . the old , howev , have limit time for their life and can not do that . the old have abund exprienc and mayh have children and grand children to teach that experi . nevertheless , they no not have time to expand that experi by themselv . abov all , i believ that the young enjoy life more than the older peopl . becaus their potenti and energi are limittess , they can do mani work and thing much more than older peopl .
