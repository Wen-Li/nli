i agre with the statement that , `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . '' my opinion about thi topic is base on person experi as well as person opinion . who ha not seen an advertis that appeal to his/her own need and want ? furthermor , i will go a step further and say that i am sure that almost everyon ha bought a product becaus he/sh rememb an advertis about it . advertis are temptou and play with the custom 's emot . in addit , the way they are put togeth they appeal to the viewer ' eye ; it make them want to have whatev is display on the advertis . in the center of advertis is usual a woman with a perfect bodi , few cloth , a big smile . moreov , thi kind of advertis make woman want to be her and men want to get her . at thi point the product be sold is not as import as the emot involv in the advertis . for exampl an advertis for a cigarett compani sell a cancer stick to peopl by present a tan , attract , and good-look woman with a glow cigarett in her hand on a huge billboard . do peopl realli want to start smoke or rather be as good-look as the woman . now , thi support the fact that the advertis make the product seem much better than they realli are . anoth point to be made in thi commentari about the statement is that even is peopl do not tri to be influenc by the product sold on advertis , they are still influenc by them . as soon as peopl leav their hous they are surround by advertis on huge billboard , on truck drive by , on school blackboard , or in magazin and newspap . these advertis will store subconsci . if peopl then go to the croceri store to make their weekli suppli they will rememb what they saw on the billboard . they might buy those product and recogn that what they bought wa not as good as they thought it would be . they are surpris by the fact that the advertis sold them thi product and , more import , made it look better than it actual wa . in conclus , it seem athat in today 's world we are surround and enclos by advertis and peopl who tri to sell thing . thi is the reason whi it is hard to distinguish whether the product be sold is actal worth buy or if it is just tri to trick our eye . it is import for peopl to recogn that not everyth advertis will have exactli the same effect on everybodi or will tast the same way to everyon . but also i had to make the experi first befor i recogn that `` advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
