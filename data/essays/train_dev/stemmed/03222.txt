let me begin by state that dure your studi at univers , for instanc in econom , you will get cours , which contain a lot of theoret content and it 's hard to understand and rememb all those differ theori from famou scientist or manag etc. for your final exam . the first fact to mention is that , if you understand those difficult theori of what your lectur is tell you dure a cours , it will be much easier to rememb it for learn for your final exam at the end of the semest . certainli , you can recap dure the last prepar day by use your script and paper and keep it in mind . but doe thi garante that you pass the exam . propabl not , becaus it is typic that you get ask about the realtion between differ theori . when you have understood , what the main theori is about you can easili answer such question . but there is also a point against thi opinion . there are alway cours content , which are not understand . i know , thi sound unusu . but for exampl in math , there are formula for which you would need day to get it , how they were develop . but if you learn them by heart , you can simpli use them in differ type of excercis . in thi case , it would be veri intens to understand it , wherea you can simpli adopt it on sever issu . besid that , there is anoth arguement for understand , instead of just learn these fact . if you understand all thi comlic theoric content of a model you need to know , it will be much easier to use them in your later life . for instanc when you get a job in a research compani , you can simpli use your knowledg to fullfil your task , you are suppos to do . anoth exampl would be a other cours , in which you are talk about thing that are familiar to thi special model you have complet understand and in mind . then you can use your knowledg to understand the next topic . you can say , that you inceras your knowledg by use your old knowledg . in conclus , i certainli can say that i support thi opinion and alway have thought the same way like the person , who ha said thi . becaus if you learn someth by heart , i 'm 99.99 percent sure that you will have forgot it complet a week after the exam and as i alreadi mention , if you understand the main content of a theori you can mank use of it in everi case you have to and you also do n't have to learn it that much ( mayb you do n't have to ) , becaus you will have it alreadi in mind .
