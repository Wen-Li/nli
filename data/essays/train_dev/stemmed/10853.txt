i do not agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . instead , i feel it the other way round . it the old peol who have an opportun to enjoy their live rather than the young one . there are variou reason which justifi my posit . first , a young guy would alway have a lot to think . he would be worri about hi career . he know it a crucial time for him which shall shape hi futur . he spend most of hi time plan and think . a lot of hi effort goe into thi . sinc , an old person would be through with thi phase of hi life , he will not have ani tension relat to career as such . he ha achiev what he want to and could now enjoy hi success . secondli , when a person is young he 's know that he ha to take care of hi famili . he know he is the bread earner . thi fact of life doe n't allow him to savor hi youth . he spend hi time work in offic or runninng busi to cater to hi familiy 's need . on the other hand older peopl donot have to work . they have retir and free to enjoy their live . third , a young person is still learn to surviv in the world . he doe n't have all the wisdom and exeri to deal with the difficult situat which an older person would have . from childhood to youth , he learn how to adjust , deal with relationship and handl pressur . for the young , the life is full of hardship and he 's lear to find hi way through . forth , it a time when a person get marri . it 's said , a right marriag can make you and a wrong one can destroy . the person need to develop that level of matur and understand to deal with hi spous . he doe compromis , make it a not so easi life for him . on the other hand , have live so mani year togeth , older peopl have develop that understand . thi leav them with a good partner to enjoy their live with . undoubt , accord to me , when a person is young he 's build a platform for hi older life . a platform on which when he grow old , he can live and relish life and can enjoy thing which he miss when he wa young .
