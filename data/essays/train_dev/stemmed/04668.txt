i do n't agre with thi statement that `` there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . in today 's fast life , as no one ha time even for breakfast , and time for more competet and hurri ha come for everyon . i think there will be more need of car in come next twenti year , becaus life will becom more advanc than today . first , peopl use car for go differ place such as school , colleg , work place or ani other place such as go for a trip with famili or friend . go on a trip with famili or friend is not possbil without car , we will not enjoy if we will not go by car . if we will go by train or ani other way , i think we will not enjoy our trip more . thi prove that use of car can not be stop , and it will becom more and more in the come year . and one import thing is that peopl are go toward luxouri life more in come year . second , as competit is grow more and more between peopl of the same or differ organ , they need to manag their time fastli and effect so , they use car and use of car can not be stop in the come year . in a daili routin busi peopl , job worker , self employ everyon need a person car so that they can use that on their person level . in morn they go to their offic , from offic to their met at differ place and then again return to home at late night . these all is not possibl without the use of car . overal , i think that as long as life will go on the use of car will go on on and in the come year it use will becom more .
