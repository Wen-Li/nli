for my live countri , i agre in twenti year there will bd fewer car in use than there are today . i have two point support that , the more conveni public transport and the oil more expens . firstli , in my live countri , taiwan , there is a smaller place than most of counti . it spend 5 or 6 hour from north to sounth . if you want to around the iland , it just take 2 or 3 day . becaus of that , taiwan have good public transport system . if you want to go thi place to anoth place far away downtown , you just have to check which bu you can take you to the place you want , enev you have not one choos . you can choos the way you want , like take bu or by train . if you want to go to thi place to anoth place in downtown , you still not need to walk , you can take mrt . it can take you to everywher you want . for exampl , i live in hsingshin . i must go to taipen for toefl test . all i need to do is take train and mrt , i can arriv the place . secondli , the oil is more and more expens . if we have car , we must pay mush money for use oil . the priec of oil will becom more expens in the furtur . it will cost lot of money for oil . if we do not have car , we do not worri about those kind of problem . that will help us save much money . for exampl , mani peopl want to buy the car which can use oil effectivili . if we take public transport system , we can share the rise up priec of oil . that may not cost a lot . by those two reanson , i agre in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
