i am agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather then onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . becaus i beliv that if we want to be success in life then we have to take risk in our life . we need to learn to take risk and also need to learn that how we can get success in that . if we just spend our whole life do just one thing , then at the some stage of your life you will get bore of it . and i think it make lot of differenc that if we do someth from our bottam of hart , and we do someth becaus we have to do it and we dont have ani other opat . for exampl in my backhom which is india . we have a one veri well known personalti call mr.ambani . he start hi bis with one small factori of wash powder , then he expend hi biness and in ten year he wa the owner of the biggest powder factori in india . he did not stop there then he invest hi money in cloth factori . eventhough there is veri tuff compit in indian cloth market he took a risk and in after seven year of hi hard work he wa the owner of the biggrst indian cloth compni . he still didnt stop and again he took risk by invest hi money in indian petrolium market . and beliv me or not after hi and hi compni hard work he is owe biggest pertolium compni in india . at the present time he is owe corpor which includ six india biggest compni . in hi 30 year of crrier he face lot of problem and ton of diffuclti but he never fear from that and look back . he alway took a risk and as result today he is cover most of the indian market and gain profit in trilon . hi achiv help him and india a lot to make hi identeti in world . if he though that one factori is enfough then the seen today is someth differ , but he do n't . that whi i beliv that you will get success onli if you put your money , your life in risk . and if ypu do know that how to get out of it and how start make profit from anyth . alway rememb when there is a will there is a way . you just have to find it .
