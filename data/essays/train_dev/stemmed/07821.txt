mani peopl in my countri believ that learn fact for the student are more import than understand idea and concept becaus when they student learn a lot of fact , it seem that they look intellig and in gener they get good grade on their test in school . howev , i do not agre with thi idea becau when it come to learnig , understand idea and concept allow us to use them outsid classroom in a real societi . besid , they enabl us to explain and develop the reason and the way of the fact . first of all , when we understand idea and concept , we can use these idea when we leav our school . in other word , we can adapt them when we work and when we do some research . for exampl , if in englsih classroom you just memor some grammar to take a test , you easili forget what you learn and memor after take the test . in the contrari , if you understand whi and how thi grammar is right or not , you will not forget thi theori even after take the test . moreov , when you speak and write english , you can util the theori you have learn . therefor , understand is more usful for the more studi and the other area . secondli , understand idea and concep allow us to explain and develop an other concept in the futur . in other word , it devot the develop of subject through do the research base on the concept and theori that peopl have learn . for instanc , when a graduat student want to do some research in math , the student ha to understand the concept and idea of math . and then , he start to do some research to develop the concept or idea that he want to prove . moreov , he can discov a new theori which is use in the world . thi is thank to the accumul of understand idea and concept on hi math area . in conclus , undersatnd idea nad concept in some area is much more import than leran fact becasu it is help to use and develop it outsid classroom sinc it help peopl to be creativ .
