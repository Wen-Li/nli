peopl start lean , observ and think at the earli age . in school , they express their opinion and exchang their idea . some might have differ opinion from other , while other tend to think in a same way . it is import to pay attent to other 's opinion and understand them . you do not need to accept it , but to approach other 's idea also can help you have varieti of idea . i beleiv that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first of all , lean other 's idea and concept prevent from becom a self-cent person . in fact , how you interact with your classmat and teacher in school ha a huge impact on the way of think . if you are more like to wonder the process of the result , you would be abl to think a lot more than other who just want to know fact . know fact is also suffici , but the point is that just learn fact can develop your knowledg and earn good score on exam , but you would not gain the abil to think more deepli . as a result , when you becam an adult and work , you would not be abl to adapt to a societi you belong to . it is valuabl to know how to exhang the idea when you are a stude secondli , creation is more import that know fact . by understand idea and concept would help you find new way , and creat new thing . if you know onli one way to think about thing , you would not innov anyhitng . in conclus , with these two view , i strongli agre with the idea that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
