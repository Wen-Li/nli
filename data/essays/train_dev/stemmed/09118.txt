it is import to know both the idea and concept as well as the fact . of courc the idea of a topic or a problem make it easier to understand and to rememb it but it take much longer to be taught thi concept . so sometim it is easier to learn onli fact even if they are dri and bore . it depend on what you have to do with the inform , wether if you have to write an assey about that or if it is just for your own gener knowledg . to know fact is sometim import when you are talk to or discuss with other peopl . to show them in a short time that you have a big knowledg about differ subject , you will need fact . to come back to the idea and concept i can say that if you have a big interest in someth it is not enough just to know about the fact . also for yourself you want to know more and understand the whole thing . if you have exam in thi topic , it is much easier to answer the ask question becaus you have the background . for myself i prefer to learn idea and concept . i am studi and at the univers it is veri import to understand the problem . the exam are veri difficult and hard . so if you are not prepar and onli know the fact , you are lost . but sometim if i read the newspap or watch tv , i tri to rememb short fact . usual i do not have the time to read about everi topic too long so i just rememb the most import thing . after that i know what other peopl are talk about , not at all but i can understand the problem or topic becaus of the learn fact . to sumer i would say that idea and concept are import to know when it is your courc or work . but fact are good to know for social relat .
