i do agre with the statement . fact are import abov all as exampl or express of the concept wich is behind them . fact are for sure import becaus they can explain thing . they can help rememberimg a thing ; they can focus the attenct on a peculiar aspect of the subject , can be helpful to explain or captur the idea wich they follow . you can remeb all the fact that you like , but if you had well understand concept you will be abl to recombin them in differ and origin way . you may be abl anal even differ situat follow the same concept . to explain better my point of view i 'll take some accadem subject as exampl . for istanc it is not import , to me , rememb date and hour of everi singl battl as long as you can remeb how the war went , whi it broke out , who were fite and whi . in histori what it is crucial is the gener set of the period . anoth good exampl can be even a scientif subject as the chemistri . it is not essenti to remeb wich specif salt and wich peculiar base are combin ( fact ) , as long as you rember the way the reaction goe and wich is the result ( concept ) . reffer to enoth subject as sociolog what it is import , for exampl , it is to rememb that someon 's behaviour can be modifi by the societi 's respons to hi action . keep in mind everi singl possibl societi 's reaction it is not that crucial . to resum my point of view in few world : if i can prope understand the concept and the idea of what i 'm learn i will be abl even to elabor them and to use it even in differ suituat . i can recombin concept in differ way , i can adapt them to a varieti of sistuat i might need to anal .
