i disagre with the statement that idea and concept are more import than fact for student . actual from my point of view , fact are the same import just as idea and concept . first , without fact , how come the idea and concept ? idea and concept can not be separ from fact . for exampl , when we learn the concept of forc in physic , student need to do experi to be awar of the fact that there are differ kind of forc everywher in the world . the teacher will confus the student if he or she just draw a simbol and point it to them , then say `` look , it is what we call forc '' . by do thi , the teacher is at the rick of be fire . second , student should not just get the idea and the concept but also know the detail fact in order to pass the exam . for exampl , in a exam of a biolog cours , student should rememb the exact exampl of anim in order to describ the progress of reproduct . i can not imag a person can write down all the materi the teacher want without ani fact . although there may some exam which allow student to take book with them , rememb the exact fact benifit the student pretti much , becaus ttey can save the time spent on refer to the book . third , student should learn fact in order to find a good job in some case . for exampl , i major in comput scienc and it involv a lot of program . the mathemat concept and idea do help me learn theori of comput . howev , it is the time when i tri to find a job that i realiz that fact such as the paramet of the comput do me a big favor to find a job as a programm . in conclut , while idea and concept are import in learn , fact are of the same weight to student .
