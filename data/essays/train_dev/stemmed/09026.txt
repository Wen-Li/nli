i disagre with thi statement . thi statement is n't true for all young peopl . in my church commun there are mani young peopl besid me who enjoy help . i have been be a scout leader for four year . i give my free time to care for children , to think about game which i can play with them and to help them if there is ani problem . i dont get ani money for thi , i do thi becaus i like it and have fun almost alway . of cours there are situat where i am nerv and tire of entertain children , but all bad emot vanish if you could make these kid happi . so it depend on the educ and the surround of a young peolp wether he ( or she ) is will to help hi ( or her ) commun . not all peolp have thi social ambit that i have . i can imagin there are peopl who onli want e.g. to get a high paid job or to be the best in the class etc . they want to obtain their goal without care for other peopl . but i think that there were alway such peopl who dont care . when i read thi statment , i wonder what enough mean . who determind what or how much help is enough ? i think there is n't a right answer . everyon should find out for theirselv what time to help they would like to spend . consid job which are paid there are other point . all men who dont want to go to the armi have to do social work for one year . they have to care for disabl human or veri poor peopl . my brother ha to do thi at the moment and he doe hi job at the social meet point of the main railway station . he tell me about the differ kind of peopl and live he wa get to know . i think he is do enough for the commun and hi work is n't easi . in my opinion peopl who have never done a piec of social work indep from the kind of work miss some import , character-form and great experi .
