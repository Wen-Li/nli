in my opinion the statement is true . actual everybodi should have a wide knowledg of a lot of academ subject than to special in onli one field . first , if you have a wider knowledg it will use yourself a lot becaus it support you in the admiss for the univers or in a futur job . a lot of peopl will know after talk to other if somebodi ha a wider knowledg or not . and if you have an interview for a job or an admiss interview at univers , your knowledg can lead you to your goal a good job or admiss . second if you have a good knowledg you can understand much more subject and world problem than if you would not have it . and that will make your world more interest . also can you assist by question from your friend , parent or rel and that give you more self confid and make you more and more a respect partner . also will it develop your logic think and thi point will lead to a greater knowledg again . futhermor , a good and wide knowledg will rest you a live time . and i think the more and more peopl learn and know about academ subject , there life becom more interest and they will also discov new interest . like the museum , theatr , read the newspap , book etc . thi will make your world more colour as if you onli would live in your four wall , with your sole special subject . what if you will meet other peopl who do not know anyth about your specif subject , which interest discuss can you lead . to sum up , i prefer have a broad knowledg of mani academ skill than just be special onli in one specif academ subject . i think it is the better way to lead your life . becaus your knowledg can help you anywher and in ani situat .
