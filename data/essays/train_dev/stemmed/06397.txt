i believ that everi one have an experi of watch or listen to a advertis . do you ever think those advertis realli play and import role for their product ? or are those product seem much better than they realli are ? in my point of view , advertis realli work well for those who make the busi , it motiv cunsum to purchas on their item , but if we take a close look at some commerci on the tv , their alway present you the posit side of their product , instead of the thing that have left behind , for exampl , we often see some shampoo commerci on tv , use those ladi with long hair show you that if you use thi brand of shampoo you will have the same shine hair as the ladi have on the commerci . thi obvious is not true , on the tv they are put on some chemic that make their hair look smoothli and shine , but not the realli affect that cuse by the real product that they persuad the consum to buy . that 's whi i highli do n't agre with the commerci . anoth exampl , if we go on shop at some supremarket , you will see all kind of delici imag on the pace , like forzen pizza , thi imag show you that it got varieti of ingredi on it and the size of the pizza . we might think thi is what the pizza go to be look like after i take back home and cook it , but infortuantli it 's not what you thought , those imag are onli look good on the pack for cosum to buy it , in order to get the profit form the consum . so would you still believ in those advertis ? these advertis might have a good look on the outsid , but what realli in the insid we 'll never abl to know . so think care befor you purchas , do n't let those unreal imag affect you and take away you money .
