i am complet agre with the idea that older peopl enjoy life less than the younger one do . actual i reach that idea as i grow up and as i thought about my earli and middl childhood . becaus while consid my life most of the tome i notic that i wa enjoy life more than i do know becaus of sever reason . to begin with , the younger you are the less respons you have , in my opinion that is the first reason behind the fact that as peopl get older they enjoy life less . for instanc i am a collag student now and i have lot of task to be carri out . for instanc , i have lot of exam to studi , lot of homework to do , lost of money to earn for make my life and etc. howev when i wa younger everyth wa easier than the present . my parent were do most of the tging for me and lot of time i had to enjoy life . secondli , i think as peopl get older there is less thing that arous excit and enjoy in peopl 's life . again when i have a look at my earli year there wa much to discov , learn and evetu excit about . for instanc ` which univers i will be in the futur ' wa one of the most import question that made my mind busi and kept me excit about the life . howev as time pass i wa the at the univers that i desir and work hard for , howev there wa noth to be excit for anymor , everyth wa so clear that i have n't thought about it again . i mean that as peopl discov new thing veri a few remain in the rest of the life and that caus peopl to enjoy life less . final , i think as peopl get older their energi also decreas and that final caus them to avoid some enjoy activ . for instanc the concert , the long trip and bung jump , beach parti , rock climb and so on , becom some of the activ which the older peopl reluctat to join becaus of their lack of energi .
