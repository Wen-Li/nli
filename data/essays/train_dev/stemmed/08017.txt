althoug there are still mani young peopl who are veri engag in their commmun , i agre that in gener they do n't provid enough help . especi by observ the intens need for help in mani commun becaus of less support from the govern it is clear to me that there should be much more young peopl engag themselv in their commun . nevertheless , i have the strong impress that the interest in social activ ha decreas among young peopl . thi ha three basic reason . first , i am convinc that the decreas of import of religion in the modern societi ha caus a more egoist approach in life of young peopl . sinc there is less religi educ , provid moral valu , the emphasi is put on person succ but not on help other . thu , it appear that help the commun for mani young peopl is a minor goal in live than egoist aim . therefor there are less young peopl who are help their commun by take part in social work of the church . furthermor , young peopl are also less interrest in polit . threfor the young peopl spend their time with other thing like person amus and do not tri to realis their polit and social view in their commun . for exampl in the gener of my parent there were regular polit debat in their town , where also young peopl made propos for social project and also particip in such action to realis their polit aim . lastli , i believ that live in big citi prevent young peopl of help there commun . although there is a lot of social work to do especi in big citi , onli a few young peopl are tri to improv the situat becaus they probabl feel anonym in big citi and can not identifi with social weaker peopl . apart from that there is also a lack of group feel in big citi . consequ the young peopl do not experi life as live in a commun and are therefor less motiv to offer their help .
