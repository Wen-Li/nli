i disagre with thi point of view . nowaday with the fast develop in medic field , social environ and the advanc concept toward the good old day , more and more older peopl are enjoy the pleasur of the daili life and the proport of older one keep on rise in recent year . older peopl as well as young peopl are enjoy the improv life . first , i think older peopl have more leisur than young peopl . young peopl have to struggl to get enough money to maintain a life in the daytim and go on to studi in the night colleg and other train system , which provid them with the technic necessari for their work . in contrast to them , old peopl do n't need to go to the compani everyday to strive for money due to the fund suppli by the govern and they do n't need to be punish by boss for not finish the work properli . what they need to do is just to lie in the sofa , watch tv or go to meet the former companion and call on at friend ' hous . what a wonder life ! second , older peopl gain happi by think about what they have acheiv dure the adult time . but the young have no time to consid thi and they are experienc failur everyday . therefor , they are surround by pain , sorrow and ani ohther unpleas thing , which constantli appear . the older have no risk to compet with other , leav the young peopl to be engag in the competit world . last but not least , the old one enjoy the care given by their son or duaghter . in china , everi child , when grow up , must commit the respons to look after their parent . their children will bring money , fruit or other wonder thing to the old but they themselv have to spend time teach their own littl chdren . gener older peopl enjoy almost everyth given in the old day . as the whole environ is improv rapidli , more and more older peopl will realiz what an excel life we have receiv .
