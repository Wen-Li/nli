in my opinion it is true that young peopl are start to have lot of differ distract that are separ them from mani interest activ and respons as help their commun . but it is someth that have been increas sever year ago . the develop of new technolog as internet , mobil , televit , dvd , comput game , etc , have extend anoth ambit and purpos in life . nowday teenag prefer to sit in front of a dvd player or play with their mobil instead share some even in some commun where all kind of activ or servic are plan . first of all , i think one of the reason is the educ that they are receiv from their parent and from the school . it seem to be more import to know how to use internet than which wa the last book that they read . secondli in thi commun the should tri to attrack teenag offer them differ kind of activ which could make them interest in go to thi communinti and particip . for exampl , organ : concert ( all type of music : classic , pop , rock ... ) , footbal game or other kind of sport , creat a librari which would includ : internet , book , cd 's , dvd 'd ; also tri to perform some play or go to the theatr . also know much more about the place that they live and the enviro in gener not just the group or the citi that they live . at last , when young peopl can enjoy in thi enviro they will be veri excit and veri decid to colabor in ani kidn of activ or help that the commun can creat or organ . my conclus is that if the commun present a good rang of attract and new activ ani youn peopl will be so happi to colabor in the well be og the commun
