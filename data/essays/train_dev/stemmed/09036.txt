nowaday , an increas number of peopl like travel . someon said that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , becaus the guid know the place deepli than the travel , and a group of peopl will make more fun . but other think that travel with one or two peopl without a tour guid is more comfert . and i 'm one of them . first of all , if you have a tour guid and a group of compani , you will feel not veri free . travel with a tour guid , the plan will be formerli order , someth you want to see a other thing or want to go to anoth place will not be allowed . you ca n't chang the plan . but for me , the plan which is order by the travel compani or the tour guid is not the plan i realli like , but i ca n't chang , becaus of the whole groud . that make me feel veri upset . and a larg mount of peopl will have a larg mount of oppinion . it 's difficult to recogn the idea . and some peopl will not follow the rule . onc i join a travel group , but we have to wait for one or two peopl all the time after visit some sceneri . i felt that 's a wast of my time . then , travel with a group by a tour guid is alway veri busi , you ca n't visit one thing in a comfert way , there 's onli limit time that you can stay in one place . the whole journey is in a quick pace that you ca n't enjoy it . and most of the tour guid will let you to some place whice they will get benifit from it . but thi kind of place realli wast our life . as a result , as for as i am concern , i think travel onli will one or two best friend or rel without a tour guid is more free and comfert .
