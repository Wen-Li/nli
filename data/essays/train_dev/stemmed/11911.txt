thi question is make me to think . young peopl are give enough time to help their commun . i beliv they dont . i can explain my view with mani point . some of them are as below . young peopl in today world are busi in themselv . they start work at earli age . most of them studi and work as a part time . they are mainli focus on studi and work . they don t have time to thing about their commun . they dont consid it is import for them to help their commun . they don t care about other . they are clueless about their life and their duti toward their commun . for e g if you ask ani young person what he want to do to the commun . he will replay that they don t have time for that . basic they are busi with someth which is not valuabl . they are busi with their own interest . some of them enjoy go out , travel everi week end , goin out to parti and spend their weekend do noth but enjoy . then they want toclaim that they don t have time . it is veri difficult task to make them underst that they owe some respons toward the commun they belong to . have not enough time is not the real reason for that . basic they don t have help attitud in them . we should help them to realiz that they can get time if they want . if there is will they can . accord to my opinion it s parent duti to make them understand their duti toward their commun . they should take out somr tiom from their schedul and use that time to help their commun . it is their duti and they should do it without ani reason . they are live here .
