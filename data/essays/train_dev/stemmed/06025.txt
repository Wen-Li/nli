sinc the serial manifactur of car , they had becom a realli import part of human live , as they decreas the time requir for transport . as peopl 's need for transport will not decreas , it is realli hard to say that there will be fewer car in the near futur . peopl use car in their everyday live and , for peopl today , it is hard to imagin ani period of time without car . there had been other form of transport in the past , but ; none ha been use as frequent as modern car . one could claim that a newer form of transport may evolv . some peopl even say that , we may be abl to teleport in the near futur , howev ; thi suggest ha yet onli live in scienc fiction book . therefor , in the near futur , as near as twenti year , peopl are unlik to see a newer form of invent that will close the era of modern car . car ' look , type of fuel they use or their engin system may chang , but ; after all , they will still be car . even if car began not to move on four wheel , but ; instead , start to fli ; as we see in scienc fiction movi like `` back to the futur '' , they would still be call `` car '' . that is becaus , they will still be belong to an individu and be use just like the way we use them today . as state befor , their way of work , that is ; their engin system , ignit type , fuel etc. may chang ; howev , they will still be `` the person transport devic '' . as a result , when we look at the 20th and the begin of 21st centuri , it is almost imposs to see car vanish from the market all of a sudden . lot of peopl are happi with thi as well , as long as oil price are kept at a reason price . mayb , the 22nd centuri will becom free of car and car addict would sure be glad that they are not to see those time .
