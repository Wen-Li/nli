i disagre with the opinion that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today even besid in all over the world now , we are consid about the enviro , and oil is decreas now . i know that there were some agreement about the ga produc by car . car are veri bad for enviro becaus they run with ga which pollut earth 's air . mani countri promis that they are go to reduc ga which is from car in present day . my countri , japan also did and now we are tri to do thi plan . howev , i never see thi success and peopl who are use car do not care about it at all . i also hear that oil is not go to take anymor . now , most of car in thi world run with oil . actual there are electrin car , but it is unus to use becaus it take time to make car run so we still use a car run with oil . i think that there still will be some oil in twenti year . car are absolutli useful . we can go to anywher in anytim by car . peopl live in metolopoli might not need car , but peopl live in rural area have to use car to live in . they live in far away from groce store , mall , and place they work at . needless to say , we need indivisu car . we can not use public system such as buse , train becaus it may be faster to transport than we use public transport . in addit , most of us will keep use indivisu car . i think that there are not thing which we can reduc car use becaus we do not care enviro , we care onli ourselv , electron car are not use , i do not think electron car is becom use , and actual peopl realli need car .
