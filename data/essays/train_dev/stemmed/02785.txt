it is a fact that car are part of our daili live . and you can not deni that we do need them , but if we will look in the furtur ; are there go to be more or less car use by human be in twenti year ? i would say that there wo n't be mani car left on street worldwid , for the follow reason . firstli , technic and it expert constantli develop new technolog . who know which transport possibl are there go to be in twenti year ? nobodi of the nineteenth centuri had ever dare think that human are go to fli or even fli to the moon in the twentieth centuri . may be all peopl are not drive anymor in the futur , but they are fli with littl u-boat ? secondli , as our environ is nearli total damag due to pollut and car , i do hope that peopl will recognis how import our environ is , and will forget about use car . without ani doubt it is the car industri which is mostli respons for the damag made on earth . if peopl do n't stop pollut our environ , there wo n't be an earth left where we can life . and thirdli , car are expens . they are even so expens that peopl can hardli afford them . and the car industri is definetli not make car to be good for the environ , but to make profit . and thi situat is not about to chang in the futur . on the other hand , we need our car . without have a car your daili life will turn into chao . we are completli depend on them if we want to go shop , go to work or even if we want to go on holiday . the argument of peopl be lazi doe support the idea of car be part of human live , even stronger . nobodi realli want to walk , if there is a chang of drive to a place . final , a car is simpli a symbol of wealth . most peopl do own two or three expens car just to show that they , in contrast to other , can afford have expens car . as a conclus , i am convinc that car are help and will alway be help in the futur . but what consequ might there be if we do not reduc the use of them ?
