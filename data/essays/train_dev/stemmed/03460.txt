my best travel wa the travel without a tour guid . the travel is still good memori even it wa long time ago and i will never forget it . i believ that the best way to travel is a travel plane and made by myself from three reason . one reason is befor the travel . befor the travel , i need to decid where to go , where to stay , and what to do . from that moment , the travel ha alreadi start . it is enjoyn to find the best travel which fit to myself . i also can find the cheapest travel by look at the internet . i like to spend more money in eat than stay the good hotel , so i can choos cheeper place to stay . i can plan everyth what i want . the second reason is dure the travel . the destin is usual the place where i have never been , so i want to see mani new thing dure the travel . if i go abroad , one of my purpos to travel is to experi other cultur . if i have an opportun , i `` m will to talk to the peopl live there even if i ca n't speak the languag they use . if the commun is success , i feel happi . sometim travel without a tour guid is adventur . i may lose my way , howev , i can go to the restaur which i found accident . i do n't know what my travel will be . it is better to travel by myself sp that i can commun with local peopl and enjoy the accid . furthermor , time is limit dure the travel . within the limit time , i have to go and see all i want . if the travel is led by a tour guid , i can not stay the one place . even i do n't finish look around , i have to leav there . it 's better to travel without a tour guid becaus i can spend time where i want to . in conclus , travel is fun becaus i can make plan which is best for me , experi the cultur there , and spend my time . travel by myself is more possibl to have a wonder trip .
