it is understood that the purpos of advertis is to attract the public attent in mani possibl way . these could be by use extravag colour , catchi slogan , song and nowaday even special effect are sometim includ . catch the `` eye '' is onli the first step , the advertis 's job is also to give the best possibl imag of the product be show . sometim the overus of misusag of technolog , such as special effect or word in the advertis might lead to caus fals impress on the public . i definetli think though that thi situat is rare seen . advertis today make product seem `` cooler '' in order to atract attent , but in retrospect the product seen is the same one you might purchas later at the store . it would be veri difficult for thi statement to becom a realiti nowaday . sever consum right law prevent that compani or corpor give a fals impressiong of their product . what is advertis is usual what you get acoord to the law . as a consum you are now entitl to demand the product you were inform of and also ani other benefit thi product shall provid to you . for instanc let take a dr. pepper ad , it might describ you the tast , the packag and the price , that is exactli what you 'll get in the store , the background music and the young actor in the advertis sure are not includ , they are just visual aid . anoth exampl is a hair growth product or a diet pill , consum right protect you from the possibl lie that the corpor may induc in the ad . at the end of the treatment you might not look exactli like the peopl show in the advertis , but you wil loos weight and grow hair . in my person experi i think that advertis might be more shock than they use to be , they tend to atract more my attent that a few year ago that 's for sure . nevertheless the product that i am offer is alway the one i get when i buy it , never better just exaclti what i expect .
