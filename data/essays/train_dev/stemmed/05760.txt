i agre with thi statement , student must more understand idea and concept than to learn fact . one moment can amphas my agreement , evri time teatcher are asqu their student if they understand and if they have question . question like thi wa ask and will be ask by teacher to know if student understand lean materi . by understandng idea and concept student can use these knowledg more product . it 's give possibl to appli idea and concept in anoth domain . onli if the student understand idea an concept , they will be abl keep them for a long time in their life and transmit them so clairli . for exampl seriouli undestand basi of physic may be appli to build road in theri bad geolog condit . we know that knowledg of physic permit mankind to fli to cosmo . contrariwis , lean fact can help some time but no so effectivli like understand idea an concept . here , it difficult to use learn fact . becaus here inform seem superfici to be appli in a given domain . therefor , the veri import attent may be done in the understandind of idea and concept than in learn fact . it must be a credo of teatch . and thi approch will be transmit from gener to gener of teatcher . onli like that thde teach will stay an art .
