i honestli can not say for sure if or if not there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are right now . there are sever reason whi there are still car in the futur . one is that have an own car is much more comfort - right now and probabl also in the futur . you do n't need to sit in an overcrowd train or buss to go to work . anoth point is the structur of public transport . for get rid of car the govern ha to make sure that almost everi point in the countri ha to be connect by buss or ani other kind of public transport . thi would cost an enorm amount of money which would n't be afford for ani state . especi for state like usa , canada or sweden where the biggest part of the popul still live on the countrysid . but on the other side i honestli beliv that even with the discrib problem the amount of car will be reduc over the next twenti year . mainli becaus of the price for fuel and car . almost nobodi can afford a car for almost 30000 euro anymor . the price for fuel rise up even in the state so that there will be a need for an improv public transport system . anoth point is the air pollut in bigger citi . by visit citi like lo angel , new york or even dalla - it get on some day even almost imposs to breath . .. most of that doe n't affect us right now - but i am pretti sure it will turn in the next coupl of year . final it is to say that there are a lot more reason whi there will be lot less car in the futur but in the short time it wa unfortunatelli not possibl to mention mor import one .
