i think that number of car will decreas in the next twenti year for two reason , econom and enviroment reason . the econom reason is that car are becom more expens and they need more ga which is actual becom expens too . peopl are expect upcom shortag in their money becaus nowaday everyth is expens and it doe n't seem that there is a solut for that problem in the next two decad . and car copani like ford an mitsubishi did n't sell the amount they expect to in the last coupl of year . so peopl are get use to other type of vehicl to move around such as buse , train , taxi subway and motorcycl or bicycl . it could be becaus they are more convineint to them and it 's easeir to get to the place they want to go to and avoid the traffic and the rush hour . and that 's exacli what 's happen in dubai , where a person can stuck in traffic dure the rush hour for three hour ! that 's whi dubai 's govern start to build a high speed train that roll around the big citi and it 's expect to be done by the fall of the year 2007 . anoth reason is that peopl are get more interest in natur again and the botan life , so a lot of club and tv show like `` the green light '' are found now to encourag peopl to get rid of their car and use differ vehicl that wo n't make such pollut as the car do or may be use public buse eventhogh they are pollut the atmospher also , but they are move anyway even if nobodi use them ! so whi make more pollut by use car while we can use those buse ? ! peopl now are convinc of thi idea and they are use public transport more . so that 's whi i think that number of car will decreas by the next twenti year becaus car are realli expens so peopl ca n't affor to buy them and they do so much damag to the natur by pollut it .
