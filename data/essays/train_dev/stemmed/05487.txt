on a first glanc it may sound polit correct to say that it is better to have a broader perspect on mani subject rather than special in a field . but i feel that it is better to special in a field , though a field that interest the person to a great extent . in olden day when there wa no technolog to aid the human , they accumul whatev inform they had on a particular field . but ultim the inform wa not massiv . that is , the inform wa not of that quantum that it wa difficult for the brain to rememb . let look at today pictur . we know of the advanc made in everi field of academ . there is so much to learn and know , but is the human brain capabl of that ? i dont think so . so it is actual a human shortcom . now , from anoth point of view . the most common exampl of a doctor ! we all know that specialist are an absolut essenti these day . the reason for an improv life longev is not onli the machin ( i.e. technolog ) but also human in the form of specialist . as a specialist know hi field veri well he can deal with almost all the situat aris from hi field and thi ultim mean greater servic to the peopl . although peopl tend to argu that due to so mani branch in everi field it might becom a case of `` too mani cook spoil the broth '' . but , becaus to the special field , the specialist may concentr more on hi field and and work hard to improv hi field of work , that is again , better result ! we have mani such exampl in everi field today . for exampl , had everi engin been build bridg and hous ( like earlier ) , would there be field of engin such as robot and nano particl ? but , final as an except , it must be left to the individu concern . thi is becaus there is a natur tendenc in some peopl to learn everyth they like , they are inquisit . so it is better to leav the choic to such peopl . of cours , ultim knowledg is also for pleasur and self content ! in conclus , i would say that the need of the hour is specialist in all walk of life for a better tomorrow .
