have less car in twenti year time doe not seem to be possibl due to sever reason : comfort of the car , avail of a technolgi and global reason . as the children of the twenti centuri we were born with car , live and grow with them . we have so much famaliar and use to them . we can not find comfort of these car in ani of vehicl , bicycl or motorcycl or a ship or train non of those can provid the comfort and servic we use to hava with our car . secondli , the technolog is not avail to make an vehicl that can comput with car . space ship , plane or helicopt they may have seem to comput with car but it should also be taken into account that they cost too much that ordinari peopl can afford . or even they can afford them some time where they will park their helicopt or where they will land with their plane . it is a big question mark and doe not seem to be realist . the last but the most import one is the global reason . the big car produc compani will not let a chang in current statu of the car by make big cut from price . not onli the car produc but also oil compani do not want fewer car in use as their profit will decreas with less gasolin sale . the same reason can be taken for oil - export countri and or for the countri who make too much money from petroleum sector such as usa , russia , and middl east countri that determin and effect the polit and econom decis all over the world . in conclus , in twenti year , there will not be fewer car in use than today as we get use to the comfort of our car which we can buy by less money than other vehicl provid with the current technolgi . and the global power will not let a chang in the situt in unfavour of them as a result of chang in oil sector .
