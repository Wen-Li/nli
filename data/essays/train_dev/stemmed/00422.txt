i do not agre with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . firstli , becaus i do not think that anyon could pretend order travel either alon or in a group . travel is one of the pleasur that is gener at your own discret . if peopl doe not feel comfort to travel in a group , it doe not mean that they are not go to enjoy their trip . for them , travel in a group could be the best way to wast your money and time . one are not go to be abl to do everyth one want . secondli , for peopl who like travel in a group , they could like to travel with peopl they know . so they would have somewhat the same interest , and will be most like abl to do the same thing . in that case , they could want to prepar their trip by research all the inform they need befor leav . for exampl , they would look about the hotel , where to eat , what are the attract , and so on . thu , they will avoid the need of a tour guid . they will end with the satisfact of plan their trip , and se onli what they want to . final , travel in a group led by a tour guid could be expens . a tour guid usual also ha hi `` own path '' . it is a gener pathway made for everyon . it usual have a lack of flexibl . for instanc , with a tour guid peopl have usual a tight schedul . the tour guid tri to show everyth in a veri short amount of time . therefor , one ha to be in good health condit in order to accomplish what could be view sometim as pain path . in conclus , i personn believ that the best way to travel depend on individu . one could be a solitar , and enjoy the pleasur of travel alon . other peopl enjoy just the fact of research , plan to travel with friend . and final , the fact that a tour guid is not person and onli show what it want to show , are the three main reason what i do not agre with the statement .
