i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . thi is becaus although young peopl usual have a healthier state than old one , thi doe n't mean that thi is the onli factor that control a person 's enjoy of life . i believ that each of these two categori - young and old peopl - have their own way of enjoy life . for instanc , despit the fact that old peopl ca n't do some type of enjoy that the youngster can do - such as hang out , and play some type of sport - howev , they also have a wide rang of enjoy activ that they can perform . the type of activ that older peopl can do to enjoy life often depend on the age categori they belong to . for exampl peopl at the age of sixti or abov often enjoy their life after retir by buy themselv hous in quiet and calm area , where they can enjoy the free time they have by relax . they can also spend their time in garden , play with their grandchildren and take care of them , or discuss ani subject in life . they also have their type of sport that help them relax such as golf . on the other hand , peopl at younger age - from forti to sixti - often enjoy their life by make trip around the world to place they have n't visit when they were young . thi type of enjoy , and other `` time consum '' activ , are usual not avail for young peopl becaus they often do n't have enough time to do it . thi is due to the reason that young peopl usual spend most of their time in their studi , do homework , and write paper . i again emphas the idea that each ha his/her own type of enjoy , and that he/sh probabl wo n't enjoy do what other peopl in other age categori do .
