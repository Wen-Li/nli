i strongli disagre with the notion that have a broad knowledg of mani subject is better than special in one . i feel that in today 's world , where competit for job is increas , one who special in a particular field is the one who stand out in the crowd of men and women who have a knowledg of mani subject . also , the person becom passion about the subject that he decid to special in and that give him enorm satisfact . great person testifi the fact that special in one field alway the better option . da vinci , one of the most famou artist of all time wa also an accomplish physicist . although he had no formal educ in the field , he had a great wealth of knowledg about it . howev , thi wa detriment to him in a way as he alway use to think of hi paint in a scientif way rather than a pure artist one . so although he creat masterpiec , he left mani more project unfinish as he felt that those project were lack in some detail scientif . for exampl , he thought that a paint should contain no element of ethreal fantasi and that it must obey the law of physic . in thi way , hi choic wa limit and he did not access hi full potenti . had he been a littl less rigid in hi principl , we would have seen mani more of hi wonder work . anoth exampl would be my uncl who switch hi major no less than four time while do hi undergradu . when he tri to get a good job in one of the field he had studi , he found none . to hi dismay , he discov that each of the job need an extens knowledg on the subject , a specialis of some kind . after the incid , he final settl for medicin and went to graduat school . he special in nephrolog and needless to say , is a success surgeon now . in conclus i strongli feel that be a jack of all trade and master of none diffus one 's talent and prevent one from reach the highest potenti . an individu can carv a nich for himself in the world if he ha hi own ident , in thi case , the one subject he take up and special in .
