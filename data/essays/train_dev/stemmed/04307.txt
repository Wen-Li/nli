most of the peopl love travel in order to discov new place , to rivisit place that they alreadi know and mayb experi them in a new , differ way , or just in order to relax by the beach . some peopl prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guid , some other peopl prefer to just buy a book , read someth about the place they 're head to and go by themselv . person , i prefer to travel by myself , or with a few friend but absolutli without a tour guid . sure an organ trip is realli nice but person i do n't like the idea of jump on a bu with peopl i do n't know and with a tour guid tell me all the time what to do , where to go and whi . i 'd rather drive with a few friend , a map and the idea to discov the true realiti of the place we are go to visit . i like thi way of travel becaus i think i 'd feel more free to organ my trip as i realli want to . the fact that i 'm not interest in be on a bu with peopl i do n't know might seem a littl bit close mind and i would n't want it to be mislead . it 's not that i do n't like meet new peopl but if i go to a new place i 'd like to get in touch with local peopl in order for me to understand their cultur , tradit , habit . waht i 'm look for while travel is a full immers in a new , differ realiti from which i want to learn . i do n't like much the idea of a tour guid becaus i think he or she will show me the most famou tourist destin without realli enter the cultur itself . all and all i can say that travel is great either way . i like to travel the way i describ becaus i believ it realli help us open up our horizon to differ realti . italian food is great - i 'm italian so . . ! - but if i went to marocco , i 'd rather tri cou cou than go the italian restaur and italian resort where there is noth about the local cultur .
