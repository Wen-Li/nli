in my opinion , special in one specif subject is definetli a veri import advantag in life , but you should have also a broad knowlegd of other academ subject , too . it is necessari to know about other academ subject to use your special knowlegd in an effect way . for exampl , a manag ha to know about much about polit , comput scienc and mathemat to use and handl hi specif econom knowlegd . if a manag onli know about econom , he could n't do a good job . anoth advantag of broad knowlegd is , to use it easi in your normal life . it help you have a good convers with your busi partner or other person . when you onli know about your own specif subject , it is not possibl to talk with other peopl about their problem or the news in tv . on the other hand , concentr on one special subject can help rais the career . for a scientist , for exampl , it will be a good choic to concentr on onli one academ subject , becaus he hardli can use other knowlegd in hi job . when the scientist doe n't get deep into hi subject , he ca n't do a good job , becaus hi task is , to find new thing and think further than other peopl did befor him . anoth advantag of special is , that you can be the best in your subject if you onli concentr on thi one subject in your life . it is not possibl to be the best in comput scienc , when you are focuss on other subject at the same time . as a result , it depend on the person , hi attitud and hi job , what hi best way of educ is . for some peopl the best way is , to have a broad knowledg , and other peopl should better special . in my case , the best choic is to have a broad knowlegd , becaus i am still not quit sure about what i want to be in my life . after make a decis i can still special on one specif subject to be good in my job .
