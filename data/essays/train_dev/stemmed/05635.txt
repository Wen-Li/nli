young peopl often in gener have a bad imag . they onli want to make parti , they make a lot of nois , they do not realli care about their futur and they do not invest ani of their time to help their commun . thi is a opinion that is pretti widespread , especi under elderli peopl . but is that realli true ? is our youth that much spoil and destroy ? i think there are also mani situat which show exactli the opposit . especi in the unit state , where volunt work ha a veri high mean , mani young peopl spend much of their free time help commun . they work with children , they work with elderli peopl or they engag in protect the environ . in those state , volunt work is highli admir and school would support it a lot . probabl in european countri like switzerland or germani , thi is not realli the case . volunt work is not that commun and it might not be that often the case that young peopl engag in it . thi can also be a result by the fact that school do not support it enough and do not make it popular enough . but veri often , help the commun may also be act out in a form , that is not that formal or public as it is when a individu doe volunt work . for instanc it might also be a help act of young peopl when they help an elder individu cross the street . or when they show them how to use a ticket machin at a train station . so all the help act can also be act out in daili life . for sure , such act are often done by young peopl , but that is not realli recogn becaus it is not that public . assum that young peopl in our day realli do not help their commun enough . what could be a reason for it ? it might be that young peopl are just under more pressur than they were in ancient time . the economi is not that stabl at the moment , job are rather rare and one ha to work against a lot of competitor to find hi job posit . therefor a lot of effort ha to be put into work on the career and make sure that one find a good work place . it often can be the case that there is simpli not enough time left to do some social work . and in our materi western societi , financ and a wealthi life are for most of the peopl more import than conduct a social life . base on all those fact . i agre that young peopl gener do not put so much effort into help their commun in a public form . for instanc they do not help a lot in the church or in childcar or in environment group . but probabl they do a more hidden kind of help their commun simpli by act out some social act in their daili life .
