peopl could be success without tri new thing but just by follow custom onli for a short term , but can not keep be successful for a long term without tri new thing . that is becaus societi and trend alway chang . i 'd like to bring an exampl of beeper and mobil phone in japanes market . the beeper ha recent vanish after 40 year of histori from it japanes market . it use to be one of the most popular mobil good until mobil phone wa commonli use . i rememb when wa in school , all of my friend had one and it wa the main tool to commun with each other . if you had a bisi to deal with beeper - could be a manufactur , supplier of materi to manufactur or agenc to make deal with consum - your busi back then must have been success and prosper . howev , mobil phone becam more and more popular sinc over 10 year ago and it ha now overtaken the beeper . nowaday almost everyon ha one or even more than two , like one for privat use and the other for busi , and it 's hard for mani peopl to imagin a life without them . as be involv in the beeper busi if you decid not to go into mobil phone busi but stick to the beeper becaus you did not feel comfort with tri new thing and did not like to take risk , your busi deal with beeper must have gradual diminish and it wa no longer success . in ani categori , as i meantion abov , trend constantli chang and you ca n't stick to the same thing forev . to be success , it is necessari to adopt new thing to go with the latest trend and it alway requir some risk but it 's , i think , unfortun unavoid in order to get success .
