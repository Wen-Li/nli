i agre with the condit , young peopl do enjoy life more than older peopl . not onli becaus older peopl had live longer , but also young peopl are more activ . yet , young peopl like to tri anyth new , they are more will to accept the chang of the world . becaus older peopl have live longer , so they had tri anyth new dure their `` younger life . '' as they grow older , they are more matur , they know what is the most import in their life . for exampl , a young man of age 18 will go to night club more often than a man who is 23 , the reason is becaus that the man know there is just a place for rest and may he need to work on the next day . on the other hand , the young man will think the night club is veri fansi and fun , becaus there is lot hot girl or ani other reason that attract hi attent . in thi case young man know how to releas himself in a night club , but the man did not get rest total in the club . young peopl are usual more activ than the older peopl , becaus they have more energi , yet , they are easili to take attent on new thing than the older peopl . for examplel , let say a 18 young man and a 25 man , they both like to read novel , but mayb the man would not to go to the store to rent it , and just have fun sit there to read , or go onlin , do some novel search . oppositi , the young man may go to the store and sit there 4 hour just watch novel and enjoy in it . older peopl can not do anyth they want freeli , becaus they need to think more and they have to have the motiv to do it . no matter what the chang is , older peopl do not like it and they can not surviv from it , but young peopl , even if they do not like the chang , they can still surviv from it . for exampl , grandmoth did not think that her granddaught can go to school and marri at age of 16 or 17 . differ from the mother , she would let her daughter go to school , and to be educ , not marri until the age of 28 , so then the grandmoth would alway complain to the mother that she should not let her daughter to go to school . all in all , older peopl can not enjoy their life , not becaus they had live what the young is live but becaus they are not as activ as the young do . moreov , older peopl do not like anyth new or to be chang , they are stuck in their own world . which is differ from the young peopl , who is enjoy their life , play around , and tri ani new thing .
