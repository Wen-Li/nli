accord to me , i would say that both can have benefit accord to the situat . in the first part you will see the advantag of a broad knowledg and in the second part you will see how special in a specif subject could also be an advantag . the knowledg is the know of mani subject , when you have a broad knowlegd you can discuss with anyon about anyth . and i think that it is a good point special when you are in the workplac . imagin that you are special in busi , and in your firm they don t need saler ( or other job in busi ) anymor , accord to thi you wo n't be abl to find other job in the same compani , becaus you are onli special in the busi subject . in thi case , i think it is realli essenti to have a larg knowledg . moreov , they understand it at school becaus more and more school propos format which includ variou subject . thank to thi the student or the futur worker will be abl to face ani situat at work or in hi privat life . in our world today , i think that someon ha to be abl to discuss or to understand the main academ subject such as : comput scienc , busi and commun , becaus i think that they ca n't be understand by someon separetli . but on the other hand , i would like to say that special in one specif subject could be an advantag . inde , if you know well the subject you can be the best . for instanc , at work if you are the onli one who know a softwar you might be indispens . you can use thi to get more money . so i would say that sometim it s worth know someth veri well than know a litl bit of a lot of thing .
