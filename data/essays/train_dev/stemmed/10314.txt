do you think peopl who alway think and act same as other person do will succee in the futur ? i think peopl should tri new thing and take risk for their success . i have some reason to support my opinion . first , i think mani thing are chang rapidli everyday ; for exampl , peopl 's demand and prefer are differ from yesterday . thu we have to think about new thing and product . if we do n't care about thi point , no one will be interest our busi , and we will not succeed . second , risk produc big success for us . most peopl do n't want to take risk becaus they are afraid of the result . then , these peopl the safeti way and get less success . they ca n't get much money or be supeci peopl . they are just gener . howev peopl who take risk will succeed becaus they chose veri difficult way for them , and they will make an effort for success . motiv is tottal differ among the two peopl . final , peopl who do n't take risk do n't believ their abil . they ca n't trust themselv for success . we have to believ ourselv for successs . in conclus , for those reason i agre with the statement . i think if we want to success , we should tri risk and believ our possibl and futur .
