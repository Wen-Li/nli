do young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ? person , i do n't think so , even if it 's quit difficult to know how much one enjoy life . i do n't see specif reason whi young peopl would enjoy life more . one could argu that their physic abil are at their maximum , but in our modern societi , older peopl do n't necessarili suffer from health problem , and physic abil are not the onli sourc of happi . i think some peopl enjoy life more while be young , and other prefer life ` now ' , that is , while be older . an idea wide spread is that be twenti year old is the best time in life , but the famou french writer paul nizan said he would never allow anyon to say such a thing . thi show that it realli depend on peopl . furthermor , it is not becaus one would like to be younger that he enjoy life more at that time . thi can be explain by the fact that he would like to be younger , but also to know what he know now . ala , if young peopl knew , if older peopl could ! the kind of enjoy is simpli differ , depend on the age of peopl . mayb young peopl enjoy it more obvious , or , may i say , noisili : they want to make thi known . but peopl get - gener - wiser as time goe by , can enjoy other aspect of life , and are not concern anymor by problem that , now they know it , are minor . to conclud , i would say that thi gener statement - young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do - is untru . thi depend mainli on peopl , and the wise man can enjoy differ each period of hi life .
