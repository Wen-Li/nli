the conclus that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , sound correct to me . there are two argument that are interest to consid in evalu the conclus abov . first , if we assum that colleg and univers are current use the best strategi and tool to teach student , it is clear that concept and idea are fundament and more import then fact to build the basic knowledg of student . in fact , at engin univers all the cours in the first coupl of year are about algebra , geometri and phisic . all of those cours are about idea and concept ; no one of them refer to fact or applic . by learn idea and concept , student can develop abil of reason and think that in the futur they will need to solv real problem and to understand fact . second , it is much more worthwhil studi generalitazion rather then specif applic . in fact , in our real world it is unbeliev to know everyth about fact and memor them . instead , idea and gener concept can be appli everywher and help to understand everi fact . moreov , our world is run so fast that scientist and research discoveri everi day new thesi and model . if a student know how to deal with abstract idea and concept , he or she can easili understand everi thing is new and ha came up in our world . fact ate constrain by context and circumst and are veri use to fix and rememb idea and concept . in conclus , student must understand firstli idea and concept . it is help for reason and think abil as well as for understand fact .
