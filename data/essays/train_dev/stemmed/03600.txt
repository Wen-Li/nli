i strongli agre with the follow statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' for the follow reason . in my opinion it is the best age to enjoy and also if we becom old we can not enjoy as much as we enjoy dure young age and also dure old age we will be think of children and also their career , settlement and marriag and becom veri tire and some time exhaust also and also in my opinion `` time is preciou '' onc it ha pass it wo n't come again . and also anoth reason is that more enjoy will there dure young age and also we wo n't have that much energi we do have in young age . the main reason for which i am hold thi opinion is , when i use to observ my parent they are alway think of my educ and career and also marriag and alway they won ' t take care of their person life and they take care of children in each and everyth . i recogn thi from the way they are take care of me . onc we \ they becom older and we \ they can not enjoy as they enjoy befor . thi is one reason for my opinion and anoth reason is that the same thing we use to talk with our close friend or rel and so on . one exampl for hold thi opinion is , i am have a veri close friend and we use to share each and everyth and we sometim use to think of futur and talk about it , then we have taken a decis that onc we becom old we can not enjoy as we enjoy dure young age becaus in young age we will not have ani respons and also we will have energi to do everi thing and we will be mostli depend on parent or if marri earli husband and also we will get from parent each and everyth we want . i want to conclud that in young age there will be more enjoy that in old age and in old age we can mostli see love toward famili but not enjoy as in young age and also onli onet everyon look after in old age is happi . for all the abov reason and exampl i strongli agre with the statement that `` young peopl enjoy more than older peopl do '' .
