becaus i am a collag student now in taiwan , and have a deep feel of thi situat that be indiffer about the environ around us . i must give some explan that whi we student in our gener are fail to have time help our commun . we student in taiwan are brought up by an attitud of life without care about the environ around us , in a brief , we are grow in an selfish attitud even though the text book had taught us we should devot ourself while we can . most of time , we studi all the time to get good grade and burden with so mani pressur on studi . as a result , even we want to help our own commun , we are realli lack of time help . some time i can see some club in campu which are tend to devot themselv in the servis of commun , and it realli have a great impact on those resid . but what i can see are just a small group of will peopl . after all , what we student consid most now is how to get relax from our pressur and have fun for our limit young life , becaus we are press under the line in the textbook . take me for exampl , it seem i should enjoy my colleg student life . but i will graduat next year , and i am face the pressur to appli the grauduat , i even do n't have time to relex becaus there are so mani chore such as million of assign and lot of part-tim job task for me to deal with . how can i arrang my schedul to devot myself to commun ? i agre on thi statement that young peopl do n't give enough time to help their own commun , but i think it is the educ that caus thi situat be indiffer about help commun . in my opinion , if we have the hope that our futur gener have a passion to help other , we should teach them thi attitud total from their childhood .
