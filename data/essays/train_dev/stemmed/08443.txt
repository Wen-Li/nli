have a chanc to travel is most definit one of the thing peopl prefer to do as a way to relax , rest and enjoy intercultur experi . of cours thi all depend on the natur of the trip , so thi essay will restrict itself to `` pleasur travel '' exclus . in my opinion travel in a group led by a tour guid is a good or bad option depend on the real purpos of the trip as well as on the travel 's prefer and person . if the travel or travel are seek an intercultur experi and do not resent be told were and when to go , then a group led by a tour guid is most definet a good option . a guid will show them to all the right place and not onli that , but he or she will provid pertin inform regard the histor , cultur and/or artist background of such place . thi may enhanc their entir travel experi . anoth good reason whi peopl may prefer travel in group is safeti . visit an entir differ countri where they might not be abl to commun may scare some peopl . have a guid as an interpret and mediat might encourag take the trip . the cultur shock is therefor decreas . some peopl might also enjoy travel in group sinc they might get a chanc to interact with differ peopl and make friend dure the trip . final , have a tour guid can help reduc cost ( assum transport is provid ) and may also help reduc lost time ( time spent in get to know the place and move around ) . on the other hand , if the place target to visit lack all the cultur background that a tour guid might provid ( for exampl a beach ) , then mayb a guid trip may not be necessari . the decis also depend on the person 's person . some peopl dislik travel in group , have to follow strict time schedul , and follow rule . if their trip is plan specif for leisur and rest , then mayb a hectic tour shedul might not be a good idea . some peopl resent not be abl to have their privaci or have to spend money on a guid when the `` can get around place by themselv '' . in conclus , i believ that `` the best way to travel '' , have or not have a tour guid , depend entir on the travel and purpos of the trip . peopl wish to travel should evalu these thing care befor engag in a trip that may or may not be led by a tour guid .
