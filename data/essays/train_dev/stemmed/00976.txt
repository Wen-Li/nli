i do not think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . for me , enjoy life is not a question of age , it can depend on societi , freedom and possibl activ . in a hedonist societi , an elderli could enjoy as much life as a middl age man or even a child , for they would all live for fun and for the moment . inde , carp diem is a motto who could make an old person enjoy even more life than a younger one would . freedom is also a factor for slave , prisonn or a paralis man can not enjoy life as much as a free man would . to be alb to move and do what you want to do when you whant to do is esenti for a full enjoy of life . adopt thi point of view , it is also possibl to add money as a criteria to enjoyememt of live . possibl activ is also a major factor . by say activ , i refer to cultur activ , in direct opposit with surviv activ such as eat or sleep . to have noth to do will not allow you to enjoy life . thi is where the conflict between young and older peopl reveal itself , for some say that older peopl have less numer and interest activ than the young . i would argu that it is untru . i must first claim that the number of activ itself is not essenti , as long as monotoni and boredom are not reach . the interset of the activ is a differ matter . young peopl , and i must admitt that i includ myself , commonli find that activ destin to older peolp are less interest . ad with the fact that older peopl usuali addmitt to miss their activ they dissmiss a long time ago we can think that the statement is true . on the other hand , if we ask to older peopl if they would start their old activ again , most would refus . we must see that activ for the younger are not ban from the elderli , it is them who no longer want them . activ are more or less interest depend on the point of view . henc we may say that enjoy life is not a matter of age and that older peopl may enjoy life even more that young peopl if they encount the right condit .
