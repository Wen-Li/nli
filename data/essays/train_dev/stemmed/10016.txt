it is common that mani peopl begin to gain knowledg in a varieti of way . at the same time the question that if it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject will be brought about . what do you think of the issu ? as far as i am concern , i will agre with the idea that it is better to special in one specif subject than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . in the follow paragraph , i will add some exampl and detail to support my point of view . in the first place , special in one specif subject ha advantag in variou way , of which , the most signific is that it will save our time and energi . we have to the point out the essenci fact that we do not have enough time to finish everi work well , which mean that we can not do good in mani academ subject . if we focu on one subject , we are abl to spend enough time on that subject . therefor , we will have more chanc to be success in the subject we concentr on . for instanc , if a student whose major is comput scienc studi art to broaden hi eyesight , he will not have much time studi hi major , which will influenc hi grade and credit . as a result , there will be bad effect on hi studi . in consequ , we will make good use of our limit time to studi , if we concentr on one subject . in the second place , what is also worth notic is that it will bring benefit to our futur job , if we special on one specif subject . as we all know , in the futur we will find a job which we are interest in . in that case , we should focu on one subject which attract us a lot . then we will find a good job after graduat becaus of our profession knowledg . for instanc , if we studi biolog , we are abl to learn more in the subject , which mean that we can gain the knowledg relat to biolog . therefor , when we have the interview , we will have a lot of academ knowledg to be discuss which will leav a good impress to the manag . we will get the job we want easili . admittedli , if we have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , we will becom knowledg . howev , if we have knowledg in a varieti of aspect and we do not know much about each subject , it will caus bad influenc on our futur life , which is not good . therefor i tend to hold the opinion that it is better to special on one subject which we have lot of interest and we will get benefit from it . to sum up , take into account of what ha been discuss abov , i can draw the conclus that special in one specif subject is better than have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . i wish that there will be an increas number of peopl who can get benefit from the one subject they special in .
