in my opinion there is no singl correct answer to thi question . of cours both way can lead to success . my main reason is that it depend on the path one want to follow whether an academ special make sens or not . my aim is to explain thi argument in the follow sentenc by look at the broad academ field of busi . in switzerland , a master student can choos whether he want to special in one specif subject - as financ - or to keep hi focu on a broad approach which includ subject such as market , human resourc , financ , strateg manag , risk manag , leadership . to illustr my hypothesi mention abov i will now have a look at two differ job within a compani . a gener manag and hi manag team need not to be special in one specif subject as they have to address problem of mani differ field - such as leadership issu , market decis and financi topic . an import aspect in the job of a manag is the need to quickli decid on mani differ issu . thu a broad educ is actual an advantag . an employe in the financi sector such as in a bank doe not need to have such a broad knowledg . rather it is essenti that he possess in-depth knowledg of the transact within the sector and on the sector itself . the job requir is much more focus . rather than just know littl about everyth it is advis to have a solid knowledg of thi special topic - and financ for exampl is actual still a rather broad subject . but of cours it is needless to say that knowledg is allway an ad asset . howev one ha to decid first which path will be chosen in order to be abl to make a sound decis whether an academ special make sens .
