i can not agre with thi statement for one simpl reason : in my opinion , both youth and elder are enjoy if you are abl to see the advantag of each age . happi doe not depend on age , but on a cumulu of decis that make each indivud 's life enjoy or hate . pleasur can be found at ani age , it is just a question of find them . mani elder enjoy life despit the physic constraint impos by age while mani young peopl wast their life think on how life is horribl eventhough they have all the opportun to chang their person life and their environ . although it is a common place , we should never forget that as long as the heart is young , the physic age is not a relev factor . one of the clearest exampl of how life is nice at ani age is travel : almost everybodi love it and can be done by both young and old peopl . at travel , young peopl tend to walk a lot , visit museum , go out in the night and sleep for short period of time in the same day . thi rythm is unsustain for the averag elder . howev , the elder may find pleasur on more refin activ ( such as eat in expens restaur , sleep in comfort hotel or luxuri tour through import zone ) that mani young peopl can not afford . thi exampl may suggest that the less enjoy period of life is what is known as the `` product life '' , which tend to go from univers graduat to retir . howev , the product life offer mani reward too : have children and profession develop are probabl the two most known exampl . to summar , i want to mention that life can be enjoy regardless of age ; happi is probabl the last decis an individu can take in thi age when there is noth to discov and everyth is sold in supermarket .
