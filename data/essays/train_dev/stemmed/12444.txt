the statement that `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' is a quit provoc statement . in order to analys thi i will differenti between some type of advertis . as far as i think there are three especi effect way of draw attent to a product or servic . the probabl most effect one are tv commerci . in second place i see magazin or poster advertis . thirdli i think radio ad are quit effect . exactli in the order that i list these three type i think there is a hierarchi present that is link to the statement . tv commerci are extrem powerful ! the human mind is affect by such commerci in a great varieti of way . the visual stimul is obviou . it is also understand that the audio affect a person . but an immens power of a commerci lie in those factor that are deliv to the submiss mind . let 's say you have 24 to 30 imag per second in a modern film . if one imag per second show your product in an otherwis `` normal '' film , you get automaticli attract to it . fortun that way of advertis is prohibit becaus the custom might be affect against hi will . poster and radio advertis onli have an `` honest '' attempt to draw the attent . but still they can as well includ a lot of stylist devic that can influenc a viewer toward the product . color , for exampl , are extrem powerful . although differ color might have differ mean in differ cultur . in the western hemispher for exampl red might repres the wild , blue the relax and silver the eleg . that way a custom might get the feel of an extrem stylish toothbrush if it is shown in a bright silver light . that way a special signific is attach to a basicli normal object . thi as well might vari between cultur . therefor i agre to the statement . person i think thi is the great power the advertis have . commerci play with all the associ peopl might have and by do so they deliv a messag that somehow prais their product or servic .
