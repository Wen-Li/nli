i think thi is a gener statement , and it is too difficul discuss about thi without follow in born tink . howev , i disagre with thi sentenc . fir of all becaus i know mani boy and girl that do not enjoy in their eveeryday life . they seem to need ever someth els , they are not abl to be happi for what they do . everyth becom a problem : the wed , the children , the job . i recogn the we live in a difficult time , the polit affair and the econom onc are not veri good , and also there is the war . .. but i ask to myself : what are the differ between the actual and last time ? my father tolk to me about the second world war , and also about the problem the he had had for find someth to eat end than the problem he had had to take a job . my father dead three year ago , but i think he enjoyn hi life more than mani young peopl . i want to talk about anoth point : the wed . i see that mani peopl now prefer the divorc to the possibl to solv the problem . i do not understood veri well thi posit . for me have a famili is a way to get better our life , but probabl i wrong becaus mani peopl i know do not think in the same way . i want to enjoy live alon or goin out until 5 or 6 a.m. so they refus the idea to build a famili until they are 35 or 37 year old . probabl i am the fir person that doe not enjoy enaught her life . i tri everi day to put passion and love in what i do , special from the time i live alon , now i have no fathter and no mother , but i see that if i am correct with other person i am not alon .
