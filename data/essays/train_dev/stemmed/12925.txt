doe success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well ? success peopl tri new thing . to be success is to be the best and differ . if we are differ that 's mean that we are alway look for new thing , new idea . the world is alway chang like as . i think that the reason that make peopl success is that they are alway chang and have new thing . if thi peopl are take risk ? of cors they do ! but who care ! take risk make as feel in life . life becom more excit . success peopl are not scar to loos but they ca n't support do alway the same think . of cors they have to do well what they do but they are alway lurn , and chang . i realli do not think that we can be success with do onli what we know how to do well . for me , i will call that '' stagnat '' and may be we can becom success for one period but when the tendanc will chang if we are not abl to tri new thing and chang with the tendanc we will not be abl to keep our succ . for exempl , for the scientist they need to do experi , tri new thing take risk to make some invent , or discov new medic . of cors they know how to do it well what they alreadi know but to be on the top of the screen they have to find newest and greatest thing . so in conclus , we can tell that onli do what we alreadi know how to do well is not part of the success peopl . for sure that will be a reason of the succ but not to keep it . to keep the succ , we have to tri new thing and take risk .
