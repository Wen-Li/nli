the issu at hand is young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do or not . i disagre with the idea that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i believ that older peopl like life more than young peopl do becaus of mani reason . first of all , old peopl enjoy life more than younger person do becaus they know they are much close to death . they know veri well the mean of death and they will die in anytim . becaus of thi reason , they tri to spend their rest of life veri effect . on the other hand , young peopl feel that they ever do n't die and becaus of thi reason they do n't awar the valu of life . addit , old peopl like life more than younger becaus they have mani reason to enjoy life . for exampl , they gener have children and a wife . they need to care about them . they enjoy life becaus of her famili . on the other hand , young peopl do not have a doughter or son . they are singl . becaus they do not have ani concret reason to glue life , they do not enjoy life more than older peopl . final , i think old peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl becaus their expect from life are not gener big . they gener expect quiet place in peac with their famili . thi is enough for them to enjoy the life . on the other hand , as i am a young man , i have mani expect from life and if i do n't obtain ani of them , i will easili hate from life and i will be depres . i expect a good job , much money , brand new car . .. it is veri difficult to obtain all of them at the same time and due to these reason most of time i do n't enjoy from life . ultim , i believ that old peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl do . i believ thi becaus , the life will end for them in a veri short time later , they have mani thing to do and mani peopl to care , and they do n't have a lot of expect from the life .
