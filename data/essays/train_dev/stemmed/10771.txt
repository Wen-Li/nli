befor attempt to give a definit answer to that question i would like to discuss the pro and con of the group let by a tour guid . i will then conclud summar the differ point made . first of all , let ask ourselv whi do peopl use tour guid to travel . a possibl answer to that question might be that peopl do not necessarili have a lot of time to visit a certain place , and therefor intend to make the most out of their time . in that case , peopl are shown the most popular monument and locat for sightse by their tour guid , and visit as much as possibl in a short amount of time . so i personali think that in the case of a short trip , it is a good solut in order to see the main thing to see . howev , the major drawback of thi altern appear to me to be that as you intend to make the most out of your limit time , everi visit is care time and schedul . therefor , in the event that you would like to learn more about a certain monument or place , it turn out to be quit difficult as the group might be alreadi leav for the next visit , or you just might not have enough time ahead of you to do so . consequ , if a deep understand of a certain place or monument is the major concern of the trip , tour appear to me not to be the best altern , make such a wish difficult to come true . to conclud , i believ that group led by a tour guid can be both a good or less good altern depend on the major aim of the journey . in my opinion , if the thourough understand of a certain monument or place is the object , then a differ altern should be taken . howev , if the object of a short journey is to go around the main sightse spot , then i beleiv it is the altern to adopt .
