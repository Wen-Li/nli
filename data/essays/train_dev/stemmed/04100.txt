i clearli disagre with the follow statement . i believ that the phenomena will be the opposit and that , in twenti year there will be more car in use than there are today . the reason support my opinion are the follow : first , i think that popul increas and the devevopp of certain countri are two main factor that will make the number of car rais . as we all know , popul is increas . in consequ , the number of peopl use a car will increas too . second point , the econom developp of countri such as china or india will also repres a higher number of car sold and use . in addit to that , i also believ that even polut problem will not stop the developp of the car industri . the reason whi is becaus new energi such as gaz or solar energi are be develop . i think that peopl will be more and more concern about environment problem and will use these new energi . the last reason whi i think the number of car will be more import in 20 year is becaus peopl are more and more individualist and are realli exig concern their confort and freedom . so , they will prefer use their car instead of take common transport such as buse or subway . to conclud , i would say that car industri is not go to lose importa
