i total agre with the statement that sucess peopl are will to tri new thing and take risk rather than just do what they know and do thing which they do well . i will elabor & exemplifi my reason for do so . peopl who are will to tri new thing show that they have a sucess attitiud . thi is the most import factor for ani one to succeed . afteral it show the desir & willing to tri new thing which have not been tri befor . recent i read a stori about a buisnessman who went on a holiday to indonesia , where he got an opportun to learn about the work of a steel mill . just by hi new way of do thing he bought that steel plant & today own more than 25 % of total steel product in the world sucess attitud come to those who have the knowledg about whi should they tri new thing . if someon doe not have the knowledg he will not be abl to tri new thing . take the same exampl , whi wa the buisnessman i mention abov , could take over the indonesian mill . thi is for the simpl reason , that he had the knowledg from back home , about waht work & what doe n't as hi father had a small steel plant . lastli peop who are will to take the risk , by tri out new thing exhibit leadership . it is onli thi leadership qualiti which gener that desir to know more , to do more & to achiev more . today the buisnessman i mention abov is respect as the world leader in steel industri , becaus he took initi . on the other hand peopl who onli do thing which they know to do well are are indirectli indic , they are happi in what they are do . in my opinion it is as attitud which may not lead to sucess in the long run . henc i believ that the world belong to those who are will to tri & will to do new thing . thi is my philosphi of sucess .
