the problem of the number of car throughout the world is often debat when talk about polut . even if person car are not the main factor of air pollut ( factori for instanc pollut more than car ) they are often heavili accus of pollut becaus they give an exampl of individu pollut that could be easili reduc by reduc the number of car . i howev realli do not think that there will be fewer car in twenti year than today as the world popul keep grow from decad to decad . i do not know exactli how mani human there we will be in twenti year but i have heard it would be around 7 milliard . for a demograph reason , even if poverti doe not decreas in the thrid world , there will be more western peopl and consequ more car . so we can ask ourselv the question how the number of car could possibl decreas . it is effect notic that car becom cheeper and cheeper . consequ , the number of poor peopl who will be abl to aford a car will increas and i realli do not think they will refus thi privileg if they get it . mathemat , the number of car may exponenti grow . thi growth tendenc might be reduc if the differ govern and non governement organis tri and work togeth to control that expans . the troubl be that they are bare abl to find an agreement on other purpous such as factori air pollut and water spoil and chemic pollut so i do not think that they will consid car like a prioriti . furthermor , i don4t see the resaon whi it should be place as prioriti becaus when you see the amount of drinkabl water decreas in coutri like bangladesh for instanc , i realli think there is still to be done befor prohibit car
