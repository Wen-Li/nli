in my opinon travel with a tour guid is good then go alon the three reason whi i prefer the tour guid are more inform about the place , can see new more place and safeti . in first by travel with a tour guid we can t get more inform about the place . recent i visti a place for the first time . i hire a tour guid by which i got more inform about the place and monument which i had seen dure the visit . he had told about the histori , specif , etc . he also help us by translat the local languag which we cant understand . so hire give us more inform about the place . in second we can see new more place becaus he would have the detail about the place like how much time it would take , about the accomid , etc . becaus hi agent , by which they can hire room veri easili . they would not be ani loss of time for go and wait for a mean of transport . we will enjoy a lot , which we can not do with out a tour guid . the last one is abouth the safeti becaus when we visit a new place we dose n't know about the crime rate . by hire a tour guid he would be take us to the place which are safeti . he also help us by contact with the local peopl when we are in troubl . when we are affect with a fever or some sort of health problem he will be know the best doctor in that town . vist a place mean a happi thing , so hire will help us to have safeti trip in conclus tour a new place with a tour guid give us more inform about the place , we can see new more place and safeti . i recoomend to travel with a tour guid when you visit a new place .
