success peopl do not have to tri new thing if they are satisfi their succeed . they should improv their success job rather than tri total new thing . of cours , they can tri new thing but there is no promis to get success again . i assum that peopl could have got success is not so care to tri new job becaus they have confid from their success . they do not have ani presser in bad way . they feel that they can do everyth they want and get succeess . i will not stop them if they have realli good idea for their project or their project have some similar point which they had , or they are quit sure they can get success . acutu , they know how to get succeess and what would be abl to go well or bad . thi is their own problem so i should not stop or disturb them . howev , from my perspect , they should not do that becaus we realli can not get success so often . concentr to one thing is more effect than tri a lot of thing . if they have a lot of categoli to do , they would be so busi and each thing can be too simpl becaus they have no time to think about each shop . for exampl , there is a boss who ha macdonald 's and h & m . if h & m is veri popular and they can get a lot of money from it , who think about a new barger of macdonald 's ? the boss would think about h & m all the time and they do not realli think about macdonald 's . of cours they can get money from macdonald 's but the shop would not be better . for these reason , i do not think success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . they can be a profession peopl of that .
