there is no need to know the thing like concept and idea , which are alreadi known by everyon . in order to be much more creativ and product , student have to learn the fact instead of understand the concept and idea . in my opinion , there are some basic reason for that . first of all , internet ha becom an import factor in student life . they can search the inform which they have been look for and they can learn the fact easili . secondli , it is much more benefici for the student to learn the fact . if they are forc to research the inform and data , they will probabl creat their own idea about a topic instead of understand an old one . that will make them much more creativ and prouduct . for instanc , think a teacher who give an assign to the student about a polit issu . if student search the internet by use googl , he or she will have some inform about the issu and mayb ha a littl inform that alreadi exist . but if he or she tri to understand the basic of polit and learn the fundament fact , he or she can creat hi own opinon about that issu . to sum up , in order to be creativ , student should spend their time by read and research the fact that they do not know . they must learn the fact in order to have their own about topic instead of memoris the consept and the idea which have alreadi been known .
