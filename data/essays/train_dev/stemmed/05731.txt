by discuss the statement , we first have to defin what > > help their commun < < mean . what are the commun ? the commun may be some of sport , music or religi . and what is help ? help may mean help in the familiy ( which is part of the commun ) or by help direct the commun . there are sever method of help in commun . these method chang along the year : in former day peopl were perhap more friedli and more help to each other . they were anoth gener and had other live condit . i also think that the peopl have had anoth familiar surround in which they live and work . as young peopl they had to help the famili e.g by go in the field and do farm . they also use to help other famili , becaus they benefit from each other . the famili had not so much money and so much thing like we have today . so help wa veri import . thi were a commun in these day . nowaday the familiar surround is not so close as it wa a hundret year ago . there are more singl or more famili with divorc parent . so the surround in which the young peopl live nowaday is complet differ to tho who live a hundret year ago . but thi fact i think is the critic point : the young peopl nowaday want to have a bigger or a more famili like famili . becaus of thi fact i think , nowaday young peopl are also engag in their commun by search a more complet familiy . so i disagre with the statement . my own experi confirm thi . a lot of my friend are in sever sport or music commun . and they help there for non profit . i am in our relig commun in my town and i am help the pastor for non profit .
