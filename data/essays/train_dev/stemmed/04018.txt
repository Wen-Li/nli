school that teach k-12 student requir student to studi variou subject . these subject that the student learn are not necessarli use in their carrier . i believ that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . if it is better to master in one specif subject , whi do the school teach numer subject to the student ? a student might agre that the subject that they are learn in school is useless and meaningless to learn . thi is not true becaus as you grow more matur you will realiz that the thing you learn in school realli come to help in the real life . so it is better to studi and have knowledg on variou type of subject rather than have unlimit knowledg on one subject . it may seem better to special in one specif subject when you get a specif job that requir those knowledg you learn . well , thi is just in your carrier . when you get out to the social world , the thing you learn are too profession that no one , but you and peopl who work with it understand . if you want to get involv in a social life and understand life better , it is better to know mani thing . for an exampl , when you go to a parti where all kind of differ peopl gather . you want to talk to peopl , but you onli know that specif topic and do not know other topic that peopl talk about . as a result , you will be seclud and feel alon . in conclus , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani subject than to special in one specif subject . with broad , but mani knowledg you will enjoy better life where you are not left behind , and you will be abl to appreci other peopl 's opinion more . on the other hand if you onli know about a specif subject , you will be left alon and feel seclud . to lead a success life , it is better to know alot of thing rather than a specif topic .
