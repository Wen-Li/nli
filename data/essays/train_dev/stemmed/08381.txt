first of all i want to say , what the question deal with . i am ask if it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or if it is better to special in one specif subject . there are mani advantag and disadvantag for both side . on my opinion it would be better if you have a broad knowledg of mani subject . the reason whi thi is on my opinion will be written down in the follow text . first i want to say , that if you have a broad knowledg you will be abl to work in more compani . so it would be easier to get a job after you finish your school of academ . mayb the compani you want to be hire is search for a person who know thing of everi part of a firm . a reason can be that the firm want to be more free to hire someon . then they can hire you for a work but if a person of anoth work is miss , you are abl to do hi work too . furthermor i have to explain that it is easier to know someth about everi academ part than special in one part . you should know everyth about thi part . i want to give an exampl . if you want to specal in market , you have to know everyth about it . you can onli be hire in thi part of a firm . and if you are not be need in thi part of the firm you will be kick . but if you have the knowledg of sever part you have the possibl to work for exampl in the sell part of the firm . a third advantag of a broad knowledg is that it is more interest to learn new thing . you can learn new thing in all part of academ . it would be bore if you do the same thing the whole of your life . a broad knowledg give yiu the possibl that you can chang yor work . your life would be more exit . to finish the text i want to give reason whi thi is on my opinion . i am studi buis . but i am studi in all part of buis . so i can look with part will be good for me . mayb i will special my knowledg later but i know mani thing of other academ part too . so i will be more flexibl than other worker later .
