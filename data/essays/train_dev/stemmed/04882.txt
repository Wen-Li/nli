some peopl argu that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year . to be frank , i agre with the idea . i have numer reason to support my argument , here i just illust some of them . first and formost , there will be less and less resour in the earth in twenti year , such as ga , oil . and the price of these resourc will grow up qiuckli , which made the privat car less and less popular . so the rail-way and subway transport will play an improt role in the futur . so the number of privat car will be reduc greatli by the market rule . what 's more , the bu and subway will be cheaper and more effici for the peopl in twenti year with the develop of scienc and tecnolog . at that time , choos trave by car , particurli privat car , will be not a wise decis , becaus it cost more , gain less . one strong argument for my conclus is that there may be more convin tasport way in the world in twenti year . for exampl , the bike with solar energi system may be invent in the futur , which will replac the posit of car as the main method of travel and transport . so , in a word , i believ that new tool which is better for tansport will be invent in twenti year . last but not least , the car have bad effect in the environ . they cosum the ga and output the harm ga to the environ . so the use and the number of the car may be control by the gover . and the peopl will also pay more attent to their health , so , more peopl will choos bike as the main transport tool , not onli for the cheap price , but also for rding the bike ha good effect on peopl 's health . so , in conclus , i agre with the statement that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i reinforc my stand point by list the major reason abov .
