the question of take risk and tri new thing rather than continu hi habit , is a veri import question to ask himself in order to know what kind of life we want to live . in my opinion , take risk and tri new thing is the best choic for mani reason . first , if you tri to do new thing , you can discov new product or find new idea . and thi is the best way to succeed if you want to succeed becaus if you do someth that someon have ever done , the copi will be less good than the origin . for exampl , the richest peopl in the world are often someom who invent someth and thu who took risk befor . secondli , the life is more interest and realli amaz when you take risk . in fact , you never know what will happen . therefor you ca n't worri . furthermor , i think that peopl are more interest to speak with you if you can tell them about a new and origin subject . thirdli , if you take risk , you can do someth differ of other activ . and that 's more excit . furthermor , how to succeed if you tri noth and if you just follow the other . inde someom who succeed is someom who work a lot and who do what he want to do . for that , it 's import to take risk . to conclud , i 'm sure that if you want to be a successful peopl , you had to take risk and wa n't be affraid to do new thing . furthermor life is more interest if you do n't what you will do next day , week or month .
