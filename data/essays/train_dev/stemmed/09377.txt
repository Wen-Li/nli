i not agre with the statement that say that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than today becaus of some reason reason . the main and most import reason i have to defend my opinion is that in twenti year the popul would growth a lot , and not onli in africa where the birth-index is enorm also in europ and in all america , and thi is go to occur becaus of the inmigr , it could be legal or illeg , but all the countri are go to suffer the inmigr and migrat proccess , instead of the law and other inpedi govern will tri . the second reason whi i feel there are not go to be fewer car in use in the futur is that in twenti year scientist are not go to be abl to find a new and innov transport method , like fli car or what els some peopl think we are go to have in few year . yeah , it 's true that some scientist have made a fli car but in the case they can comerci it , it is go to be so expens for the mid-peopl , so they are go to use the tradit car . the last reason i am go to talk about is not as import and relev as the two other , it is the comod . nowaday the comod is a veri import factor of our societi , all the innov in technolog or in other subject are to make more comfort our life . moreov , we creat thing not to think more about what to creat , those thing we have creat are go to do that job instead of us . to sum up i have to say that i feel it is ridicul to think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
