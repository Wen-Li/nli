the statement that advertis make product seem much better than they are in realiti is veri true . when i am watch tv at home and get to know new advertis i ignor it . if product would be as good as the advertis promis them to be peopl would onli buy product of which they have seen an advertis . for exampl there are onli star that advertis for a product when you watch tv . alon thi fact show that advertis manipul the watcher . of cours there are product which you see on tv that are realli good in realiti but most of the product are not as good as you think they have to be when you see them on tv . the produc of a new product have to think veri well about what kind of advertis would be the best for there product . concern pay million of dollar in order to produc a new advertis clip on tv in order to increas the number of sol product . if that would n't work they would not spend such sum of money . of cours the number of sold product also depend on whether the product is realli good or not . i think that it is better to compar product or to to ask peopl which product they prefer instead of convinc on a supermodel that that is just enjoy an ice cream on tv . but there have to be peopl that are believ everyth that is told on tv , radio or in some magazin and those peopl make that the concern benefit with their advertis . person i believ in the experi i made and decid if i take aspeci pizza onc more or if i should choos anoth one the next time . advertis do n't have ani influenc on me . as a conclus i think that onli few product are as good as actor ensur in advertis becaus i wa nearli everytim disappoint when i bought a product that i admir on tv . perhap i have had alway bad luck .
