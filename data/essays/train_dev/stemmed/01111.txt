` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are ' , i think that thi statement is true and base on my experi i am go to explain whi i agre with it . when i wa younger , i have been fool by advertis sever time . one of the better exampl is when i decid to lose weigth , i saw at the telivis , peel that seem like magic becaus without ani effort , user could lose a lot of weight and veri quickli . of cours , these pill did not work as well as the advertis said , howev it help me to understand that the purpos of advertis is to sell a product and to tell to the client what tey want to hear . on one hand , i think it is quit normal for an advertis to onli talk about the advantag of a product , even if it is a kind of lie not to tell to the client everyth that they have to know about the product . on the other hand , it can be realli annoy for an user to see that it is harder than in the advertis to make the product work . for instanc , it is alway make me laugth when i watch my mother tri to use a veri complex oven that she bougth becaus the old one did not have all the function of the new one . she never achiev to correctli put the alarm , thu the food is nowaday too much cook . howev , now befor i buy someth quit expens , i alway go on the internet to watch the point of view of user . thi is veri help , for exampl , when i decid to buy a new laptop i spent over a month to compar the produc 's advertis and comment from user . furthermor , i think that when the promis of a product 's advertis and realiti are close that show the serious of the produc .
