i agre with thi statement even though i person preffer travel by myself to jo the packag tour . i agre with thi statement with some reason in the term of price , secur and the time . as the first reason to agre with thi statement , it can be said that if you join the packag tour , it sometim is much cheapter than organis and plane by yourself becaus you can get `` group/parti discount '' . moreov , the travel compani know which place to go or to eat so that the tour price will not to be too expens . some peopl believ that it will be cheapter if you organis by yourself but it is not the 100 percent case . second point is about the secur . even if you get the insur when travel by yourself , you still might face the danger especi when you travel the place you are not famili to . in the case of group tour , howev , the tour guid know much about the place and it is the tour guid 's respons to take the custom safe to the trip . mani elderli peopl seem to join packag tour due to thi secur matter . thirdli , if you join the packag tour , you do not have to spend ani time to organis the tour and to book for accomod and so on . and most of the case , the packag tour includ famou and popular tourist place to go and moreov , the tour guid will explain thing such as histor background od the place they visit and so on . as i state abov , there are mani advantag when you join the packag tour led by a tour guid but there are also some disadvantag . first , if you jo the packag tour , you can not and you do not have to commun with local peopl . by commun with local peopl , you can experi mani thing such as local life and you can get much inform . and in the best case , you can be a friend of them . second , you can not see the place other than the place which are not includ to the schedul . i still agre with thi statement but i also think it depend on peopl .
