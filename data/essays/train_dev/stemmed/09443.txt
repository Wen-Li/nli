at the first , i have to emphas that i total agre with the statement . have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than special in one specif subject . onc you have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , you will easili understand everth in daili life and wo n't get confus by the subtl stuff . the reason whi peopl usual respect and trace abnorm stuff , even think it is enigma , is alway come from the lack of broad knowledg . if they had ever read a lot , then they would easili figur out whi the miracl happen . like the magic show , the magician show everth superis and make peopl confus . but if you ever had that kind of knowledg , and you will easili know what 's the secret insid . same exampl of chemist , they can make lot of uncommon speci . without the broad knowledg , you will never know what trueli happen insid . special in one specif subject is good for a research , that would lead him or she to discov scienc and advanc detaili . but without a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , he might sometim get confus when hi topic is out of hi specif subject . with a broad knowledg is the best way to fix the problem . same as the condict today , scholar who studi in biolog start to studi chemistri , and they also learn the physic process from the physicist . the combin of then make advanc for scienc research .
