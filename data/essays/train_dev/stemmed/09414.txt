the issu of whether or not it is more import for student to understand concept than to learn fact is a controversi one due to it influenc on today student 's educ . on the one hand , learn without understand is claim to lead to make student onli ` wise monkey ' . on the other hand , the current twenti or so gener is said to know far less than former gener and henc should larg learn class content by heart . on my opinion , i agre with the statement abov and consid that understand is a prerequist to learn . the first argument in favor of my posit is that understand is a real reflexion while learn may be seen as a deshuman task . if school educ ha to build tomorrow brain , it seem import that they can understand what they have been taught . the movi ` rainman ' can be taken as an exampl : the stori is about a veri smart man , abl to comput how mani match fall out of a box in second , but unabl to commun with the world surround him . student learn larg amount of fact without be abl to understand basic idea could be seen as futur expert jail in a veri narrow mindset . then , it ha to be note that leibniz is said to have been the last man know everi field of knowledg . in the current centuri knowledg ha becom so vast that it seem hardli imposs to know everyth in a specif field . one life is often not long enough for a specialist to lead all the research he want to . henc , it make more sens to make student abl to think with concept they understand than full of knowledg they do n't even know how to combin the differ element . eventu , creativ is essenti to cope with an unknown situat . while student know mani fact could in a sens recreat learnt solut , student have understand concept and idea could be more apt to deal with the unknown and to fit an accept solut to the problem they cope with . as a conclus , i think that understand is a prerequisit to an intellig learn . the former may not realli be separ from the latter but i think that wise advis and concept are much more use for the mind than a huge amount of data .
