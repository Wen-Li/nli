our world is fill with advertis , they are on the wall , on the radio , on tv , on the internet , and even in artist item such as movi or paint . can we consid the add as be tricki ? to what extent are they give fals inform on a product and doe it depend of the product or of the look that the consumm have on the product ? as far as i am comcern i believ that addvertis do n't lie as far as the consum use the product in good condit . i am not work in the adventis world to have such a point of view , but for peopl who know a littl about law , it is clear that advertis can not lie . there is a legal phrase `` lie advertis '' that would punish all advertis who would give to their product fals properti . and that is the main point about a product that is in add as it is in real life . but how can we explain that product that are said to be wonder do n't plainli work when you buy it and use it at home ? it is not becaus the product is inefici but becaus it is n't use in the same condit as those in the test lab . let 's take shampoo for instanc , they are said to make smoothi and shine hair in add . but when you do buy it , it doe not make the same . whi ? becaus at the first use you do n't benefit of the activ element yet , and becaus your hair are weaken by pollut , stress , etc . .. that make them suffer . the shampoo yet can make your hair as smooth and shine it is said in the advertis . the less point would be that our consum 's eye is not the same as the design one . he will find hi product perfect and he wo n't stop talk about the new thing it bring to us . thi is the main differ that separ the inventor from the user . we wo n't have the same regard on a car as the one of the ingeen who made it or the design who drawnd it . the advertis share thi regard with them .
