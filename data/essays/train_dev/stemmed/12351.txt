a fiftheen year old guy doe n't know exactli what he want to do in hi futur , so i think it 's imposs for him to choos a specif academ field where concentr all hi effort . in my opinion , guy until 20 should investig mani academ subject , so do they acquir a variu cultur background that can help them to take the right decis for their futur . later , they can special their knowledg in one specif subject , in order to reach an excel standard in the cultur field they like . i think thi two step process of trasmit cultur permit to reach differ target . first of all , at the end of the univers cours a man ha attend , he ha the possibl to discuss at the same level with the prior and bright professor about the subject that are link with hi studi . furthermor , the fact that hi cultur baggag is also full of a widespread background , he can get in touch with other realiti , speak the same languag and without misunderstaind . for exempl , an engeni is abl to built a bridg or to calcul the right quantiti of iron in a construct , but also he can talk with a doctor about a medic instrument . the creation of thi open mind could be not onli the target of univers cours , but it 's necessarili to look for it from the first year that guy spend at school .
