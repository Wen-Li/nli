with thi essay i will tri to explain whi i disagre with the statement that there will be fewer car in use twenti year from now . when one look at consolid automobil market such as the usa or europ , one find that even though the number of car in use ha not increas substanti over the last decad , neither ha the number declin . even though other type of fuel might substitut the ga use nowaday , there is no sign of anoth , more effect way of transport . therefor it is veri like that the number of automobil in europ and the usa will remain constant for the next twenti year . on a worldwid scale , i think that the number of car will increas drastic over the next two decad . emerg countri , especi in the asian region such as singapor are show two-digit growth rate in the number of car use . even though thi develop will eventu slow down in these countri , we will still see substanti more car in these region in the futur . while onli look at consolid or emerg market one can alreadi imagin , that the number of car in use will not declin within the next twenti year . there are howev countri such as china or india , that will be the major driver of a stark increas in the number of automobil . these two countri alon make up a great part of the worldwid popul , while the major of peopl in these countri do not yet possess car . in china we can slowli observ what will happen in both countri in the futur . name an immens increas in vehicl . the develop in these two countri alon will lead to a dramat increas in car use worldwid . as a wrap up i can say that i do not onli disagre with the statement that fewer car will be in use twenti year from now , but that come two decad will show an increas in automobil use worldwid .
