i total agre with the opinion that most advertis make product seem much better than how they actual are . there are mainli three reason whi i support thi idea . first of all , i want to underlin what i call `` the valu of experi '' . i think everybodi ha a bad memori of a product he/sh bought . moreov , i think everybodi could tell a stori about how his/her expect were not met by the purchas of good and servic advertis in the media world . i think person experi can say a lot about how tricki advertis can be . as an exampl , i rememb the first time i bought a new type of frozen pizza that wa adverit for a while all around itali . the imag seen on tv show a fine and elabor pizza serv with some fresh napolitan ingredi . in realiti , the pizza turn out to be a poor imit of the origin one that i wa shown in the advertis . second , i think that the type of advertis on tv , newspap and even on the web can never be complet reliabl . what i mean is that a product or servic can not be perfectli reproduc on paper or through a photo . thi second point is pretti technic , but i believ it is import . final , it appear clear to me that advert techniqu are well known and design for be tricki . even in a well-funct market economi , you can not impos rule that prevent compani from describ or present a product in a way that increas it valu . obvious , there are some limit that compani and advertis agenc must follow to be in line with the regul and law enforc , but in gener i think there is enough room to induc a consum to buy good which are not how they are in realiti . in conclus , i think it is inevit to come across product , buy them and then regret to have done so becaus the product were not exactli what we thought .
