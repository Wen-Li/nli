on the one hand , risk is someth unknown so you can never bet if it 'll turn well or not , but on the other hand , i 'm sure if you do n't take ani risk you 'll never be success . although some peopl think that success is not about risk but just a result of their person abil , i agre with the statement becaus differ experi convinc me to that . first of all , i think about histori and all the mathematician , philosoph , writer ( let 's think about galileo , giordano bruno , newton and so on ) who often challeng the way of think of their age and becaus of that they almost die poor and alon . but what 're we still studi in high school or even in a ph . d ? eventu they were abl to carri their idea through centuri and we would n't ever have their thought and teach if they did n't risk dure their life . they contribut to creat our way of think so they 're realli are among the most success peopl ever exist . anoth experi convinc me that risk is an inner qualiti in success peopl . i 'm talk about all the stori we read on the internet or book about poor peopl who decid to chang their life drastic , mayb start a new busi , or `` play '' at the stock exchang market , and suddendli creat an empir ( did n't bill gate start in a garag , did he ? ) if there were no risk , noth would ever been creat . now thousand of peopl work thank to the risk taken by someon in the past , is n't that success ? from my point of view , nowaday mani peopl could get wrong on the concept of success , it 's not just about busi and creat money and that 's whi i consid success all the intern organ 's member ( and everi peac \ maker there ) who everyday challeng incred danger situat risk their live in war countri or simpli help children with mortal diseas in africa . that 's what realli make a better world . in conclus i think that everyon should take hi or her own risk , mayb in what they do the best , in order to becom success consid that not ani risk is worthi to take
