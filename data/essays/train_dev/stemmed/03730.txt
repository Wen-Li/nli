i realli have to say < i do n't know > . thi is a question that i ' ve discuss in the past a lot of time , particullari at the school . i think that the student often think studi like a great possibl to improv their knowledg but also their person . to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject can make a better man or woman in thi societi . an open person cultur can give the possibl to have a lot of relationship . the problem relat to thi opinion is the fals dream that it give to person like me . i do n't think that the current societi can accept a man or a woman that love learn mani thing , but noon like specif . to find a job today it 's more difficult than ever , and if you have not a specif compet you will onli enlarg the big world of unemploy . now i 'm still studi so i ca n't speak about the job world thank to my person and direct experi , but i can see my friend and my brother 's life . they have studi for a long time to be good worker , but i see thi is not suffici . the job and the societi requir everyday a better work . so like i usual have to do when i speak about the differ between a broad knowledg of mani subject and a specif one , i must write that today that 's imposs live in a dream , where everyth in your opinion is interest . today the onli possibl to creat a futur is to leav at home the passion and all the rest , and think about a specif compet that you like and that can give you the possibl to realiz a part of your dream .
