if you had opportun to travel favorit countri or place , i predict you would be happi and excit befor you take a trip . howev , what would happen if the cost of trip is expens , or if you do not have enough time to see place where you want to see ? it would possibl happen if you choos to travel with a tour guid . to avoid thi fact , the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guid , to travel individu . take trip with a tour guid is usual more expens than individu trip . for exampl , the tour guid compani prepar everyth for custom such as book plane , hotel , restrant , buse or car , anyth neccesari for trip . on the other hand , if you prepar the trip by yourself , it could be cheaper . it is beacus you might abl to find cheaper plane ticket , cheaper hotel , etc . if we count on the tour guid compani , we might have to pay more becaus earn money from custom is for thier busi . if you travel with a tour guid , you might not abl to visit place where you are interest in . it is becaus travel as ` tour ' mean alreadi ha rout to see place . when i wa 12-year-old , my famili and i went to franc with a tour guid which wa not good choic for me . we went to a art museum which wa veri bore place although i wa hope i would be abl to get franc soccer team uniform and visit ani soccer store . final , i could not buy or visit ani becaus of ` tour ' . from my thought and experi , i believ the best way to travel is individu trip . it is becaus it would be cheaper , and you might not satifsi the plan of tour .
