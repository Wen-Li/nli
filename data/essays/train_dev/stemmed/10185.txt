young peopl nowaday do n't give enough time to help their commun . i strongli disagre with thi statement becaus nowaday young peopl are veri liber in their view . they are far more better educ then their parent or the older societi . and thi eduact and knolweg help them to think which thing or deed is more benefici for the whole socitey or their commun . like , due the the knowledg of the scienc and technolog they are in better posit to help the commun by gving them the inform about epidam and deasic like malaria , aid , hepit a , b and c.and almost everi young human be is do so by just take the job like scientist , doctor , work in a ngo , etc . secondli they know all the mistak and wrong decis taken by their parent , rel , societi or even gover in the past . for an exampl young peopl of everi nation now do n't want war and they activ protest thi . young peopl now are more interest in the progress of their own countri . and thu they alway tri to make the countri better by work hard for the technolog advanc , much better standard of live . they are more wile to go outsid their countri to gain knowledg and use that in their own countri . for an exampl mani young peopl from develop countri go to anoth develpo countri for their higher studi and then after return they use thier skill and knowledg to help the progress of their countri . final , young peopl alway make sure that they do n't do anyth which can harm in anyway their commun or societi .
