i do agre . in fact i would say that thi issu mark one of the most import cultur differ between europ and the unit state of america , and that it is one with enorm econom impact . while in the usa there is a veri strong cultur of the succ , exemplifi by the work peopl whose valour and will to reach as high as they can lead them to a great econom succ not onli for them but for the entir societi , in europ nowaday econom succes peopl is be regard more and more each year as demon guilti of the miseri in which so mani peopl around the world live . as mani modern european intellectu vice thi opinion is veri like to be found ( but more as a trend to exhib than as a realiti ) in franc . i must say that when i use the term `` economicali succes '' i do not refer to plainli rich peopl but to peopl who ha achiev to make money by themselv and by a product activ . thi leav out specul and the like . i will now justifi my opinion on the french : french youth nowaday would prefer , in a seventi percent major , to becom civil servant rather than to work in the privat sector . be a civil servant in franc ha even more advantag than in the rest of europ about free servic such as health care or educ for your children . howev thi way of think is lead franc to not be abl to keep up econom with the rest of europ , and europ to not be abl to keep up econom with global in gener and with the usa in particular . on the other hand onc you have acquir deep knowledg about someth it seem such a piti not to use it , and the labour market usual demand more specialist than entrepreneur , and much of the featur that make the usa so dynam in econom also creat great inequ in it social tissu not to be seen in europ , so in thi issu as in mani other i would suggest to find an equilibrium point instead of cling to an extrem posit .
