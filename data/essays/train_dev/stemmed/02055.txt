i agre it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject for mani and differ reason . in the first i have mani possibl to speak with the other person becaus the knowledg mani subject will do of me an intrest person . moreov to studi mani subject permit to me to know differ person and differ thing . thi is veri import for my futur becaus i have mani possibl for my life , for my job , for my hobbi , etc . for my job , for exampl , to know differ subject is veri import becaus ti is an intellectu job and if i will special in one specif subject i will not becom a good architect . to special in one specif subject mean that i am a limit person . the knowledg of mani subject is the most import thing for the growth of an individu , the intelletu 's growth , becaus a person can to becom a bad person , while he is an intellig person he will ha n't the difficult with the social relationship . to understand my topic i have an exampl : my father start to work when he wa a child , but when he becam a man for hi cultur and to creat the futur he start to studi and now he is a manag of heat sistem . now the younger have mani possibl for to studi immedi with the school , with numer book , with the tv and with the newspap and therefor becaus it do n't do it . in the end , it is veri bore to studi onli one subject becaus the time do n't never walk !
