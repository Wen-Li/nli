in my opinion thi question need to be dealt with in a differenti way , there are pro and con . a signific argument in favor of the statement is that certain developp which current take place , lead to a higher degre of egoism among the peopl . we live in a world , which global more and more , there is more competit and everyth becom increasingli busi and difficult . one ha to face unemploy or lower wage unless you are better than other , one ha to domin other in a certain way . i think thi quit gener phenomenon gradual lead to a chang in social behaviour , which express itself for exampl in a lack of young peopl , will to help their commun . furthermor young peobl are in mani case not will to help in their commun for the simpl reason that other thing are more entertain . whi should they help older peopl or do some clean job when they could altern spend their time play comput game , watch a seri in televis or hang out with friend . young peopl are n't suffici taught that it can be far more interest to help other and to improv the commun experi . on the other side there are also some argument against thi statement . the exist of a consider number of organ in ther welfare-sector and the fact that young peopl are integr in these organ serv as a proof against the statement that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . there are religi organ , sport club and polit parti which dedic themselv to the duti of help in their commun and the y have mani young member . apart from that the civil servic is the germnan altern to the militarz servic . for the period of one year young peopl can help in there commun .
