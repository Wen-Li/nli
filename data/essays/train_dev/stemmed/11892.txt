i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . whi i agre with the statement is becaus , when i watch tv , i can see a lot of advertis for good thing , and when i see thing from advertis at store , it doe no look quiet same as that of advertis . i like to watch tv , so i often watch a lot of advertis on tv . i have some experi that i want to get thing from that of advertis . when i wa elementari school student , i saw an advertis for a elector staf anim which can walk . then i realli like that staf anim at a granc . it look so cute and can be walk veri well . sinc i realli want to get that staf anim , i ask my mother to get it for me . when i use the stuf anim it did not walk like that of advertis . i wa so sad . i think wy most adversis make product seem much better than they realli are iss becaus , they want to convinc a lot of peopl to but their product . even though they can get more money thank to thier advertis , they are not say true . so i think it is not a good idia . also becaus of the advertis that make product seem much better than they realli are , they can lose customm ' trust . it 's veri bad for them . in addit to lose costom 's trust , now i think a lot of peopl realiz that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . if so , these advertisen can be lost thier purpos of their advertis . i think it is veri import for most advertis who make product seem much better than they realli are to realiz costomm ' mind , and make advertis that can be trust by a lot of costomm .
