intro-advertizements-role-media-halo-rol models-glamor - the role of media ha reach it zenith in thi age . right from a common daily-ne item like a toothpast , to a someth more in vogu like a new design brand apparel , or of technic import like a new tv , a automobil , or a computer-al need the media to make them appeal , or to lure peopl to buy them-irrespect of whether or not peopl need them . infact , these advertis `` creat a need '' rather than cater to the need of those who are in the process of make a decis on someth they alreadi need to buy . advertis , more than often , project a product in a way that the actual effect of the product advertis fall short of the descript ! for exampl , the advertis on bodi cream project such flawless , smooth , entic bodi , although when use , they do not cast the same glow and charisma to the bodi of those who use them ! anoth exampl is of a stain remov . most of them are ineffect , and if they are effect , they ruin the veri color of the garment itself along with the stain . what is annoy is the way they are romanticisedlet asid the idea present in which use it would mean ad romanc to a moment , or find the right guy ! such decept of ad extra charm to a product entic buyer . advertis cast a halo around an item , ad glamor to it by choos attract model to sell for them . peopl , especi younger gener to be more precis , get veri affect by looks-out appear . they tend to copi model and movi star etc . they are in an age that is veri influenti . when these individu watch their favorit model seel for someth , their first impuls is to buy that item . in the process , they seldom realiz whether the product is worth it or not . at time it is of no use what-so-ev . for instanc , recent there wa an advertis that flash on the tv screen , which wa unnecessarili glamor , although the product wa anyth but glamor or flashi . it wa an advertis for a pain reliev pill ! is it necessari to romanticis someth like a pain reliev ? and who is be target ? unfortun , the more vulner part of the society-th younger gener becom a victim . in my view , such decept are harm . they do noth to bulid a societi , rather make it depend on item peopl would never have need otherwis . thi doe n't mean that advertis do n't have their place at all . but if they are more discrimin in their depict , it would be more fair .
