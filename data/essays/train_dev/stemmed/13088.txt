nowaday mani peopl travel in group , led by a tour guid . i think thi is not the best way to travel , and i tri to avoid these organis holiday . sinc i 've been young , i have travel veri much with my famili , and we have never been in a group . thi ha made tie between us stronger , and it give us the oportun to spend time togeth , which is usual hard dure school time . if we had travel with a group , we might not have had so much good time togeth . one that bother me about travel in a group is that you are alway with stranger that , even if they can be veri nice peopl , are not close to you . moreov there can be peopl in the group who tri to impos themselv as the `` leader '' , organ everyth . you then loos part of your autonomi and end up angri at them , and at yourself , for have accept to travel with other peopl . moreov , my famili holiday have alway been organ by my mother , so we could choos what we want to see and how much time we thought we should spend in each place . the memori we have of our trip are therefor veri person and , in my opinion , more satisfi than those of peopl who have to follow a tour guid becaus our are uniqu . moreov , each time i see a travel group i get the impress that their trip is a mear product , that is sold to them and that ha no person content . if they compar their holiday to those of other peopl in travel group they will realis that they visit the same monument and heard the same explan from the tour guid . we can also add that these organ trip leav no space for adventur . for instanc , one of my friend travel to cambodia with her famili and had a seri of accid due to bad weather . even if at first they were nervou becaus their trip had to be chang , they end up have a lot of fun , do thing such as ride motor cycl on secondari road , that they had not plan the least bit ! if thi happen to a group , the agenc in charg can not let them take these `` risk '' .
