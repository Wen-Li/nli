in life there are situat for everyth . in case of thi statement i beliv that there are certain time when the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid but there are also sometim that you want to travel with your famili , friend or by yourself . it depend on your expect of the trip and how you like to travel . travel with a tour guid is alway much more practic and easier . here , most of the time thing work as they are suppos to work . flight are book , hotel have reserv , restaur are good , time are schedul and thing just run easli . thi is a perfect choic for a first time visit to a place . if you onli have a coupl of day , and want to get to know as much as you can , a tour is perfect . it will show you all around , the most interest site and what everyon talk about . in the other hand , travel by yourself is complet differ , here you get to make your own choic . you decid when you want to wake up , at what time and where you want to go to dinner and what museum you want to go visit . thi is a much more relax time . it is a perfect situat for a second time visit , here you get to go to the place you most like the last time you visit and do exactli what you want . it requir much more individu plan , well no one is go to to that job for you , but it also ha certain priviledg . i also beliv that a group and a tour is not a thing for everyon . you have to be toler with the other peopl around and you have to let peopl boss you . if you are not a type or person that like to rush and be with a lot of peopl , travel by yourself is the best choic . i dont think you can say what is best , you just have to consid the type of trip you want to have and the type of person you are . then you can make the right choic and enjoy a perfect trip .
