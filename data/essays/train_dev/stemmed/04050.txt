i complet agre with the statement of ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid ' for sever reason . the first and foremost one would be the safeti and comfort offer by your companien in group , especi when travel to new place farwaway from home town . in case of ani unexpect emerg or untoward event happen on travel , you have a gropu to take care of your need and shre the burden and sterss . secondli , the guid tour would provid right inform about theplac and one can get more precis inform about the place visit for the first time . also , a guid tour in a gropu is more econom over person tour with or without a guid . the guid are train to perform the tour on a time manner while explainig the fact in detail . when you are in a group , you would spend less money on travel , accomod , and money spent on engag a travel guid . tough it may not be possibl to spend their time as one wish , while travel , it provid the opportun to ineract with other peopl in group and know more about the place than it would be other wise . i provid a typic exampl , to justifi my opinion . it is about my travel in india last year . i have to spend about $ 150 to go to a histor place all by myself in a taxi , while it cost onli a fraction of that , i.e $ 5 if i choos to travel by public transport that wa avail . i choos to go by taxi as i wa alon and afraid of travel in public transport system along with the mani local , for fear of isol as i do n't under stanfdth la thu in conclus , a guid tour in group is , safe , econom and time save .
