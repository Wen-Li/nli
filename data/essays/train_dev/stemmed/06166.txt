young peopl stand for the futur of one societi . it is worthi of discuss what they do when they are free . recent there are mani report of younth consumpt of luxuri purs and cosmet in taiwan . young peopl are depict as egocentr and indiffer to social condit in such report . is it true that the youth nowaday are no longer embodi of passion to chang the world ? examin care , there are mani exampl of enthusiast young men to help their commun . for instanc , a group of sophomor and junior student in yang ming medic colleg annual visit yu li asylum to support therapist there . the prepart begun at least one year earlier . these futur doctor learn not onli from textbook but also from interact with patient . they are not satistfi with a knowleag of diseas and therapi ; human be are their ultim concern . sinc some young peopl contribut their leisur to those who are in need , then where doe the myth of aloof youth come from in taiwan ? i think there might be some reason behind the prejudic to young peopl . nowaday young peopl are more dare to express their discont to social realiti than their parent did . but our societi regard these opinion as pure complaint , a symbol of arrog . thi is the first mistak , although some young peopl are busi indulg in variou kind of luxur , other are dedic to improv of where they live . it is not fair to deni the effort made by young peopl tip a tag of lazi . so i ca n't agre that young peopl nowaday do n't give enough time for their commun .
