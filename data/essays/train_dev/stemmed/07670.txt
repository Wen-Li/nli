i do n't absolut agre with the statement . i studi at univers sinc i wa 19 year old and in these three year i 've understood how ha been import to have choosen one specif subject to studi . usual the most import univers offer a lot of cours : each one belong to a specif subject . for instanc , i studi `` transport and logist engin '' , that is a particular aspect of the world of engin . thi doe n't mean that i do n't studi the basic subject of engin ( as mathemat analysi , phisic , statyst etc . ) : i studi these subject the same , but perhap i studi onli their basic aspect . if i had to studi all the aspect of all the subject , i think i would n't have the time to do anyth els , becaus it would requir me too much time . consid that now i studi 8 hour a day at univers and 6 hour a day at home . moreov i spend 2 hour to go to univers from home : how could i find the time to studi everi particular aspect of everi subject ? i think i would becom mad ! . so , i think that know a lot of thing is beauti , but at the end it is imposs . thi is also becaus the univers tri to prepar student for the job they will do in the futur . thi job usual belong to one or few subject studi at univers . so whi do i have to studi more and more subject ? i talk you about my experi . the aim of my cours is to prepar student to solv transport and logist problem within a few time . thi is veri import for us , becaus in thi way we avoid to studi some subject and instead we can concentr on the most import one , in other word the most `` oper '' one , that comprehend the knowledg that actual we must have when we 'll do our job . for all these reason , i confirm that i complet disagre with the statement .
