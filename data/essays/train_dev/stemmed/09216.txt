some peopl have broab knowledg of mani academ subject , which mean that they know littl on mani mani differ thing , some other know a lot about onli a few subject , which mean that they 're special in those subject . what is the best ? as far as i 'm concern , i realli believ that student should touch a littl bit evreryth , they should be in the know , not onli about the differ subject they have in class , but also about what happen in the outsid world of their univers . i think that if somebodi ha a broad knowledg of mani academ subject it show it mind-op and it interrest for what other learn and studi . nevertheless , if you know littl about mani differ thing you can take part on a lot of convers , but as soon as it get to the core of the matter you get lost , given that it will be to specif for you and you wo n't be abl to answer question . on the other hand , if you know a lot about onli a few subject you can depen convers on those you know but you ca n't even take part at convers which deal about someth you may never have heard about , or you can ask but the other peolpl may look at you as if you where from anoth planet . that is the risk you undertak . so to resum my opinion , i think that there ha a balanc to be found between have a broad knowledg on mani differ academ subject and bee special in onli one . that mean that one should be open-mind and have a lot of differ point of interest but in the same time that one should know everyth in an exact way about one or maximum two specif subject .
