i definit do not agre with thi statement . accord to me , understand idea and learnig from fact have the same import . let 's take for exampl fore languag teach . it is self-understandind that first of all is requir a base , someth a student can reli on to move in hi `` fore environn '' , for thi reason teach grammar , verb , preposit and so on is veri import , but these thing have to put into practic . thi practic can not onli be small speach between student and teacher an between the student . in my experi , i 've alway prefer to be alon , in a foret \ ing countri with no one around who speak my same languag . thi is the onli way to learn a fore languag the proper way , to put into practic what you learn in class . i can give anoth exampl ; some italian highschool that have the purpos to teach languag as a second languag , spend two over five year to teach grammar and the remain three on literatur . of cours thi is import , it 's onli through book you can deepli understand the way peopl think . but thi is not enough , onc an italian student finish highschool , he is abl to talk onli about literatur , sometim he ai n't abl neither to order a meal at the restaur . thi is the reason whi i think fore languag teach should be `` both-sid '' . on one of ` em you give student the basic , then you encourag ` em to use these teach : mayb school could organ period when a student goe abroad to work an live , so he/sh can realli be abl to reli on himself , and not onli on hi way of speak . school ha to be tha chanc to grow , not onli as a student , but also as men and women . thi is the reason whi i think understand idea and learn from fact have the same import .
