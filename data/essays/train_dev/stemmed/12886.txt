i gree that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agre with that for mani reson . such as , they will find mani good ide , and a lot of diffrenet concept . what everi bodi know that peopl learn fact by them selv , so it 's less import to understand . what i think is more fun is that student realli need to realiz other peopl idea and concept . student will share idea and concept . furthermor , they will be involv . the most import thing that student will come up with mani good idea and concept . therefor , it is more import for student to understand , realiz , and consid idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . as what said befor , that peopl can learn fact in their own life . what i need to mention is that fatc are basic thing . you ca n't chang the fact or do anyth with it . on the other hand , you can improv you idea and come up with a better one . that 's i am agre with that student need to realiz idea and concept . befor i came to america , i did n't like it , but my cousin advis me to come . it wa my cousin idea . everi bodi ha mani idea and concept . one exampl is self help concept . that concept make peopl are independt , so they can do their own busi . i wa n't a self help concept befor i came to america . now , i am a self help consept . i learn that in america becaus peopl in america are diffrent than peopl in my countri , peopl here make their own busi by them selv , but peopl in my countri get help when they need . the fact that i am agre with statement is that peopl are abl to imprv idea and concept but not fatc .
