i do not agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . person , i think that peopl who are 60 or older would enjoy their live much more that younger peopl , especi peopl who are between that age of 16 to 50 . i agre the reason for be young is to have fun and enjoy life , but that doe not mean that onli young peopl can have fun , and older peopl would definit have bore live . for exampl , my grandmoth who live s in china is 70 year old , but i have never heard her coomplain about her life is bore . even though she live alon at home , but she still ha her social life like i do . she sign up for a ballroom danc class at the local learn center , and goe there three time a week . sinc then , she ha made mani more friend , and becaus she is veri good at danc , she feel that is the place that she belng to . as for me , i have made friend in my school sinc i move here , and i constantli hang out with them . anoth reason i think that older peopl would enjoy life more than younger peopl is becaus most of the peopl who are 60 or older are retir , they do n't have to work anymor . which mean they do n't have to deal with the all the pressur from work or school , perhap the relationship between co-work and boss . i can see that everi night when my parent come home from work , they alway look exhaust , but they still have to cook , and finish the rest of their work after dinner . they also have to face other problem such as morgag , bill , my colleg tuition and more . on the other hand , my grandmoth , who is alreadi retir , she doe not have to worri about thing like that , she can just relax and enjoy the rest of her life . therefor , i do not agre with the statement and i think that older peopl can enjoy their live even more .
