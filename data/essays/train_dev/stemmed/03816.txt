i actual live in barcelona , a citi with a lot of traffic . i have a car but i usual go everywher by public transport . i onli use the car to go outsid the citi . howev , nowday are a lot of car everywher and , in gener , we use the car for go everywher . consequ , it 's difficult to imagin a citi with fewer car . i realli think that in a short period of time it will be less car everywher . there are a lot of reason for think like that . the first one , is that in some year will be veri expens use the car . for exampl , the petroleum resourc are finish and everyday the ga price is increas . anoth exampl is that in barcelona in most of the place we have to pay to park the car . thi reason make public transport cheaper in compar with car 's price . the second reason is that in the big citi is faster go by public transport everywher than go by car . we have a veri function and complet underway , with a lot of line . it is also veri regular , we have one everi five or ten minut . moreov , there are a lot of underway station in the citi . if you use thi station you do n't have to spend time look for a place to park the car . on the other hand , the peopl who live outsid the citi ha a lot of problem for use public transport . in most of the littl citi or town , the public transport onli work one time in an hour or mayb the station is at 30 minut walk . if thi happen , it 's easier and faster go by car than use a public transport . in summari , i think that the number of car will decreas in the big citi , with good public transport , and it will be the same in the litll citi and town . unless the gover improv the public transport overther . in conclus i think that it will be fewer car in the futur but it will not happen everywher .
