travel in a group and be led by a tour guid ha both advantag and disadvantag and the consider about whether it is a best way of travel or not depend on mani factor . suppos you are a busi work man and you want to spend your vacat or annual leav . you have a week or two and you plan to go somewher . first of all , most peopl want comfort in such case and they would want go to the major sightse . in such case , organ tour led by a guid is the best option : the tourist compani will arrang everyth for you - all you have to do is enjoy . the guid will tell you what most travel would like to know and you do n't have refer to a book to find out about the sightse you 're at . you are free of all the uncertainti and risk involv in travel alon and be respons for yourself . but travel in a group led by a tour guid ha sever restrict and they are even frustrat if you are seek adventur or total person experi . i felt it person when i went to a turkic tombston in rural mongolia with a group of tourist . the tombston wa awsom at least for me for i wa interest in turkic histori . it had inscript on it and i wa badli want to tri to read it on my own ( i onc spent some time tri to learn the old letter ) . but the group had onli 2 hour to spend there and i had to leav the tombston with them too becaus other member of the group did not share the same interest and the schedul said that we should be at the tourist camp by 4 o'clock . i felt so frustrat that i decid then that i will go there alon sometim afterward . so thi exampl of mine illustr the bad point of guid travel - you 're not free to decid where to go or where to stay for how long . you ca n't actual , if i can put it thi way , `` tast '' the activ and the place becaus the experi is not all your : it rather turn out to be a group experi and it doe not give you that feel when you find do someth , think about someth out , experi someth on your own without be distract . person , therefor , i prefer to travel alon if i have enough time but at the same time , i agre that organ travel can be use and enjoy experi if you doe not have enough time or if you are not realli into the destin of your travel .
