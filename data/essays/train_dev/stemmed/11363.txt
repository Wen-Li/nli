in my univers , most of the student tend to complet their studi in the field that they start , and they direct their mind into one specif subject without go out of it . for student thi easi path alway give mani advantag on their own field . howev , without ani interact with other subject academ life might be too mediocr . student who satisfi all the offer cours in one subject have a good chanc to enhanc in that subject , and they can easili follow what is requir for them becaus the curriculum is alreadi determin for them . for exampl , dure the whole of his/her undergradu studi , a student who studi in depart of mathemat must regist for a certain number of credit or cours which are all relat to mathemat . such a person whose mind is full of mathemat problem might be a veri reput academician or scientist in the futur , but he/sh lose the chanc of learn differ subject and relat and develop them . on the other hand , one who tri to get a broad knowledg of variou academ field can use those subject with each other . in other word , one specif subject can help to develop anoth . for instanc , although i studi philosophi at the univers , in the second year of my studi i chose to regist for a minor program on architectru . thi gave me o good chanc to interpret architectur product in a philosoph way . i gain a chanc to investig architectur effect on human . in conclus , even though specializt on a singl subject might be use within that subject , for me it is more enjoy and interest to special in avarieti of subject . thi provid me to creat my own style in the academi .
