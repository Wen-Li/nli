dure the educ , the studi and even when decid for a job , peopl are often put in front of an import question : is it better to get veri deep into one specif subject or to keep a more broad mind . there are sever argument support both side . on the one hand , the amount of knowledg and inform is get alway bigger nowaday becaus of the internet and the globalis . so if you want to work on a special topic and produc or design product or even develop new technolog , it is veri import to realli understand thi topic . and becaus of the enorm amount of inform mention befor , one ha to special in thi singl subject . on the other hand most invent and develop made today , are just a part of a bigger system . so after invent and produc veri special element , there have to be peopl who do not neccesarili understand everi detail of thi element , but who know how to put them togeth to one big and work system . they have to keep all aspect in mind and they also must know where to look if someth doe not work . veri special peol would have no chanc here , becaus they onli understand their own compon . so broad mind peopl are need . anoth point is that peopl speciaiz in one singl subject often have veri big problem when commun with other peopl special in a differ subject , becaus they know noth about it . here broad mind peopl are veri help to connect member of differ subject becaus they have enough knowledg in both area . final one also ha to see the situat out of a veri pragmat point of view . if you have to leav the compani you are work in becaus it goe bankrupt or whatev , you will have to look for a new job and of cours the chanc to get employ in a new compani is much bigger if you can work in a broad field , than if you onli can do one specif work . take everyth into consider , i have to say that nowaday , specialist are veri import in our societi . but peopl with a broad knowledg of differ acaden subject are definetli need and at least as import as specialist .
