i think that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun becaus school do not provid these opportun to the children and children lose their familiar with their hometown . nowaday , the children are expect to enter a high-level collag and get a master degre becaus they will get haigh salari or high posit in the compani if they can achiev to take a collag educ . therefor , parent demand the school to give a good educ for their children , and school make a rigid studi carriculum . they give student a lot of homework that do not permit student to have a free time to do someth . they studi hard even after the class and remain stay in the classroom . they are get tire and can not have a time to help their commun . by get tire , they do not look for their surround . in other word , they can not afford to care about their commun . in addit that , nowaday the connect with neighbor are weaker than befor . sometim a child doe not know even the neighbor 's face and the number of famili member . it caus the careless to the neighbor . if they do not know the neighbor , they do not think they have to consid about neighbor . in conclus , what i would like to say is young peopl do not have enough time to help their commun becaus they have to use their time by studi , and they are not familiar with their surround environ . howev , we should not complain the children about thi . actual , we , adult made thi situat . we grab away their freedom and , we do not children to have kind to the surround . we should know what the import thing which we have to teach children , high level educ ? kind to other ? it is import .
