although accord to some peopl learn fact is more import for student than understand idea , i believ that the latter one is the key concept in educ . understand idea and concept about lectur is veri import in a student 's life becaus they teach the reason whi someth happen in a particular way . a person who memor or learn onli the fact about a topic can answer mani question about it correctli but when he face with a situat where he ha to modifi , repair or make comment about someth he would not be veri success . know fact onli is not enough for make comment on a topic or explain the reason for someth 's happen . in order to success do these one ha to know the answer for the question like what is go on or what are the underli principl which can be learnt by understand the idea and concept about the topic . think of busi life where peopl are face with mani difficult problem . mani of those problem can not be overcam by not know what realli is go on . for exampl , in a softwar compani which is design and build a highli complex and huge program employ usual have to solv problem relat to the algorithm use in the program or even creat new algorithm to solv a problem . also , the solut that are made must be not onli success but also effici . in order to creat an algorithm which bring a success and effici solut to problem , the employ have to be abl to understand the problem as a whole , think and comment on it and creat new idea base on the old one or even from scratch . thi of cours can not be done by just know fact . as a conclus in order for a person to be success in hi life he ha to learn the idea and concept behind a topic becaus from my point of view , thi is the most import thing that help peopl develop new idea or explain current one .
