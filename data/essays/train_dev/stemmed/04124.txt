from my point of view thi statement is onli partial true . through my studi in the area of manag and entrepreneureship i know that the typic success entrepreneur is not the crazi person mani peopl think . quit the opposit is actual the case . a success entrepreneur think hi idea and plan through veri care befor act . even though it is of cours true that there is alway some risk involv , risk-tak should not be confus with careless . more over , i believ that a person who realli know where hi or her strength lay , can be veri success . for exampl , if a person ha a passion for and the abil to build guitar , it will probabl be best to exploid and build on thi abil , rather than tri to build mani differ instrument . special is the kye here . so , if someon is good at someth and like what he or she is do , improv the skill in thi area will be more success that start to experi . thi of cours doe not mean that a person , who focus one hi strength , can stop learn . it onli mean that the energi for learn new way and method should be focus on that one particular area . for the guitar builder , for exampl , thi would mean to everi now and then tri someth new to improv hi procedur . he could mayb invent a machin which help him to be more effici . therebi he would be would tri someth new but the risk involv if the machin doe not work is limit . anoth way to tri someth new without carelessli take risk is to transfer experi . a person who ha gain expertis in a particular area might find a new and differ way to use thi knowledg . use the same exampl , the guitar builder could for exampl begin a cooper with a violin builder and exchang knowledg . the process involv are similar but neither of them would have to actual start build the other instrument but both could still profit from the experi . after all , i would rewrit the satement as follow : success peopl tri new thing but care estim the risk involv .
