`` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . '' i am strongli agre that idea and concept is much more import than just learn or rememb the fact as it is . although we are surround by million of billion of fact , but as a student , i believ that somehow tell them how to fish is better than just give them fish . undeni , we have to learn some basic fact in order to do some further explan or elabor . ultim , we go through that much of studi basic is to archiev someth . if our goal were just to learn someth , learn fact will be much more easier and effect . but we are not onli learn , absorb , and memor ; we are also improv , creat and invent . for instanc , if we just tell a student that sun provid heat and light . he will just tell you as it is . in other hand , if we told the student the idea and concept of sun provid heat and light . perhap here come differ , sinc the student understand well , he have much more space for him to creat or imagin . imagin bring creation . by simpli memor or learn fact will not prevent the student from further think . henc understand is better than learn . follw is understand will give the student better imprint than just by hard learn . peopl say , '' learn by heart not learn by onli head '' or '' studi smart not studi hard '' . these show that better concept on a subject will creat a newlin in studi . student will never allow to say , `` sorri , i forgot '' . thi is becaus they are not memor hard or just `` swoll '' as it is . thing that they learn is learn by exampl , idea , and concept . the will simpli recal the fact by see the exampl or relat thi to that by ultim know the basic idea . we are move to a new world , a whole new era . student are those who support the come futur . they should neither studi with onli old fashion style nor just forget about tradit . instead of that , they should studi in a fusion , a combin way of studi .
