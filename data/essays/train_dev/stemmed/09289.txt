i agre with thi statement , but onli refer a littl part of advertis , in fact i think a larg part of the advertis tell the truth about the good characterist of a product . for exampl i can talk about the tooth past that is present more and more contol by test to grant secur , or i can think about ani other product that reguard our saniti and need to be test clinic and that advertis demonstr : i use a veri great quantiti of cream that i buy onli with the grant name of a famou beauti factori , and thi secur in my shop is given by advertis that state their good proprieti , year by year . but other advertis seem to offer a veri good product that is n't so good : i think about our tv advertis , that tri to captur peopl with all kind of word , for exampl by say that product is use onli by the best peopl , or it'i sale onli for best shop , or by a veri famou testimoni like the most favourit charact of cinema to captur differ type of target ( from teenag to older peopl ) . i do n't mean all thi advertis do n't tell a true characterist of a product , but sure it tri to show the product as the best product in nowaday busin . in fact our businn is full of product that are all the same , but are continuosli chang ad some more ingredi to make peopl think it 's a more suitabl product , more comfort , more capabl to solv problem than the previou ( which is product by the same factori ) . it 's a continu increas of product to make busin move , and thi is possibl onli with concurrenti product , even if thi mean to show a new product that doe n't differ by the previou one but that is shown to be bettert than it .
