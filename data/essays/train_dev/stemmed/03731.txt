in today scanario it seem that car are the import part of life and drive a car is statu simbl . by view the growth in product of car and use it seem that in futur time all the way are overcrowd by car . but i believ that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today becaus of some strong reason like fuel problem , awair about pollut and health problem caus by car . fuel are limit on the earth . in world veri small region are known where fuel are found . fuel are the main sourc of car . due to a larg quantiti of consumpt the scarsiti of fuel ha been gener and the price are grow up and up . so when fuel is end their is no car on the road and automat reduc the car . now peopl are veri well known about the harmful effect of pollut which is caus by car after the burn of petrol . it caus sever health problem like asthama and other breath relat problem . peopl do n't want to take risk on their life . pollut also caus the environment chang by which all the inhabit are affect . and the last reasion that due to spend more time in car peopl are affectd with their back problem and get fat which caus the diseas . i would like to give an exampl that in recent newspap studi show that due to use car and lack exercis 60 % peopl have suffer from back pain in the age of 30 . so when they consult with the doctor and knew about the reason most of them leav the car and start the use of bicycl . although it is true that it seem veri difficult that the car are decreas in 20 year but most of the peopl think about bicycl which caus no pollut , and also good for health , also redus the risk of accid are good for them . they also adappt cycl and certain countri the car are also decreas due to awair of peopl . so i beliv that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
