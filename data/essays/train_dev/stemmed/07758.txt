in my opinion , for student , understand concept is more import than mere learn fact . thank to my person experi , there sever reason which can support thi statement . first of all , if student manag to understand concept , then they can studi them in depth mayb discuss with the professor or with other classmat . they can decid if they disagre or disagre while , learn fact , doe not allow student to dicuss about them . from discuss , new idea can develop , give to student the impress of contribut to the gener knowledg grouth . secondli , tri to understand a concept is much more challeng than learn fact . of cours , thi is a more difficult way of learn , but i am convinc that in the end it give better result becaus if student want to understand concept they have to think about them . while reason and discuss about a concept , student start natur to memor it without learn the lectur by heart . final , studi thank to the understand of idea and concept is not onli use , but also less bore . for exampl i would find realli bore to learn a sequenc of date and histor event , while i would find much more interest to tri to link them logic , find caus effect bound . in conclus , i understand that sometim , especi for literari subject , learn fact is necessari , but i strongli believ that thi way of learn ha to be accompani by a deep understand of the fact and of the link betweeen them . thi is not onli a good way of memor witout too mucch effort , but also a way of make the learn more engross .
