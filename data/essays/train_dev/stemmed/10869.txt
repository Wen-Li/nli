i somewhat disagre with the statement becaus i believ that although it may be import to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , it is more effect for your futur career if you special in one specif subject . for exampl , in school i learn about mani subject includ scienc , mathemat , drama , music , histori , photographi , ethic , etc. , which serv me as basic knowledg for my day to day live . after i graduat i decid to studi market , and i made a bachelor in busi administr with a concentr in market . therefor i had to take financ and account clase , addit to the market concentr clase . i wa n't as happi with the account and financ clase , as i wa with the market clase , but i believ that it is imort for me to have at least a gener knowledg of other relat subject . thi two cours serv me as a support base for what i learn in market becaus it 's relat . and `` relat '' is the clue word here . i do n't find it necessari for me to studi a littl bit of medicin , architectur and polit in the univers , just to have a broad knowledg in mani subject . for me it 's more import to concentr in subject relat to my major if that 's where i want to work in my futur . that 's whi i 'm plan to do now a master degre , to even concentr more and learn more in the studi befor . therefor , i conclud that learn about other subject it 's useful for your day to day live and gener knowledg , but as you get older i believ you should concentr more in the subject you want to work with . special in one specif subject make you a `` pro '' in it , and it is better to be a `` pro '' in a subject than to be a `` mediocr '' in mani subject .
