the product of coar need to be advetis . the genuineti of the product is one of the nost import thing that a prudoct may have . the pubblic is a soul of tradind and obvious made a product better that in reali is . if we take for exampl about a shoe , in nike spot we can easi see the peopl that run faster than thi wind , or jump higher than the sky , but in realli thi concept are unbelivebl . all of us kwon that nike shoe is like an other common shoe , but the advertis make product much better yhan they realli are . an other exampl are sky , the satellit tv compani , that in the advertis show that yuo can take home the famou movi , in realli sky offer the same thing that an other tv compani offer . pubblic aim is onli to encurag the peopl to buy thi product instead the other one . an other exampl will be the advertis of a car , the pubblic tell that one car is `` like no one '' , but it is icred , all of the car hav e got 4 wheel , an engin . .. it 's incred that car are so differet to justifi `` one like no one '' !!! in my opinion advertis make product much better than they realli are ; so i like thi advetis but i kown that the truth is not what i see , i think that other peopl on the earth are enjoy with me , but i also know that the largest popul of the world may not enjoy with me , is for they that the advertis is referd to .
