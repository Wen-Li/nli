the tradit car , which are be use today use petroleum , which is a non renew sourc of energi for their function . it is a well known fact that the petroleum reserv are limit and are fast dri up . but i feel that thi and the eventu exhaust of petrol in futur doe not prevent the car be use . scientist world over have work extens to find a solut to the abov said problem and have come up with some practic and feasabl idea of have car that run on `` altern energi sourc '' . by `` altern energi sourc '' , we mean those energi form which are not convent use . newer and advanc method are be discov to power the `` concept car '' . the use of fuel cell , which releas energi by the combin of hydrogen and oxygen is not onli a potenti sourc , but also renew in the sens that it use alcohol , obtain by plant decomposit as fuel and give out water as bi product . though thi concept is still in infanc , regard the safeti paramet , few car design to test these cell have given posit result and hope . recent , in the europ , a car which run on recharg batteri , use electr for recharg wa under demonstr . thi electr driven car is not onli be use in other part of the globe , but is also be recomend as it is eco-friendli . unlik the exhaust gase from a petrol driven car , thi car produc absolut zero bi product . the other invent be done in these line are the `` solar batteri '' driven car and those which have a combin of more than one of these sourc . the prime relat area where statist are be work out is to see the effici , safeti and the unit cost when such car are under mass product . henc , whether the petrol reserv dri up or not i person feel that the car which run on the abov said energi sourc will without doubt replac the petrol driven car and see to it that car are use as much as they are be use today and who know , even larger in number .
