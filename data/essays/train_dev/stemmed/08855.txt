it would be too easi to simpli agre or disagre thi statement . i will explain in the follow paragraph whi both are veri use . first we need expert who have a great and deep knowledg about a veri specif topic . the reason for thi is quit simpl . without expert how could man discov new theori in physic for exampl or creat new technolog . if thale had never exist man might not have discov a veri import mathemat theori , and it is the same for newton , galileo , or even einstein . without expert we might consid than man would not progress much and would remain at the same state for million of year . when you see how wa life a thousand year ago and how life is today you understand that these expert are compulsori for man . on the other hand of cours we need peopl who have a broad knowledg of plenti of academ skill . we need them becaus they are the link between the differ expert in our societi . besid to fulli understand a situat it is sometim a lot more use to have a great background base on differ area of knowledg than be a specialist on one specif subject . for exampl , to lead a project you will need someon , the project manag , who will be abl to understand variou area of activ so that he can sum up all the work done for the project and lead the project properli to reach the expect of it . thi person doe not need to fulli understand all the detail which are know by the expert , but he need to have littl knowledg in variou area to understand all the expert who do not alway work on the same subject . in other word thi kind of person are use becaus they can understand the `` big pictur '' . to conclud , it must be understood that we need both kind of person becaus the work of the first one complet the work of the second . it is like in natur , we need water and fire .
