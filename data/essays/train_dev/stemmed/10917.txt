nowaday , most compani if not all of them , reli on advertis to make a certain product or object known and valuabl . they actual use the advertis to compet with other compani and sell more . howev , are the advertis the real imag of what product realli are , and how much they cost ? unfortun , most custom are get a `` disappoint '' feel when buy a certain product , or after have bought it . for exampl , when we see an advertis about a car , the price is usual without tax , and without ani option . howev , when the custom see the panel , he would get excit about the price meet hi own budget . so he would go and prepar hi save and tell everyon about it . then , when buy the car , the compani would tell him : '' excus me sir , do you need it with an automat transmiss ? do you want the window to be electr control ? '' and with everi question come , the custom 's smile would give place to a sarcast and fake smile , that would total disappear with : `` excus me sir , thi price wa without tax . '' now , can the custom chang hi mind after the price increas by a coupl of thousand of dollar ? it 's not that easi , after have sold hi own car , for exampl , and have told everyon about the new vehicl he wa go to buy . on the other side , some compani have the option to refund their custom if they are n't satisfi about the product . howev , how mani custom will actual have the time to go and ask for a refund about hi product ? in addit , will it be a total refund ? in most case it is not . they would tri to sell you anoth product instead of the older one . final , we can realis nowaday that most of what we see on televis and panel is n't true . `` ly '' to peopl will actual make compani lose on the long run , becaus a disappoint custom will not come back . therefor , everi compani is in a dilemna between `` show off '' and lose on the long run , and give the world the real imag of their product .
