some peopl may be call success when they do new thing and get success . whatev they do for success such as take risk , put a great effort , work contin without rest can be list as a reason for their success . i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well and i stongli believ thi . when peopl tri new thing they might face some problem . to solv those problem they should take risk for one or other reason . for exampl take a student who is do hi basic in math . suppos he is well known with the addit and subract and to go further that is to know about multipl he ha to take risk . thi may includ spend more time in studi or calucl becaus it is a new topic and he need more practic in that . and come to a project leader he guid hi student about the same project for year . he may find it easi and also perfect to in do that . when he goe for other project that is new to him he should take risk in do that . it includ studi the project , find a solut for that , and to teach hi student in an effici manner . thi make him success . i can give anoth exampl of a success person . he wa dhirubhai ambani one of the famou industriliast in india . he cam from a villag to citi and start cloth bussi . he got success in that becaus he know how to do well in that bussine . but he wa not consier success until he tri some other busi other than hi cloth busi . he shift to petroleum industri and he offer a low price of petrol that other didnt give . and also he start a telecom industri and he gave the lowest price of mobil and aslo the call rate when compar to other . thi signifi the risk taken by him and then he becam a success person and also an inspir to other . so do the same thing make u perfect in that perticular task but not a success person . to be a success person u should tri new thing and take risk in acheiv them .
