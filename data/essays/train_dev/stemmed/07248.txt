gener , i do agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl , becaus it is a matter of fact that young peopl live in less stress and respons than older do . from anoth perspect the lack of matur might be one of the major reason for thi enjoy , also no much attent is paid to the consequ of ani action made by the young . furthermor the youngster enjoy life more due to less explor and expect than older peopl which involv exit , the older we get , the more we know and expect even if we are travel to a new site , while for exampl if you observ a kid in a park you can tell the differ in the approach and the movement while older are set still becaus they till them selv that i alreadi know the feel . on the other hand the more younger the less mind occup and complex while proceed in life , you find the teenag with bigger smile and exit than the colleg boy who start think of hi career and how good hi gpa should be , who is ani way more happier than a recent marri man with more respons on hi shoulder , not to mention a man spous a wife and a group of children and respons financi about their school and cloth , as we can note that pressur and respons get acceler when we grow older which unfortunatli minim the joy in our live . nevertheless , i do think that those accumil problem becom the joy of a life time when a son is notic graduat with first honor from school or get marri , yet the price of sacrific made through the year is refund at onc with a joy no young peopl can ever experi . in conclus i believ each age got it is own joy , depend from which prespect and angl we are look from , even though if i 'm to choos , i will spend my whole life as a teenag .
