i absolut agre whit the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their comun becaus they have other worri in life and do not have more time to be involv with their commun . nowaday young peopl ha mani other worri and doe not have time to spend for their commun . thi problem are that some younger while are studi they have to work in order to pay their studi . other younger have problem with money and as nowaday life is veri expens they have to work so mani hour in order to go on with everyth . and if we talk about younger that have alreadi children , it is not viabl . for instanc , i am 27 year old and i finish my degre and now i would like to do a postgradu program oversea in order to improv my profession skill and knowledg . in order to do that now i have to spend most of my time work so mani hour so i will be abl to carri on with my studi . not onli i have to worri for my studi but for my flat , the bill , the rent . and in a few year i would like to have a child . eventhough thi pitti situat i would realli like to have a littl of time help my cummun but sinc the rythm of life goe so fast i think that it is imposs at least at the moment . as life goe so fast in my opinion i understand that young peopl nowaday have so mani problem to spend help their commun . mayb if the rythm chang thing will go better and
