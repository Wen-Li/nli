when face to the question that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well , differ peopl had disapar view for that . in my poit of view , i agre the view that success peopl should tri variou and new thing and take mani risk . here i will explor some signific and conspici reason as follow : the first reason to support my opnion is that in oder to make big contribut to the societi where we live and as the pregress of the societi , more and more thing need peopl who have higher skill and excel abil to do the tought staff . therefor , peopl should face thi situtu and tri their best to do the thi as good as he/sh can , especi , for those success peopl . they shoud adapt the new environ and at the same time , the success peopl should tri thier best to concentr on some new tecnolog , such as know the skill of how to do well about comput . what is worth notic that tri new and creativ thing can help peopl to improv their characterist , especi it is good for peopl to becom brave . for exampl , masier is one of the famou artist in the art fie , and he is veri famou for the harmoni art . at the begin , he can not find the key element of art , but he did not give up it . after take risk about art and hard work again and agian , final , he becom a veri excel artist in the art field . anoth reason is that tri new thing can make peopl more hard work on the thig what you concentr on . the process will let peopl not easili to say give up and tri their best to do well for thier thing and thi will provid a big chace for them to find aa good job and becom succ in the end . in conclus , i agre that the success peopl should tri nem thing and take risk rather onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
