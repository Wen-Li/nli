i strongli agre with the statement that the success peopl like to do new thing and tri to take risk . i think they have to tri new thing if they do not do thi they will lose thier success some day . they have to do it in order to mintain thier success and to develop thier self . if you are a success person that 's mean you have achiev mani hare thing that other peopl can not do it . but the question here how to be success for ever ? if you stay in you posion the peopl below you will reach you and some day they will be better that you . so the best way to mentain you success you have to tri new thing . to illustrat thi let me tell you about my friend . she wa a success maneg of acompani . but she did not do pay ani effort and did not tri to ani new thing to keep her postion . after two year of be a maneg , here director chose her partnar who wa work after noon and studi in the morn to be the new manger of the compani becus the director saw how much her partnar wa a hard woker and how much he is an ambic person . clearli , if you want to be a success forev , you have to keep tri new thing forev too . the success person also have to develop him / her self . for exampl let me tell you about my self . in my countri i wa a success medic technican , i wa a super vaisor of the lab . but i chose to come to the usa to develop my self . that when i come back i will a univers profess rather that a medic technican . so , the success person doe not agre with hi posion and he like to be the best . in conclus , the success peopl have to tri new thing and take risk becaus if they do not do that they will lose thier success .
