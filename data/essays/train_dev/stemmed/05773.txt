i am agre with the statement say , `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than it is today . '' the use of car is in the increas stage dure these day . howev , i believ that thi condit will complet chang dure next twenti year . first reason of reduc in use of car will be pollut of the environ . car is the main caus of pollut of the earth everi year . thi fact wa most like ignor by the peopl dure past few year . howev , peopl start to recogn the import of maintain good environ condit and tri to do their best for it . other reason that car will be less use in the futur is the global . global mean that the world is not separ as an individu but conform as one big commun . therefor , other transport , which is airplan or ship , to travel oversea will be more use than the car . car will be just use for the travel within the land or contin . in fact , peopl even start to use transportaion such as subway or airplan more than the car . the final reason that effect the use of the car is the develop of the technolog . i person believ that the develop of the technolog will soon invent or creat new way of transportaion . thi new way of transportaion will be much faster than the car and have less harm on the environ . thi will make the car to be not welcom by the human societi anymor . the chang in the world occur much faster than the past . in other word , there can be big chang in a veri short period of time . therefor , twenti year are definit not a short time for car to be in a less use .
