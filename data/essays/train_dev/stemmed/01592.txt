peopl alway discuss that which one is more imporatnt betwe understand idea or concept and learn fact . in my opinion , make student learn fact is more use and help than just make them understand the concept and idea . first of all , if student just underst the idea and the concept then when they face the problem in the real world they will not know how to solv it . the propus of peopl learn knowledg is they want to studt how to use these inform to solv the probl in the societi , so master the skill to face and deal with the problem that they have is the most import rask . secondli , let the student learn fact throuhg the practic can make them more clever and give them much import inform . throuhg their experi they can learn mani thing that they can not studi in the classroom . these use inform and experi can teach them ue thier own way to solv the difficult problem and make them becom more wise . thirdli , if peopl can underst how to face the fact then they will have a better relationship with other peopl and the whole societi . they will use a suitabl way to consid their life , and do a better choic . the connect between singl person and the whole societi also will becom bettter . peopl live in a complex real world all the time , we will meet mani differ peolpl and mani difficult problem , but if we can understand the fact complet and know how to use the right way to solv them , then we can get a bettter life . becaus of these rason , learn how to face the fact becom a so imporatnt thing in peopl 's live , if we can learn and understand fact but not just know the concept and idea .
