my opinion about the topic that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun is ambuoul . on the one hand i think mani of young peopl are egoist today , on the other i know that it is not easi to manag social ambit today , espaci for the youth . i can imagin the young pepol becaus iam one of them . i do not help in my commun or neither i work in a social programm . the reason for that are my few time between the duti 's wich fill my whole day . i think the possibilti to help without ani pay in commun is better at a younger age of children , from eleven till fifteen . mani older young peopl are busi with their educ and own futur and too young children mayb are not in the confid or have the respons to work for the commun . mani of the work wich is to do in a german commun is made by so call young peopl who finish school . if thez do n't want to go to the armi , they can choos a social work in commun , hospit , etc . . the truth is that young peopl do n't help for free . they are alway look for a payment and do n't do anz help benfitli . iam sure that there are mani thing wich young peopl could do in a commun
