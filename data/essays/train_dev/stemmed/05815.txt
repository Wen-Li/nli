`` life is just one , and we have to substract from it all as we can '' , i mention and use that phrase all my life . sinc i wa a kid , i understood that i have goal , the one that made me work and continu through school and colleg . i experienc a lot of thing , which made me the man i am today . i took risk dure that time , like move from my town to get a better educ , but at the same time i continu with the same goal and do what i did best , math and scienc . i understand that peopl do both , they take risk , while they do what they know how to do well . for exampl , a stori about a guy that know how to sell tv 's to peopl . after do that for a long-tim period for a `` x '' compani , he realiz that he could do that kind of job with hi own compani , and he quit the job . then he start hi own compani name with hi son 's name . that wa the huge risk he took but he understood that peopl like him had choic , and that he will be success becaus he know how to do the job . with that stori , an integrationg of risk and experi can be observ . he do know where he is good at , and he use that to tri new thing . my experi tell me , that i should integr both , while they are accept . my life is made about experi , and each day i take risk to keep live . overal , i do not agre with the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . peopl are the owner of your action , and the success will depend on it . a person can be success by just do what they know how to do , or by tri new thing , which will take them again to the point of do what they know how to do . i know that my futur is around sciec , but i do know that i have to take risk to achiev my proffesion goal , be a meteorologist . i have to move from my home-countri , know that is for my own good . that the bigest risk i will experi next year , while at the same time i know how to talk to peopl , make new friend , and take the best from everi opportun i encount . success is around the courner and should experi it with new thing or by just do what they do best .
