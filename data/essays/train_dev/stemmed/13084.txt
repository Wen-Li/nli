the entir educ system is so plan that an individu first gain knowledg about mani academ subject and then , after decid hi field of interest , he move toward special in a specif subject of hi interest . my opinion is that it is better to special in one subject . therefor , i disagre with the staement that it is better to have a braod knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i would defin specil as becom an expert in whatev field we choos . the main reason to hold thi opinion is that ordinari peopl reli more on specialist for inform about a subject . when peopl are more comfort in one or two subject , then they can continu with that subject and becom specialist . also , specialist from differ field can come togeth and solv a problem better rather than peopl who lack in-depth knowledg about differ field . it is better to studi the subject in which we are interest rather that tri to get knowledg of mani subject which donot interest us . a jack of all trade will becom good for noth . a person will be comfort to studi the field in which he is interest . in thi way special will make everi one do their best and contribut to the societi in a better way . there are variou field of special in medicin . peopl do go to a gener physician when they have small and gener problem like fever , head ach and bodi pain . the physician doe an overal check-up and if he find some seriou problem then he recommend a patient to a specialist who deal with that problem . if specialist were not there , then it would becom difficult for a gener physician to deal with the numer problem that human bodi can face . thi appli to all other field such as engin and research . there are some situat when a broad idea of differ subject are need . in such case , expert from differ field acn come togeth and solv the problem . thi appli mainli to research where mani factor are to be consid for one specif task .
