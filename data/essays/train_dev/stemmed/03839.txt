i disagre with the statement for mani reason but i must agre with the fact that a tour guid can provid use inform about certain place that you can visit and that you may not know about . i , be a veri curiou person , prefer to be left on my own to explor a certain place and learn about it by myself or at least accompani by a friend or a famili member . by explor a tourist atract by yourself such as an ancient palac or castl , for exampl , you could wind up discov sever curiou nook or room not offer in a normal tour schedul . if i 'm explor a castl without the guidanc of a tour guid , i might want to carri some sort of map or written inform about the place so i can not onli satiat my curios but also learn interest fact in the process . a teacher of mine onc told me an experi she had when she visit some turkish palac some time ago . she did not enjoy follow the crowd of tourist around so she lag behind of the tour group . as they found themselv in some room , she struck up a convers with one of the gaurd . the gaurd like her and told her that he could show her one of the room the `` regular '' did n't have ani access to . the gaurd took my teacher through a door into one of the most gorgeou gold-lamin , ruby-stud room she had ever seen . tour guid can often be bore an monoton and herd peopl along through differ place as if they were a flock of sheep . they will give the usual tour to the usual type tourist , one after anoth , after anoth , after anoth . there is no dynam involv in a guid tour , no interact between the peopl , the guid and the locat . it 's the same routin for the tour guid : look here , take a pictur there , here x person die , room after room . by explor a place on your own with a propper , written , guid you can learn a lot more and also enjoy some degre of independ . if i ever visit the chateau of franc or the pagoda in japan , i would larg prefer to be left on my own to inspect and explor everi hidden room , corner and passageway .
