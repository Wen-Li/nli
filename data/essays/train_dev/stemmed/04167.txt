ye i complet agre with thi fact that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the world is progress toward the scientif world in which there might be a possilbl that there will be invent of some other altern which will replac the present day car to some extent . as we all know that in big citi there is big problem of space . now whi space is a requir ? the answer is in big citi due to larg popul one requir space in which he can have hi live and other thing safe place ; what we call it a hous , also if one is own a hous he will own a car and due to limit of space one ha to accomd both hi hous as well as car . also big citi have big shop mall where lot of peopl come to shop and to have some kind of entertain . and there come the problem of park of the car . at present everi big citi is face the problem of park , so twenti year from now the problem will get worsen . so the solut to thi problem will be person will limit the use of car . also the problem of traffic is there in big citi , car requir a larg space to move on the road as compar to two-wheel vehicl . one of the problem that today big citiy is face is of traffic due to larg number of car in the citi . also petrol will go to get exhaust after 30 year from now and the major requir for a car is fuel . also some research is go on about the altern of the fuel but it is still in the develop stage no one ha assur uptil today that the solut to the fuel problem is overcom . the technolog is improv day by day and there is a possibl that veri soon our scientist will devis such a equip which will requir less space and will have some altern option for it function and will not requir a fuel which is like to extinguish . so i conclud that by take in to consider the abov state problem , in my view there is a possibl that peopl will use fewer car in futur .
