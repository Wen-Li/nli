thi question is a realli compliqu question . i am a student i agre that for me is most import to understand the subject that about just know the fact . in histori if you understand the idea you have the fact but if you know the fact you mayb not understand the idea . for the student is most interest to discas with the teacher that just read a book . the import in a class is make the student happi . if the student ha good mark in the class he probabl like the class . but if the student ha bad mark he mayb like the class too . i mean that the student can like a classroom if he ha good mark but can like a class where he ha ad mark . the teacher can help in thi way . if the teacher just take the book and say `` read page 234 in ten minut a quiz. '' the student probabl do n't like the class . if the teacher say `` ok who want discass the subject with me today after i make a quiz about we discas '' the student listen ehat teacher say and understand the subject faster that if he just read the book and do n't say anyth and actual sleep on is book . i remeb a student who ha so much troubl in histori in my grad ten year histori . in grad eleven class histori we chang teacher and the teacher decid to use discas and tri to explain the subject with exampl . thi student ha is mark improv so much . an today long time after thi histori class i rememb pretti well my histori class . and my opinion chang so much about histori . for the student lern we need interest the student and make feel happi in all of is class . if thi system is wrking whi we are not tri in everi class .
