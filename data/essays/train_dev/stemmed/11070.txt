person speak , i total disagre with thi statement . first of all , i think young peopl do n't have the enough time to enjoy their live . for exampl , young peopl , no mater where they are , will have to spend major of their time and energi `` start '' their live instead of enjoy their live . they have to spend 8 or more hour work everyday and even work overtim on weekend . and i am not surpris to see young peopl work like dog . as a result , they are short of time to enjoy their live . while on the contrari , old peopl , on a larg part , have retir from their work . so understand , with all the time avail , they can set out to enjoy their live either by stay at home and watch tv all day without worri about the work load or travel around the world to differ place . second , young peopl do n't have the necessari amount of money to enjoy life . becaus the major of young peopl 's incom is spent to support the whole famili and to maintain their competit advantag in their own field by often take up some train program , they bare have ani extra money to enabl them to enjoy life . howev , with all the save the old peopl have made dure all those year and no further need for them to get promot , they can safe begin to enjoy their live in whatev way they want to enjoy . final , with the demand of their work and their famili , young peopl never get around to think about how they can enjoy their live and the fact that they do n't exactli know what life is , due to their limit life experi , ha enorm deter young peopl to enjoy their live to the greatest extent . but on the other hand , old peopl have experienc a lot in their own life cours , they well know what life is and how they can enjoy it and consequ , old peopl enjoy life more than young peopl do .
