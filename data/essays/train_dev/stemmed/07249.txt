whether have broad knowledg of mani topic is better than special in an specif one is not an easi question , and often , not even our choic , sinc it 's determin by our educ . even though it 's an issu applic to all field in life , i 'll narrow it down to a profession point of view , and how be a veri special person can be veri posit at work , but can also significantli damag your career path . the best way to start the discuss is by illustr the issu with an exampl which i 'm rel familiar with . there are mani compani current develop new mobil phone network , which result in an enorm invest in highli qualifi telecom engin . the market valu of an experienc engin in `` 3g '' network deploy can be measur in term of hundr of thousand of dollar . the learn and develop opportun , as well as the earn potenti , are veri attract . on the other hand , there are other telecom profession who rather have a slower progress by broaden their knowledg . `` in order to be prepar for the futur chang , it 's better to know a bit of everyth '' , would be their mileston . they may not be so success in 3 year time , but when the develop of the new technolog start to die off , the knowledg and expertis they 've acquir in other field will open them door that wo n't be avail for those who specialis in that one specif subject , which is no longer `` fashion '' . these advantag and drawback can be extend to all aspect of life . a case that will sound familiar to everyon is that smart member of our famili who can talk about everyth , but when you ask him for deeper detail on certain topic , can onli give vagu respons . thi is one of mani exampl that can be found in real life . as i said at the begin , have a veri broad rang of knowledg is often dictat by our educ to a certain extent ; but we 'll alway have the option to special in a more specif topic , or guid our knowledg to a more open and gener approach , by spend as long as we possibl can studi about it .
