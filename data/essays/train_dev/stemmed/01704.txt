i agre with the statement but in my opinion it also depend on your studi and your individu way of learn . for an exampl if you are studi histori it is veri import to learn the fact , too . even if you can explain how e.g. kennedi becam presid of the unit state , you should be abl to present fact to thi topic , too . if you are a math student you would have to learn veri hard to pass through exam just by learn fact . you would have to proov theorem in test and learn all of the proov would take a long time . if you are abl to understand a proov 's context it is easi to complet the full proov correctli . but in math you have to learn the definit and theorem , too . in a test there is not enough time to reproduc everi littl `` fact '' fastli . it is indivdu if you like more learn fact or the main concept and idea . there are student which are abl to learn fact and rememb them veri fast and other would have problem and must repeat them again and again . when you just concentr on the learn fact it will often be hard to get the main concept . a student should learn the fact and think about how the connect are between them . if he understand whi he is learn all of them he will be abl to rememb the fact better . a student will improv more and in hi class if he repeat everyth he ha learn . to summar all the ponit , i think that it depent on everi student to find the right method to learn . to be good you have to understand the concept and idea but without recal ani fact that is not enough .
