is not easi in thi case to complet agre or disagre with thi statement . reason be that idea and concept can not prescind from understand of fact . a fact is someth that is happen , while a concept is the reason whi it happen . these two thing have to go togeth for an individu to be abl to catch the complet essenc of thing . for me , what thi statement say , is that what happen in the past can easili be ignor , that fact , what truli happen befor , play littl or no import in a student 's learn experi . everi histori teacher will scream when hear such an opinion . in mani case , fact can teach a lot more than concept . just think about our whole stori , the stori of mankind , and the big crime we would commit when ignor what man did befor us . you can studi about cultur and philosophi , about religion and mathemat , but you will never complet understand about yourself and the other until you 've learn about what ha alreadi happen and what ha alreadi been done . the concept of genocyd can be explain with hundr of word , but will never be fulli understood until what happen ha been studi and observ through document and video . so the concept of , to give a contrast exampl , drive a car can be explain with load of word and idea . but onli when it come to actual show what happen if you take a certain action you can fulli understand about drive . at the other side , i must say that without a complet understand of basic concept , it is imposs to studi profici ani subject . whatew will be shown to you , alway need will be a clear concept that explain the mean of what you see . a major differ between an italian univers and an american one is in the differ learn method : while in the italian institut fundament is the necess of rememb word by word what is explain in the book , without ani practic applic , in the american method thi studi is accompani by an activ class discuss and group particip . the first method will obvious bring everi student to memor the concept studi , but sometim without even understand them , while with applic and confront in the class , basic understand of the concept is need to construct particip and learn . without concept , there is no understand of fact ; without fact there is no `` real '' understand of concept . the two thing must go togeth .
