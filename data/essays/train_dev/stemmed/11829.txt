in my opinion there are two opposit point of view from which one could see the situat . first you could agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing rather than onli do well known thingh becaus they can allow themselv to be experiment for there is no financi pressur . they are , due to their success , abl to come up with neg effect of their behaviour and they also have the capit to invest in new innov for exampl . wherea poorer peopl or just peopl without overwealm success might have great financi pressur and have also the fear to lose what they have alreadi reach . so they are more like to play on the safe side . a poor compani might use it old computersystem for a longer time than a rich one for firstli the poorer one doe n't have the need money and secondli becaus newer system might not work that depend . second , one could also tell the stori the other way round : success peopl might becom more care becaus of they 're afraid of loos their wellb life and their posit in societi which impli that they take not the unknown road . for exampl a famou food chain would never chang the slogain or the kind of market strategi as long as the food sell well . in comparison with that , unsuccess peopl have noth to lose so they might tend to tri out new thing for it ca n't get wors . a small unknown compani may tri out a varieti of market strategi to find out which one caus the highest sell . there are alway these two option . which way is meant tyo be taken depend on everi individu charact which is challeng by a decis like describ abov . so i ca n't agre the statement that success peopl are more will to take risk in gerner for there are as mani reason speak against thi thesi .
