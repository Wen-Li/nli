have broad knowledg of mani subject doe not lead to a good futur . wherea special in a particular subject in more benefici nowaday . i complet disagre to the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani acedem subjet than to specialis in one specif subject . '' nowaday there is demand for professin , who know their job veri well and can handl ani task in a particular field . peopl who have broad knowledg about mani academ subject , do not actual know what field they realli want to master in and so they have knowledg about mani subject . it is veri well said `` a jack of all trade is a master of none . '' so thi impli that to be a master or to actual achiev what you desir you need to be pragmat and should know what is neccesari for you to achiev what you desier for yourself . i have even seen mani peopl who have degre in mani field but still do not have what they want for themselv . for exampl , one of my friend 's elder brother ha mani degre in differ field and ha alot of knowedg about mani differ academ subject , but he still doe not have an aim or a particular direct to move in . wherea one of my cousin had a master degre in comput , which wa hi favorit subject from hi school day and then got a proper job with proper statu and a respect social life . it is not bad to have vast knowledg , but have vast vast knowledg in mani differ field , stop you from be interest in a particular field . it is not onli that have vast knowledg is import what is more import is to be more smarter and choo a specif field to major in . thu i would say that specialis in a particular subject is more benefici than have fast knowledg of variou subject . as , now you are want to be more knowledg about your subject , then it doe not matter how much you know about other subject .
