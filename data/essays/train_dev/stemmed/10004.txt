advertis have been the mean of sell a product for a long time . advertis are not onli been use in the modern era it ha been exist even in the past world . in past , where the modern mean of advertis wa not there , there were place where the art work and thing that are to be sold were exhibit where the artist or the seller use to talk about hi work and sell the product . but in the modern world there are mani mean of sell a product through televison , internet , newpap advertis . i do agre that most advertis make their produt seem much better than they actual are . mani compani who sell their product though do give the detail about their product at the same time they give in the detail that may be fals or of a veri littl import , or may not be actual use to the consum . and most of the time they use celebr person to sell their product which itself is a mean of provid a fals inform . for exampl , a advertis in which a celebr is shown use a soap or a cosmet product . is that product realli use by that celebr ? advertis do not provid with complet inform of the product . for instanc , while sell some doll or toy for kid , they are advert in the televison as they move by themselv and show them in a huge size which is definit not the size the real toy might be , kid get facin with such advertis and kid get disappoint when they get to see them or play with them . a simlar exampl can be present with advertis show for the variou food place , where they show a enlarg vision of a food item make it more appeal and colour , though they do put in miniscul unseen asterix mark and inform at bottom as it be an enlarg vision which is miss out by most of use . but ia also agre with the fact that unless such a kind of advertis is not done the consum can not be attract easili . though there is so much of advertis done if the qualiti is not god the consum can never be convinc . so i agre with the fact that advertis make product seem far more better than they realli are .
