ye i do agre with thi statement . in my point of view when a person invent someth new which is not avail in the market . he tri to includ everyth that he could do . thi is a good thing . but when the time come for advertis thi product . the person tri to advertis it in such a way that he could get profit as fast as he can . let talk about a shop who deal in mobil phone . when a person open a new mobil phone shop he tri to give the custom promot that the other shop do not give . like to give a mobil phone headset , a car charger , a mobil phone carri case , some applic , game that he can be download from the comput into the mobil phone . when a custom look at thi kind of an advertis he get realli excit . he goe to that shop and ask for that item that he saw it in the advertis . then the shop keeper show him , he doe not like the item . whi ? becaus most of the shop advertis the promot item as origin one . but they find them that they are not origin . thi make a lot of problem when a shop keeper is sell a product of someon els . i would like to share an exampl that i experienc befor a year or two . there is a trademark who is realli popular among the ladi . it sell readymad cloth for women . and hi logo is also veri popular . a shop owner copi thi logo on a materi that doe not cost the half price of the materi the orign shop is sell and he advertis it in variuo magizen and newspap . peopl start buy from him not also keep in mind that it 's the same kind of materi . so thi kind of advertis can loos alot of money on just silli thing . in my opinion peopl should not do these kind of thing at all .
