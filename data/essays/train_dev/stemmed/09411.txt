to say that `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' is a lot like say that someon should be good in everyth but be perfect in noth . doe that make ani sen ? everyon should have someth they wish to know better . .. that 's whi we all have differ job . i think we can find a perfect exampl of have to realli know someth in particular , in nippon societi . japan is famou for their expert and we have been tri to copi their way of studi for decad . doe the fact that they know more about one subject in particular , make them less smarter than peopl who know someth about everyth ? i think not . of cours , have a good cultur background is import , but as long as we follow our desir and believ in the thing we do , than there 's noth wrong about neglect other subject . obvious , thi doe not appli in an academ envior . as long as we are in school , we must studi everi requir subject , but onc that 's over , we should be free to expand our own knoledg in the field we prefer . if we all knew the same thing , we could never teach each other anyth !
