there are mani impress advertis in everi countri to make their product look nice . howev , i sometim dissapoint it valu when i buy , becaus it is realli differ from they are . that 's the method of atract peopl to buy their good and that 's the onli way that peopl know about the product . in my oppinion , it is import to make good look nice for seller becaus they have to sell product as much as possibl becaus they spend a lot of money for the advertis . for exampl , one compani which sell good cheaper than other compani in japan . they do n't use big advertis . their good are worth of the price but it 's not atract at all . for get custom and improv their qualiti , it is import to have a advertis . competit is good for custom , too . it is difficult to know about product without ani advertis becaus that 's the onli way to let peopl get across . it ha to be catchi and impress . if there are same kind of product at the same time , it 's difficult to decid which one to buy . i think it is also an import abil to show the product nice for the compani . in conclus , for these reason that i mention , i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . it 's neccesari for the modern societi 's competit .
