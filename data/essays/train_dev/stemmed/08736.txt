i believ it is better to to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . if you special in onli one subject your knowledg would be veri confin and henc when you face the world out of the academ set up it would be difficult to adjust . a specif exampl can be when you studi manag . if in a manag program you onli expertis in oper and have no knowledg of financ you would have tough time when you have to work in oper as it would involv part of financ . anoth exampl can be if you are stude histori and do n't have ani knowlegd about scienc you would face difficulti when you need to use scienc in histori , for exampl , in radio carbon date of fossil , and henc a knowlegd of scienc would be use in such situat . if you have broad knowledg of variou subject you becom more flexibl and can diversifi in variou differ area , while you choic becom restrict if you are special in one particular subject . anoth aspect would be when you move into a busi environ you would be consid a more fungilb resourc and henc you can fit in varou kind of role . broader knowledg about variou subject also broaden your horizon and help develop integr think in you . in gener the depth to which a subject is taught in academ institut dure specialis may not be what you would requir in normal busi set and henc thi special would gener be not of much use in futur unless you get into research etc . henc , i believ that though special may help in specif circumst broader knowledg of mani subject is more use in gener .
