to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is to learn mani thing in differ field of studi . to special in one specif subject is to look at one thing from one point of view . in my opinion , it is better to have both of them as a part of your academ develop , and they are both equal import . what truli happen in everi person 's academ develop is that thi person goe through differ equal import stage . in the first stage of a child life , thi child learn how to speak , and then he or she learn how to write . thi is gener inform that everyon should start with in the begin of their academ life . then come school , whatev , or wherev thi person get their educ is all call school ; although , there are some differ that occur on the level of that educ . in school , peopl are taught all the essenti of life , and a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , includ differ scienc , mathemat , art , music , and languag . these are the foundat each and everi one of us need in our life . as the school educ come to an end , differ peopl start to special in differ subject of their interest . later on in life , we are approach by univers ; by we , i am reffer to the peopl who are look at pursu further educ . univers is where we are suppos to narrow our choic down , and choos specif field of studi . that is when it is proper for a person to special in one specif subject ; in other word , major in someth they are attract to . in the end they are go to have to live with what they choos for the rest of their live , and that is whi they have to choos someth they truli love . in conclus , to have a broad knowledg on an academ subject , or to special in anoth are all equal import . you have to get a broad educ first , and then narrow it down to what comfort you most . it is like , watch the rain fall , and then wait for the rainbow to appear . from the first word a child learn at home to the last book thi person read , each and everi stage in that person life is import .
