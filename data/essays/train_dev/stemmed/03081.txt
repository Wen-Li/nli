i agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well becaus success peopl are full of confid that what ever field or work thier choos in that they can do well . what i beliv is the confid of be succes is the half success and after that half path is left to success . for exampl my father is a succes busineesman and for increas hi busine he tri out new thing and he did well becaus he know how to do well in new busi . for be successful a person should hardwork and he must be devot and obidi to hi work . i thing if a person is hard work a succ is not far away from him . but sometim a some success person afraid of do new thing becaus of be unsuccess . the most success full person for exampl a famou industrialist of my countri `` ambani '' he is the sucessful industrialist of hi time everi one know him becaus he tri to do new thing and he know tri new thing is not so easi a factar of risk is alway exist . as a success person he pleas in do new thing , that make him more poplar . sucess person alreadi know the key of success is hard work and their are mental prepair what can happen to them if their are not sucessful but still their never afraid in do new thing . ambani is actual a gold merchant after hi success in thi field he tri out new thing put a oil refinari industri by sell all hi gold busi shop and final he becam sucess and he did not stop here he is still tri new thi , so in my veiw a succes person tri new thing rather than onli do what they alreadi did .
