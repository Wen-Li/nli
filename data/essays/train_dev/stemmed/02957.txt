i agre with the notion that there will be fewer car in use twenti year from now , then there are current base on certain fact and project . firstli , we all know how the gasolin price are rise everywher . although part of the reason is polit , there is no doubt that the amount fuel in reserv ha dwindl rapidli . for a common commut that mean an addit cost , a cost which is not increas with his/her incom . slowli thi would lead to peopl shift to public transport . the gover are also work in variou countri to improv there public transport system especi in the big citi . sooner or later most peopl would have access to good and effici public transport . secondli , as the popul in citi is rise there is lesser space for hous consequ either the citi would get bigger or more hous would be built in the space which is avail as of now . if the citi get bigger , the distanc might becom to larg for peopl to drive on their own . most peopl would , i feel , prefer get on to a train and bu . not have the discomfort of drive these long distanc and mayb get some work done on the way . if more hous ha to be built in the citi , then the park space and wide road will have to go . in thi case most definit peopl would have no option but to leav their car and reli on public transport . final , with the rise in global temperatur be link to green hous emisson , the time is not far when govern would start charg except high tax from peopl who are produc these gase to compens for the nvironment damag . the car owner , i think , would be one of the first to get hit with these tax . so unless some radic new fuel which is both cheap and clean come up in the next five to ten year , i think we are look at much fewer car twenti year from now in our urban environ .
