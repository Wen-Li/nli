most of the time , youth is rememb as day of happi and good memori . on the contrari , and especi in our time , becom old is often seen as horribl and everybodi tri to stay young with cream and other chemic product . but do young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ? i think they do , becaus onli a few peopl make the right choic when they are young and becaus we have an illusori vision of youth . first and foremost , young peopl have a lot of free time , they are have no repons . they are total free to do what they want , or that what is wide believ . in fact the larg major of young peopl is to attend school , obey to their parent and deal with the problem of find their place in thi world . the differ with older peopl lie in the fact that they are ask to do almost everyth they do as older peopl choos a job , a wife , a place to live and all the other thing . the time that is still left , onc what is demamd is done , is realli free : thi time is given gener to young peopl and is preciou to older peopl . thi is when they live like they want , and often so as to be the contrari their parent want them to be . onc peopl get a job , a wife , an husband , a situat , they forget that they are free , that they can live like they want even if it is not easi . actual , freedom is much more danger for grown-up than for teenag : parent are there to help and to rescu in case of emerg and there is littl time when the danger of freedom can be experienc . the experi of freedom dure the youth is fake becaus the inner feel of freedom is not balanc by a great danger . on the other hand , older peopl see much more risk in freedom . peopl do not learn fro their youth .
