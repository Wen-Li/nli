in franc the educ system seach to bring the most of knowledg possibl . there is no specialis until the higth school and even there the specialis is not realli clear . as a result french student have got plenti of knowledg on serval subject but they have to do long studi to have un precis knowledg of some thing . i do not think that thi way is the best way in the world in which we live , in fact , in our world we ask peopl to be readi to work veri soon . and the fact is that you can not work with a broard knowledg . the onli thing you can do is speak whith peopl at restaur and amaz them thank to your gener cultur . now to have a job you have to be specialis becaus the technolog of our day is veri specif and precis , you can work if you do not know precisli your job . for instanc , what do we think of a doctor who know a littl about economi , a littl about astronomi and a littl about the way the bodi of a man work . to my self , i would not want to see him when ever i ill . but i have to say that thing are differ when you alreadi have a precis knowledg of some thing . when you have a job and when you areabl to do it well , have a spread knowledg of academ subject is a intrest thing . first , it will help you to understand th e world you live in . if a good doctor know same base of economi he will be abl to understand whi the price a some product or drog rise . and then , have gener knowledg is the mark of open mind peopl . those peopl alway tri to understand so they learn . thi could give a good imag of you to the societi . to conclud , have a broard knowledg is good onli if you are abl to be precis on at least one subjet .
