i agre with the statement but i have to point out sever issu . i believ time have chang therefor we can not expect young peopl to behav in the same way as young peopl from the past did . they might not give enough time to help their commun but thi could be due to a lack of time and differ target . nowaday young peopl are individualist becaus we live in a societi that focu on individu rather than on commun . by the same token , young peopl focu on themselv and they prefer to invest their time in selfish activ instead of commun servic . i consid myself a young person and out of my experi i can say that i am not interest in commun at all . furthermor , i have live in sever countri and what realli strike me is the fact that young peopl behav complet differ depend on the countri that they live in . for instanc , in sweden guy are extrem independ wherea in spain are much less independ likewis spanish guy might care more about commun than swedish guy do . so in order to understand the question it is need to place it in a specif context . the respons of such situat is the societi becaus societi is construct around individu , rule are made accord to what is the best for individu thu they becam the most import thing . nonetheless , it is possibl to notic strong nationalist movement in europ that emphazis on commun . if european commun becom strong , it would be a chang regard young peopl 's attitud henc they would give enough time to help their commun . to conclud , i agre with the statement but some aspect need to be consid befor talk about young peopl and their attitud . young peopl behav complet differ depend on the countri that they live in and their cultur , howev , all in all it can be said that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun .
