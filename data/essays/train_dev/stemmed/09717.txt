i agre with have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than specialinz in one specif subject . there are some reason whi i think that way . first of all , it is crucial to choos someon 's futur onc . becaus it is too earli to decid what to studi . the more we experi , the more we can choos . we do n't know what we realli want to do yet . becaus , we could n't have such a enough time to think . most univers student are not sure about their futur . in my case , i choos french as my major . and i have work with french . after 2 year , i wa confus if my choic wa right or not . i decid to take some english class and talk to professor about my situat . i could think of my problem enoughli after it . lastli , i decid to dounbl major english and french . if i did n't take english class , i would n't know what i exactli want to studi in the univers becaus i would n't even know i like to studi english . secondli , sometim peopl do n't have mani knowledg out of their major . and thi can make bore person . now day , societi want peopl who have mani interest and talent . and we can learn those inform from other activ such as other academ subject . from those studi , we can explor other major . for instanc , there are leisur sport depar in my univers . mani of my friend were interest in jazz dans and physic exercis like bodi build . even though their major wa not leisur sport , they took those class and had a lot of fun . from those subject , not onli could they enjoy their campu live but also could make great memori and experi . until graduat from highschool , we could n't choos what i want to studi , and we have right to choos mani subject and to get interest inform from outsid of our major . thi can be veri help in our campu live .
