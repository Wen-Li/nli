i agre with the statement that in twenti year car will be fewer in use than today . i agre , becaus i know that the fossil like oil will be quit rare in the futur on earth . becaus of that , the oilpric will rais up , so that not everybodi is rich enough to buy the expenc oil for their car . also , i have the opinion that in the next few year lot of law will found to save the natur and i hope that the peopl notic that they have to chang anyth , if they want to live on earth more than twenti year . i guess that more peopl will use the train or the plain to get to a foreign countri for their vacat . becaus they it will be cheaper than go by car and they are more comfort . also , i think , that the export from food , cloth and other import thing will be not do by truck . i think that the thing will export by train , ship and plane . my last reason is , that i guess , that peopl don not need their car anymor becaus most of the peopl live in big citi or town . in citi everyth ist close to you , like supermarket , job , school and cinema . so you can do your way by foot and do n't have to use your car .
