i dissagre with the statement that say `` it is more imprtant for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' becasu of mani reason . first of all , they will learn more about the fact becas it is real and they will believ it so it would help them more and more . in additt the idea will not help them becasu they can forget them quickli and it could be wrong . second , it would help them it their life and give them more experins and leson . such as if anyon of the student had strang question mayb he had learn from that fact alot of inform that would help him to solvi it . third , they will learn about new thing that they have not know about it . moreov it would get to the other gener . so that fact would be inhert for all genet and all of them can get what they want to know about . also that inform that they get from the fact would make them more seriou with thi life . in addit it would make peopl who were sleep to wake up and go to work becaus fact have mani ture and strang inform . in the end i see that the fact much better that the idea becaus the idea might be wrong and it will efect our societi . so , learn fact is much better becas all the peopl and sientis kwon about it .
