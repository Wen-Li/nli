i do n't agre with thi statement . i think peopl can enjoy life no matter how old they are . i also think a person can feel miser no matter they were young or old . the reason peopl enjoy life ha noth to do with there age but is caus by other extern factor and circumst . one factor that help most peopl to enjoy life is be around the peopl they love . thi mean that an old ladi could enjoy life by be around her grandchildren . it also mean , that a young boy can feel miser and unhappi when he is live away from hi parent and friend . anoth factor which caus peopl to enjoy life is health . peopl in good health usual enjoy life more than other sick peopl . thi mean , that an eighti year old man who is in an excel health condit is most probabl enjoy life more than a sick eight year old boy . never the less , i believ that financi secur help peopl to enjoy life . richer peopl usual ha more mean to enjoy life than poorer peopl . thi might sound shallow , but no one can deni that it is true . thi mean that a veri old billionair can enjoy hi life as he can use hi money to do fun activ like travel . at the same time , a young poor man may not be enjoy hi life as he does'nt have the mean to have ani luxuri . in the end , i would like to stress how i do n't think age affect how much peopl enjoy life . i think you can enjoy life wheather you were young or old ; howev i believ there are other thing which help some peopl enjoy life such as good health , money and be around the peopl you love .
