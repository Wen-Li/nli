car , which are consid as mean of necess now a day , were consid as luxuri in 1950 's and 1970 's . peopl sinc 1970 ha increas use car becaus they stand for prestig . the present topic is use of car in twenti year , whether there will be more or few car in use . there are both advantag as well as disadvantag of use car . advantag could be 1 ) econom , as the whole famili could travel at the same time and cost less when compar to the expens of travel by train or bu . 2 ) second advatnag could be halt or take rest when want . the disadvanatg could be 1 ) pollut , 2 ) increas traffic , 3 ) more accid . now-a-day , peopl in citi like london , tend to leav their car at home and prefer travel by train to their destin and thi probabl could be due to increas traffic , which delay peopl from commit . so i agre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use . the second point that inclin me to take the side of the statement is pollut . most of the peopl are suffer with respiratori diseas like asthma , chonic bronchiti and for thi pollut could be blame partli . peopl who live all their live work in bigger citi tend to retir in countri side to avoid air and sound pollut . so thi could be one of the reason that in futur use of car will be lower . the third point which support my decis regard fewer car in use in twenti year is obes and physic fit . peopl are more bother about their physic fit as they are busi with the work and ca n't exercis in leisur time . so as a matter of fact most peopl to improv and maintain physic fit ride bike to work than use car . so to conclud , with all the abov reason there will be fewer car in use in twenti year .
