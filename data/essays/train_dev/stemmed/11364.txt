most advertis make product seem much better than they reali are . i totali agre with thi statement , most of advertis give the consum the advantag that they can get by use the product , and they tri to avoid mention the disadvantag or the misus or side-effect . to give a life exampl of that statment , i will give an exampl from my person field which is pharmaci . patrient or consum in other word like most of medic compani prefer to address them , see the advertis on tv , or newspapp . and easili get convenc with the mediact becaus of the follow . first , they use easi langaug and someth most of us suffer from like pain , insomnia and syptom of allergi , second , they keep repeat the advertis over and over agian . even some peopl get convenc that they have problem in sleep although they do n't and how the medic is effect and safe . i know one of my patient , that she forc her physicain to call me at the pharmaci to give me a phone - prescript for sleep pill that she previous saw on tv . although , she wa not suffer from ani sleep problem just she like the advertis and the music on it and the colour of the sleep pill ( it wa nice shini pink colour by the way ) and i say forc him becuas some could say '' he ha the right to refus . he is a doctor '' . ye , that is correct . but she mention that she will go to everi singl doctor other than him to prescrip the medic for her in case he will refus to do so . and simpli he doe not want to lose bussi . third , the side-effect of the medic are wrtten in small letter in the end of the advertis or mention real fast that , the custom can not follow what wa exactli said and the most import thing as i mention earlier . it ha to be in the end of the advertis , so no one can pay attent . we can use the exampl that i just gave about the medic and the advertis and thier way on everi singl aspect and field on adveris bussi . to conclud and summar , i agre with the statement say that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . for the previous mention reason .
