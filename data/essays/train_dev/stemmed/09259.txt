peopl who have success in their life , veri often tri to push their limit to the test . have had the sweet feel of success , they tend to know that els is possibl . like so mani peopl in our materi societi , they first want to have success . so , success automat come along with money or respect . be an individu member of thi societi , but still seen as someon special becaus of hi achiv , the success man ( or woman ) tri to stay on top , prove to himself and the mass that he could achiev everyth , be someon special . so , the thing he use to do are n't so special anymor , what mean that there must be new , more excit challeng wait . so , know that he is a `` winner '' , the success man ha the power ( whereth it is money , influenc or popular ) and can do what he plan , which is give him the kick he need . i think you could compar success peopl with junki . not in a selfdestruct way , but in the way they alway need more and more to be satisfi , which is a phenomena that can be prove by look at the world ' top manag nowaday . earn more in one month than an averag worker would earn in one year , still not satisfi and greedi . i have the opinion that success peopl often do not specif realiz that it is greed , what is drive them to push their limit . they tend to ignor that fact and take risk more easili than a `` normal '' person would do . in the end , i do n't agre with the statement abov , for i think that tri new thing and take risk is just a need prove for these peopl , that no matter what they do , they will alway be someon special . these peopl are just bore by what they achiev so far and need to find someth more satisfi for theirselv . but everyon for himself is special , so there is no need for take the risk to prove it .
