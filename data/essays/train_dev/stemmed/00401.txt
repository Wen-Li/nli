i agre with thi statement . i think that the broad knowledg of mani academ subject is import for sever experi . also , it is use on the sever situat . first of all , i think that peopl who have the knowledg about anyth are respect by other peopl . if the teacher know about not onli english but also scientic , when he or she is ask by hi or her student , he or she can answer smoothli . and , they can solv their question . in my case , my english teacher ha knowledg anout anyth . for exampl , he know about the art , the histori of the live , and the life of the other countri ' tribe . when i talk with him about these subject , i wa surpris and thought that i could learn variou thing from him as my teacher . i can ask the question what i ca n't solv , and everytim , he respond my question . therefor , i respect of him becaus he is intellig . in addit , if peopl know that , they can use their knowledg anytim . for exampl , when they are forc to write the essay about the subject that i mention befor , they can write them without research . they do n't have to wast of time to investig or ask to the other . moreov , even if they research about them , they know the basic thing , so they can improv their knpwledg from other inform . in my experi , when i had to research to write the essay about the problem about yasukuni shrine becaus i had no idea about that . at that time , i regret that i did n't have the knowledg . if i knew about the problem , i could write the essay more deepli or effect . in summari , i think that it is good thing for them to have the knowledg about variou subject . one reason is they can be prais their intellig when theycan answer the question from other peopl . the other thing is that it is use on their live .
