i think that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . thi is so becaus of mani reason . to start with , i think that fact origen ( come origin ) from idea and concept . thi can be clearli shown in the physic field , for exampl . when a person want to prove someth for somebodi , through an expir , he ha to build hi whole expir on one or more idea or concept and then go on with the expir to prove a specif fact . from thi point we can understand that idea and concept are more import than fact . moreov , through focus on idea and concept the , student will develop a self think method base on reason . thi is basic done by school and univers . when these institut are focus on develop and improv the student 's abil to learn new fact and concept , it is grow and feed the student 's imagin to think in a differ angl of view and thu discov nem thing . but on the other hand , when school and univers are just ( spoon feed ) the student with readi made fact they are kill the imagin part of hi think . after that the student will grow up and continu in hi educ just depend on readi fact which are in hi text book .
