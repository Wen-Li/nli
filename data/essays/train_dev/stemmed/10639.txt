i agre with thi statement and i also believ that it 's an unavoid `` side effect '' of the advertis process . in principl the whole idea of advertis someth is not onli to convey inform but also , and mainli , to convinc an audienc that a product is good . an advertis is not a technic report , the main purpos of which is to state the thing as they actual are . .. in an advertis everi singl aspect is care and strateg plan to attract the attent of an audianc and to convinc it . it 's not a surpris then if in an advertis a product look so good and when we have it in our hand it doe n't meet our expect . i 'm not say that advertis and cheat are the same thing ! i believ in fact that most of the peopl are awar of thi fact , if not by intuit , by experi , so where is the cheat if the victim is awar ? and furthermor often we do n't find in an advertis plain lie , what we see is that the weak point are not expos in their full extent . if we watch for instanc the advertis of some phone compani we almolst believ the everyth come for free : well , to the best of my experinc the bill arriv . alway . sometim ago i had the opportun of design a flyier for an event , so in a sens i could see the advertis process also from a differ angl . make that event look veri good and attract wa my goal and i did my best . now i 'm ask myself whether or not i describ my `` product '' in such a way to make it look better than it actual wa . .. the answer is `` no , i 'm not a profession , but i wish i could . .. '' . i guess i 'm not in the right posit to complain !
