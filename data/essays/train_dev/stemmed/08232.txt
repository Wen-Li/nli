sinc i 've been student for a long time , i can say that at the age when we are young student ( for exampl high school age ) , we normal tend to care more to understand idea and concept than it is for us to learn fact . anyhow , i have to say that , at least as far as my experi is concern , along the student age we chang our lear process , pass from give more import on theori to link theori to fact . for exampl when we talk about student until high school , i believ that up to that age we alreadi had a lot of concept from school , famili and social enviro . at thi age we do n't care , for exampl , about polit event or intern affair . thi is due to the fact that certainli we are too young , we are more focus on other thing such as have fun , go out , do some sport . what is more , we 're complet unabl to link all the concept we receiv to real fact . on the other hand , when we go to the univers , and thi is anoth step of be student , i think the thing chang . it happen becaus we 're get in anoth enviro in which we weant to be well consid , we 're meet other peopl with who we 're go to share more adult experinc and last but not least we 're get more matur . as a result we can link in a more effici way what we studi ( aslo dure the high school ) to the real fact . for exampl it happen to me when i studi the concept of inflact . when i wa watch the tv news , i wa realli surpris to final understand what inflat is and what are it effect . and thi is not all . we 're also becom abl to link some concept that we 've learnt in the past to the real fact , and at that time you final realiz how wa useful to studi that concept ( that at the begin it ha been consid stupid ) . so , i agre partial that for student is more import to understand idea and concept that it is to learn fact , becaus it could depend if we 're consid high school student ( who are more focus in concept and idea ) and univers student ( who are begin to link the concept to fact ) .
