consid the statement `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' , i feel that the statement would be much better chang it to the past . the way we live now and the way we will be live in the futur may chang . we know that scienc ha develop a lot and everyon is awar of the recent develop . vehicl which are run on the fuel ( petrol ) now , may not work on the same grid . latest invent like electr , hydrogen car have come into exist . mani facil like charg point avail in the petrol bunk is done . thi rapid growth result in the much more invent and develop . peopl who go for the econom and best , will be sure of purchas these sort of car . sinc initi purchas amount will be quit low , where maintain cost is lower , with cheap recharg of the engin at near by locat . peopl gener have awar of the pollut in the futur and have concern toward it . so opt these car is favour and help . compar the past , present and futur , we know the olden day car were veri expens . but now mani peopl could buy them . sinc the car which run on electr charg were cheap , peopl will be buy them too . infact we may see the increas in car in the futur due to thi reason . henc , even though the number of car have increas , they are not creat the pollut problem . the statement mention will go well with the past circumst , not with the futur .
