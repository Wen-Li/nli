i would definit agre that the most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are some reason whi i believ so , and the exampl i can give for thi topic . one of the exampl is that the everi product at the supermarket , especi the food look veri good which make the custom want to buy them . some product are as good as how the advertis look when you open the product at home , but some are complet differ than how the advertis look . i am one of the custom that buy food . i look at the advertis first and then if i think the product seem good , i pay for them . i have been veri disappoint mani time by be treat by the advertis . i 've had mani food that tast complet differ than how the advertis look like . it happen alot in frozen food . even though you look in the box what the insid product look like , you ca n't tell how it tast like until you heat it . peopl alway look at the advertis first and then decid weather they want to buy it or not . it may look veri differ when the frozen product is heat than how it is suppos to look like which show on the advertis . even though the compani that make those product make the advertis look much better than they realli are which doe not realli make peopl happi , it is not their fault . i believ that the compani work hard on the advertis than they do on make product . the compani just want to sell product as more as possibl . they know that it is the most import thing to make the advertis neat which make the peopl want to buy them . i believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are in order to sell more and more becaus sell product and make money from it is their job .
