world resourc are end fast today . resourc like oil , natur ga which are major fuel to the modern car are limet sourc of energi . therefor i agre that in coupl of decad , there will be fewer car in use than they are today . with the effect of industrialis in past two centuri the cultur have markedli chang , more eas in life , more amen easi commun and travel . but all of these on the cost of fuel , which are rapidli eaten up as time progress . main fuel that are use in car are gasolin , deisel , natur ga etc . these fuel scarciti ha been now realiz . they are hint by the recent hike in oil price all over the world . major gulf countri , which are abund in oil field are now increas price becaus of it grow demand consid it avail . solar car are the good option to secur our futur . but these sourc of energi is veri ineffici and less product than exist oil and natur ga fuel . electr car may sound good which use batteri to run the car and is suppos to replac futur car . but these batteri are to recharg again and again by electr . now , from where the electr come . it is made by util coal in thermal powerpl , from hydal powerpl and nuclear power plant . but sinc most of the powerpl in the world are thermal powerpl , which depand on coal and also a limit resourc . it will probabl be over in futur . these fact also aggrev the fact of avail of fewer car in futur . henc it is the hightim that scientist today should find out the altern way to replac the exist fuel which are limit or face the bitter consequ of futur . where the car on road wil becom histori .
