i am desagre with the statement becaus in my opinion when i travel i like to learn everith by myself and made the trip so much interest . for exampl i like to walk in the forest enjoy the bird sing and admir the natur place , use a book or map as a guid . like that i learn everith and enjoy in peac . other reason is when you travel in group with a guid not all the group like the same thing , some of them want to go shop , anoth , go danc in other word everybodi want to go for a differ way an see differ part of the place , final you never can do that you like or enjoy as you wih . if you go to a big citi along or just with one person we alway can share our interest an both do tha we want to do at the same time but when is so mani peopl , some time we can not finish to explor the citi becaus they are tire and want to go back to the hotel , or the kid want to go to the park . other problem is when you go in a tour gide you just go tu the place that they have in the packag , you can not go anywar als becaus is a new place and you do n't know how to go back , that is a risk . could you imagin that you go in a group with your boyfriend and you like to espend more time in an specif place and you can not becaus you are in group and have to go with everybodi have to go ? i dont realli like that , i am better feel free to go to the place that i like and if i want to danc do it , or run , jump , play or be happi . final like i said in the bigginig is a lot better travel along than in a group lead by a tour guid .
