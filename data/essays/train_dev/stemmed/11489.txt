from my point of view it is more import for student to understand idea and concept , becaus of my own experi . it doe not make ani sens if they learn fact , sometim by heart , without understand . furthermor , if they understand the idea and concept , they automat learn them . in addit to that , they rememb thing , they learn by understand better then without . moreov , what do they want to do with their knowledg , they learn onc , without understand ? they can not use it in their life . and student learn for their life and not onli for their teacher . for exempl sometim it is not import to know all the chronolog year and event of the past by heart . it is much more import to know , whi someth happen and/or someon did ? anoth exempl which refer to that topic is the subject latin . i learn it in school sinc 4 year and we do not onli learn a larg amount of vocabulari to translat some text into our languag , but we also analys the text . today it is easi to make research on the internet , by onli print someth out , without understand anyth . you have the choic to learn everyth without understand , or you read everyth care with understand . as far as i am concern the second way is the better one . all in all it is better for student to understand everyth , then onli learn them by heart .
