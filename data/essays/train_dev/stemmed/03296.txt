i disagre with the `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' statement . although the form , shape of car will alway chang with the choic and like of peopl the concept of car will alway be there and the number of car on the street will increas until a restrict law pass on that . peopl have some everlast relat with some object that they will never give up no matter what . and car is that type of an object . peopl got use to drive car , thi is a pleasur for them and a differ color in life . think of a telephon for instanc we have internet and we have voip ( voic over ip ) technolog which enabl us to speak on internet without ani cost and with anybodi all over the world , did it caus in less number of phone at home ? or did it reduc the number of cellul phone sale ? i dont think so becaus peopl got use to speak on the phone and thi wont chang at least thi wont chang in twenti year of time and peopl will go on talk on the phone just like drive their car back home . there might be other transport altern and they might be cheaper too in twenti year of time but that wont chang the car sale , actual it might even increas becaus popul of the world will increas . in conclus we can think drive car as a all the time activ , it will not get fewer but increas .
