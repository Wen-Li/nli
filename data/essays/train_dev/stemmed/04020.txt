i realli do not agre that young peopl enjoy life more than the older do . i think they enjoy differ area of life but with the same intens . it look like that young peopl are have fun with a lot of physic activ becaus at that stage of their life the bodi is alway full of energi and rich of sensat . on the other side i see a lot of old peopl prefer mental activ such as read , medit and convers . thi happen just becaus at their stage of life they learn and take advantag of their mental skill . for exempl , you can see in the same park a group of kid have a blast dure a soccer game , and their grandpar sit on a bench and be completli immers in a convers or read a book . even with music we have two differ world : young gener enjoy fast and laud music that they danc till they drop on the floor . adult get excit with less hectic music that they can listen and danc as well . but , if you go to a danc studio , you can see that regardless the age and the kind of music peopl is danc , everybodi is enjo that activ . the intenc they put in what they are do and the reward they get from what they are do is not relat to their age . they just get from differ sors of joy sors that are more fit with their physic and mental statu of the age they have . my impress is that both , young and old peopl get a lot of joy from the activit that they choos . like i said at the begin , they choos veri differ way to spend their time but the intenc and pleasur level they achiv , i am sure is the same .
