the statement , `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' , is a controversi one , but person i agre with it . thera are mani reason for my to believ that idea and concept are more import when student are in a learn process . firstli , when understand and idea , you should support it with a wide rang of exampl , but all the fact that could be mention are never more worth than the idea itself , just becaus is the idea the main sourc for all the fact . consequ i understand that the comprenhens of the idea is the key for all the fact . on the other hand , i realli beliv that concept , even though when they are drawn through empir exampl and high complic laboratori experi , will be alway concept . as a matter of fact , those concept will be readi to be applic on ani new fact . so even though we learn from fact and experi to get empir conclus and therefor new concept , i have observ dure my life that concept will remain over ani fact . besid the argument list abov , i also support the rule of be up to date on learn idea and concept becaus understand the caus you will alway readi to discov new fact and the insight reason of them . otherwis we could get lost in a pool of number and figur without know how to solv mani question and challeng and turn an easi situait in a difficult problem , just becaus the lack of idea and concept to overcom it . in conclus , i close recomend to all student to enhanc their abil to understand the core idea and concept on whatev the might be interest on , and to get the skill for futur success career develop .
