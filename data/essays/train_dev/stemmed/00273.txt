mani thing in the world are so complex , if we want to get all fact that it might be take a long time to understand all . in my opinion , the effici way to learn thing is to get the main idea and concept , instead of understand all the fact . the better way to know a fact is to attemp get it by ourselv . if someon alway tell you anyth what you want , you will not know how difficult to get the knowledg . you just follow other step , without think deepli . you will not find other news dicoveri , becaus you alway think other ' opinion are correct . it will stop prodess , and it make our brain get rusti . for instans , when i wa studi in univers , the profess alway theach us the way to studi , not follow the book and read that . the mean of teacher is to help student find their way to research , they can tell us about differ field talk about . if we are interest in some specif area , we should research more inform about that by ourselv . afterward , analyz the inform and discuss with profess . it 's the way to learn knowledg , by mean of the mothod and we can find more necessari inform than we expect . in my opinion , the better way to studi is to understand main idea and concept . if we just follow our ' opinion , we can just stay in the same place , without process . we should think someth by ourselv , and it is possibl for us to learn more thing which we should know .
