i do n't agre that there will be less car in use in twenti year compar to today . the histori of car product and of ownership of a car show that the amount of car is rise and rise . ok you can say : `` but the bad enviroment situat will lead to less car and more to alternativ like public buse and subway ! '' but in my opinion thi is not the way peopl will think . the most highest valu for most of the modern peopl live today are mobil and flexibilti . you can go where ever you want , when ever you want ! further than that : you have to be flexibl . it 's import for your job and to catch up with the speed the world is run . for exampl : i 'm work as a cinematograph sinc sever year for differ broadcast station . the medium of televis becam so fast dure the last 15 to 20 year becaus there were such import invent like mobil phone and the internet . you can react on certain news much more faster than some year ago . when the medium is becom faster the peopl who are feed the medium have to becom faster . follow thi line it is import to be flexibl . one way to be flexibl is to have a car . so at the end the circl is close . on the other hand it is a must for the peopl to think about altern next to the use of car . the rais of the amount of car on the street will lead to a traffic-collap . in thi case the gouvern is also in charg to support altern way of transport . thi can be in spend money on traffic research project or in support scientist who are develop new way of energi suppli for car . at the end it will lead to more car but with altern way of run them . fuel - and diesel-driven car should be reduc and instead of thi solar , hybrid - or hydrogenic-bas vehicl should be support .
