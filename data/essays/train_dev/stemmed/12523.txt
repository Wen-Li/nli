some peopl might think that it will be disappear the number of car within few year . i do not agre with thi idea becaus the car is good transport to go somewher and there is not signific trial as altern car . first , i can say that the car is the best vehicl to go somewher . we usual use the car when we go some place . even though the distanc is long or short , drive car is suitabl for ani distanc . for exampl , when i wa in summer vacat , i went to 3 academi for learn english convers and english write and comput class . academi were so seper that i need to ride someth . at that time , my sister recommend me to ride a motor scooter . becaus it wa cheap , i thought that to ride a motor scooter wa a good idea . it wa not good idea at all becaus of long distanc for a motor scooter . i think that there is ani vehicl that can replac the car becaus i can drive ani distanc even though it is ten meter or five thousand meter . secondli , peopl rare tri to develop the new vehicl . press usual say that we are in the situat of lack of petroleum . in thi situat , most car compani tri to find the altern energi instead of gasolin . for exampl , i visit a car compani when i wa middl school student as a school picnic . in there , i could learn lot of inform about car and the sourc of energi . the supervisor of that compani told that car were face of shortag of energi . in addit thi mean that we woud not make new transport but find new energi . it took hundr year to make car and it is too late to make new vehicl now . that idea made peopl do not care about make new transport for move . i agre with hi idea and i can feel that few exert to made new vehicl for money . i believ even though sever year are pass there are still mani car . car are the best way to move and peopl hardli tri to make new ca
