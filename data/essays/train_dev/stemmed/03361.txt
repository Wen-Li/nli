i do not agre with the follow statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . and i prefer for travel alon even though i will face mani unknown problem becaus i think it will save my time and i will go to anywher i want to without limit . mani peopl have a tradit idea that they must be in a group led by a tour guid when they travel . but i think it is incorrect sinc it will wast your time . whenev you move to a new place , you must follow the tour guid 's step and can not control your time by yourself . what you should do is wait all the time even though you have been exhaust . wait for other peopl who belong to your group to prepar , and wait for the tour guid 's tediou introduct of some famou bulid or carv which you are of interest of at all . eventu time is up , and you have not do what you are desir to except hear the word `` becaus of no time , let us go back '' by your tour guid . the second thing is that you can go to ani place you are interest in if you travel alon . without the tour guid you can go to the museum or thear which may not be includ in the schecul of a group led by a tour guid . you can go the shop mall to buy whatev thing you like instead of line on the travel group to shop in a mall which is the tour guid 's recommend . final you can alo have food in the restraunt where serv you well and make you feel gorgeou . so abov are my reason that travel by yourself can get lot of benefit . if i you make a decis to travel abroad and want to have a good time , tri to do it by yourself .
