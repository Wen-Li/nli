i am agre with the statement . i think that peopl should make differ thing to make thi planet a better one . what i mean is that much peopl do not like to do a big effort , but who realli like that ? we need to start take risk to be success . work with an own bussin you can feel better , becaus you are work for you and not for anoth person who mayb you will never know . you can research someth and then bring put it on the market . i have some friend work by import firm they like what they do , but i am sure that they will never take a risk becaus their parent never did . that is a big problem in my countri , most of the famili educ they childrend to studi and work for an intern compani . in person i think that they should induc them to creat an own bussin . the term `` take risk '' mayb is not onli for have your own bussin . other exampl is the univers . most of the student after they have finish the high school they do not know which carrier they what to do . of cours there are some guy that prefer the money befor anyth , so they studi someth which they do not like much but they will earn some money . also they are other who take the risk of do what they like and after few year they are famou scientif . who know the futur . in conclus i will say my childrend do what they realli want to do and if they should take a risk do not think twice and take it . i am sure that if we work in someth that we realli like , we will be a better worker and we will have a better life .
