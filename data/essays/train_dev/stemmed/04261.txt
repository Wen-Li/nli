i recent read an articl about support group , which have to face the situat of veri low activ particip rate among their member and lack of new applic . sinc i also lead a support group for keep clean our citi park , i can confirm thi tendenc and i agre with the statement . i ca n't stop ask whi young peopl do n't want to be involv in activ , which can improv the life qualiti in their commun . lack of time is the first most popular answer . nowaday youngster are veri busi : if the school doe n't give them enough homework , parent will find some extrascholast activ . friend are also import , and someth done with them seem to them to have more worth than someth done for the commun . help the commun bring not onli benefit to the commun itself , but also to who particip in the activ . stay togeth is essenti for a social anim like the human be . in conclus , more should be done to involv young peopl to help the commun . school and parent should be the first to promot such activ , show the benefit that can be achiev , and not hold peopl back !
