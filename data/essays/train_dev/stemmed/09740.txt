in my opinion in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ; although thi statement can sound total unawar of the fact that car ' possessor are quickli grow all over the world , i will now explain the reason for my idea . car ' price have been decreas slightli in the past few decad : origin born as a super-luxuri statu symbol back in the end of the nineteenth centuri , we can therefor clearli state that today car are a commod afford by almost anyon in ani industri countri . howev , thi appar good chang of the situat , ha led to two extrem neg effect : the abrupt rise in oil price , and a tremend impact on the planet 's environ . firt thing first , sinc car are produc and sold even in big , heavili popul countri like china and india ( togeth comprehend more than one third of the world popul altogeth ) , market where onc they were unaval to almost the total of peopl , their demand quantiti ha risen to the sky , and so the fuel price : petroleum extract site are use in a more and more savag way , but the lack of offer of thi fundament miner caus , accord to a veri well known econom law , an increas in it price . as of today , even extract site place veri far from ani valuabl market , or veri expens to use , have been approach by excract compani ( e.g. in alaska , in the north sea , through ocean platform . .. ) after the tradit site ' shortag . it is my opinion that the oil price , unfortun , rise more and more , to the point where car will be onc again an item afford by , and onli by , veri rich peopl , therefor decreas significantli their number . the onli solut to thi inevit econom disast would be to find some altern energi font ; howev , research in that field have been grow slowli in the last year , thu our energet futur is not look bright at all . besid , how not to mention the fact that sinc car ' use spread around everi contin ( and it 's gonna be wors and wors in the short period ) pollut 's effect on global environ have icreas so much ? car are not what you might call an ecolog way of transport : have more and more of them drinv around all over the world might even lead to the worst solut . some scientist , in fact , even came to think that , if their number is still go to increas over the year , world governmentscould even ban them from use , so to prevent the enivron , that howev , by that day will probabl be serious compromis . to summar , i think that car ' number will grow in the short period , until it will be too much to afford them ( in econom and ecolog mean ) : sinc that moment on i believ there will be fewer and fewer of them , even less than today .
