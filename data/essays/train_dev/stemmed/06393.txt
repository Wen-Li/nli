although it total depend on how a person look at hi or her life to say he or she is enjoy hi or her life , from my experi as a man who just turn 31 , i disagre with thi statement . as far as i am concern , older peopl can have more chanc or time to enjoy their live and more of them might alreadi have got great memori that can last until the last day of their live . i believ that older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl do for the follow a few reason . first of all , most of those ` older peopl ' are assum to have retir or to be in the near futur which mean they alreadi have enough money in their save or other invest portfolio to live without work for the last of time . it is not unusu to see those older peopl who are do all the fun stuff they could not or have put off for a long time . it is possibl for them to enjoy their live becaus they work or have been work for such a long time prepar for retir . also , sinc mostli the older peopl do not have to work to support their own famili by the time around retir , there are not much time for them to get stress . it lead them to more enjoy moment they have wish for . at last , the older peopl can final have their own time spend more time with each spous and other commun and so on assum all the children are independ of their parent financi and econom . in conclus , as long as heath condit for both young and older peopl remain quit same , the older peopl have better chanc to enjoy their live than young peopl in mani way includ financi and ecom reason .
