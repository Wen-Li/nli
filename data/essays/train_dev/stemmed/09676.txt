i total agre with thi statement . inde it is clear advertis want to give a good imag of their product and in advertis the product seem better then in realiti . in my opinion it is not amaz becaus the goal of the advert is to sell . that is whi custom can onli see the best aspect of the product . advertis have to imagin a way to lure peopl . if it is a good advert , peopl will have lust to buy the product even if they are not veri well inform . i think if product seem better it is becaus there is a lack of inform for the consum . besid it is not the aim of the advert to inform custom and sometim advertis overstep the bound of the product by show some irreal situat . i mean sometim the product is not the core of the advert but the goal is to show it and that peopl regogn it in shop . for exampl a famou advert for a shampo convey the idea that the product is pretti erot . .. it is a weird way to use thi product but if you are naiv you can think it is true and you will be disappoint . thu product are more attract if they are not ordinari and when peopl see the advert on tv it is alway with handsom men or pretti girl . .. in order to sell dream . as a result the product seem alway better when it is on tv . for instanc a woman can see a beauti skirt on a top model but when she will see it in a shop she will be disappoint . owe to the goal of the advert , the product is shown as someth beauti and even if it is an usual product , like soap or milk , mani peopl will buy thi one becaus they have seen it on tv although the product is not more differ than anoth one . to conclud i realli agre witj thi statement becaus i think advertis sell dream and it is not often the realiti , that is whi product seem much better then they realli are .
