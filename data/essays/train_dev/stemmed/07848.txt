even though sometim , in particular when travel for a short amount of time , be in an organ group with a guid can be more effect , i gener prefer to travel on my own . the main reason whi i like travel is the fact that it provid an opportun to be close to veri differ peopl , learn a languag and eat new , unusu food . in summari , to experi a differ cultur . when you travel in a group , you often end up with peopl from your countri , who speak your languag and want to eat known food , in known place . also , tour guid gener focu on the typic tourist attract , becaus that 's what most peopl are interest in . thi is almost the exact opposit of what i am look for when i travel . i like to read book about my destin befor i travel , so that by the time i am there , i alreadi have a rough mental plan of what i would like to see . do so offer much more flexibl than travel in a group . you can choos exactli where to go and when , regardless of what the major consid interest . some peopl like to visit church , other museum or even shop mall . when you travel in a group you almost alway have to find a compromis and rare end up be complet satisfi . my dream vacat includ plenti of time to wander the street of a new citi , without the help of someon who alreadi know the place . i like to get lost in interest street , to tri to interact with local peopl and to see how they walk , shop and talk in their own countri . even when i am not fluent in the local languag , i alway do my best to use as mani word and express as possibl . i find it much more satisfi , than just use english or italian , my mother tongu . base on my experi , i also believ that peopl react much better when they see that you are travel on your own and that you respect their cultur and tri to blend in , instead of be in a larg group , look at them through the reassur cultur len of a guid , as if they were exot anim in a zoo .
