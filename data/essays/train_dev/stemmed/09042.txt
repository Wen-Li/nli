i think that the statement is too extrem to agre with . it is true that there is a seri of problem involv with car , for exampl the oil becom rarer and rarer and the econom crisi we are experienc , which should lead to a decresas in the number of car , but there are mani factor which could lead , instead , to an increas in the number of car in the next twenti year . in fact , there are countri such as china and india which are becom richer . if a great amount of the peopl live there want a car , the number of car would probabl increas , instead of decreas in the next twenti year . it is true western countri are handl the problem of air pollut due to car circul limit the number of car actual allow to circul in the citi , but eastern one most probabl have n't alreadi face thi problem . so , perhap the number of car is like to be reduc in western countri , but not in the eastern one . furthermor , new type of energi exploit are in studi . for exampl , electr or nuclear car are matter of studi of today 's scientist . if new energi were discov in the next twenti year , there would be no evid support the argument that the number of car would decreas . furthermor , car corpor could also build car more appeal to the custom , increas the number of car in thi way . in fact , a car sold togheth with surpris servic like the possibl for the non driver to surf the internet or to watch televis could improv the sell . in conclus the problem with the lack of resorc that the earth is face is realli a great challeng to the number of car . even the media is rais peopl awar of the lack of solut to the oil scarc human race is face . but there is noth certain about the number of car within the next twenti year .
