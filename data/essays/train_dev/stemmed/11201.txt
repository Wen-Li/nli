although it must be said that there are young peopl who do n't care about their commun , i think that , in gener , new gener are keen on help their town and do it in a varieti of way . there are mani young boy and girl who spend a lot of their time work for the poor and the disadvantag . for exampl , in my countri there are sever associ that recruit personnel to drive ambul and one of my best friend , who ha a veri demand and time-consum job , work there without compens at least onc a week . anoth friend of mine spend everi sunday serv meal to poor peopl in a church , and he often tell me that perform thi servic for the benefit of hi commun is veri reward for him . but there are also other way to help peopl ; skill profession can be of great help in certain area . a classmat of mine , who graduat from a medic school , is now part of an associ call `` doctor without boundari '' that send doctor around the world to help poor commun in less develop countri . she wa sent to africa and provid medic assist to mani peopl . i think that a person like her is a clear sign that young peopl are will to help the other and therefor can be reli upon to becom activ member of our commun . in fact , if a young doctor is will to help peopl in a remot countri , one can be sure that she will be much more keen on contribut to the well be of her commun . as for myself , i tri to get involv in pro bono activ , too . sinc i am a lawyer , i wa abl to spend the past two year assist poor client who were involv in variou kind of litig without charg them . so , the exampl i see around me are , in my opinion , eloqu sign that younger gener are not less will to help other in their commun than older one .
