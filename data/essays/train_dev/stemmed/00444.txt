some believ it is better to know a lot on a specif subject or on a specif major , some other beliv , instead , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani accadem subject . for me , i can say with confid that it is better to know mani subject in dept . i have studi an enjen and i almost alway take cours connect with my major , so cours relat to enjen . if i have a convers with other enjen i feel good and i am sure about what i say . you know , in situat like thi i think that school did a good job and i think , also , thi is great for my job . but if one day i meet someon and we begin talk about somenthig else_ if he or she want to talk about literature_ or art_ or music_too bad , i can not ! so , in thi situat i feel not prepar , not well belanc as a person and thi is the biggest reason i think it is realli import to studi mani and mani other subject . i think also that school that ha an import influenc on the background of students_lif , must tri to prepar belanc peopl who can look at their futur without fear . if i have time in the futur , i will want studi by myself what i have not studyi up to now .
