there is no deni that mani politician and scientist have rais awar concern the problem of car pollut sinc it is now usual to hear about thi issu in all the media . howev success a solut to the car problem will be , it is a thorni issu in so far as everyon agre that someth must be done for the gener interest but in the same time doe not want to give up drive hi or her own car . it can be infer from the opposit between gener and person interest that these latter will win at least for the next few year . thu , i am strongli convinc that more car will be use in twenti year . i believ thi becaus of three main reason , which deal with wealth , the problem of fuel and the problem of space . first , it seem obviou that some countri will use far more car than they use today becaus they becom wealthier everi day . these develop countri , such as india and china , are peopl by more than one billion inhabit who can not afford a car for the moment but will be abl to do it more often , by dint of have a huge econom growth . thu , peopl who are go to give up their car in alreadi develop countri will not have ani effect on the amount of car in use sinc other peopl will drive more car than befor . moreov , it seem imposs for develop countri to prevent develop one from drive more car becaus develop countri have alreadi done the same . some peopl would say that the problem concern petrol will lead to a fall in use car . i do not agre with thi statement . there is no problem as far as fuel is concern becaus two solut exist . either compani find more petroleum or anoth type of fuel will be use . some countri , such as brazil , have alreadi chang fuel by use oil that come from agricultur product . so , it seem to be true that car manufactur will not have to be worri about thi problem . car will keep be the unavoid motor of our economi . the third reason whi i believ that more car will be in use in twenti year is that i do not agre with the peopl who argu that fewer car will be use becaus of the traffic in citi . it is true that more and more car in citi caus unbear traffic jam , but it is not true that peopl will stop drive for thi reason . i state thi becaus car manufactur have alreadi shown that they were abl to solv thi problem too . their answer consist in design smaller car , which take less space and are more easi to park . the most famou exampl in europ is the success of the car name smart . if more peopl drive smaller car , then there will be no problem at all . in my view , more car will be use in the futur becaus noth
