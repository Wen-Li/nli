in the modern era , where it is an era of technolog and scienc , the upcom young gener is face with enorm challeng . they have to preserv their cultur , social root and at the same time keep abreast with the latest technolog develop to have a decent stand in the societi . i person feel , in between these challeng the young peopl nowaday do not have enough time for help their commun . the first thing that come to my mind , as a part of young gener is to get a good educ , good job and be stabl econom . in the modern compitit world , it ha becom so tough to keep up with thi challeng that almost all of the time is eaten up concentr on thi singl goal . a youngster in modern era , is most consum with thi challeng that he forget hi commit to the commun to where he belong . if i consid my own exampl , i find myself guilti of the same thing , i am so much engross in my studi and think about futur that i am not abl to denot much time to the commun . i person want to devot time to help the commun where i wa born and brought up , and give someth back to the societi , but at the moment i think of that i find myself constrain by my socio-econom condit and the inabl to do so . one of the major factor which i have notic in the upcom younger gener , is the loss of valu and feel of belong to the commun where they live in . they consid it just ani other thing in their life , and are mainli concern with their enjoy and their life . as the fact in a lot of newspap in india suggest , that a major of upper class youngster , who are not constrain econom and financi , prefer go to night club and parti to commun help , or tyre to help anyon in gener . i do n't have to go much farther to find exampl of such case , if i look around my colleg , and student with not much financi constraint would at ani time prefer to go to a club or a movi to enjoy rather then to help anyon . even in today 's modern world , i do find some young peopl will to take up the challang and improv the societi which they are a part of . a veri good exampl of thi would be yfe ( youth for equal ) organ form by univers stuent , in delhi , india , to fight against the reserv in the educ system on the basi of cast , which wa impos by govt . of india . see their exampl , i am sure that some of the youth contribut to the societi and countri . the onli concern is that such number of organ and peopl are veri less compar to the total number of youth in the countri . if we look at the person life of an averag life on an youngster today , in most of the case we will find that they are not veri emot stabl themselv . they are veri much confus about what to do and what not to . in the modern gener , in most of the case with both the parent work , the kid who form the young gener do not get to know their valu system . in absens of guidanc of their parent , they usual do not understand their respons toward the societi , countri and moreov to human in gener . i would conclud that , in gener young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun , but the reason for thi are vari and are differ for everi young member of the modern societi . for some peopl it might be the socio-econom constraint , for other it might be due to the loss of valu . i firmli beleiv if given the right direct and guidanc , the young gener would realiz that what they are miss on and definit give more time to help their commun , societi , countri and human .
