now-day the market is becom more and more competit compar to the past year . thi chang of situat is due to a more sophist technolog and a better awer of the product . from my opinion thi contest lead to a point in which the compani , in order to sell more product , produc advertis that make product seem much better than they realli are . i believ that thi technic is becom a strategi use by the compani to attract the consum 's attent . in fact , onc the consum find out that the product is not as it wa pictur in the advertis , if he ha come a long way to buy the product , he will most like purchais it . howev , it may even happen that he is so disappoint that he will not buy at all and at the same time he will make a bad advertis both on the item and on the compani . i have experienc thi situat as well , in deed , on a magazin i found an advetis of a new brand that wa promot a shirt , but when i went to the shop to buy it i found out that it did not corrispond to the pictur of the magazin . in fact , it look much better on the advertis and the materi wa realli bad . at thi point i decid that it would have been a wast of money buy it and i left the shop . moreov , thi situat is occur too frequent and it will influenc the consum in a neg way when buy product advertis . in addit thi type of promot make break the trusti relationship establish between custom and compani . in conclus i can say that i tottali agre with the statement , most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , and i feel that thi new approch adopt by compani will have a neg impact on the market and may damag the relationship between produc and custom .
