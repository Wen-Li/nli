youngster are the veri basi of a societi . it is them who are energet and capabl enough to manag a nation and move it on the line of develop . it is them , who form the veri backbon of a commun . accord to me , i dont think that it would be appropri to blame all the youngster for not help their commun . well , we have everi type of individu in everi walk and everi sphere of life and it would be inappropri on our part to blame the complet lot of youngster for a few irrespons youth . the youngster do activ particip in cultur , social as well as technolog event in a commun . for exampl ; as in my countri india , economi boost is go on all becaus of effort of the youngster engag in privat sector manag as well as technic task which is a help to the nation . then , we can also consid that mani social activist are youngster who take initi to wipe off the evil from the societi . social refom project are mainli run in collag and school now-a-day . the youth of today is more awar of the right and wrong and at time , is even readi to teach their elder about it . also as we all know that the promin literari artist , sport personel etc are the youth who , by their good work , bring name and fame to their commun and societi all across the world . although , i wont deni that certain youth do not particip at all in their commun develop , rather spoil their futur by get engag in useless type of work or in antin activ . or , such peopl would get addict to drug or so . in the end , i would like to conclud that youth now-a-day is pretti respons and awar of it duti as a lot and should not be underr or underjudg . i would say they are spend almost whole of their time for their commun develop .
