what is advertis ? you develop a great product ( in your opinion ) and you want to promot it . that is the basic fact of advertis . a good market specialist would do it aida-styl . aida is a process in market . it includ the follow step : attent - interest - desir - action . the first point is get your attent . therefor he must do someth special like a big present or someth els like a campaign ( e . on did someth like that . it wa everywher in the media and no one knew it ) . if he got the attent , the interest must be build up . the follow step is : advertis . in advertis he want to show us that product from it best side . he count up all posit skill and gimmick . he show anyth in the product that is better than other product and so on . the next phase is build a desir for your product . best exampl for someth like that is appl , who made a fashion brand out of ipod . in the last step it is up to you : you have to buy the product . sound good so far . the problem is that there is not onli one compani and one product , there an almost uncount amount of compani and product and anyon want to sell their product . in some market , where there is a hard competit , there is more promis made that can kept . thi lead to a bad imag , becaus if you buy an expens product and it is work for onli a few week , you are not a happi custom . if the number of unhappi custom grow , you will be soon a unhappi compani . a few year ago advertis play not the role as it doe today . the compani realiz that their imag depend from their product . they invest veri much to make their product the best on the market , so that they can show us , that it is the best product .
