a good teach can adopt differ form and pedagog path , but the most appropri way to learn effici lay in the method adopt , in order to understand thing , rather than simpli learn them . at the veri beginn of our scholar ` career ' , we learn by heart a whole bunddl of thing : poetri , multipl tabl , grammat rule , definit , and so on . .. but most of these learn are ment to help us work faster without have to wast time in search and understand : thi is the case for instanc of the multipl tabl ( even though we know how they work . .. ) . all these item are also usual the base to acquir a good memori and to enabl us to learn more and more , alway further . yet , in mani case , learn by heart will not be suffici if not accompani by a full understand . if consid for instanc the case of a mathemat formula , it will onli be effici applic if it necess and logic is understood , so it can be util appropri . an idea will be better defend or critic if all of it argument are well known and understood . a concept will be optim and well util if it function is evid and logic . moreov , be awar of the origin of an idea or concept , understand it evolut and purpos , will help undoubt in it appropri and memor . it will help acquir it own opinion or vision of it , as it entir process is known and understood . yet , other thing will not necessar need to be understood in order to learn . some fact can not be understood , or their understand would be way too complic , useless and timewas to enabl us to advanc in a learn process , depend on what the goal of the student are . in thi case , one can learn without understand , as it will help advanc further in learn more and more , which is the main object .
