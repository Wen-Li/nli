for what concern my point of view , nowaday advertis is use to convinc peopl buy product that are often of lower qualiti than they seem on the tv spot or on the advertis space . i think most of the compani are onli interest in earn as much money as possibl . their polici don-t alway care about ethic and moral principl . thi attitud is reflect in the way they act when advertis their product . they want to caught the eye of the consum with bright color , wander imag of idyl place , beauti women , music and similar thing . they work hard , think about what attract the major of the peopl , what are the desir and the dream that their target custom ha . but on the other side they do not invest enaugh money and time to improv the qualiti of the good . i think everi custom at least onc experienc the mislead inform advertis convey . when i wa a littl child i alway want my parent to buy thing i saw in the televis spot . for instanc , when i wa six i wa amaz by the spot of a doll that could speak with children . i thought that she wa abl to answer everi question i may ask to her . but when i went to the toy shop and i tri it i wa realli sad in understand her abil were onli cri and say she wa hungri , thirsti and sleepi . now i-m no more a child but often product that attract me with advertis don-t satisfi me at all . i think that govern should be more sever with compani , check if the standard of good realli meet the promis of the spot . the compani can-t be free of tell lie to the custom , besid thi he must = e protect by the law .
