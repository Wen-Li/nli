i 'm sure i can say i total agre with the statement . in fact it 's the reason whi i choos a cours of degre that cover a lot of differ subject . i think one simpl ( but not so stupid , i suppos ) reason is becaus studi a lot onli one subject can easili becom veri veri bore . i ca n't immagin to pass all the year of the colleg studi all the aspect and featur of the same subject over and over again . i 'm sure that thi way one will becom a great expert of the subject , but i think in the end he could even begin to hate it , unless he is total fond of it . anoth good reason to achiev some knowledg in at least more than one subject is that you can never know what life 's deserv to you . one question : what if you ca n't find a job that 's concern with that subject you have studi ? it mean that you are realli unlucki , but it could happen . one extend knowledg in onli one subject mean that probabl you are veri littl compet in ani of the other numberless subject that exist . with an academ prepar that cover a lot of differ subject , you have at least medium-to-high skill in a greater number of them . so on your curriculum it 'll written that you have match dure your academ carreer a number of subject , mean you could more easili find a job in a varieti of environ ; after all , i think , you can achiev the real expertis in a field of knowledg onli with the direct experi on the work place rather than with the academ studi . i think thi is true at least for what concern my biomed engin studi , i 'm sure that the knowledg of chemistri , physic , mathemat , biolog and medicin that i 'm learn , although they 're not total complet will help me in futur find a possibl job in a number of biomed applic .
