if i had to refer onli to my person experi i would have to complet agre with the statement . fortun not everi youngster is like me . i must confess that i have never taken part to commun servic , which in my home countri , itali , young men could choos as an altern to militari servic . a bill ha been pass that free my gener from militari servic and thu also from `` compulsori '' commun servic . i might have justfi my behavior by say that nowaday the sens of commun that use to anim the life of suburbia and countrysid villag ha been lost ; that work condit and habit have chang and all in all peopl are less and less tie to their own commun . they think and act global . but the fact that i am selfish doe not impli that so are my fellow citizen of the same age . i have mani friend devot to at least one commun servic activ . my best femal friend ha been activ in the emerg transport servic , that bring patient to emerg room and hospit for the past five year and she is still on duti onc a week everi thursday night . it is worth to mention that in itali thi servic is run on a voluntari basi . final one can extend what i have mention about the fade of local commun and claim that the young should take care of the global communtiy and especi it poorest member . more and more young women and men are now spend their holiday in non government organ activ in the poorest part of the world . as far as i am concern i have never join these program , but my sister and some frind of mine did last year . they were help in a small hospit in satellit town of kolkata , india . so , hope , the pictur is not so bleak , at least as long as my friend persist in their altruism .
