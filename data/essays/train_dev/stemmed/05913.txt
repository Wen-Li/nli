i agre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . firstli , the fuel reserv on thi planet are limit and the consumpt of fuel is onli increas with time . one of the reason for the increas in fuel consumpt , mainli petroleum , which is easier and cheaper to refin , is the grow popul worldwid . petrol is not onli need to run car but also need to run citi - to gener electr which is need to run all our electr applianc at home . also with an increas in air travel , the fuel consumpt ha gone up . anoth reason for increas in fuel consumpt is due to the increas in industri and other technolog advanc and research . thu although the fuel consumpt is increas , the resourc are limit and henc the demand will eventu outdo the suppli . thu to prevent thi the number of car run on the road will need to be reduc . although , altern resourc of fuel which are more enviorn friendli are be research , such as substitut petroleum with ethanol , which is be wide discuss about current , the research have a long way to go befor thi can be use commonli by the consum . variou other factor such as fuel economi and effect of use thi altern on the car engin need to be sort out . i also feel that the cost of substitut petroleum with other fuel altern would be veri high and not possibl for the common man to sustain fuel charg for hi car from econim point of view . henc not mani will be abl to afford car then automat caus a delin in the number of car . lastli , we all know that the current increas in the number of vehicl on the road in addit to the increas in fuel consumpt is caus a lot of enviornment chang . global warm is onli increas by the day . even scientist are shock with the effect of pollut releas in the air on our climat . these drastic chang in our climat will compel us to decreas the use of car and look for more enviorn friendli altern .
