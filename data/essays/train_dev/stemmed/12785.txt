these day , mani peopl are will to help their commun through mani way such as donat cloth or money , howev , some peopl think that young peopl appear to be put littl time to help , but i disagre with thi statement becaus of two reason . initi , sinc most young peopl are more activ than the older peopl , i beliv that they have better chanc to help thier commun . for instanc , i saw mani young peopl who are do voluntari work in school . they sometim teach poor peopl who can not afford to go to colleg , and also , they teach poor kid , too . also , mani young peopl engag in demonstr to fight against some unappropri regul . from my experi , some of the young teacher tri to chang the compani that wa suppli for my school 's meal becaus the qualiti of the food wa not good enough for student . becaus of their effort , my school could chang the compani and had better qualiti of food for the meal . in addit , i think that the campaign are mostli launch by young peopl . for instanc , in the church , there are mani colleg student who are help poor kid around the countri by donat cloth . also they convinc other peopl to donat by advertis their campaign . sometim they make poster , or they cook cooki by theirselv to advertis it . in the conclus , i think mani young peop are give enough time to help their commun by sever way such as demonstr to fingt against some unappropri rule , voluntari work , and donat for poor peopl . therefor , i disagre with the point that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun .
