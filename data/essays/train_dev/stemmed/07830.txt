younger and older peopl have differnt way to live their life but it seem to me that younger peopl can enjoy their way of live more than older peopl can . that is whi i agre with the the statment . on reason is , that i think that young peopl are more unconsci than older peolp and that is whi they are more free in take advantag of what is go on in front of them . for exampl if hey have the opportun to go and visit a friend in anoth countri they often do not thing how hard it is to go there . they just take a few thing and tri to reach their friend place , mayb by hitch hike . thi mostli differ from the behaviour of older peopl , which often have to plan thing in a realli organ way . and often have all thi thouhgt like is thi the right moment in my life , what about my job . .. thi feel like , that young peopl have a big amount of freedom to act howev they want a other reason whi young peopl can enjoy their life more is , that they do not have the same amount of responsibil like older peopl . they do not have children to look for . they can go to a parti the whole night long without have lot of stress the next day . they onli need to go to school . young peopl often are more healthi then older peopl , so they can do a lot of thing older peopl can not do , for exampl extrem - sport accord to all the other reason thing about thi topic i would think , that the main point whi young peopl enjoy life betteri , that they still have freedom to choos what they want to do , without bee trap in an adult life .
