peopl have their own idea about whether they concentr on the broad suject or not . some peopl may say that we have to studi special subject for develop special . in my opinion , howev , it seem clear that learn mani subject is more import than the sepcif subject becaus of select and relat of job . first , when it come to the select of job , know a lot of field enabl peopl to have mani option which they select job . it is gener agre that if we studi more subject , we would gain more item of consid occup . for exampl , in my case , i major in environ and i am soldier , in other word , i studi environ as major and explain armi skill . therefor , i can select my futur whether i would be a soldier or environmentalist . moreov , if peopl have so mani select , they would fail to live in their life . therefor , the so mani select have posit effect on studentr . second , as far as relat of job is concern , some job are rel to other job , peopl have the common sens that math is similiar to physic , scienc , engin and so on . therefor , all subect are rel to ani other subject and we can say that the some occup also similiar to other job . for instanc , if peopl want to be a comput specialist , they should understand engineerinig worker and investor and also know math , scienc , engon and so on . in other word , comput scienc involv in engin , math , scienc and other field . furthermor , in the compani , person who work at same corpor have each major and they have influenc on each other . therefor , they must know respect field for develop their compani . in thi way we can say that we must understand mani field . to sum up , i agre with the statement in that we had better gain more knowledg from learn lot of subject . if we studi mani academ subject , we can obtain so mani benefit , all thing consid , i can definit say that we must studi mani subject .
