everyon in hi life look for a prosper futur and like to get a job where he can appli hi academ studi and experiemt skill . and to find thi job he must be veri good in hi major . but the student must not concentr onli on the subject that are import for hi major . so , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to speializ in one specif subject . my friend studi engin in the univers , he is veri good in hi major and he know everi thing about it . he graduat from the univers with veri high grade . now he is work in a big compani . but the big problem with thi friend is that he is unsoci . the reason for thi loneli is that he know noth except hi major . he can not talk about other subject like literetur , polit , or music . so , inord for the student to be more sociabl and to take more experi in life , he must have knowleg about ani field . the student in the univers must take cours in the univers that are not relat to hi major . for exampl , if the student 's major is physic , he should take music cours or philosiph cours in order to make hi knowledg not restrict onli in physic . so , he can make convers with hi friend about music and art . and if he set in a societi and talk with older peopl who have more experi in life than him , he will look veri intellectu . he benifet from that by have more friend and by make relat with big number of peopl . mani peopl think that the student must focu in one subject that will reflect hi futur and hi career , but i think it is better for a student to have knowledg about a varieti of topic . throughout my educ i took mani cours like music and art andi find it benefit .
