i disagre with the follow statement becaus i think that nowaday the car is most import for life and the peopl do n't make a step back . moreov i think the design of a car is improv of the 100 % and the innov in thi sector is in a great improv . so the innov is most impor in the world and the case- car improv your gain to make a new car , and for thi reason i think that for the nex twenti year there will a lot of car in the world . i think that twenti year are few to chang the situat , if onli there will some problem who can will danger for uman life thi statement will be real . for sure i think that a uman life of nowaday are depend of a car in fact if one peopl must go at work and if must few km for exampl one km , take a car and , for thi reason the car in the world improv . if we look around w can wacth all day mani car in the citi or in a villag and as the statist test demonstr the number of a car grown in the world . certanelli i think that the problem of the environment is mani too , but do n't all the peopl understand thi problem . to solv thi problem the peopl must use too bu or train to move but thi is imposs now . in anoth word i think that a number of a car improv becaus the peopl do n't undertand a problem who can caus at the environment , and i think that the progress will be continu . in fact there is mani other reason becaus be improv a product of a car , one of thi is a global who make a world gener when the market tend to produc a lot of product so in thi case are the car . to sum up i think that in onli twnti year the car will not decreas , and onli the big problem of the environment will can chang thi situat .
