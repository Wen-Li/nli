the statement , that advertis tend to be too euphor regard the product valu or effectiv , is an ofter heard observ from peopl consum today massmedia . the reason for a compani to spend money on an advertis is to make the product known to the public and to compet with their competitor on the market . if the advertis is made for a new and innov product , it is more like a realist view of the product abil , than it is in case the product ha to compet in a dens market of similar product . in the later case the consum is alredi affect by the advertis of other compani or even own experi and therefor less like convinc by a new product . depend on the market situat the product is face , the advertis ha to be choosen by the advertis . the statement , i am refer to , should be made more specif , as a gener view on advertis is not possibl in my oppinion . anoth reason whi advertis can seem to be much to confid in a product valu but actual are not , is the set or stori told in the advertis . a vacuumclean in front of a beauti landscap is somth differ from the same vacuumclean in a wardrob . the product is the same onli the viewer connect to the advertis product vari . sometim it is the consum imagin that lend him to the conclus that advertis are promot a unrealist pictur of a product and not the advertis itself . in the case of product intend to be use by a veri young usergroup ( kid or teen ) the advertis are more likli to present a better pictur of the advertis product that realiti would allow them to . the young consum are more easili affect by such campaign than older consum , who tend to be more careful when relay on advertis . the gener understand that advertis ca n't tell the truth is wrong in my view , though the techniqu to present a product in a better light as it realli is , is definetli in everi advertis toolbox .
