when you are do studi , you are confront with a lot of fact , and also with idea , and specif concept , either you are studi biolog or literatur , or philosophi . we could wonder what , for a student , is more import : is it understand idea and concept or learn fact ? right from the begin , we could answer that what is realli import is both to understand concept and idea , and to learn fact , that is to say learn to understand both to the light of each other . actual , we could think that understand a concept doe n't mean anyth if you do n't have ani fact to link it with . if you just have a concept , but no fact , it serv for noth to know thi concept . nevertheless , if i had to choos between both , as a student , i would argu that it is more import to learn to understand idea and concept , dure your cours , at the univers . i would say that becaus in my opinion you have less chanc to encount concept and idea and to understand it in your person life than in univers . univers is the place you could learn about difficult notion and where a teacher could explain them to you and develop them , wherea you could learn fact on your own , read newspap , listen to the radio or read book . yet , i would add that it is import to learn fact , so as to improv on your knowledg , which ca n't be compos of concept and idea , sinc it is alway import to know , for instanc , import date of the histori , if you are an student in histori , or import formul if you are a student in biolog , or the date a writer wrote an import novel and the polit and cultur context in which he wrote it , if you are a student in literatur .
