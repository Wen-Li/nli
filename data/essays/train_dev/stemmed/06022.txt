know a lot of academ subject or just know one specif subject . if you want to be call intelig , you should learn a lot of academ subject becaus you migh fit in everi convers , but if you want to be the kind of person that is recon for what they know , you should learn just one academ subject . if you decid to be the intellig guy , you stare learn a lot of subjest , so you migh look brilliant , but in the other hand , when you learn that much , you are just do that becaus you want to be the brilliant guy , the one that know everyth , not the one that love what he do . howev , if you chose to be the guy that learn just one subject you migh love , what you do , and you would be realli happi . but unfortun you migh not look as brilliant as the guy that choos to learn a lot of subject becaus when it came to have a convers , you mayb do n't know what to talk about it . althouth , when it came about somenth respect to your subject , everybobi would be surpric to see how much do you know , and you migh develop a invent about your subject becaus you know a lot about it . in conclucion i think that it is better to learn one subject realli good than learn 100 subject badli , becaus if we think about all the invent that have been made for peopl that know everyth about the subject they are work on it , not jut a littl bit about everyth .
