when make refer to high school itself , it is much better to see a well-round transcript with bs and as in everi subject then to observ how a student had straight a+ in a certain subject , but fail in everi other class . the main point of academ subject and school it to keep challeng yourself , never cies to strive for the best and never feel satisfi with the least of what you can do . colleg are n't strive to recruit the a+ student that is n't commit to extra curricular activ , leadership and commun servic ; they 're search for the `` well-round student '' . of cours , if you can be a honor student , athlet and presid of the class at the same time , go right ahead ! but basic , everyon ha to learn to do a littl of everyth to achiev success in life . be perfect at art craft but pathet stupid at mathemat wo n't allow you to succeed becaus you will need someon to do all you do n't know how to . onc you think you 're perfect at a singl subject , you must find a way to challeng yourself to improv in it as well . sinc the world ha gotten so competit over the past decad , know absolut all there is to know about a singl subject wo n't get you far in life becaus it is more import to be `` a well - round person '' than perfect at a singl subject . to impress someon you have to denot your overal cultur knowledg and not onli your broad wisdom in histori , for exampl . to strive for the best , you have to know as much as possibl from everi academ subject . in my experi , it ha been imposs to be perfect at everi subject natur , but i find more satisfact in constantli strive to do my best and be well-round in school . an english teacher at school onc told me `` it is not necessari to be , but to pretent to be '' . when i first heard what he said i thought it wa inmor and an uneduc expect of life . think about those word and refer to it by previuo experi though , i conclud that what he said wa correct ; even though i did n't want him to be . if you can not find a way to be perfect in everi academ subject you must pretend to be . the way to `` pretend to be '' is to constantli rehears on be the best , strive for the best and give the best of your knowledg and will to that subject . soon , you will learn to love it , appreci it , enjoy it and acknowledg import fact out of it . in conclus , is it better to have broad knowledg on mani academ subject rather than special in one specif subject becaus that 's what life it all about : know a bit of everyth to be abl to surviv in thi competit world . everi person need to know a bit about math , scienc , art , literatur and histori in order to stand out in societi . someon who life onli reflect mathemat achiev will lack the intellig , or knowledg , to be abl to fullfil the rest of the activ in hi daili life .
