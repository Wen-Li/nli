the abov statement that is `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' it is not right . i disagre with thi statement . mani of the old peopl enjoy with thier life than younger . in the oldag the peopl have leav all the burden and they are spend their own interest work . infact younger have more respons and work in that age , sometim they ca n't enjoy becaus they dont want to loos their offici work . forexampl , long toor we want to go , in that time spend fifteen day of time for that , that is not suffici for all the younger . some of them are miss for thier own impert thing but old peopl are spend maximum time to that toor . not onli toor but also in daili thing . moreov , old peopl enjoy with children and play with them . they can act like a child like play criket , chess etc. they can enjoy thier own way . old peopl work in their young age and then take the rest in thi old age with their interest activ and abil . i conclud that , older peopl also enjoy . enjoy thing and way are differ but they can also enjoy . not young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . young peopl and old peopl can enjoy themselv in thier own way , style and adjust .
