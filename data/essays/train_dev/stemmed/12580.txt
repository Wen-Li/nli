in my think of way , it is more import for student to learn fact than to understand the idea and concept . there are two reason whi i believ that lear fact is more import than understand idea and concept . fisrt , if student dose n't know about the fact perfectli and onli understand about it cincept and idea , they would not know what the truth is . thi would make student confus when they enter social life after school and face the real situat which they onli understood ith concept . they could do well accrod what they have understood about , but if it is wrong what they have understood , they would fail at the moment . second reason whi i believ learn fact more import is the chang of the concept and idea about what they learn . the concept and idea about an object could chang as time go on . in other word , even though it learn the right concept and idea when they were student , the concept of an object could keep chang depend on the social environ , so what they have know will may not ture anymor . third , understand onli concept and idea is less effecet for make creativ for the student . if they understand of on object 's idea alreadi , they would believ that there is onli the idea for the object . then , they 'll lose a chanc to make their won idea and opinion about the object . therefor , in my opinion , it is more import to learn fact than understand onli concept and idea f
