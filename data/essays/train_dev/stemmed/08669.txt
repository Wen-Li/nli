i think , it is absolut necessari to understand the whole idea and the whole concept of a topic . on my opinion , onli then it is possibl the get the core and the intent of a topic . if student would onli learn singl fact , they would never receiv a complet pictur of a subject . they perman would have singl piec of inform but never a whole pictur , they would absolut lack an overview of everyth - like in a puzzl where some piec are miss . furthermor , all idea or concept themselv contain fact which are embed into them , so it is not even possibl to lern about an idea without learn - at least a few - fact . my experi ha shown that i have less problem to learn and to rememb both , the whole idea as well as import fact and detail , when i have understood the whole topic . i have tri to learn onli singl fact a few time , for exampl at math , a subject i am not veri good at . i onli learnt singl formula but had no idea about how all these formula work togeth in ani relationship . in those case i never got access to the deeper sens of the materia . anoth exampl i have alreadi experienc , wa when i had to learn a lot for the univers . especi in one manag cours there wa so much content dure the whole semest , i realli wa afraid i could not cope with . but at the end of the semest , when i had understood all idea of the content , all inform match and fit togeth nearli alon . i realli wa < in the topic > . so final i could use all inform i had to learn , becaus i knew what they were all about , i could categor them and use them in the right way . i am sure , thi would not have been possibl , if i onli had learnt the fact . summar , i think student get not onli a better , but also a wider knowledg by understand idea rather than singl fact .
