i mainli agre with the statement . advertis are present in such a profession way that they are abl to make costum believ they need excactli the product which is shown . advertis is made to show you everyth the product can do or how it chang your daili life in a veri posit manner . there is never shown a neg aspect . the key is , that advertis is mostli place at televis in the late even when the peopl are watch a show or a film and do not want to think about what they look at . so they do not think about all the neg aspect the product may have , they listen to the music , which is of cours perfectli chosen , they see imag of great landscap or happi famili so that they are in a veri posit mood . and that is just what the compani want their consum to be in , a posit mood , where you are more like to buy product of everi kind , even if you do not need them at all . furthermor , they are test with a small audienc befor they are releas so that the compani who invent the advertis can chang some kind of it if the test audienc critiz it a lot , so there is an improv kind of qualiti control . anoth aspect is , that the firm who produc the food or whatev ha to be advertis , doe not creat the advertis itself in most case . they engag a compani which is a speciallist in advertis and so they know everyth about what their consum want to see . at the end it is import that the statem includ not everi advertis ever made . there are big except from that rule , for exampl when you see a sauceg crash into a wall it doe not anim me to buy a safe car . and you must allway rememb that they onli creat an illus , when you buy the product just becaus of it advertis without compar it depend on real fact with other product , you will not have much fun with your new product . in conclus , i have to admit that advertis are influenc everybodi 's shop behaviour a lot becaus they are abl to present the product in a nearli perfect way .
