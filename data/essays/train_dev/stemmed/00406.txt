sinc i lack of experi in young peopl particip in other countri , let me focu the topic geograph . in colombia , young peopl involv into their commun is quit common . but , it is special clear to see in low class peopl . thi phenomena is not present in high class young , as it is in low class young . my opinion is , i think the young who particip help their commun and contribut to it develop are peopl who see that in their commun someth is miss and the think , they feel , they can do someth in order to improv some life condit . for instanc , a boy who like play footbal goe everi weekend to the field . onc he see it without grass , it can be that he encourag other peopl play with him to do someth for improv thi situat . then , they can collect some money from neighbor and buy the grass and fix a date to plant the grass and thi way the may have a better field . on the other hand , high class young peopl are not in touch with problem , becaus most of the time they are alreadi solv by their parent . so they do not feel the need to fix someth becaus everyth around them is fix . besid , their prioriti lie on studi , parti and some other aspect of life that do not includ their commun . also , somehow their good econom situat make them more individu , lose in some way the communitiy sens . take the same exampl like abov , a rich boy goe play footbal in the social club , where hi parent have some share . thi club will have for sure an excel field with recent cut , soft grass . so thi boy will not worri about grass . he probabl will worri about wether he will use the sauna or not , and if he will go to the pool with their colleagu after the game . the situat illustr is a common exampl of everyday life and a differ way to see it depend on the observ . for peopl who like to particip , commun sens is veri import . peopl who do not , simpli do not mind .
