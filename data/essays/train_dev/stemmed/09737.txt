in my opinion , say that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun , is a veri pesimist statement . it rather sound to me as an exagger of the realiti . there are some hide aspect concern to thi topic which i want to mension in order to discuss thi topic . if you compar young peopl nowaday to the young peopl in last year , you will gain the impress that peopl are more and more engag in activ , which keep them busi . nowaday , young peopl are more and more involv in activ to enhanc their educ state in order to remain competet for get a job . the market in our sociti nowaday request more and more profit and highli qualifi peopl in order to follow the stream of high technolog . given that the circumst and requir to ensur your and your famili life ha chang so drastic , there is much less time to help commun . apparantli , although young peopl are enthausiast in help their commun , there will be no enough time to invest for thi goal . therefor , i would say that the intent for help ha not chang compar to last year , rather the competit among peopl and the circumst make it unposs more difficult for young peopl to invest time for help their commun . keep thi reason in mind , i would say that thi statement is overgener and should not be evalu as true in thi form . we should observ and studi the circumst of individu to make sure if the less readi for help ha characterist reason or is it realli becaus of circumst which make it not possibl . then , we should be abl to make a better suggest concern thi topic which is made from empir observ .
