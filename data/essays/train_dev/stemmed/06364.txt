i agre with that , it is more import for studet to understand idea and cocept thanit is for them to learn fact . i believ in thi becaus i think the idea and the concept of anyth is more import than the fact especi in some subject like technolog , philosphi , mathmet , becau here you have to anali the fact use the idea and the conept . so that the indea and the concept are import to understand and anali the fact it self . first , most of the subject that we are stude in the school are base on fact , but our understand for thi subject will not complet if we do n't know the concept and the idea about thi fact . for instanc if we are stude acours about the structur of the air plane , here we are studi the fact of the air plan , but if we also studi the idea whi we are use thi materi or put thi thing in thi place thi will give us have a wider view about the mechanism how we could make the air plane fli with the most perfict and effici way . for exampl we use the aluminium instead of iron to made the skeleton of the air paln becaus it is lighter . thi is an import concept we should know it about the structur of air plane , second the idea and the concept is more import than the fact in analys the mathemat problem . if we want to soliv ani problem we have to know the idea and the concept of thi problem . if we onli know the fact we will never reach the solut . becaus in mathemath we depend on the fact as well as on the idea and the concept to analyi these fact . final , concept and idea are import in our life philosphi . philosphi of life is depend on fact . but we need to underst the concept of thi fact . for exampl , there is a fact in our life is that everi one of us should get marri , but we have to understand the concept and the idea of marrig . here the concept is more import becaus we should get marri not just becus it is a natur desir but becaus the human bieng is a social anim and must live with a partner and ha a children in order to be happi .
