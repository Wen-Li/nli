i think success can be achiev in differ way , not onli by take risk and chanc . in the come paragraph , differ point will be state and discuss in order to properli analyz the statement given . first of all , success can be a rel term , becaus for some it may mean own a privat jet and have million of dollar , but for other success could simpli be have a good , small busi that maintain their famili and give them a decent life . not everybodi want the same thing , some just want to live a quiet , normal life and noth more . take a risk is a possibl , but never a sure thing . also , it 's difficult to achiev succ in life , sinc it requir mani abil from a person . there are mani key ingredi involv in the process of mayb achiev success . it take hard work , dedic , be fulli prepar and intellig . usual peopl do n't acheiv success by accid . it take year and year , and sometim that is not enough . just becaus a person ha all those ingredi doe n't guarante them a bright futur full of rich . most peopl have work hard all their life but have n't gotten anywher they want to go . anoth import point is the fact that succ can be achiev by do what a person alreadi know how to do well . sometim it 's as simpl as that . to work hard at you 're craft and make smart move can equal take you toward success . for exampl , if a person studi econom and end up work at the nycs , he can achiev a fortun by just put to work all those year of studi he did in colleg or univers . by just appli hi knowledg to the stock market and make smart choic , he can becom rich , but he can also lose it all . it 's not so much about risk but about make smart choic . in conclus , i would like to be clear that while mani peopl have taken risk and tri new thing in order to achiev succ , where some have won mani more have fail . success is never a sure thing , and even if a person achiev it , the possibl still exist that it wo n't last for long . onc you get to the top , the onli other way to go is down , sicn it 's not onli difficult to reach the top but to be abl to stay there . so in the end i do n't agre with the statement given . noth in life is certain , onli death and tax .
