in my opinion , i think it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than the other . the reason whi i prefer thi one is that if someon is special in one specif subject , i think thi person is quit bore person . let say he know veri wel about the anim in the sea and whenev you meet with them . he talk onli about thing that he is good at and nothingels . as i am a listen of him , i would have veri bore time . on the other hand , if you know broad knowledg of mani academ subject , peopl who talk with think that you are veri smart . you dont have to talk that much but littl bit of inform about mani thing . that all you need . usual listen dont tri to argu with you , unless they are profession of what you are talk . of cours it is also good to special in one specif subject . especi if you are teacher or doctor , anyon who teach or give advic . then the one specif subject would be veri valuabl . actual both person are valuabl and better than know noth becaus you know someth at least . i had one friend who wa usual quiet . but when i let him talk about car , he didnt stop talk until i chang the topic . he wa so interest in car and he like to spent hi time for car .
