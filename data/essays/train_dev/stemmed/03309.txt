i think advertis give us a differ imag of a product . thi is possibl becaus advertis alway manag to affect our mind and our imagin through televis and newspap . they modifi our percept of a product buld an entir world around a simpl object . when we watch an add on the tv , we never pay attent to what is advertis . we are caught by slogan and imag . sometim we do n't even see the product itself be show . so , we just remeb the name of the firm and sometim the catchi melodi that accompani the add . televis usual advertis brand , not product . that 's way we may not get a proper idea of what we are go to buy . in newspap product are often advertis by movi or sport star . in that case , we stare at the pictur of the star and do n't notic the product . we associ that good to a charact of the show busi . in thi way we do n't care of what we intend to buy , but whom we are go to look like after we bought it . we look at imag , not good . both pictur and tv commerci are now made by veri famou artist . we are attract to the advertis for themselv . it seem to me that the more an advertis is tempt and promis , the more talent is requir to hide the real natur of the object . the beauti of an add obscur our idea of the product . advertis are aim to built a web around a product . a chain of associ that must influenc our behavior as consum . to make us buy someth that mayb we are not go to like and enjoy . televis , internet and newspap all offer a great and profit way to accomplish thi goal .
