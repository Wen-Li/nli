i disagre with thi statement . at the biggen if a person have a broad knowledg of mani academ than he will know mani thing but the problem is that he can not do or work in a spesif topic . that person will have onli vagu idia about mani topic , and that mean that he can not do a spesifiqu thing . in the other hand if a person is more special in one specif subject it will be better for him . that person who is special in one topic will know all the side of hi subject , and will be a profesin on that subject so he can work on that specif subject and be good . her is an exampel of to brother the first know hi work in a veri big compani and the second one is still look . how he becom like that ? the answear is that the first one wa work hard on hi specif subject and gott hi degre after a normal time of work and the second one wa not sure of what he want and and keept chang topic each year . will that lead him to no work , rach time he tri to get a job he is not veri inform on the topic . i dont say that it bad to know mani subject , no it good to have a gener idia on mani subject , but in order to secss in life you will need to to be special in one specif subject . thi is my person view there are peopl who will agre with me and other who want and i respect their point of view . peopl are veri worri about there futter so it better to be special in one specif suject , and after if you have time learn more . in conclus i say that to be special in one topic is better than to have broad knowledf of mani academ subject .
