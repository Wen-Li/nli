young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . is thi statement right or not ? i think it is quit difficult to answer thi question . if i think of my grandmoth , wa she realli more involv in their commun ? it is possibl that at the time , when my grandmoth wa young , kid and teenag may have done more for their commun . for exampl peopl in these day organis event for the whole commun , they were togeth in a social commun and help each other , wherev they could . but thi statement can be made for all peopl of my grandmoth villag , not onli for young peopl . on the other side my grandmoth and also the other children in her age had to work a lot at home and on the field . so they did not have a lot time to spend togeth or to do thing for their commun . furthermor i think nowaday young peopl are also social activ . it depend more , where they are live . in rural societi , in a small villag for exampl , the connect between the inhabit is much closer , than in urban area . in a big citi , in zurich for exampl , peopl do not spend a lot of time in help other . as bigger a citi is the more individu and isol peopl are . thi do not have enough time and also not enough connect with other . and the consequ of thi individu and thi isol is that peopl , expeci young peopl , are not integr in the whole societi , they have onli their peer , but they are not much connect with , or relat to peopl form differ age or differ social and educ background . thi peopl do not even think about help their commun . but that is not their problem , that is the problem of the whole societi and the differ between urban and rural life .
