to answer thi question it is import to figur out the reason whi young peopl support their commun . mostli the younger peopl join group to have peopl around to enjoy the time with friend . thi can happen in the church commun , sport club or just for hang loos . especi activ in church tri to teach the younger one how import it is to e.g. help peopl with disabil . but becaus of the increas of the media consumpt , especi tv , commun activ are be told to be `` uncool '' . it is more import to be individu and gain your own popular . anoth reason can be that peopl loos trust in their govern . they feel the pressur which last on them if they want to have success in their life . so they tri to get the best for their own advanc . as well when the peopl recognis that govern member who should serv the public think it is more import to fill their own pocket . thi can have the effect that peopl turn to be more egoist . especi becaus of the new inform era the peopl are awar of the selfish of some govern member . as well they are told about the risk in life everi day in the news . i think thi constant pressur and the lack of honesti ha lead to the point that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . but with the societi be awar of that matter , chanc ar not bad that a new way of think and act can be taught . so you can see a lot of effort be taken from media and govern to emphas thi problem and to point out how import it is to serv the commun . hopefullli thi will lead modern societi to a turn point where serv is someth good an ha not to be `` uncool '' .
