i agre to the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun for three reason ; too busi to particip , prioriti in help their commun is veri low , and fact that exist of commun itself is question . first , the young peopl do not devot their time for help their commun becas they are simpli too busi . there are thing they need to do in order for their dream to come true . for exampl , i put in a time in my acadm work in order to achiev enough grade to be accept to the univers i wish for . on top of thi , i particip in three differ sport team , so that the univers knew that i wa an activ member of school . and on top of thi , i had attend to the sat prep cours to maxim my score . i just did n't have time to spend time in the commun volunt . secondli , the young peopl 's prioriti are usual in differ direct , so that they do n't even pay attent in help their commun . i sure wa not a kind of teenag to give up my time to help communit instead of go out with a girl who i like . the rang for the definit `` young peopl '' is some what ambigu , but it veri like that peopl in their teenag choos their privat and person life over help their commun . the reason is veri simpl ; they like privat life better and feel excit . lastli , the young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun , becaus young peopl ca n't find the commun itself . it 's not just young peopl , who ca n't find commun , i believ peopl nowaday do not reli on commun at all , that their exist might have been forgotten . especi in the citi life , it 's possibl for someon to not to interact with anyon or anyth to retain your lifestyl .
