i disagre with the statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' when peopl were young , they have a lot of dream . `` i wanna be an astronam , a teacher , a musician , a painter '' , and so on . they have a lot of dream . so , they make effort , compet with other . in that age , they have no idea to die , even though commit suicid . their life is fullfil with joy , delight , hope , or the futur . for financi ground , they have not to feed their child ( of cous , they have no child ! ) , they have not to cook , they have not to , they have not to , ... they can onli do what they want !! when they get adult , they must work . thi is the most import , and relact thing . peopl say `` enjoy work '' , but they say that becaus they have no way out from bore life . get old mean know what who do not want to . so , i agre the statement `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' thank for toefl ibt !
