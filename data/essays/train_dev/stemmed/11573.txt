in the last hundr year the world commun are chang a lot . the behavior of the younger peopl is caus by these chang and i think there are help much more than the most elder peopl belief . first of all we think about the valu the younger peopl are judg with bee less useful than other gener . the most import argument for a wide rang of peopl is the behavior in face of the famili . famili chang a lot , especiali in the western part of the world . in past time everi gener of the famili wa live at one place , for poorer peopl could be not even a place mayb it wa a room . there were not ani social system to help them . there for the famili member care for each other much more than the state could do . nowertim the question of care for each other is conect with the societi as stongli as it is conect to famili . the number of the famili member dimish strongli . there are today less young peopl and more old peopl than in earlier time , becaus of medic invent . in germani for exampl the pension system is work between gener . the work peopl are pay the pension for the older peopl . the problem of pension in futur is base on the demogaf relat of young and old part of the societi . the younger peopl mabe do not care for there parent themself , mayn they pay other peopl , who care for them . but acctual they pay a lot for the pension of peopl they not even know . addit young peopl in germani are help their commun much more than anoth gener ha ever done , becau they are pay a system that will not benefit themself , so they have to care for their own futur as well . final youngr peopl are less secur in the develop of the societi as the older gener are and that for there have to care for themself and other peopl too . mayb that is the reason , whi some peopl think nowerday young peopl are not help their commun , but they do it as much as they can .
