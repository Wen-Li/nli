i am 24 year old and a student , so i have not so much money and i am unsur about what the futur will bring . therefor i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . one reason for my disagr is the perspect for the futur , which differ between younger and older peopl . younger peopl usual do not have concret plan for their futur . therefor it is difficult to realli enjoy life , becaus one alway think about what the futur will bring . i know these problem when i have to decid wether to spend a lot of money for a new comput , an enjoy for me , or better save the money . due to the reason that i do not know wether i will get a job , it may be better not spend so much money . older peopl mostli have a job and spend the money will not have such a big import . anoth reason whi older peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl do , is their opportun to spend more money for certain activ they enjoy . for exampl i would enjoy learn how to fli a plane , but i do not have enough money to take cours . older peopl may have enough money to learn how to fli a plane and therefor can enjoy in do so . besid these exampl , enjoy may also mean to have a wife and children . thi is someth gener older peopl have . so from my situat today , i look forward to have my own famili and i think i will enjoy it . the reason and exampl abov show , that older peopl may have less problem concern money . they also may have a familiy and may be abl to perform cost intens activ they like . in contrast to that , younger peopl do not have these possibl and often have to think about their futur . therefor i think that older peopl can enjoy and do enjoy their life more than younger peopl do . so i am look to the futur and think that i will enjoy my life when i am older .
