im strongli disagre with the statement as i iknow old pepopl and young peopl the can enjoy in defer way accord to their age and their abil . there are mani thing old peopl can enjoy do for exampl go to cinema or go to park with famili . i think some old peopl they did not agre to go out or they are unabl to do so but if we are encourang them to do that they will . in addit the children should treat there parent in a polit way so that they can enjoy their remain life even though they are old that is not an excuis to deal with them in a bad way or to keep them away from comun . furthermor some peopl may not be veri good with there parent that whi the old peopl may refus to enteract with other and the prefer to be aion rether than go out and enjoy thersself in some countri the gover provid a special place for the old peopl to leav especiali for those who do not have the place to leav and it may contain alot of function that creat for them to take off there worri and bore that is a good thing and also there is a special place that buil and design for the old and disabbl peopl to move easili . in conclus i think everi one right to enjoy there life and it not setel
