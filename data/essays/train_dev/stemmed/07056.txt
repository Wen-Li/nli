in my opinion , young peopl realli enjoy their life more than older peopl do . as we see some exampl , we can figur out how much young peopl enjoy their life . use those exampl , we can gener young peopl . young peopl have enough time and healthi , so they can tri mani thing which they want to do . for instanc , if old peopl want to do sky junp , they usual can not do that becaus their bodi is veri weak , but young peopl can do that without wor about physic problem . besid , if old peopl want to travel whole world , it will take a lot of energi , but old peopl can not deal with that . on the contrari , young peopl can do that well . usual , old peopl have their children and famili , so they have to protect them against poverti . even though old peopl want to travel and have break , they can not take that , becaus if they take break to enjoy life , they will lose their job , so they can not enjoy their life more than young peopl , for they have repons for their famili . young peopl , they realli have enough time to enjoy their life . when youhg peopl tri to do someth to enjoy life , unfortunratt , sometim they could get in hard situat . they have to spend lot of time to escap from that situat . through that experi , they can learn someth and improv themselv . howev , if old peopl tri to do new somet so as to enjoy their life , and they get into hard situat , they will not recov their life becaus they don not have enough time unlik young peopl . from abov exampl , i agre wtih the mention that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . it wa complet from object exampl that i suggest in the write .
