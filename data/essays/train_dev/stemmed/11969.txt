i do not believ that in twenti year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . mani factor contribut to my belief . these factor includ the current state of drive , current driver and develop in the area of drive . through thi investig , it will be shown whi i disagre with the statement . the current state of drive today , is one that ha morph sever time , to reach where it is at . befor car ever exist , peopl found other way of transport such as boat and hors . the gener aim wa to be transport or transport item from place to place . the first car that wa produc , revolution the transport system . peopl becam more time effici in reach where they want to arriv at . technolog advanc are made everyday , so as car start to becom faster , peopl start to lose sight of the purpos of a car . now faster car constitut faster driver . peopl now place more import on the pleasur of speed and perform stunt , rather than get to where they need to be . thi state of drive ha an effect on the driver . today , we find that more adolesc are interest in car than befor . as young adult , they enjoy extrem and risk , and the young age at which they are grant a licens doe not help . most accid in my countri of bahrain are attribut to speed of young peopl , and the fact that the mortal rate increas each year , seem to have no effect whatsoev . now , for a driver seek an adrenalin rush and a live on the edg attitut , the right technolog ha to be develop . as i mention befor , car today are faster and technolog better than befor . we should acknowledg that advanc will not ceas , and if we take other life factor into consider , we see that car are demand and are need even more . as job requir relat to car chang , so do car expect . new road are alway be built and so faster , more reliabl car need to be engin accord to the newli built road . no matter what is done to reduc car usag , such as increas the age requir , or invest in other mode of transport , i believ that peopl can not give up on car due to the privaci and effici it provid . logic speak , if the world progress we go forward , not backward , and so in conclus , forward to me mean more car and not less .
