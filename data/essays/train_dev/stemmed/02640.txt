be a young person i believ that in today 's profession world young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun , as they prefer their profesion life ha a domin role in their life . now day life is get veri profession as compar to earlier day . earlier , peopl use to work till the even and after that they go somewher around with their friend , parent , famili but now day the work pressur is so much that they dont have time to even take a proper sleep . accord to the recent survey work peopl especi age between 23 to 40 could not sleep for even 8 hour a day which the doctor advic one should atleast sleep in a day . earlier peopl treat templ and church as the place where they believ that god live and they can be relax and make themselv calm but nowday peopl treat those holi place as a picnic spot where they can go with their children and enjoy . nobodi want to work like mahatma gandhi . there are mani ngo 's which are work for the welfar of the commun but no one join them rather no young person join them , you can find most of the retir person who are work there as an offic becaus they dont pay you much . today young peopl want to achiev the higher goal as to earn more money . higher they will go in their compani higher the remuner willl be . for eg.an employe of a compani can work there for 18 hour in a day but if he is be ask to work for a ngo or ani social commun then he will defin say big no to it as it will not be higli payabl as he is get in the compani after consid all the fact i believ that young peopl want their life to be the most succes profession not for the welfar of the commun in which they live in .
