some peopl might think that it is more import for student to learn fact , while other think understand idea and concept are more import . in my opinion , howev , know idea and concept are much valueabl than just learn fact . i agre with the statement for two reason , if understood idea and concept , the student could use the theori in other aspect when studi variou happen not onli in their academ studi , but also in ordinari live . and the student might think more logic . firstli , understand idea and concept will help the student about the relat factor . they can use the theori they have learn in mani area . for exampl , scienc knowledg can be happen in our real life . in the kitchen , in the garag , in the play ground , and so on . if the student have understood about some variou theori they can understand the happen that they have seen . like newton theori ; the object usual fall to the ground , easi scientif knowledg like , if ice melt it get into liquid . .. etc . and they can deal with it when emerg situat , too . secondli , just learn fact would interrupt student when think logic . student those who get use to memor fact will have a hard time when they have to solv logic problem . for instanc , especi to those who are in languag major student are mostli get use to memor . i heard that professor in chines languag cours warn to the student practic think logic , unless they will have hard time when they go into some compani . to sum up , it is essenti for student to get the idea and concept than just memor and learn fact . so that the student can get knowledg which can be relat to our ordinari life , and could think ration . that is whi i agre with the statement .
