i agre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . it ha lot of advantag like u do n't need to be panick in a foreign countri , the tour guid will direct you to all worth sight seeign place and provid you the background inform about the same . the comfort and secur offer while travel with a group is better than travel on your own . . u build new friendship and see differ facet of life . moreov the cost of the trip are realtiv less sinc most of the guides/oper have tie up with diffrent resort , transport compani etc . .. it give a better deal for the consum . your trip is organ and ani problem aris can be dealt by the guid sinc he is a season and experienc in the trip . howev , there are few disadvantag even . we may/may not get individu attent dure the trip by the guid . if he ha mani tourist under him . sometim a consum may also feel that he is not gettign a raw deal i.e. not a good deal and it expens becaus the tour oper margin ( commis ) will be ad to the packag cost . immateri of the disadvantag , i feel that the best way to travel is ina group led by a guid sinc you tend to enjoy more and ani hassl realt to foreign exchang visa etc are dealt with effectivey etc . . anyway , as the say goe , `` the more the merrier ''
