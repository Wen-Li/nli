i strongli hope so ! i am rather stuf by the contin hear of noisi car , the pollot they produc and the stress they increas in peopl all the day . i think that the number of car must be reduc for a lot of reason of ani kind . there are too mani car in city : i m think of all the time i have been block in traffic , i m think at the stress that produc a situat like been in a jungl of clacson sound , peolp that insult each other with no reason , all the import appoint posticip . .. car are expens : sinc the car ha began a statu symbol it price ha risen enorm . and the more peopl continu buy the car at ani price the more the price will rise air pollut is caus by car : have you ever ask yourself _ `` how doe it cost all the public work to clean the build of the city from the thick dark layer of smog that cover them ? '' , or `` how dose it cost to restor the street everi two year ? '' the public transport can be more efficiet and less stress : i think that public transport are the oni solut to the problem of the car . we offcours can not avoid to travel , we need to , we onli have to consid more effici way to move . the most importan featur of public tranport is that the allow mani peopl to travel at the same time with a grate maxim of the result at the same price . furthermor there are new technolog that use not energi that involv pollut such as solar energi , wind energi and so on . i think that futur must go in thi direct to have a safe life for us and for futur gener .
