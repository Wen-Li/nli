i think understand idea are import to student . what is the job of student ? it is learn . teacher have to teach student and student have to understand what teacher say , but not everi student understand what teacher lectur . then , what should student do ? first , they have to tri to understand again by textbook or note and if they still did not get mean from them then go to ask friend for help or ask teacher for help , and mayb they will understand what teacher taught at that time , but they still can not do some problem if they did not understand idea . i took math class befor , and i can understand math so i do not have ani problem with that but i have some friend that they can not understand math and i alway taught them and they could do the problem at that time , but they could not do well with the test . whi they could not do well with the test ? i think it is becaus they do not get ani idea from math . they just understand how to do the problem when i teach them , but test will chang the style and they will panic with that and they did not know how to solv it becues they did not get the idea from math so they could not do by themselv and if they did not get the idea , they never get good grade with math so i taught them to understand idea . it wa realli difficult to do , but they got good grade at the end . in conclus , i agre with the statement . i know it is realli import to understand an idea , so it is the best to understand idea , and when i studi , i alway tri to understand what is it talk about and tri to get the idea from the lectur .
