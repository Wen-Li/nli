at school , in each subject , we learn differ thing and the way to learn it can be differ . in histori , for instanc , we learn more fact than we have to understand some process wherea in biolog understand idea and concept is the base of the cours . i am convinc that is import and more interest to understand some idea and concept but i think that is equal import to learn fact . first of all , i think that is interest and challeng to understand some idea and concept we may provid a consider concentr and it may take a long time we should have some difficulti as the result when we understand it , it providd some satisfact . for exampl , i rememb when i wa at high school in a chemistri class , we had to analys and understand how plant can do the photosynthesi . it appear difficult but it wa interest and it motiv me to find thi process . when i understood it , i wa satisfact . although it seem to be veri interest , it is also import to leran fact even if it could be bore . in a nutshel , it 's equal import to learn fact and to understand idea .
