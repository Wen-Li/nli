thi statement might be true to some except peopl but the common success peopl do not take risk . first it is difficult to defin success . it may appli for money , celebr or just happi ( even if hope thi three thing can work togeth . .. ) some success peopl do take risk and tri new thing becaus their succ comfort them and they know that somehow they have a sort of safeti net . peopl who put their life or money at stake is realli rare . for exampl , a person who own a prolif busi might take a risk by launch a new product but he never put hi whole money in it . or at least not unless he know he can alway get back on hi feet with a stabl product or a plan b. and thi argument should explain whi `` unsuccess '' person will not take to much risk . surprisingli these person dare take more risk sinc they do not have too much , or less , to lose . unfortun , most of the success peopl is coward and prefer to keep do thing they know . they sort of `` stew '' in their own success . one of the main reason is that `` normal '' , someon ha to work hard to reach the top with a planifi goal . except celebr nowaday , you are not bump to the successful categori . it take time , effort and sacrifici ( just tri to be happi ) . so whi would someon take risk ? the onli reason would be that success is bore and in order to dynam it you have to make some chang that can be radic or not . but you may also fall into someth even duller . .. to conclud , i do not agre with thi statement , probabl becaus i am a part of the coward . one of the main reason is that success is hard to maintain , so onc you have it whi take the risk to loos it for someth wors ?
