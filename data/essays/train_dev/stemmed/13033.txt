it 's easier to learn fact than understand the idea and concept which gener them . while some student may think it 's more import to understand idea ; other prefer focus onli on fact . in my opinion , it 's worth it to tri to deal with idea and concept . idea and concept allow us to understand the reason of what happen in our world . fact are onli a result of someth and never provid enough inform . when a student focu on idea and concept , he will understand much easier new event . in my opinion , focus on fact is too restrict and doe n't provid ani new abil . when i wa litll , my physic teacher wa alway explain us the reason whi someth happen . it wa hard in the begin but i develop the will to work in a research depart . the last but not least , it 's just more interest to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . when we learn fact we probabl do n't understand the mean of the event . student who are lazi will choos to learn fact without understand the concept around . i have alway thought it is pretti bor to tri to rememb by heart someth becaus i just do n't understand . i did it when i wa in histori class . i tri to rememb everyth and just gave it to my teacher dure the exam . when i begin to understand idea and concept behind those fact , i wa abl to learn more inform . in conclus , it seem obviou that it 's more worth it for student to deal with idea and concept than it 's for them to learn fact . the opportun to provid more abil in understand other subject and the interest to be abl to learn more are two main reason .
