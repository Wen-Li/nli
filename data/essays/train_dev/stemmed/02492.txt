in gener i would not agre on the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . obvious , it is necessari to learn some fact at the begin of your carreer . you can not understand idea concern math when you do not know that 1 plu 1 result in 2 . but i think it should not be the primari aim of our educ to learn fact becaus the world ha to be develop by us in the futur , too . thi is not possibl when someon for exampl just learn the theori of albert einstein by heart , shut down hi book and begin with someth new . he ha to learn it and then he can start to think about it . pose some question concern the theori - talk to other student to get to know their opinion about it and afterward creat hi or her own idea which are base on hi knowledg . perhap thi process could end up in a new product combin the learn fact and the own new idea . as a conclus it is in my point of view as import for student to understand idea and concept as to learn the basic fact . thi statement can also be connect to other topic of our societi than math of physik . we all know , that the most import fact is to realiz an idea if it is done . thi is definit imposs when you are not abl to speak the other languag . you need to learn fact ( the foreign languag ) and afterward you can share your own idea with everyon . by thi way it can sure be realis . so you can say , that there are two basic exist - the learn process and the creat process and for the biggest success both have to be combin in the most effici way . everi student should have basic knowledg in sever topic and the more knowledg you have , the better you can understand exist idea and creat your own one .
