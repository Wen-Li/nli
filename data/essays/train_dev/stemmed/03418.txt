to tell the truth , i do not think that concept are more import than fact . to my mind , both of them are signific and essenti in a student 's train . first at all , i am convinc that understand concept and idea are realli import for a student . inde , learn fact can becom veri useless and it is imposs to understand those fact without understand their origin . theori is essenti in a student 's train and a student can not devot hi time on fact he can not understand . howev , if a student onli learn concept , he rapidli ha troubl liken experi and theori . consequ , i think it is veri import to learn fact for mani reason . first , when a student learn fact , he can on the one hand , learn a situat , and on the other hand the mistak made dure thi situat . furthermor , gener knowledg is essenti . first , in order to have hi own opinion concern a topic , and then , to liken those fact to an experi . for exampl , i am major in materi . i have learnt a lot of fact concern differ microstructur , and when i carri out an experi , i can observ a microstructur i can easili liken to what i have learnt befor . as a consequ , i think that in order to understand the theori , it is essenti to learn fact . concept are essenti in a student 's train but a student can not make the most of those concept if he can not liken them to an experi . furthermor , gener knowledg is essenti to have hi own opinion about a topic . to conclud , concept and fact are not contrari notion . a student will be well educ insofar as hi educ draw a parallel between an understand of idea and concept , and the fact which aris from those concept .
