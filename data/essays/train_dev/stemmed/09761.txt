today , in the bachelor degre of the univers , mani peopl take the doubl major and tri to pursu the variou aspect of academ subject . although i graduat from onli one major of bachelor degre , i believ that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . first , by have mani academ subject , one can acquir not onli broad knowledg but also the wider scope of opinion and way of think from mani subject . to sepcial in one subject may lead he or she have the narrow mind or way of think and may have difficulti to accept differ opinion sinc he or she concentr into one subject . second , by have mani subject , one may not get bore with the subject he or she take dure the univers . when one goe to school , school life is a big part of everyday life . on one hand , if he or she concentr into one subject , it can be bore after year . on the other hand , if he or she have varieti of subject in school , topic of studi chang and it may be more interest to studi . third , if one ha taken mani academ subject or doubl ( or more ) major , it must be easier to get a job after the graduat . one ha more academ experi to write about in resum and he or she can appli to more varieti of job . howev , to special in one specif subject is more suitabl for peopl who want to be specialist in the busi . in conculs , the varieti of knowledg result in peopl to have wider understand and way of think by the background of mani academ subject peopl studi in school .
