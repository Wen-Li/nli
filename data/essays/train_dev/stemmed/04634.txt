nowaday it 's clearli imposs to run away from advertis . at home or on the street , even when you drive a car you may see advertis on buse . it seem to be veri difficult to escap from it . but what are advertis made for ? usual they are made to attract peapl or to get their attent and finnali to sell the product which the advertis is made for . mani peapl complain about the way advertis is present . they see everi kind of advertis as an illus of good that in fact do n't repres what is said about them . but do advertis make product better then they realli are ? if you consid most of the advertis you may discov afterward that they do n't lie but they hide inform . for exampl in some advertis they claim that their yoghurt ha a lot of vitamin that make you healthi . unfortun the same yoghurt ha alo a lot of fat and ohter ingredi that can do harm your bodi . thi is a big problem for everi consum and for the govern as well becaus it is pretti diffucult to find a solut for it . you ca n't prohibit compani to do advertis . so the hidden inform will be exist also in the futur . furthermor advertis is seen as everyth that appear on screen that is shown between film or seri . so what about cigarett ? in germani for exampl cigarett are shown in advertis as a caus of cancer and a lot of other ill . thi is a kind of advertis that doe n't make the product better . it doe the opposit by show how harm cigarett are . nevertheless advertis is there to get peapl attent to buy a product . . how can you reach thi goal mani compani ask themselv . one option is advertis , and as there is so much competit compani have to invent fact that make it more interest . as we know that most thing said in advertis are not true we know that thi is just a stragey to catch the peapl eye and make them interest in their product . in my opinion it 's true that most advertis make product much better than they realli are . despit the except mention abov , advertis use wrong or differ fact to improv their product .
