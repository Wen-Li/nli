i strongli agre with the idea that it is more import for student to underst idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i am go to explain my agreement , base on the level of educ , in the next paragraph . first , student at the elementari and high school level need to understand basic theori befor they are in contact to the world as independ peopl . they must know about logic solut and good behavior . althought parent care for the develop of their children , school are a fundament part in the adquisit of basic knowledg . second , at the univers level , student are in a contini process of learn becaus everyon want a career . the understand of idea and concept is the most import for them in the adquisit of knowledg . althought learn by fact is import too , student gain more knowledg from idea and concept . that is the reason whi there are so mani univers and school around the world . student must enphas in theori rathen than in practic . they will practic later but they need to understand import point befor they enter to the work enviro . third , as graduat student , they should practic and learn fact , but the process of learn would be longer if they did not spend too much time befor understand idea and concept . it is true that peopl learn a lot from experi but it is also true that it take too much time for peopl who do not have the basic concept on their mind in order to appli them into the practic . as far as i am concern , i believ that it is more import for student to gain their knowledg by understand idea and concept . althought experi is import , thi process would be endur if student do not press attent to the theori .
