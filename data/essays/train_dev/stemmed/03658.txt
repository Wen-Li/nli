there is an enthusiast held discuss take place at the moment at my univers in heidelberg . student and professor are discuss if it would be better to have a more broad knowledg or if it is prefer to special dure the studi . i think that a special is better . one of the reason whi i think it is better to special is the profession career . peopl with higher qualif in a certain area usual earn more money than unskil or semi-skil worker . the higher your qualif , the higher your sallari . i studi translat and i know that onli translat with a special in a special area , like engin , account or medecin , have the opportun to find a job and earn some money . the second reason whi i am in favour of special is self-confid . i have made the experi that i am becom much more self confind when i have the feel of be an expert in someth . translat is a good exampl again . onli if i have learnt all the necessari vocabulari and all the grammar rule i feel compet and abl to do my job appropri . anoth reason to special is the life-long learn aspect . if i onc have a certain kowledg i should continu to learn , and thi is true for my whole life . if an engin , for instanc , need to work in a foreign countri he can still learn the appropri languag . but first of all , he need to be an engin . he still ha enough time to learn addit compet when he need them . i am absolut convinc that it is wright to continu with my translat studi befor i switch over to learn anyth els . i am sure that thi is the right way in order to earn my own money after univers and to feel self-confid in my everyday life . in addit , i can still learn thing in other scientif field when i have my univers degre . but to earn thi degre is the most import task for me at the moment .
