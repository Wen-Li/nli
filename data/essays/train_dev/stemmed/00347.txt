youngster and commun aid i believ the implic of young peopl in help their commun will vari from one countri to anoth . focus in my home countri , spain , i must say that i do agre in gener term with the statement propos . the declin in social concern that western countri like sapain are experienc is due , in my opinion , to two main factor : the improv in the qualiti of life of middl class famili and the reduct in the size of famili . spain ha chang a lot in the past thirti five year . while some decad ago we still had a consider proport of our popul live in condit of poverti , that is not the case anymor . middl class ha boost in spain and nowaday it is one of the countri with the most dispers distribut of wealth . in thi new situat there are less class differ and therefor the need of help the commun is not so evid to young peopl . anoth import social chang in spain ha been the dramat sreduct of averag famili size . thirti year ago there were veri seldom one-child famili in spain . today , thi is the most common situat of famili . one-child famili usual tend to over-protect the lone child , and these children becom less concern about social aspect of life . therefor they do not spot the need to help the commun afterward when they grow up and becom youngster . these two reason just express my opinion and must be taken in gener term . i am sure there are a lot of other reason whi young peopl do not give time to help the commun , but i consid these two as the most import one . it is also import to take into account that there are except , i know young peopl that devot a lot of time to help their cummun and even some that work full time in field relat with commun aid , but i just feel thi is not the gener behavior of thi gener .
