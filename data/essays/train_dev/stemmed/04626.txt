i 'm not sure of thi statement , i known a lot 40 year old more sad than older peopl . to make an exampl , my grandfath is 70 year old and he still enjoy life go around the world two time a year . i like hi love for life , and i hope i 'll have the same becaus if you do n't enjoy the life you should spend all the time sad and it is n't a good thing . i do n't think that the age is so import to determin the love for life . logic a young peopl can have more from the life than an old peopl if the speech is about the physic activ ; i can stay all night long or do mani kilomet by bycicl . thing that an old peopl ca n't do . but as i wrote befor is close to the physician charaterist . the problem are that mani young boy do n't ejoy life and i ca n't understand whi . too peopl in thi time are sad mayb for the stress the fast of life-styl that is concentr onli on work and stupid thingh that you have to had to be similar to the other peopl . i think that the statement is too restrict , we ca n't say sure the young peopl are more attract by life than old peopl becaus is not alway true . anoth exampl is about a professor who theac me few year ago , he wa not young howev hi behavior were like the behavior of a young boy : hi vital and hi capac to relat with my classmat ( young boy ) . luckli the peopl who go out with me are full of vital , so i never spend my time bore myself like other peopl do . i say thi becous i know a lot of peopl who seem afraid of life and stay at home all the time watch tv while out the sun is bright .
