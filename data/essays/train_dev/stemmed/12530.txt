i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid becaus i think both with and without a tour guid are differ form and each one ha it differ on the time and money one have in order to spend on the trip . through my experi , i have learn that travel in a group led by a tour guid impli to adapt at the differ situat and activ suggest ( or schedul in advanc when you book your trip ) by the travel agenc and to the differ interest not onli person but also of the other member of the group whom will be ask the whole travel to go to unschedul place or to wast more time in somewher els not mention by the tour guid , but you will be sure to spend your whole trip in place alreadi plan and with a sum of money alreadi paid . howev , travel without a tour guid is more flexibl in order to choos where you want to go and for how long you want to stay . in other word , you have the onli respons of look for inform and take care of your own , and of cours of enjoy your journey . tha fact of go without a group doe not mean that you are exempt of loke for your own interest . while you are travel , you have to realiz that all you are do , visit , or discov is base on what you want to do and no one els is there to tell you where are you go to go next and whi . in addit to the place to go and the interest you have , it is go to be veri import to realiz how much money one ha , and how mani time one want or is abl to spend . not all the peopl have the same possibl in these topic and each one ( base on the roll each one ha in the daili life of oneself ) will have the exact answer to respond to thi question . therefor , travel with or without a tour guid is differ and each one ha the opportun to decid in which form is go to be the best way to accomplish one 's interest base on the time and money to our dispos .
