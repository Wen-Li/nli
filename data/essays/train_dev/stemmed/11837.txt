today car is consid a commod : most peopl have one and even in a famili of three or four peopl we can find more than two . sinc the day it wa invent , the product of car ha increas in an incred way : from a small factori with few peopl work in to the incred phenomenon that we call `` mass product '' . nowaday , also , when we talk about car product , we must talk about mass custom : everybodi can choos the car that best fit hi own tast . at the time of ford , if one would buy a ford t he had to take a black one , becaus thi wa the onli colour avail . today , instead , you can indic which option you want in your car , such as cd player , mp3 player , air condit , ab and so on . when we think about the futur we must consid differ problem about use car . first of all , a big problem is repres by pollut , wich ha rais in level in a dramat way . a possibl solut to thi problem can be use hydrogen fuel instead of oil . in thi way we can continu drive car without pollut with smog the atmospher . anoth problem we must think about is traffic . probabl world popul will grow in number as it ha happen in the past . thi mean that more peopl will want to drive a car and so there will be more traffic . a solut to traffic can be build new street or highway but time will arriv when we have to stop becaus we do not have space enough or becaus thi solut is too expens . thu , i think that the statement `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' is quiet correct . in fact , i believ that the problem i have alreadi describ will make peopl think about altern solut . instead of use car , for exampl , i think we are go to travel by a more develop and more effici subway net . also i think that train and airplan will becom faster and grow in number . in japan , for exampl , a magnet train ha develop that can reach incred speed .
