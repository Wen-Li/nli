to answer a question as multi-facet as the one given abov , it is absolut necessari to review and evalut pro as well as con argument ! one can say that a person who aquir a broad knowledg in mani differ field of academ subject is better abl to understand certain develop . whi is that ? first , mani develop concern more than onli one subject ! as an exampl onli think about the process of global : thi phenomeneon concern econom , industri engin , transport as well as educ , or polit . someon who focus onli on one of the field could hardli manag to bring certain fact togeth and draw qualifi conclus . second , mani field of studi have stron interdepend mean that one determ is influenc by differ factor out of differ academ branch . thirdli , the generalist ( as one can call the expert in mani field ) is abl to access a wider branch of tool out of differ subject which enabl him or her to be a more effici problem solver . nevertheless there are obviou advantag of a specif knowledg as well : it is easier to total understand a certain facet of a problem as one is abl to focus on that subject for a long time . thi enabl you to draw back to a varieti of experi . pick up the exampl of the global process it is easier to explain onli the econom aspect when you are an expert on that and have been abl to collect deep experi in that field of studi ! if you want to focu on the effect of global on poverti in third world countri it is not necessari to be an expert on the develop of transport cost . .. have the pro and con argument present in the abov section in mind , i would say that it is more import to special in one subject than be a generalist . especi today in a world with a lot of research done it is necessari to special on a detail field of studi to bring up new knowledg . expert can deliv more detail problem solv plan . in my opinion it is nevertheless possibl not to loos the overview and to know the root your are come from . the best altern to do research on a multi-facet problem is a team made up of member have their origin in differ field . do thi it is possibl to draw from both advantag as everybodi ha hi of her specif knowledg and contribut to a team unit differ qualiti . thank you for your attent !!
