i think it is true that the younger peopl enjoy more of their life than the older peopl do . and i have three point to support with . first , younger age is `` free '' . except go to school and do homework , young peopl have more time than the elder . consid `` adult '' spend time with anyth regard their job , such as meet and get readi for the present or even rais children , it is obviou that young peopl have more time than the older peopl do . second , young peopl have less to worri about . new hous , pay tax , promot , rais children . these are none of the option that younger peopl would have in mind to consid . the few thing they might think of would be boy/girlfriend , schoolwork , colleg or get job even . except few group of peol who take them too serious , those are not desper import or i should say `` deep '' matter . compar to those of adult , young peopl have less thing to concern , which help them to enjoy their time even more . third , and for the last , young peopl is liter `` young '' . they have more chanc to tri out for mani thing . for exampl , the adult usual do n't get chanc to tri out for music or sport team if their major or field are differ . but in middl or high school , or even in colleg , young peopl get lot of chanc to tri a bit of everyth , so to speak . and i think the more you tri , there 's more possibl that you 'll like , and have a good time . so for these three reason , i think young peopl have more chanc to , and do enjoy life more than older peopl do .
