as we all know , life is chang veri fast and new invent are rise now and then . some may say that some of the older invent will come to an end and some would say these invent will still remain . one of these invent are automobil . in my opinion i dont think that car will fewr after twenti year from now for sever reason : first , a car is an essenti thing to have nowaday simpli becaus one could not do anyth with thi preciou gift from scienc . the main reason that gave the first idea of invent the car wa the difficulti man had face dure hi daili life either becaus of the distenc or becaus of ill . some may argu that there were anim which can support peopl , i think that deal with a thing that ha sens is realli hard special when it come to meul or hors . anoth reason is that peopl cant stand - and i 'm one of them - live without have an automobil . in these day and in the com year , an automobil will be a sign of leasur and wealthi ; some may prefer to say , but gener speak it is an import invent that scientest have done . i think , like other peopl do - that technolog is veri costi . if we assum that car will decreas becaus of a new thing that scientest have invent and thi invet will decreas the ammount of car to the half , a simpl reason will be that thi kind of invent will be veri expens and not all peopl can manag to have it . from what i state abov it clearli show that i have a pissamist point of view , mayb becaus i dont beliv in scienc , or simpli becaus the increas number of needi peopl who are the sourc of new automobil .
