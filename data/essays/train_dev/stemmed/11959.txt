befor give a straight answer to thi question , i need to state that it depend on what the specif person intend to use hi academ educ for . in my opinion a solid basic knowledg of a varieti of subject should be obligatori to everyon , who seek an academ degre . but as thi should be content of the school educ and somehow a foundat for the decis , which subject is choosen at univers , the goal to be perfect in everyth is not a use and not a realist one . to understand the last aspect , one should regard that the knowledg in the world is doubl everi four year and speed of thi process is even increas . an all-around geniou , like da vinci or other great charact in the renaiss , do n't fit in our time . thi mean not that i do n't see the import to link knowledg or to have a broader horizon to deal with academ problem . nevertheless i prefer to get an educ that give me the chanc to special in my field of studi and go as deep into the topic as possibl . the main reason for thi posit is the fact that most of the student , includ me , will onc enter the market for well educ and highli motiv work forc . to get an advantag in thi competit is essenti . and it wo n't make me special and import for a potenti employ that i know a bit about biolog and art-histori work as an account in car industri . to have a realist or even good chanc in thi field of industri i 'd rather reli on my abil in busi administr and knowledg about thi kind of industri . therefor it is , in my eye , import to make an earli and specif decis , what you want to achiev in your academ studi and - if possibl - where you want to work in the futur . the same is relev for student , who are occupi with for exampl law . most of the student i know , who made a degre in law , need to focu on one specif sector of thi field of studi . otherwis they would have had seriou problem to get an appropri job . becaus , the rest of the student with no vision end as taxi
