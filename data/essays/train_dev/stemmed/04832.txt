there is no doubt about the fact that some peopl are not abl to differenti between the idea and concept versu fact . what i normal do and follow is to learn about the idea and concept first and then connect it with the fact . so , for me understand idea and concept is far more import as they are univers and is a complet statement in itself . as far as i am concern , to me idea and concept , are a kind of univers rule i.e it can be use in more than one situat and / or event . for eg. if i am have clear concept and idea about ani particular thing it becom lot more easier for me to understand the detail though it look tough . it also help me to gener an exampl and explain the same thing in my own word . in addit to it if i am have a strong understand of the fundamet ( idea and concept ) i could appli in ani given situat as current in a toefl exam mani a time you had to understand the concept and idea of the read and listen passag . secondli , i would like to say that idea and concept which we also call fundament is complet statement in itself while on the other side fact are incomplet without an idea incorpor in it . for eg. the theorem and formula use in math and physic are also a kind of concept and idea of solv the problem of calcul ; without thi it is imposs to do anyth . therefor , i strongli beliv that idea and concept are defin have an upper hand than the fact in everi aspect of life whatsoev .
