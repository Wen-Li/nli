nowaday , young peopl are more involv in mani activ than in the past . for thi way , someon can adfirm that young peopl do n't give much time to help their commun . becaus of i 'm a young person , i can explain my opinion and i can support my disagreed opinion with some exampl . the first exampl i support , is that young peopl have not so much time to help their commun becaus they do n't wont to help them , not becaus they have n't such time : in fact , i can help my friend if he ask my an hand , even if i have to studi for myself . if i am belov to a friend , i help him in everi way . but in thi way , i have to renounc to spend some time to play the comput or to have a paus , go to commerci center , or runnig , for exampl . i suppos that the peopl that said thi sentenc , know just selfish peopl , that think just to their life . but in univers , for exampl , student live togeth much time : they stay at the same lesson , they spoke in paus time , they have a lunch togegh and they becom as a famili . in a famili , if a member ha a problem , the other help him . and in thi way occur in univers . in fact help each togeth can consent to pass more simpli the exam , and live the univers life with no fear . also in famili young peopl help fairli well ( and more than sometim or seldom ) : in fact as a young person grow , hi respons grow itself and he recogn that help parent is import . they can do it in differ way : work in spear time , to learn some money to spent for their person object , and they do n't ask money to their parent , or clean the hous or their own room . natur , exist mani of young peopl that do n't help in none of thi way their famili , but i ca n't gener . as the man who said that sentenc can not gener .
