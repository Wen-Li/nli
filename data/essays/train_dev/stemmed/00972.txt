i do not believ that succes peopl alway have to tri new thing rather than do what they do best . a success person is n't someon who is good in everyth he or she tri , it is someon who is among the best in what he or she know the best . if the former definit wa true it would mean that there are n't ani success peopl in life becaus noon can be good at everyth . mani peopl consid bill gate as a success person . after all , he took the risk , establish microsoft , and earn billion of dollar from it . howev , even he doe n't tri other thing that are outsid of hi strenght , such as swim . i am one of the best swimmer turkey ha ever seen , and i hold multipl nation record . mani peopl consid me as a success person as well . suppos that bill gate wa to tri a swim career , and we compet side to side in a meet . doubtlessli , i would have won , but would that make bill gate a loser , instead of a success person ? would it mean that i am more success than him ? i think not . success is about what you can achiev with what you are given , not about how mani risk you take . a one year old talk babi is a success babi . a student with the iq 150 get 90 per cent on a logic test is not so success . take risk and tri new thing in life broaden your vision , it doe n't have anyth to do with be success . peopl who do what they do best are alreadi success . they do n't need to wander around for new excit just so that other peopl consid him or her to be success as well .
