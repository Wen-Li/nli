in the past fifti year , the number of car ha continu explod as the need to move away from where one live ha made itself clear . such a dynam ha lead to an exhaust of the oil ressourc that will be effect in a few year from now . the continu develop of asian and african countri unvari goe along with a grow in their number of car , make their ga consumpt ever increas , while the western countri ' keep still . such an increas will ultimatli lead to the deplet of the energi that ha kept them run until now : oil . that deplet will lead to the reduct and ultim to the extinct of the car as they now exist , be ran on ga . a total disapper of the mean of transport on long distanc would lead to the destruct of the western economi system which is not toler by those countri . the rarif of oil ha alreadi led scientist to seek new energi . these so call `` green energi '' have to be avail on a veri larg scale , storabl and usabl to run a car , without have ani long term effect on natur , and have to be as safe as possibl . for the moment , chimic batteri have shown their limit as to how long they allow a car to be use befor reload the batteri . the hydrogen batteri that is for the moment the best shot for engin propuls is still not effect enough and to danger for the user in case of a car crash . for the moment , no viabl solut ha been commercialis on the market , and there is no know whether or not the solut will be found in the year to come . but what is for sure is that onc the sign of the real disappear of oil are clear to everi countri , everi one will seek solut that can support their economi , for their economi allow them to live . so in twenti year time , the number of car will not be lower than today , but higher as new popul us them . but they will not be ran with oil . so inde , there will be fewer car ran with oil than there are today .
