have knowledg in mani subject wouldnt help a student in mani way becaus of thi a student can not be perfect in a subject after he complet hi academ . thi happen mainli becaus throughout hi academ he ha to write mani exam on these subject so hi prepar would also be for the exam onli rather than gain knowledg in that particular subject . for exampl , take the engin studi the peopl who take up thi cours have to be perfect in their field that is either comput , civil , mechan etc. but they finish their cours without ani knowledg and after that when they go for job interview they began to feel the import of a particular subject and start gain knowledg of that subject . so after read the exampl , effect one question come to your mind what 's the use of do engin , studi a lot of subject and be perfect in none . it would be better to say , you can select subject which are relat to one anoth and start gain knowledg from them , so that you can becom a specialist in that particular subject . by becom a specialist in a particular area you could do wonder to that particular field in a small period of time . so i disagre the statement mainli becaus of the follow reason , by read mani subject a person might get a broad knowledg but he can not implement that knowledg perfectli becaus of imperfect in those particular subject . but onc a person choos a field in which he is interest and special in it he would astut know of what to do and the shouldnt 's in that particular field of special . from thi it can be said that , it would be better to do special in a particular field rather than mani . and to support thi there is famou quot , `` jack of all trade but , master of none '' .
