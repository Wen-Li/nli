knowledg subject knowledg is a veri good and commplac thing at the same time . i't a good thing to heve and share a knowledg but the idea is do you prefer to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or special in one specif subject ? . in my opinion have a knowledg special in one specif subject is better . i disagre with the idea have a broad of knowledg becaus alot of reason . my mind will not abl to understand and save all the knowledg that will be taken by mani academ , but if it were one specif subject i will . for exampl take a knowledg about a histori as a one subject it 's not easi as have a knowledg about histori and art and math it will be vnot easi . pick up a specif subject that you love and you want to learn it it much easi and fun for u to learn alot of knowledg either you love or not , one subject you will enjoy it and you wont be bore of it . for exampl i love histroy so if i have aknowledg of it i 'll be abl to love it and get exait and enterist about it . of my point of viem learn or take a knowledg from differ place is a bad idea it will make you transport from place to anoth . for exampl if i go to learn in a 3 academ it will waist my time and i 'll get board too fast ! that whi i prefer the knowleg from one place and one subject either . at the end if you want to take a lot of enjoy , meaningful and enterst knowledg you should go for one special specif subject to keep the joeyful and beauty moment by have the knowledg , it is the best way .
