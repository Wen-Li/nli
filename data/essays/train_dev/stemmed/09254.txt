'' . though thi inform may seem useless at that age , after progress through life 's obstacl , one realiz that the knowledg one had gain by studi such subject is veri preciou and valuabl . we now rememb that mt . everest is 8997 metr high and is go higher everi year . it give us a sens of superior and pleasur that we , after so mani year , rememb such tini detail . special in one specif subject may give the student more time to understand the subject and achiev perfect . special may give one an edg over other . but when we emerg into societi , readi to make a differ to our live , the live of other , or the world as a whole , we realiz that a broader knowledg of subject is better than special in one subject . with knowledg come power , and with power come respons . it is our respons to make thi world a better place .
