enjoy life seem like the prioriti goal of life to mani human be . go on vacat , danc all night in a club , cater themselv with scrumptiou food and expens cloth all prove to the world that peopl do whatev they need to do to enjoy the life that they will never get to experi onc again afer it is over . becaus age can be one of the factor that influenc how much a person can enjoy life , among the econom class and moral valu , the question of who enjoy life more come out into the public veri often . i disagre with the statement of how young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus it is not onli the age that effect how much a person can enjoy life . go to the hospit about 2 time a week wa my routin for the last 17 year of my life . i have been born with a diseas that make me easier to be vulner to common sick such as cold and flu more than other . i am 17 year old , the age which most consid as the age when one get to enjoy life the most . howev , by compar myself to my mother who is 40 year old , i believ that my mother enjoy life more than someon younger like myself . instead of go to the doctor and hospit everi week , my mother spend time cook , clean , and take care of our famili , which make her the happiest in her life . `` i enjoy my life the most when i get to make dinner for you and the famili after a hard day of school and work '' is what my mother say to me all the time . also becaus she is such an optimist person , rather a pessimist one like myself due to the condit i wa born with , she enjoy life like there is no tomorrow . not onli doe the person characterist that one is born with effect how much a person can enjoy life , the physic and the outter substanc of a person definit effect it . pari hilton , the daughter of the owner of the hilton hotel compani , is consid as one of the peopl who enjoy life to the fullest as proven through numer megazin and articl . apart from her valu toward life , one of the reason that she is abl to enjoy her life to the fullest is the money she ha . the econom support from her famili buy her the most expens cloth and jewleri , make her look like a supermodel everi singl day and also `` afford '' friend that a common person like myself would not be abl to do . compar pari hilton with a young teenag like myself prove that not all young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . howev it is also not the case that older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl sinc older peopl have experienc more hardship and face obstacl throughout their live . there is no doubt that i do not go by a day without fall asleep feel so bless compar to some of the less fortun . i get to enjoy life , mayb not as much as my mother or pari hilton , but at least i have the privilleg to enjoy life while some other do not . not onli do young peopl do not enjoy life more than older peopl do , it is also not the older peopl that enjoy life more . it is mere the age that effect one 's event in hi or her storybook of life - it is one 's gift and outlook toward life itself .
