although it look that young peopl tend to enjoy more than older peopl as the are young , full of energi and free from ani kind of ailment . but on the basi of my person experi i think if a person plan hi life properli hi go to enjooy more hi oldag than hi youth . he accord to me hi ` own ' life onli when he reach the fag end of hi life and enjoy thye life in it real term . let us take an exampl of a person who ha recent retir from hi job and a person who ha recent join hi job . as i have said earlier if he is financi strong than he ha virtual no worri at all . sinc he ha no tension of go to offic , catch bu etc he can start hi day as per hi wish . while the young fellow can not allow hi such wish as he ha to attend the offic . by the time a person reach that age hi as suufic hi thurst for achiv new posit , and henc is completli free of mind have no tension of achev new target or propos new project . on the other hand the young fellow will struggl a lot to make hi reput in the compani and also to make hi futur secur in the compani . mostli old age peopl by thi time are free from their famili liabil , there children are well settl and they have not worri about them , they can spend there money complet accor to there wish and do everi thing that they onc want to do in their l on the other hand the of so call energet young person is lose a lot of hi energi fight and keep himself up in the cut age competit . more over mani thing he can not do for himself becaus he ha a famili depend on him , he can not buy hi dream car becaus he ha to educ hi kid and for that he need money . as far health is concern physcial he ( the young man ) may look fit but mentallli hi more troubl .
