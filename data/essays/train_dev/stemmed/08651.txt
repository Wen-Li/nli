i do not complet agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , simpli becaus it depend on what the definiton of `` fun '' mean to these peopl . fun for young peopl , special for an adolesc could mean a lot of thing like hang out with hi friend , throw birthday parti or even studi for an intellectu young individu that is . my point is fun could mean a lot of thing to a lot of differ peopl . for the older peopl fun could mean just watch televis or go for a long walk . for exampl , my grandfath who is about 75 year old ha a lot of fun have food of hi kind . ye , thi is true when a person ha reach a particular age he start pleas himself or have fun with venial thing like these . thi doe not mean that he is n't enjoy hi life . he ha hi own way to enjoy it . younger peopl might enjoy life as they are present but thi doe not mean older peopl have not done what the younger peopl have . moreov , the older peopl have done everyth the younger peopl have . what thi mean is , enjoy life and fun go hand in hand and also chang as need of the peopl chang when they grow older . it all depend upon what the individu pleas himself with , to have fun at that particular age like in my grandfath 's case in wa the kind of food he like to eat . in my cae it enjoy life sit on my roof top with a guitar . henc , comment on the statement i would like to assert that fun could mean differ for differ peopl . therefor , older peopl have as much fun as younger peopl do , the onli differ is the mean of have fun or satisfi themselv .
