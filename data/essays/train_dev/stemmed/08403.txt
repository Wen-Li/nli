first of all , it ha to be metion that the concept of ` enjoy life ' is dramat differ for a teenag and for an older person . even if thi concept should be present in life from the cradl to the grave . on the one hand , it is gener accept that young peopl are physic more capabl than older peopl . as a result , they will normal not enjoy life by do the same kind of thing . inde , go out in a club on saturday night is sure quit unusu for most elderli peopl . they may prefer to travel on an organ trip or to read a good book . older peopl also have the advantag of be retir , which allow them to have more time for leisur , holiday abroad , etc , on the other hand , young peopl usual have less experi in life and have a tendenc to make `` youth mistak ' . they are usual less wise in make decis and will sometim face a lot of problem . furthermor , young peopl get more and more respons as they becom older . for instanc , the one who studi have to attend class regularli , to do homework , to write a memoir or a these on a particular subject . other will have to work , to care for their children or face money problem . inde , gener speak , older peopl tend to have less money problem becaus they are not menac by unemploy and mainli have their accomod mortgag paid . undeni , less respons give you more time to enjoy life . howev , in my opinion , enjoy life is not realli a matter of age , i feel that quot like `` life begin with 40 '' are total wrong . for me , life begin everi morn when you wake up . in conclus , we were all given the choic to do what we want with our life and should take advantag of thi opportun . life is short and enjoy it everi singl day , regardless of either you are young or old is definit a conditio sine qua none to happi .
