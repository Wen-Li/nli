i agre with thi statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . they are usual busi with thier own problem and esho or with their studi so they do not have much time and there are other who are not interest in help their commun becous they think that it is not their job , it is the other job . but not all young peopl think or act thi way , there are afew young peopl who help their commun in sever way . in my openion i think that perant should incurg their children to do such thing .
