the best way to train and improv our intellig is to make the brain work by understand and analyz differ concept . therefor i definit agre with thi statement : brain 's exercis are more useful and import than memoy 's exercis . the first step in the educ of ani human brain is to learn how to studi and understand a new idea . learn by memor new fact is onli a mechan exercis that can not increas our intellig . therefor if we can understand a concept , we will be abl to rememb it and it will be part of our knowledg for ever . sometim student tri to learn fact becaus they think that it is an easyer way to learn ; but thi idea is complet wrong . onli understand the real and essenti mean of a new concept , the student will be confid and abl to use it in hi futur . in addit , it 's import to underlin that the rule of teacher is to encourag student to analyz and studi new idea . for exampl , i rememb in my high school the support of my favourit teacher who wa tri to teach me how import is to studi deeper ani subject instead of learn fact . in conclus , i want to emphat again the import to understand idea and concept becaus is the best way to increas our knowledg and our intellig : that is the real exercis for the human brain . .
