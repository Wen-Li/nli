look at the valu of modern western societi commun servic doe not realli seem to rang in the top ten of aim a succss human be ha to reach . to be regard as a proper member with a respect social statu for exampl one need to have a career , regular incom and all the incentiev that come with it , like hous , car and journey . help in your commun just seem to be not an the agenda . therefor i think that it is quit true that young peopl do not spend as much time for organ event for the town 's elderli peopl or get involv into cummun meet as 50 year ago but at the same i time i believ that it is not entir their fault . of cours it is a person decis to get involv into social activ or not , but on the other hand human be are not as altruist as they like to be . so if societi want young peopl to spend more time help in their commun than i think societi should start to apprici and reward the work peopl are do there . nowaday social committ in gener is regar as burden more than a duti . but without it commun simpli are not abl to work . i guess , modern men first have to realis thi import fact in order to get commun servic back into `` top ten '' again . if thi kind of commit is reward again - not financi but social , which mean with a higher reput - , i am pretti sure that young peopl will start to get involv again . an statement like the one abov are part of
