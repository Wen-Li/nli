here i want to sight a quotat that `` who dare win '' . i feel that success peopl are those peopl who have taken risk to do well in their respect field or taken a risk of choos a new field to succeed . i feel that no proffess or ventur of human is risk free . for exampl if a man have money to invest , he should risk to invest the money in a new bussi or even share of some reput compani . if he doe not take thi risk to invest in one field or other , hi money may loos it 's valu after some period . if thi risk turn to be fruit , we can say that the risk the man taken succeed . we can also say that the man is a success man . if a man goe on do the same work he know how to do well sometim or the other he will feel life to be boredom . so take risk make man to live live . if our prematur man have not taken the risk of find fire , we might be eat the same raw meat and uncook food . if they have not taken the risk of hunt anim in those day the human race that we see now may not be exist . if scientist have not taken the risk of spend their time or brain on invent new thing , we may not be in thi develop world of high scientifisc adavanc . in medicin field if the then doctor ha not taken the risk to oper a person by surgeri mani diseas or injuri of littl import now might still be lethal to human life caus mani death . all the recent advanc in the automobil or aeroplan is becaus of risk that wa taken by our forefath in develop them . i feel that all the knowledg that we enjoy now in ani field like space research or medicin is becaus of the risk that were taken by one or the other . so in my opinion no proffess is risk free and there is no exist of thi world if no one take risk .
