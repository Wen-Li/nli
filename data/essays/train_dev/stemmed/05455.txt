advertis , as a typic factor of thi commerci societi , can keep work becaus of it can make thing better than they realli are , so peopl will decid to buy the product . in my opinion , chang cover , announc a new verison , and use famou super star are three way for advertis to make them look much better than they real are . the cover make them look uniqu , profession , and beauti . but what will happen if peopl get use to it ? the fanci cover wo n't attract peopl anymor . so at thi time , they will chanc their cover . for an exampl , coca cola , as a veri popular and traditon soft drink of america , ha chang it cover for so mani time , but it did n't realli chang the drink itself . the new cover will let peopl think , mayb it might tast better . the new cover bring peopl a new mood , which is invis . a new version is anoth way of advertis . when peopl get use to use someth , they will lost their interest . so a new version of the product will come out at thi time . it doe n't mean the product is still the old thing , but no one know exactli how much the productor chang it . for exampl , there are so mani kind of shampoo say they are the second verison , but onli profession analytist would know how much they realli chang , and how much differ will be made . the third way for the productor to sell more their product is to use make the famou guy , such as singer , movi star , or even the presid . the effect of the famou peopl are huge . first , if someon is a fan of a movi star . he or she might buy the product without ani reason . second , most super star have good-look face . even the product is not the reason that made them look good , cosum might be affect . so they think at least they might becom beauti . so in conclus . the most advertis use veris , cover and super star to confus peopl . so they can use these way to hide the real valu of their product , and sell more of them .
