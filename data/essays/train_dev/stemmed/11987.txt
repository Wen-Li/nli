there is a gener notion among the older gener that today 's youth are irrespons and are not social conciou . they feel that young peopl do not care about their commun or their nation as a whole . i disagre . true , the older gener can proudli boast of all the help that they have done to their commun and their nation . take the case of the fight for indian independ in the first half of the 20th centuri . the youth at that time were veri social conciou . they were passion about their countri and involv themselv in variou freedom movement . some of them were readi to die fight for their countri , such wa their vigour and devot toward their countri . similar case can be seen throughout the world at that time when the world wa undergo a chang with two world war and decolonilis take place . but in no way can the older gener assert that the younger gener do not give enough time to help their commun . today 's youth may not have the social and polit awar that their parent and grand parent have , but it is incorrect to see today 's youth as irrespons and bound by consumer . young peopl are wrongli accus of have a do n't - care attitud toward their commun . there are mani instanc that overturn thi notion . for exampl , in my coloni , it is the young peopl who organ festiv and program to celebr and rejoic with their commun as a whole . i can often see colleg go student give lift to old peopl who are too old to travel in public transport , in their vehicl . the recent bollywood movi ` rang de basanti ' depict four young men who elimin a corrupt politician for the good of the societi . therefor , it is wrong to believ that young peopl onli think about where their next date will be or when they will see their next movi . they are veri respnsibl toward their societi .
