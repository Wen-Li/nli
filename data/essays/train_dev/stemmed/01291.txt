a tradit way to travel is travel in a group and follow a tour guid , now day , more and more peopl would prefer travel by themselv , becaus they can explor more and disscov more by themselv . and i am one of them . it is true that travel follow a tour guid is much convin , peopl onli need to book a trip and readi to go . but , thi is an inform era , travel by yourself is eay to prepar as eyou can just `` googl '' through the internet , you can find all the inform you need , like accomd , flight cost , histor stori . .. it wo n't take too much time to organis and more cheaper . i think in mani group travel case , the travel site quantiti befor qualiti . the inform they provid are alway attract and full fill in the schduel , but not all of them are necessari , even accross a bush can be a famou site . so , i think thi is wast time . if peopl go travel by themselv , they can just go the place where the are interset in , the anoth reason whi i like to travel by myself is becaus i can select the root by myself , it is more flexibl . i can stay in a place longer if i realli enjoy it , and i also can skip some place where i think it is not worth yo visit . travel in a group and follow a tour guid is not a bad idea , but i think we must explor the real mean of travel , find the suitabl way of travel is the most import .
