my person belief is that learn fact is more import and help in life than understand concept . first , is it clear that a person who ha learnt a lot of fact , in a word who ha a great experi , adapt more easili to new situat than the one who first tri to understand the underli caus of thi event . the former is abl to imit what he ha alreadi seen or done himself and to react quickli wherea the latter need time to think it over and build hi behaviour . come back to the caus of anyth to understand the hidden mechan of action is start from scratch everi time and a hugh loss of time . it is as if you do n't trust what other have done befor in similar situat . a lack of trust is basic a kind of anxieti that prevent from adapt to unforeseen event . second , know past fact increas one 's action effect . find a solut is quicker when compar to a similar problem that ha alreadi occur than when modelis it into abstract scheme . now one could argu that experi is of littl help to solv problem that are complet new and that one would be more success if he understand the caus of the problem . well on the contrari , i believ that experi stimul creativ and that it can inspir new solut for new problem . third , learn fact is get a realist approach to life . focus on idea and concept is too abstract in my view . of cours thi is can be seen as a superfici understand of life but at least thi bring liveli and pragmat . and live is all about reactiv and abil to get in contact and commun with other . understand deep caus of action is too theoret and may cut counic sometin .
