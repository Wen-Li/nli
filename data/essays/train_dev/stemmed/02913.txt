when peopl travel to remot place they ussual think that the best way of get to know well the place they are visit is by be in a group led by a tour guid . thi statement can be true if the person travel is visit the place by the first time . other way , by person experi i think it is better to travel onli with the peopl you know and without a tour guid . the tour guid are of great help if you do n't know the place you are visit . in a lot of case if you do n't travel with a tour guid you can miss a lot of place to visit becaus you do n't know where they are locat or what is the import of thi place . it is veri import to know what are you visit and what it repres , in the case of histor site , biuld , or place . in my case , i like to travel alon . that way i can go wherev i want , the time i want , and stay the time i want in differ place . i am an architectur 's student and obvious i like to travel . the reason i like to travel is to know place of great architectur and histor import and i love to have time to appreci everi corner of the place i 'm visit . i like to see everyth , to touch everyth , and to feel everyth . to do thi i need a lot of time and i ca n't have someon tell me where to go , what to do , or even tell me fals stori about some place . for exampl , if i have the opportun some day to visit the versal palac , i would not like to have someon tell me what to look or where to go . i will like to danc in the mirror hall and to smell in seren the smeli of the garden 's flower . i think that if you know the place , or at least are familiar with the place you are visit , it is import to go in your own peac , and do thing your own way so you can enjoy the best your travel . thi doe not mean neccesarli that if you do thing more privat you are not go to enjoy the trip .
