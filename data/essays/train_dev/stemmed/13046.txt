i agre with thi statement . in fact , i 'm sure that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . everyon know about the catastroph consequ deriv from pollut . for exampl , our planet is becom warmer and warmer and the sea level increas rapidli in the last few year . i think that pollut is a great problem , but i believ that we can do someth in order to save the earth . what can we do ? we can prefer public transport , such as buse or metro , to car . for instanc , everi day i go to univers on foot . it 's a good attitud , becaus i can have some phisic movement , i can meet friend on my way , i can stop for a while to buy a newspap and , most of all , i can enjoy my citi . i relax when i go out for a walk and i suggest that you tri to do the same thing . so , i suggest that you prefer ecolog mean of transport in order to respect our planet and to defend it from pollut . public transport is less expens than car , so that you can spend that money in other way . moreov , through buse you can social , you can share the travel with other or , if you are lucki , you can meet interest peopl on your path . for exampl , last week , while i wa come back home , i met giovanni sartori , an italian writer . i wa veri surpris ! i ask him some question about hi latest work , call `` la mala costituzion '' . he told me that he prefer take the bu becaus it help him to feel close to common peopl . i agre with thi idea , becaus i think that through public transport you can share , not onli a travel , but also feel and emot . in conclus , i suggest that you abandon you car and you start take buse for three simpl reason : first of all , you can contribut to save the planet from pollut ; secondli , buse are cheaper than car ; final do so , you can enjoy the atmospher of your citi .
