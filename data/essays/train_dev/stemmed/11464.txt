i agre with the statement becaus , after all , the purpos of the advertis is to point out the advantag of a product and thi is usual achiev by exager them . one common scenario on tv advertis is to show happi situat that are not necessarili relat to the product be promot . for exampl , you can see a sad person in a gray raini day whose mood chang to absolut happin as the sun rise automat when they drink a coke . even though the weather ha noth to do with peopl drink coke , they tri to sell the idea that a refresh drink can make you happi no matter what . on the other hand , magazin and photograph base advertis usual tend to use veri simpl trik such as show product bigger than they are , or accompani by a lot of accesori wich are not includ , and sometim not even sold at all , but make the real product look a lot more attract . furthermor , some advertis show result that can not be complet achiev by the product itself , to convinc peopl to use them . thi is veri common in diet product , where a veri thin model wake up in the morn to do some exercis but she just goe to the refriger and drink a diet yogurth . desit of the fact that the yogurth could onli prevent you from gain extra weight , the propaganda make it look like it actual can make you lose weight . final , anoth issu is that the advertis do n't show the dissadvantag of the product or if they do , becaus of some reglament , they do it as fast an ileg as it is possibl . thi is the case of alcohol beverag ' advertisement , which show a veri small and realli fast read phrase were they advertis that drink in excess is not good for your health . as a concluss , it can be forseen that advertis do n't usual say the hole truth about a product and one ha to be veri careful in examin the real characterist of it befor buy or use it .
