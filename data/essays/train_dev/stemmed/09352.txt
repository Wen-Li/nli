commun alway need help from engag peopl . they look for young peopl to organ a kid 's club or choir for exampl . but commun nowaday have troubl find young engag peopl to help them with their work , i agre with thi statement . to my mind , some young peopl are veri engag in commun work and are will to help other peopl , even today . but in gener , i think , young peopl are more interest in meet friend , do sport or work in a job , where they are abl to earn extra money . to my mind , young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . one reason , whi they are not will to help in a communt may be , becaus it is a lot of work , but they usual will not get money for their work . anoth reason whi young peopl are not interest in do commun work is becaus they may seem bore and less excit to their peer . young peopl nowaday have to risk someth and have to do fun thing to be accept from their peer group . in my opinion , not onli the young peopl nowaday play an import role in not help the commun , but the commun themselv have to becom more interest for young peopl . they could make the job they have to offer more appeal to young peopl by honor their work in front of the whole commun with certif , for exampl . anoth point is , that commun could organ more meet for young peopl who help . they could offer trip to those and they could tri to engag a lot of friend to do the work togeth . so , not onli young peopl have to be more engag , but also do commun have to be more creativ in order to get young peopl 's attent . all in all , i can say that on the one hand , young peopl have to show more respect toward their commun and be will to help , but on the other hand commun have to make their work attract to young peopl .
