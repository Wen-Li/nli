i agre to the statement that nowaday young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . there are variou reason for thi . first and foremost , the cut-throat compitit prevail in the market forc the young gener to devot most of their time develop their own career and they are left with no time to concentr on help out their commun . in addit to it , with the develop of technolog , there ha been a numer number of distract that have crop up in the market which , mani a time , astray the young blood to an undesir path take them away from what they ought to do . but whi , do we think , ha thi chage been seen in the new gener . are they at fault ? well , from my point of view , i think the system , which we term as ` societi ' ha led to thi downfal . young peopl are not made awar of the import of the cultur ethic and it in-grown valu . they are not subject to the happi and have not felt the tranquilti that one enjoy help their commun . young blood are suppos to the part of the societi which ha alway brought revolut . they are the one who have given birth to a new system of govern by erad the ail societi . they are the most enthusiast crowd who ha the zeal to turn the societi the way it want to . but if they are not abl to bring about chang or help thier commun , it is not sole their fault . we need to re-think if we are conclud thi decis . now it is high time to rejig the way , the think of the societi ha becom . if the young peopl are not abl to extract time for help their commun we need to find the answer to a veri relev question . and the question is -- ` whi ? ' . whi are they not abl to do it ? is the light of commun work fade ? are they not abl to find valu in perform thi job ? if day we have these answer and the moment they start get implement , i think , my point of view will chang .
