first of all i would like to make clear that the object of market and public are to highlight the good side of the product they are present so the most natur thing is to find that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are but thi is someth relat to a consum impress not to a advertis creator issu . it could be a problem if the advertis say lie dure it present or present inexact inform that could guid the consum to a invalid choic . for exampl if a deterg advertis present a clean proof , compar two type of detergent , it ha to present the truth result becaus there are law that protect the consum against abus and missinform . becaus of thi law the advertis world have to be veri careful in the present of fact and imag and they have develop . over the year , they have develop mani tactic for say the maximun great thing about their product without tell a lie but make the consum think that their product are the best when sometim it not the case . for exampl , talk about beauti spot in the tv , everyday we can see that in the screen supermodel use creme and beauti product that they say put the skin or hair in an excel condit but we are fool ourselv if we think that use that product it will make that we becam as beauti as those supermodel . that is not the fault of the advertis guy becaus it is their work tri to make their product the most desider for us . final , consum need to be realist and critic with the actual advertis world , pute in the balanc all the concept and knowledg they have to determin if a product is as good as it is present .
