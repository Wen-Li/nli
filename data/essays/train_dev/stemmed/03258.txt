obvious thi is true . everybodi know that market 's import in everyday 's life is grow faster and faster everyday ; and advertis play a fundament role in thi `` play '' . the impact of imag and sound dure a product 's advert is more import than the qualiti of the product itself . how mani time do we buy a particular kind of biscuit , cake , clean item , tissu , shoe ( and so on ) just becaus the day befor we saw that fantast advert with that catchi tune ? well , i think that thi happen veri veri often . nowaday everi seriou compani ha got some expert peopl think about market strategi to have their product well spread . and the main part of these studi goe to advertis . thi studi is base upon a lot of other thing : peopl thought , poll and so on . exploit thi inform with accuraci , compani choos a mix of sound and imag that catch our attent . so , the point is : i agre with thi statement , becaus it is obvious true and recogn ( who could say it isnt ? ) , but i do n't agre with the way the compani exploit thi kind of thing . i mean , ye it 's their work , but sometim there 's so much differ between advertis and qualiti that we could call it a crime ! these kind of thing happen in music too . . when some popular music magazin like the nme want to `` launch '' a particular band , it begin put these band 's pictur everywher , on the cover , on the back , in the middl etcera , so that the young kid think '' oh , the nme ca n't be wrong '' ... the consequ is that these band reach a level of success that is not proport to it skill . in the same way , compani spend lot of money in buy advertis space in televis or in the street or in internet site for their product and onli a few for the product itself ! ye , it 's nice to see some advert on tv ( mayb featur some nice girl hehe ) , but i do n't agre with thi excess hype . compani should spend less money for advert and a littl more for the stuff they produc !
