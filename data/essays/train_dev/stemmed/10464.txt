the idea of whether broad knowledg of mani academ subject than special and focu in one specif subject ha been a matter of debat recent in mani countri . in my point of view , i believ that broad differ mani knowledg will give studnt the abil and the basic background to understand the real life to be abl to disscuss differ subject , argu in mani issu , and to improv himself . also , be awar of mani academ subject will give the studnt the abil to go through differ field and chose the best major he want to drill in . i believ that spread more than one subject in the academ year especi in the first and second year will allow the student to be awar of what is go around hi world . studnt who is go to studi about educ , social studi , polit , art , and may be math will be abl to understand hi countri and hi sociti peroblem and will have more idea than a student who never hear about polit or art and onli studi for hi math major . moreov , student in their first year will never be abl to take the right decis for their career life and choss the major they want to enroll-in as they dont have the enough knowledeg and experi to chose among all these altern . for exampl , in my first year and directli after the high school i had to chose my career and my whole futur base on my zero experi and approximatley zero knowledg , of cours if in my countri i wa abl to gain and aquir the basic of more than a knowledg absolutli i wa go to chose someth els or if i didnt chose someth els ; at least i would know that my choic wa the right chice for me . to conclud , i strongli recommend and agre with have broad knowaledg of mani academ subject befor focus in the specif field of knowledg which i believ it will be the best for my futur career and which will be help for my sociti .
