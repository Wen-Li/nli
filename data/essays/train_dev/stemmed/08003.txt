in twenti year from now the world would have chang greatli as new technolog is creat everyday . as for car it is a difficult question to answer as it can be argu both way . so will car increas or decreas in number after twenyt year ? over the year more peopl are come into thi world and so the demand for car is becom greater . more money is be made by everyon and poepl are get richer each day and so i believ for these reason that car will increas in number but the energi use to oper car will be chang as natur resourc are decreas and will soon run out . as for the other side of the argument , ye the number of car will decreas as natur resourc are run out so sooner or later the gover must put a limit to the amount of car use . anoth problem is the amount of enviroment damag that is effect our world greatli . car pollut our world a lot and they are the main caus of temperatur chang . if the use of car continu in thi amount we will soon start have more sick and that is whi car will soon be decreas in number . to conserv natur resourc new sourc of energi will start be use soon as a new technolog and these new resourc will diffenetli be expens and not all peopl will be abl to afford them and that is whi not all peopl will have a car in twenti year and that is whi the number of car will decreas to a certain extent . in conclus the reason for car to decreas in number are more than the reason for them to increas and so i believ that ye car will decreas in number in twenti year .
