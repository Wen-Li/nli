to have a knowledg of ani academ subject is veri import becaus we can learn how to think in an academ way with thi type of studi and think in that way make us to ask question about anyth in life . there is a lot of subject to special but i would choos to special in onli one specif subject and thi can also help me to learn how to ask . acoord to me , if you decid to learn someth , you have to give all your energi to it , and thi help you to notic and understand everi detail about the subject . becaus everi detail ha a reason and these reason take you to the profess on the subject . the point is , you have to understand and feel the sens of your subject . with studi the regular part and then studi the detail , you can achiev in ani subject . moreov , how much time you spend on your subject is the other import point . due to the chang , you should keep on studi and develop your research . if you decid to special in subject more than one , it will be difficult to research all the meteri , actual detail . . i can give a primit exampl that i decid to appli for the conservatori in u.s. , and they want me to give a recit , take the toefl andpass the musician placement examin . first i start to studi for all of them at the same time , but after a while i realiz that i forgot some detail about each subject , and start to studi one by one . thi help me to finish all the work . although i can not allien myself from both side , i would choos to studi for onli one subject and got the broad knowledg of it . i believ onli thi way can let you to have a domin charact studyingin academ .
