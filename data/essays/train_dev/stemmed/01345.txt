which is better , to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subjetc or to special in a one specif subject ? the answer realli lie in the context in which you are speak . if you are still in school then it is alway better to have a broad knowledg of all other subject . just imagin what a person will becom if he studi onli biolog hi whole life . he will never becom a doctor , let alon a success doctor . there are some subject or field of studi which are necessari or form a base for further studi in ani field . you can never succeed in life as a doctor if you do n't have ani knowledg of chemistri or math . we do need elementari knowledg of all the subject to truli apprici the subject in which we want to special . but at the same time we can not expect a person doind phd in biolog to know about difficult topic in mathemat like calculu . infact , the matter of fact is that as we move toward higher educ , we should tend to concentr on less and less subject . a person stude engin , will usual do away with the subject of histori and geographi in colleg , but will still embrac physic and chemistri which are more relev for him . a person do specialitaion must have pretti good knowledeg of the subject which are go to help him and facilit him in hi reaearch even though they are not directli relat to hi field of special . in conclus i would like to say that we need a balanc of both the form . one one hand , in order to realli understand and enjoy a subject we need to special in it , but at the same point we can not afford to neglect other subject . a good combin of both broad knowledeg as well as special knowledg will make a truli knowledg person .
