i definitli agre with the idea that it is more import to learn fact than to understand idea and concept for student . there are 3 reason as follow to support my idea . for most of human be , the abil to learn fact is much stronger than that of understand idea and cencept . fact equal specifict and concept stand for abstruct . for an exampl , we may distinguish a hign valu pictur from a low valu mainli by the whether it look like the real stuff or not . on the contrari , expert defin the valu of the paint by their color or some paint skill . we may not understand the essenti thi in van gogh 's paint beacas we even not kown what he draw on the paper . for anoth thing , it is easier for student learn thing from teacher than learn by oneself . that is the reason that teacher can make some specif exampl and fact to descib the new concept which made student make sens easili . when it come to learn fact , we can not take into account the part-tim job . whi there are so mani student like to take it when they are in school ? becaus it proiv some interperson abil with them which are not learn from book or class . addit , they learn thing with the joy of earn money . in spite of thi , understand idea and cencept are basic for student . such us some acdem subject math , cacul , scienc , historyand social scienc , they are essenti for student to learn someth new . suppos a man can not read or write or simpl cacul abiliy he will learn noth even he know quit a few of fact . at last , in my opinion , i thing understand idea and concepr are as import as learn fact . we may build up tow side abilitli at the same time .
