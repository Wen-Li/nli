i do not agre with the statement that succes peopl are take risk and tri new thing rather than do what they know how to do well . i admit that a lot of invent and busi concept have succeed , becaus they were highli innov . probabl most peopl would have doubt that they would be profit . on the other hand so mani peopl tri to develop new idea about be differ and fail . most of today 's idea , that actual are pretti good , do not turn out make it inventor rich . so gener speak take risk more often lead into frustrat and poverti wherea concentr on your strength is more like to lead you to succ . as an exampl i would like to tell you about a freiend of mine who had a great idea about a new sportsbrand . be an expert in market with year of experi and a wife who wa work in the cloth industri he wa veri confid that hi idea of a local brand would suc . he took the risk of get into the new busi of produc stuff he never had done befor . deal with all the new field that hi busi involv he wa not abl to fulfil everyth need to develop a succes brand . if he would have stuck to hi root and would have stay in market onli , he would have been better off for sure . in conclus i would say that stick to what you know best is better for most peopl than be too risk take . in my opinion learn from peopl who alreadi are succes is the best thing one can do . by that you can follow in someon footstep and , if done right , suc in a much easier and less riski way than someon who want to tri out new thing .
