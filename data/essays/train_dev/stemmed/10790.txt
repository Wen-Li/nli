to be honest , i disagre with the given statement , which sugget that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , for mani reason . in my opinion , if you travel accompani by a guid and a group , you will not be total free of ani movement . i mean , usual , thi kind of organ travel plan the trip from the begin to the end and you have no other choic than to follow it . when i am travel , i prefer to remain abl to decid where i want to go and what i want to see . the guid tour will obvious take me to the most tourist point in the countri i am visit , but usual , those place are not the most interest , judg by the differ trip i had the chanc to do . it is not rare while visit a citi or a countri to find surpris place , mainli ignor by the tourist but mani time more attract and pleasant than the well-known sight . when i decid to leav my daili routin to enjoy the pleasur of a trip abroad , it is alway to go somewher i can be alon . i live in geneva , switzerland , in downtown , so i am use to live surround by a lot of peopl . so for me , travel mean go as far away as i can go from that , and do it with a group doe not exactli help to find thi tranquil . i do not talk about leav with a friend or a few peopl , even though i have never travel with more than one person , but it is still a huge differ compar to travel with a bunch of peopl you mostli do not know . anoth point which make me disagre with the statement is that i absolut hate the guid tour . do not get me wrong , it is not that i do not like the cultur aspect which can lead me to learn a lot of interest thing , but i find utterli bore to listen to someon who repeat hi speech so mani time he doe not take ani pleasur to do it anymor . i prefer get the cultur inform from a travel book or from a local citizen , who often love to proudli talk about the histori of hi countri . you can not even stop some onc they start , but at least they do it led by their heart . to sum up , i could say i do not have ani interest by go in vacat with a group and a guid .
