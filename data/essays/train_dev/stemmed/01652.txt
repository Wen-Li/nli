in my opinion one must rather special in a specif topic , rather then have broad knowledg on variou field . it is also a lot easier to gain knowledg on a varieti of topic superfici . while thi may give us a lot of inform , it will not be help in get answer . in the past , it wa perhap more beneficail to have a wider rang of inform . howev , as we continu to advanc in all walk of life , it is go to becom increasingli difficult to obtain new inform unless we dig deeper and deeper in the topic at hand . thi will requir a us to special in specif area of studi . we will have to tackl problem at even more minut level . we can consid the exapml of biotechnolog . thi field tradit includ the subject of molecular and cell biolog , and the basic of biochemistri and physiolog . today howev , biotechnolog span area such as particl physic , high speed comput and even biomechan engin . it would be virtual imposs to have inform about all these branch . moreov , the onli way to excel at these topic would be to special in them . the need of the hour is collabor between individu in special field . with a high level of special knowledg . on a more person front , i feel than a person self worth is perhap elev when he/sh master their field of interest . it seem rather easi to gain broad basic knowledg as it is so readili avail . with tool such as the mass media and special the internet , it will be even simpler to do so . howev , special knowledg will push us to think in newer direct . collabor effort between specialist in differ field will help us deciph sever vex problem which current have no answer . overal , it will give rise to newer and benefici technolog . an onli through special studi can we be a part of thi revolut .
