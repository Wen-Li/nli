in my opinion , have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is more import than special in one specif subject . in other word , i think one should do the former first , then do the later . from my experi , i insist like that and i can explain more detail . first , we can easili find the good exampl through the system of educ . you enter elementari school and start to studi there . follow middl and high school , you may learn variou thing thourghout mani kind of subject . after that , you could find your specif talent or concern , dedic yourself on that . it mean learn basic and common thing first , and then concentr someth special chosen after that . second , it 's my regret stori . i neglect studi when i wa high school student . as a result of that , i select wrong major which wa mechan engin for bacholar 's degre . anyway now i becom militari offic and prepar to enter into post graduat school public polici major . i could say thi rout is pave way . if i had been dilig to learn mani academ thing when i wa in high school , i could have found right specif subject for me and follow the shortest and effect way to be myself of nowaday . lastli , special earli may make one be partial . as balanc nutrit is veri import to toddler , balanc learn to youth . if one go into specif thing too earli , of cours she know veri much about her subject but not about other thing . it can make her concentr more to the specif , neglect more to all the rest . it mean unbal . so she may have the limit even on her subject as a result of partial . peopl say that read is food of mind . as you know read is main method we can get the knowledg . so it is veri import to get nutriti balanc . when we feel like healthi as grow good balanc with knowledg from variou part , it 's the veri time to select the specif for us .
