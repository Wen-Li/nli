i do agre with the statement `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' to understand idea and concept is not veri easi but onc you understand , to know the fact is easi job i think . i would like to talk about base on my experi , when i wa studi i use to learn fact first then tri to understand idea . that wa a huge mistak for me , i thought i understood what i learnt but it wa not . i wa understood total differ way so i had to studi again which take much more time . also when we had group work i wa the one who alway give wrong suggest and it wa veri embaras in fornt of my friend . so , from that point i decid to chang which wa understand idea first and learn fact . it wa littl hard for me at the first time but time goe by it wa much easier for me to learn fact after understood idea . well not onli that , after i understood idea and concept i had a lot of question to ask and opinion to suggest . also time that i spent on to understand becam much more shorter so i can studi other thing as well . in the class i wa the one who never ask question and suggest my opinion in class but i chang . how ? i becam the one who most talk in class becaus to understand what i learnt i had so mani thing to ask and want to know . so i knew from that time , becaus i did n't understand the concept i had no question to ask and no interest to think about that topic . from my experi i do strongli agre with the statement . to do easi work or better work , to understand what is the idea and concept are the first thing to do then learn fact will be the faster way to learn from my opinion .
