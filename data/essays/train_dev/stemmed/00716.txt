dure the first read of thi task i have alreadi made my choic . i person disagre with that statement . whi ? i have experienc that mani peopl in may surround spend much time in help their / my commun . let me give you an exampl . i know mani peopl who give even - cours for pupil in their age for be better in school and that for free ! anoth quit good exampl is the group of some pupil who meet older peopl / senior dure christmas-tim for give some hope and the feel of be part of the societi and i person think that thi is a great support for the whole commun in a citi . there are also some young peopl in my surround who creat an anti-drug club for prevent youngster and also older peopl from take drug and / or commit crime . i do not want to show that topic onesid , i mean i clearli know some peopl who have not taken part in a free social programm instead they prefer watch tv , play computergam the whole enven or night , disturb other peopl , steal or destroy thing but i think the major of the youngster i know are realli motiv in do thing for the commun , just becaus of fun and avoid to be bore by a situat . i know in other societi ( china ) pupil have to work for their famili and other instead of wast the time becaus it is tradit . but relat to the statement , what is enough time to help the commun ? i think it is quit enough when someon also do onli a half hour or less everi day for the commun . so it is clear that it is up to everyon to do what he want to do but i think everyon ha also the task to show respect for the commun itself and for what they do for everi part of the societi you live in .
