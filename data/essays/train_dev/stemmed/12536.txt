i total concur to the statement that the best way to travel is in a group and led by a tour guid . a tour guid well acquint with the place of visit and is veri benefici when it a place have histor import . we had visit the vatican citi dure thi summer . even after do a entens cours work befor go to the trip it wa unavoid from hire a tour guid . gain knowledg from book is alway consid less than gain knowledg from experi . it wa easier for us to locat the place but we were liter confus when it came to the histor signific of the place . eventu , we land up in hire a tour guid which made our visit more pleasur and even reveal a lot of unknown fact about the vatican citi which we might not have known . the tour guid show us each and everi artifact of histor signific and also gave a brief descript of the ritual carri out in the citi . our trip wa a success and even today it feel us with joy when we think about the vatican citi trip . travel in a group ha it own charm and benefit in comparis to travel alon . the most import and notic fact of travel in a group is that we never get bore and the trip becom more enjoy when the group consist of friend . as mention in the previou paragraph , we had been to vatican citi dure the summer . our group consist of 5 member includ me . we had distribut the task among ourselv which wa quit help in plan the trip . i had the task of studi the map and mark the place of interest on it wherea my other friend had variou other task . the plan of the trip wa so perfect that we saw each and everi place on the map and were never late of ani event . it would have been difficult for a singl person to perform such a full proof plan . and even the expens of the trip is also reduc consider as the overal expens are distribut among the group . the next time i plan a trip i would definit plan it along with my friend and will alway hire a tour guid .
