in whatev lesson , we learn idea , concept and fact . idea present the topic and fact are an applic of these idea . i think it 's more import for student to understand idea and concept than it 's for them to learn fact . the way to understand well a lesson is , first of all , to understand idea and concept and then , understand fact . it 's not revers . for exampl , in histori class about world war one , you have to understand whi thi war took place and whi all the countri were involv in thi fight befor learn fact : battl , event , great name , famou day . .. anoth exampl happen in mathemat class , you see that a theorem can be appli to particular case but you should have understod befor all the concept which are use in the theorem . secondli , i think that , in a lesson , idea and concept are more signific than simpl fact . inde , fact are just applic of idea . i mean that without idea and concept , you ca n't totali understand a lesson . you can partial , of cours , but it 's not the same . i ca n't realli explain it but you feel differ when you 've understood all . i feel kind of victori when all is clear in my head . you ca n't get all the detail explain if you 've just learnt fact becaus they are not enough to get to the heart of a topic . at last , what is the point of a lectur or a lesson if you just rememb fact ? fact ca n't exist without idea or concept wherea idea and concept do n't have to be relat to fact to exist . i know it sound weird but some field of knowledg such as metaphys do n't realli have ani applic . howev , they exist . besid , we alway can extract an idea from a fact , wherea the opposit is n't as easi as we think . for all these reason , i think that student should understand idea and concept befor learn fact .
