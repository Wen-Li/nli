nowaday young gener are involv in a lot of activ , which absorb all their energi . these activ can rang from someth relat to their studi , to someth complet differ as sport . all of them , howev , are realli demand , and , therefor , they have to choos what to do . besid that , nowaday all young peopl like me are more interest in themselv , and in what they have to do in order to increas the number of skill they have , rather than in what other peopl are do . thi is also relat to our societi which is becom more and more individualist . all these thing lead the young gener not to take care of the need of other peopl , and , therefor , not to help them . thi is what i experienc few day ago . i wa walk with some friend of mine in one of the main street in the citi center of frankfurt , and , all of a sudden , a poor joung guy came to us ask for money . he state he wa veri poor as hi father lost hi job , and , therefor , hi famili did not even have the money to buy some food . i felt veri sad and i tri to give him some money . i am not rich , but when it come to help someon , who is less lucki than me , i usual tri to do it . on the contrari , the other young peopl who were with me did not even look at him and just pass by . they did not even took care . it wa unbeliav . they told me that , as they are work hard everi day and have to face a lot of problem at work , they do not see the point in help someon who is not tri , as they do , to work hard and improv their life . thi is onli a small exampl , but i person believ that nowaday we have no time and aver all we are not anymor , as in the past , will to help one anoth . thi can also be seen in the decreas number of young peopl who do not anymor take part in social activ within their commun .
