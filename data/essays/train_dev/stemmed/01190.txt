the use of car today is not restrict to onli provid transport . it ha now infact becom one of the basic requir of each individu . therefor , i disagre with the statement and feel that the number of car is sure to go up in the next two decad . we have a reason for thi right in front of us when we see massiv infrastuctur project consist of expressway , freeway , complex over bridg network , better road etc. be complet one after the other . there is a consciou surg in the infrastructur develop today and thi is happen mainli due to a realis that the number of vehicl is go to show a definit increas in the futur . more importantli , econom speak , go by the rapid popul increas in our countri combin with the want of own a car by each individu , we can say that it will be a major factor in allevi the number of vehicl around . there are sever other factor too for exampl : individu nowaday are earn higher and better salari and enjoy better perk which give them satisfact . therefor they can afford to buy a car not onli for themselv but also for their work partner , which is increas too , and sometim also their children who wish to drive to their educ institut on their own . furthermor , some peopl from busi famili think of own car as more of a statu symbol and therefor keep sever of them even if they are use onli a few . though the increas in the number of car will also increas problem like high level of pollut and stress in individu , it is someth that can not be total control . we can forese on the basi of the statist of the past few decad that it is bound to happen becaus it ha been go on the same way for quit sometim .
