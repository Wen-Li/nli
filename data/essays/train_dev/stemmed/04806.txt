the societi we live in is base on consumpt . i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in the contrari , nobodi would buy these product . i think that nowaday , peopl realli need to be sure of what they buy . they want to make sure that they buy the best product . so , the onli way to ensur them is to creat the advertis they want to see , even if it is not true . it is the case , for exampl , for the solut which make you lose weight in onli two week . most of the women know it is not true but as the advertis show fake benefit of the solut , women want to tri it , and so , they buy the product . women final notic that the product doe not work . it is also the case for the children . they often see toy they have ever dream of on televis . the advertis make them believ that with thi toy they will be the strongest , or they will be the best . as children still ignor the principl of thi consumpt societi , they believ what they see and they want to buy the toy . but onc they have got it , they becom awar of the truth and see that their toy will never give them what they were told . so i think that , inde , most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . it is one of the most impost rule of the consumpt societi . produc have to alway seem better than what they realli are . peopl onli buy what they think to be the best for them . all advertis have to lie becaus if they do not , the advertis for anoth product would and so , the true advertis will not have success . it seem that there is a tendanc nowaday , peopl prefer to be told lie to feel more confid than be awar of the truth . that is whi i think that onli the advertis whicg make product look better than they realli are are more succesful .
