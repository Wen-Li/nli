i do n't think that yong peopl do not take care of their commun . there are three reason to support my oppinon . when i wa 16 year old i wa in the school valunt 's club in an year . at that time , i could realiz that there are a lot of peopl who help me without think of money . also i could understand whi there are commun in the world . i think there are so much chances to take that kind of experi for young student in korea . listen radio is one of my hobbi and my favorit program is ' chin han chin gu ' that mean my best friend in english and most of listen are middl or highschool student . whenev i listen that radio program , i could heard about a move stori about our life . the mc of that program alway tel the mean of peac through the radio and that realli help me to do good thing . an year ago ' www.thehungersite.com ' is produc through that program and i 'm not sure but over hundr thousand student can heard about that same as me . in that site , you can do a nice thing to hungerd children without money problem . even young peapl do n't help their societi , that 's not onli young peopl i think . we live in a big citi and there are not enough commun between our neigberhood . i think that 's the point whi the peopl think they live in a cold-societi . in that reason , i do n't agre with that young peopl do n't help their commun .
