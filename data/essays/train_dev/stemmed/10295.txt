i disagre with that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . mani countri is develop rapidli now . just like china and india . these two countri were not so superior in ecnorm befor , but they are develop now . there is a big popul in both of the two countri . as the countri develop , they would be manufact a larg number of car for transport or for the citizen 's use . as we all know , china is the biggest bike use countri in the world . but now , more and more chines becam to buy car instead of bike . of cours so do the peopl in india . peopl need car when they want to go to the place not so near to them . and i do n't think the peopl in well-develop countri , just like usa and japan , will stop use car . peopl feel inconveni when they lost someth they are use to use . especti in usa , the usa is so wide that peopl live in there ca n't leav from car . the car compani are tri to make light car which consum less gasolin to antipolut . but none of them stop produc car . they know car are greatli need by peopl over the world . mayb you will say that peopl can take the metro or buse . they are also veri convneient . that is ture . and peopl also can take them in rush hour . but what about weekend ? when we want to go out for a picnic with our famili , do you think it is better to take metro than drive the car yoursevl ? of cours not ! everybodi need the space of himself . so a car is necessari to everi famili . we can take a metro to go to the workplac , but we ca n't bear do the same thing when we get along with our famili or lover . so everybodi of us need car . there wo n't be fewer car in use than there are today i think .
