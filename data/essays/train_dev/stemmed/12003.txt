we should all know a littl about everyth , other wise we would be ignor . it is true you ca n't learn about everyth and sometim should choos between what we want to learn , but more than anyth i beliv we should know mani thing inst of close our mind to what we onli need . my step father , actor and everi human live in thi world can be use as exampl for thi statement . my step father profess is music he live and bread music , but he know about everi thing ! anythin you ask him he will be abl to answer and thi demostr charact , person and good parent . even though he doesent need calculu for hi line of he ha use hi knoledg of calculu to help hi daughter and i with our home work . he shair hi knowledg with everyon and even though he does n't need it , he pass it on to someon who doe . i aspir to be an actor when i go to colleg and be an actor is alot more than just act and say some line , actor need to constantli be learn , everi singl piec of inform they can get their hand on they learn it , they might never use it , but it is there just in case . who know when he might land a role were he is alexand the great , good thing he read that histori book when he wa in colleg , he ha to know about the charact to character him . and of cours everi other human in the world . the reason i beliv thi world is so mess up is becaus we do n't take our time to learn , learn from the mistak in the past so we do n't make them again . ignor is the destroy of thi world we live in , not know , `` bah , i do n't need to know about architectur ! well gover . .. we just lost new orlean '' for be ignor to the world around us we will some day , kill the rain forest , kill the sea with all the oil dige and destroy the world with global warm . we all need to know about `` stuff '' even though we ca n't know about everyth , we ca n't turn the blind eye to the thing that are right there in front of you for you to learn about them . if we can make ourself smarter , get smarter and let knowledg in to your brain .
