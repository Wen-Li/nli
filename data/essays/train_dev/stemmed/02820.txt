i would like to discuss the statement that young peopl do not spend enough time to help and suopport the commun they are live in . to my mind young peopl nowaday spend less time help their commun than they did some decad ago but you should consid that there are quit a lot of thing that have dramat chang over the past few year . now , there are mani new servic offer by the govern that give us the opportun to spend our time do someth els than work for our commun . an exampl for thi would be the improv helthcar system : some time ago , it wa nearli imposs to work in full-tim job if one of your rel wa veri ill and need perman care and help . today , you just have to appli for special servic that are paid by the insur and you will be given help . howev , there are still some some servic which can not be provid and / or paid by the commun . in those case ( i.e staff at the fire brigad , ambul driver , trainer at sport club etc . ) there is inde kind of a shortag . in my free time , i am work as an ambul driver without be paid for thi . often have i experiec situat in which we ran out of personnel becaus nobodi want to work on the weekend or want to stay up all night . i wish that in those case , more peopl would recogn how import their contribut would be . all in all , i think that we do inde need a young gener that spend more time help their commun than mani peopl do now , but we onli need their support in some field . so my suggest would be to tri to make some advertis and promot in order to show them how much fun it can be to play an activ role in societi and to help them to find the right kind of occup for them .
