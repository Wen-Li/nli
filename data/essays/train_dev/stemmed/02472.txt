how to be success ? is it rather by onli repeat thing that you alreadi know how to do well or rather by tri new thing ? on the one hand , i think that to succeed in anyth , everyon ha to practis . for instanc , a tenni player , befor win competit , ha to practis for hour and even day . when you repeat someth , it becom easier to complet and you will even be abl to do it faster and more accur . the first time you tri someth , you will most like fail . then , with the habit of do it , you will improv yourself . consequ , success peopl may be success becaus they have practis enough and now know how to do well . but on the other hand , with onli repeat the same act , mayb you will stop think . you will begin to act mechan , therefor you wo n't have the will to improv yourself . so i am strongli convinc that tri new thing is also veri import : you have to learn not to be afraid of what you have never met befor . for instanc , i have studi mathemat and i wa told by my teacher to practis with long and complex problem , that i had never seen befor , rather than with small and repetit exercis , with a view to learn how to deal with new question . moreov , if at some moment of your life you do n't take risk , if you do n't put yourself in danger , if you alway want to be secur , you may lose mani opportun : for instanc , if you want to get a better job for which you are not quit prepar , you must be courag and not be afraid to appli for it , to tru everyth to get it . to conclud , the solut of thi concern is far from easi . what would be the best behavior ? to my mind , both are relev , but at differ moment . you should n't hesit to tri new thing , even if you feel unprepar , but to succeed in new thing you must alway keep in mind everyth that you alreadi know : what you know how to do well can prove veri use to do new thing .
