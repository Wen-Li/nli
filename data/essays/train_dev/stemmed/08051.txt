knowledg in a broader sens is alway help , but keep knowledg in mani acedam subject rather than in one specif subject will be difficult and in practic scenario will keep you on `` no man land '' . i person disagre with the statement to have knowledg of mani academ subject than to specil in one . there are strong reason for thi , let us take a subject for thi , say `` industri design '' thi seem to be a one subject but it a complet disciplin in itself ani academ curriculam if design will includ all those subject which will help in thi subject . special in one subject will make a person skill and specialist of it subject or field . he can contribut to the industri or a societi with hi skill . thi is one aspect of the special , it ha anoth side also , it will bring peopl from differ field and subject togeth and will encourag a teamwork , exampl of a autobobil industri will help to make the point clear . to make a product one broadli need a design , a person who design or visualis that product , an engin who will make that product work , a market person who will sell it to it right user , thu they have to work togeth and everybodi ha to be a specialist in hi subject as a engin can not sell or a market person can not design a product . though it look veri simpl but it is veri difficult to execut as each and everi person in ani industri ha a specif role , though they can contribut in other area with their idea , but one ha to play hi key role in that particular process and that whi skill or expertis count a lot in today competit field . specil will not give you a choic from the career point of view , but it will make you known for that particular subject . most of the peopl who serv the societi with their knowledg were highli special in their respect field . thu , it better to have a special rather that broad knowledg of mani subject .
