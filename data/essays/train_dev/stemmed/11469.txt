i have to say befor enter thi topic that we can not know what will happen in twenti year or even if car will circul around . but , if everyth contini to progress as it ha been do for the last ten year i think that hope , there will be lot of car but not as much as today . the reason are that global is make us move around the globe more than ever befor but also more quickli . anoth task to have in mind is that citi are expand , and thi make it imposs for car to succes attend the requir of peopl in term of transport . so , if we have to cover longer distanc in a shorter period of time i think it will onli be possibl if public transport becom more acces to peopl , more confort and , of cours , more effici . also for longer distanc , air transport but speacial train will bring the solut to the problem . train are more confort in term of work experi ( for exampl with a laptop ) , read , have meet or convers , than in plane where take off and land do not permit nearli anythyth . of cours between place where there is sea or ocean in between plane are the onli option , and i also think that they will continu to impriv in mani aspect . but return to the citi ( where by the way i have more experi ) , the rush hour are a complet wast of time . govern and privat institut need to promot public transport or for exampl taxi cab . thi transport have two main benefit . the first one is that peopl in charg of drive are not in a hurri so the will drive more care . also they will know the better way to follow and will transport more peopl in less space ( what doe not necessari mean that you can not breath ) . the best exampl would be the metro ( or underground ) . citi like pari or ny need to invest in their metro servic ( witch are old and smell realli bad ) , but other like madrid have invest a lot in it and , not in twenti year but now , today , there are less car than befor . also citi where motorbik and bike are promot experi a big fall in the number of car .
