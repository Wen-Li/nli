advertis are util of compani to sell more piec of their product . and alon thi hypothesi make me want to say : `` advertis make produkt seem better than they realli are ! '' an exampl for such advertis is about car . often you can see car in tv which roll over a lonli street in a beauti countrysid with a hawk on sky . thi make you feel free and good but there is noth said about the car itself - for exampl if it is chep or how much petrol doe it need for 100 kilomet . also you can often see car drive trough moodi street and hard theretori but in normal life i do not have the possibl to drive in that and i would not have it . anoth in last time often discuss product is the cigarrett . in most advertis person who smoke cigarrett are cool ( like at `` malborocountri '' ) and have much friend and social contact . thi make you believ if you smook you will have friend . but there is noth said about the bad thing like tumor and lose power at sport , or onli about the fact that mani nonsmok do not like to kiss a smoker . also other kind of advertis are reali problem for some group of person . if you have a children , for exampl , and in tv are all of these nice toy and electr car shown but you have not the moni to buy someth of that it is veri hard to explain thi circumst to a kid . so the advertis can effect some familyproblem . and i think it is not nescessari to say that thi toy are not that good in the eye of your children i play with it for some time . but it is not onli the advertis which make thing semm better than they are . the pacag of produkt is anoth import detail . an exampl for thi is milk . i think everyon like to bye hi milk in a bottl , becaus you can see it an it look better than in a so call `` tetrapack '' . so it ist not easi to say it is the advertis alon .
