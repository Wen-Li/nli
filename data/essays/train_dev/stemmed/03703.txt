i total agre that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , for two simpl reason : person , profession , first of all , i think in my case i will grow more as a person , mean that i will studi more of mani thing , not onli concentr in one specif subject . that make me , in my opinion , more interest and useful . for exampl : read , which is part of studiy , is so import for us to obtain knowleg , so it will help us through get all that broad knowleg we want . and eventu we have a lot more opportun for job , which lead me to my second reason : profession . thi give me such an advantag in get a job , becaus i cover mani subject , so there are more open opportun for me out there . it 's good to know mani subject becaus you can be veri useful at not one , but mani thing .
