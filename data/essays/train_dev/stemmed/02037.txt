we are live in a modern world fill with advertis . all advertis tri to show the magic of their product . howev , i have littl blief in what the advertis have told me . i think most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are ! the goal of advertis determin their poor credit . all the advertis are aim to attract as mani custom as they can . and how can they obtain thi achiv ? they give mislead and uncred inform of their product . for exampl , some healthi food will claim it body-build function in the advertis . but few give ani convinc statist state or trustworthi survey on how it make effort on peopl who have use it . we may see a set of comparison between a fat girl and a thin girl . but how can we believ it 's just the effect of the food ? sinc advertis use for commerci use , most of them will not provid sientif proof . anoth interest phenomena is that famou actress and actor often appear on the screen to advertis a product . of cours , the actress and actor are attract and beauti . by these kind of advertis , we attach the product to these beauti imagin . but the truth is , how mani celebr realli use the product they recom ? they are just invit to say a sentenc , show a pose , and etc . . it misguid the costum to some extent . costum will connect the product to the good imagin in their mind . actual , the product are not so perfect as the advertis said or the custom think . the reason whi there exist such a huge gap between the product in the advertis and in the fact is becaus there is n't effect norm to regul advertis . no specif polici ha given to restrict the advertis . in fact , exagger becom one of the keyword in advertis . i have alreadi disappoint to find a real product in ani advertis . onli when our gover and media realiz the import to suppli the audianc unbias and true fact instead of the beauti lie in advertis , can we choos the product without doult follow the instruct of advertis . so , when you choos someth to buy , do not trust what the advertis told you . turn off the televis when you see an unbliev product in an advertis again . a clever custom should tri to evalu and judg a product by him/herself .
