ther are some peopl who beliv that in the futur it will be fewer car in use that today . they usual argu that in twenti year we will discov anoth type of public transport that could remplac the tradicion car . i not agre with thi optimist vision . in fact , i think that in twenti year it will be doubl of car that there are in use today . i think thi becaus three main reason . actual use of the car is not extend in africa , india or even in china , but when the wealth of these countri grow up , the citizen are go to demmand more car . in a few year they will be at the same level as europ and usa , and pleas note that in europ and usa we have an averadg of two car per familli , therefor there is anoth import argument : the petrolium and ga . the futur of ga industri depend of the number of car , so they are not go to allow that the number of car decreas . therefor , there is no chanc that we discov a new energi fount in onli twenti year . the last argu is the car industri . it is a powerful industri , which provid work for thousand of peopl arround the world . the gover are go to use it influenc to increas the number of car in order to avoid social problem in their countri . it will be great if we could reduc the use of car , special becaus it would help us to decreas the pollut on the earth . but i afraid that it is onli a dream ; the realiti use to be more cruel .
