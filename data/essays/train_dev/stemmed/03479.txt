i stand behind of the opinion that young peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl do . there are three reason : chang societi , health and internet . first , compar to some decad befor to present , the societi ha complet chang . old timer were spend time for themselv to live somehow for gain money as much as possibl when they are young . howev , young peopl these day are given with almost ani good which are essenti for everyday 's live when they are born . therefor , young peopl can spend their time for enjoy themselv . secondli , although in order to enjoy life , peopl should be healthi , older peopl more like not to be healthi than young peopl . if they are sick , even they are veri much optimist person , it is usual hard for peopl to enjoy their life enough . lastli , in present circumust , in order to enjoy thi worldwid and borderless societi , peopl are need to oper a comput and usag an internet servic enough . to oper a comput is a kind of hard for older peopl . for instanc , my father who is 65 year old onli can type by hi right hand so that use a lot of time to oper a comput . also in the occas of the comput crush , my father , one of the older person , ca n't solv the situat . on the other hand , young peopl are more use to usag a comput and know much about it and internet servec . in their age , comput in no more complic materi than mere everyday 's staff like a microwav . younger peopl usual are much more famili to the system of comput and know about sever solut about the comput troubl compar to older . also young peopl can type the keybord faster than oldtim , in that way young peopl do n't feel flustrat for use a comput . for all those reason , i think young peopl are enjoy their life than old peopl do .
