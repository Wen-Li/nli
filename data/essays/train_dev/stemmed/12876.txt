it is common opinion , that success peopl have to tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . when i think of a success discoveri , the first thing that come to my mind is the discoveri of america . christoph columbu tri to find a new sea way to india . but instead of find a cheaper and better connect to india , he discov america by accid . he took the risk of failur , becaus mani peopl believ , that there can just exist one possibl seaway . the thesi , that the earth is a plate and not a globe , support their idea . instead of take the usual , common way , christoph columbu tri to risk someth new and succeed in the end . but at the same time , new experi and idea ma also turn into a catastrophi . one exampl can be the invent of nuclear weapon . einstein did not intend to destroy the world with hi discoveri . but if a new invent or knowledg get into the wrong hand , it can also be use an evil way . atom bomb are now use to destroy life instead of secur it . anoth reason , whi past tradit , idea and way are as equal import as new discoveri and invent is the learn aspect . peopl have to learn from their failur and mistak , in order to succeed further . howev , some thing can onli develop when they had been alreadi experienc befor . in thi way , peopl could discov their posit and neg aspect . we need the knowledg and the tradit of the past in order to find new and easier way . at the one hand , it is import to develop new idea to achiev success . but at the other , peopl are just abl to learn , when they understand and observ past idea and thesi .
