i strongli believ that it is crutial for student to learn and undertsand idea and concept than to blindli learn fact . it is import to do so as it is neccessari for a person to undertsand inform befor appli it . mani a time we will encount situat in our live where we may need to appli concept or fact that we know . inform that can not be appli when need is complet useless to us . it is veri easi for peopl to learn and memor fact , but if they do not understand what they memor , inform that they just absorb will prove to be complet useless to them . for exampl , if a student learn a basic concept requir to appli in a simpl problem of mathemat , he or she can not use the inform they learn in order to solv a more complex problem of the same kind sinc they never were abl to understand the main concept behind it . if a person just learn fact , he or she is not excercis their abil to question . question is a veri import aspect in learn . if peopl do not question , it is veri difficult for them to develop intellectu . as question lead to reason and without reason one can not understand fact . if we learn fact blindli , we are not appli the potenti within is . thi may crippl our abil to advanc . there will not be ani differ among human and comput , except that we perform human function such as breath and eat and they do not . after all , comput were creat to learn , not think . fact are input in them , they do not have the abil to understand concept . we creat comput becaus we understood concept and idea , we can not advanc if we stop take advantag of our abilti to understand and reason .
