if we are take about the whole world , in my oppinion there will be at least as mani car as today . it is a possibl that in modern countri , we will use the car less and less with the pass of the year . we live in grow citi , everi day a higher pertentag of the popul live in citi . and everi one that live in a big citi can tell you the unuseful and expens bussin is to have a car . is much more efic to take the public transport system or even a motorbik , or even a bike . ani of thi solut is cheaper and faster than move thoughout the citi by car . in addit we have the problem of the petroleum . we are aproach to the famou peak oil . some day in the close futur we could not attend all the energet demand of the world just with oil . so oil and fuel will enhanc hi prize , and have a car will be more and more expens everi day . so not everi one will be wealth enough to have a car and use it as today . but in the other hand there are a lot of high popul contri , develop countri . is reason to suppos that mani peopl of these contri will be rich enough to pay for a car and it mantein . also , it is import to be awar that have a car , is one of the most tipic of symbol of wealth and social success , and for the peopl of these contri , to becom a car owner will be surelli prioritari . so although in europ and the usa , we will probabl have less car , in china , india or brasil the number or car will certent increas a lot in the next few decad . so thi is the reason i do not agre the statement abov .
