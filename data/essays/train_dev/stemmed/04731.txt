i strongli disagre with the statement . old peopl enjoy their life as much as old peopl . what i feel is enjoy is a subject percept and doe not depend on age at all . an older person can enjoy more than a young person also . i feel enjoy depend larg on few thing like individu psycolog , socio econom statu , famili circumst and friendsand health . . for exampl an old person of 70 yr old , hi mode of enjoy is differ . he enjoy more with famili hi or her children and grand children or by read spiritu thing or do thing of hi or her own intrest like read book , listen to music or by go for a tour . if an old person ha all thi facil he can enjoy more than a young person . if you select a young person hi or her mode of enjoy may be comlpletli differ . he or she may be enjoy hi or her life by buy a sport car , go out with friend , shop , danc do thing of hi or her own intrest . what i would say is , enjoy depend on how u are receiv thing surround person and person responc to that situat . young person may not enjoy at all if he depress with hi perfom in educ and becaus of hi poor econom statu and lack good friend and have no famili life . and old person may not enjoy becaus of hi health and famili problem and physic uncop . i would like to end thi passag say again that enjoy doe not depend on how old are you but it larg depend on peopl mental , socio econom statu and surroun . as far as i know their is no studi say young peopl enjoy more than elder peopl .
