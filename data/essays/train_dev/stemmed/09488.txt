i clearli disagre with the statement that `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . the onli constant thing in thi world is `` chang '' . thing are chang from the way they use to be befor . man is also chang . the phase of hi life , when he use to find it difficult to earn hi daili bread ha almost come to an end . the live condit have been improv . man is abl to earn enough to support hi , as well as , hi famili need . man ha becom a veri busi anim with hi appoint , meet , busi and mani more issu which demand most of hi time , calib , intelleng and effeci . he also ha hi daili chore which he ha to finish befor call it a day . to keep up with all thi he need fast and convin transport to help him reach hi destin on time . car is a convin mode of transport for him . it is no more a statu symbol . it ha becom a necess . it a veri common thing , nowaday , to own a car . the advanc technolog and the need for fast transport result in more peopl owe car . apart from fossil be the primari sourc of fuel to ignit the engin , new form of energi are also be develop . one among them is , trap of the solar energi . car can now be run on solar energi . thi eco friendli develop is a boon to man . he need not spent mpre money to just fill hi car tank with ga . henc , i opin that there will be an increas in the number of car rather than a decreas .
