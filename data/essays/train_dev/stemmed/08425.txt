in my opinion it is import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact where it could bring out the natur talent in side the student and make him understand the thing more clearli than it happen in the class room . understand the idea and concept make the childern think more scientif and discov more new thing about a partiucular concept it inculc a habit in childern to analys the thing in more broad way and arriv at the result on their own . understand the thing rather than learn the thing from fact from class room help the child to rememb the thing for longer and in inculc new idea in arriv at new idea which help them in a long way to go . also learn concept and idea rather than learn fact which were written or told by some one help to develop a sought of invidu in the childern and to evalvu the issu in rather broad way stand differ form other . for an exampl one of my friend with a concept of aerospac in hi mind later develop a idea which he implement in one of hi project an hi project wa select to demonstr in nasa in unti state of america . and he also wa reward by the presid my countri as the best out stand research student in hi age group . learn concept and idea would also childern in their educ where he could he could he could be intrest in field like research and thing do realli do matter a lot and even have lot influenc on on his/her profession carrer . concept and idea and are not onli confin to four wall of a room where these could obtain form mani place in natur in book in peopl and even in him self . final i would conclud knowledg of idea and concept is larg ocean where it ha no age ba reveri one is a intelluctut in him self onli thing differ is to understand the concept and implement hi idea in to practic .
