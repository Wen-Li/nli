i strongli agre to thi statement , success peopl tri a new thing rather than onli do what they alreadi know . first of all , i think the new thing will creat a new idea than do a same thing , becaus if you are do a same thing as befor and which you know veri well , would you learn anyth knew from that thing ? mayb you will learn some kind of thing but you will not get ani opportun to know a new stuff . secondlli , the successsul person is alway think the next step that would be the best for them . they are alway think the next step they will go . if you are not think about next step you will just stay in the point where you are now . you could not move forward or backward , that is whi mani success peopl tri a new thing to go forward than other peopl . that is whi thi are call success . for exampl , i saw thi televis program about japanes success buissi man who own 10,000 of chain restaur in japan . he said that he is alway tri a new thing by risk a huge money and empoly . becaus if you stop creat a new idea , they will be no more cuostmer who will go and eat there . hi buisi would fail easili . i think to tri a new thing even you are car a huge risk , is the nearest way to be success person , becuas it will make you think a new thing and it will bring you more knowledg you have never learn . it is hard to tri a new thing becaus you do not know anyth about it , howev that is the grate point of tri a new thing . even if you fail in that new experim you should not worri about it becaus that fail will brong you more high skill experim and also it would bring your mind more matur . you would have more conffidnc of what you have done . final , it is import to tri a new thing even you are not success becaus to be success would start from tri a new thing or think a new thing rather than stay where you are .
