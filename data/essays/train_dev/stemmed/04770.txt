i absolut agre with the statement that it 's more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for then to learn fact . the onli inform from school that never left a person 's mind is the data that he understood clearli . about 14 year after i graduat from univers , it is interrest and curiou to see how i can explain most of my knowlegd to my son . most of those inform were veri well understood not just memor . after a coupl year , even if a person have a good memori , he wo n't keep in mind the concept and knowlegd that he never understand . i learn when i wa a child a lot of vers on the bibl , becaus my kid 's school had learn me those vers . but now , becaus i do not repeat then all the time , i forgot a lot of then . i di n't care to understand them , just learn then to have good grade . but now , now all i can rememb are vers that they explain to me and those wich have a import in my life . i think educ today should focu more on explain thing inste of just let student learn then . our world will be better .
