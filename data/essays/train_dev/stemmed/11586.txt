travel can serv mani purpos , rang from pleasur and academ to busi . a guid tour is often part of the former exampl of travel ; for one 's pleasur or academ purpos . the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guid , howev ; if i had the choic , i would rather travel alon . thi is becaus of freedom that solo travel provid : freedom of plan your own travel , and freedom of avoid problem caus by other group member . first , a benifit of travel alon is that it give you the freedom to plan your own travel . sinc you are the onli one who ` sing up ' for the tour , you are free to decid on the place you want to go to , when to go there , and what to do when you get there . as an exampl , when i went to hawaii last summer , i decid to go there on my own , rather than join a group tour . becaus of that , i wa abl to see what i want to see ; the beach to surf , rather than go shop mall , which the tour focus . also , i wa abl to pick when i want to go , unlik the fix date indic on those tour . by travel alon , i wa abl to enjoy my stay in hawaii base on the greater magnitud of freedom i had . second , travel alon give you an addit degre of freedom sinc you are free from problem caus by other ; the possibl cost i may have to incur due to action of other . imagin a scenario where i decid to sign up for a group tour to hawaii . the schedul of which plane to take and what time the bu would come and pick me up at honolulu intern ha alreadi been plan out . but it 's not just my schedul ; it 's the entir group 's schedul . let 's say that sever selfish peopl decid to show up late . the whole tour ha to suffer from the possibl consequ caus by those individu ; perhap skiip an activ we want to do or even delay the trip entir . it would n't make sens if the tour had to give up go to the beach becaus some individu wa take too long decid on whether she should get a pink or a white coach bag . by travel alon , i am abl to avoid possibl problem caus by irrespons companion . on the statement of `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , '' i disagre in respect to the lack of freedom i would get from travel in a group . travel alon would allow you to plan your own trip , ( the freedom of choos the activ and it day ) and avoid possibl problem caus by accompani tourist ( such as skip or delay an activ . ) unless i am certain that the tour somewhat follow an agenda similar to that of mine , i would not consid travel on a group tour led by a guid .
