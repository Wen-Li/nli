i think that the idea that most advertis make product seem much better than they are is right . in fact advertis is made for the purpos of push peopl to buy a product even when it is not need . to do so the good ha to seem much more better than what it realli is . the funni thing is that the mismatch between what is advertis and the real product is openli declar everywher as it could be read in small font that the object can be differ than how is pict on the advertis or the box . an exampl is when drug are advertis on televis . they show someon that feel sick and as soon as the littl pill is swallow he or she get back to work as noth ha appen . i guess thi could be danger too . anoth exampl is when in a fast food restaur there are pictur that show wonder hamburg that do not look like the hamburg i get to eat . i also rememb when i wa a littl boy and i saw an advertis about an ice-cream on tv . the ice-cream look so good that i felt that i had to have one . as soon as i could i went to buy that ice cream , but when i unwrap it and i saw how the ice cream wa in the real life i felt like a fool and got veri disappoint . as a conclus i think that when we look at advertis product we should do it with critic and be awar of the differ between pictur and real life .
