`` you should go to school , learn a lot of differ thing . .. '' that is what parent often said . but i not completli agre the fact that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . in deed , i support the way that special is a good thing . so , peopl know what they are talk about . in some field , like men who built hous , special is necessari : how could be someon as good the paint as wood tabl ? furthermor , it impli a more longer studi if you want to have a broad knowledg . moreov , if someon ha a broad knowled , i think it is imposs that he know accur all hi mani academ subject he had even learn . thi is a great problem , there is not a lot of peopl in the world who have thi capac . you need to be veri smart , like leonard from vinci . he is a good exempl . .. nevertheless , in contrari to my first explain , it is import too , to have peopl who know a littl bit of all . import becaus those peopl will bring an open mind : they will be the refer between specialist . and becaus of their knowledg , they will be abl to resolv problem and manag a team . that 's whi they confer a great adapt . to conclud with thi statement , i think that in a societi we need specialist and we need generalist . the both are complat themselv . but like special doctor in esthet for exampl , could n't ze imagin more peopl who could have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject and after that more special in one subject ?
