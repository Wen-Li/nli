i total disagre with the statement . in fact i do not think that neither young peopl nor older peopl can claim that they better enjoy their live . each group can enjoy it 's life equal . peopl who claim that young peopl may better enjoy their live may claim that thi is becaus they have helthier bodi , thi is not true becaus noth is absolut in thi world we can find a lot of older peopl who are even healthier than younger one . there are mani young peopl who have disabl , doe thi mean that they can not enjoy their lifv ? of cours not , they mayb enjoy their live much more than other individu . the secret is in the spirit it doe n't matter how old you are to use your time the best in someth you realli appreci and that bring joy into your life . i could even claim that older peopl might have better chanc to enjoy their live much more than younger one and thi is simpli becaus they have much more time than younger peopl who spend most of their time work and spin in the wheel of the life to cover their basic need while older peopl who are most propabl retir can find some time for their lesiur and nobodi would belam them caus they have alreadi complet their mission in life and it 's just time for them to look after themselv , they can travel all around the world and have both the time and money to do thi while most of the younger peopl do n't have the time except for a week of vacat everi year and if they have the time they might not afford thi . it 's alway thought that the best time the farmer can experi is the harvest time when he can see all the effort he 's been do for the whole season in front of hi eye and thi is veri similar older peopl can alway enjoy the harvest of their entir life especi when they had done it right and had been work hard for their entir life . these are some of the reason that make me think that young peopl do n't enjoy life more than older peolp .
