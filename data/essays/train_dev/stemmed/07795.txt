most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i disagre with thi statement . when the first nokia portabl phone that wa compatabil with a camera came out , advertis all around show that you could videotap scene and take snapshot of friend . when peopl actual bought the product , what they actual saw wa a realliti . anoth exampl is when the ipod wa releas . everyon wa shock about how a devic smaller than a calcul could store more than a thousand song . when peopl went and bought it , they saw how it could do it . it is not that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , it is about the person that buy the product . mani peopl when they see advertis of new electron devic , they get so happi to see someth that new and someth that function in a new way so when they buy the product and use it everyday , they get bore of it . so when the person rememb how the product look on billboard and newspap and compar it with him after own it for two month , he will think that the advertis made the product seem much better than it realli is . the realliti is that the person ha been use the product effectivley that lead to him get bore of it . my opinion is that most advertis show what the real product is and that they do n't exagger on the product . anoth problem is that mani peopl understand the advertis wrong . when the person goe to buy the product and the find out that it doe n't function the way he thought it is , the individu then get unsatisfi . i think that peopl should understand the advertis and what they are tri to say and understand the messag that they are tri to send .
