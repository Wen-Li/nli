i have experiemc a situat mani time when i wa disappoint by the actual useful of a productb compar to the advertis on the televis . most advertis truli make product seem much better than they realli are . we see mani kind of advertis on almost everi channnel on televis , such as laundri soap which make dirti laundri exreamli white or jerm kill spray which kill all the jerm in three second . almost all product have catchi phrase and a song that goe with it which make us want to tri it at least onc . in japan , tv advertis play a big part in the societi . they have ring tone of a particular advertis song that we can download or t-shirt that have a charact of a specif charact of a product . they are part of our life , and we are often unawar that we are actual advertis those product . becaus televis advertis play a huge part in japan , peopl who make the advertis end up focus on the `` side effect '' rather than the actual useful of affect of a product . also , the compani which make advertis focu more on the `` look '' of the product than of the actual tast of the useful of the product or a dish , becaus their job is to gather peopl ' attent as much as possibl . when advertis someth , it is import to make sure that it look good and attract . but we alway have to be awar that they are sometim over exagger .
