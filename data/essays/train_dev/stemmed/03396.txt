i do n't think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , it is onli a differ way of enjoy theirselv and to perceiv emot . in my opinion there is more conscious in the way in which older peopl tri to enjoy and get the best from life , becaus they have live a whole life and they realli know what is import and what is not . they know , for exampl , that read is more import than watch a blockbust movi or than have a car race . young peopl wast a lot of time do thing that seem import to tham but which after a coupl of year would have lost their mean . furthermor young peopl often tri to have fun do danger sport or thing . for instanc , older peopl are use to visit art citi and to chose quiter locat for their holiday . thi is not a sign of luck of will to appreci life , not at all , it demonstr onli older peopl 's capac to live without all modern stuff which seem to be central and crucial in young peopl 's life , as tv , music , disco , nois , crowd place , videogam , and so on , and to appreci natur and historyc background . furthermor young pepl 's way to have fun is often superfici and selfish . they spend a lot of time do thing as watch tv or play videogam which both are activ which do n't stimol their skill and abil . these are also activities that do n't encourag guy to gather togeth , on the contrari they meke young peopl more and more lone .
