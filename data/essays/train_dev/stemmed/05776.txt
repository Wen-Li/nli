from my perspect , in twenti year time there will be fewer car circul abov all in big citi . there are a lot of reason that make me argu it . first of all citi are tri to improv more and more public transport : there are alway project for new and faster metropolitan line which can link differ citi zone in a real short time . moreov , pollut is becom a problem even more danger for the health of everybodi and all the diseas caus by pollut are make peopl awar of the necess of an altern to the use of the car and of other pollut privat transport like motorcycl . furthermor , have a car is alway more and more expens : taxat and insur cost are also veri high . besid the cost of oil is alway grow and if you add the cost of the park in central zone you can guess whi alway more peopl prefer public transport more than their own car . lastli also public transport like highspe train are be develop and i think that in a twenti year time all the major citi of europ will be reachabl in a veri short time , make useless the car also fo long journey . howev , problem remain in littl citi where car is necessari in winter or in raini day . but here also car are becom less and less popular . educ program in primari school teach the children to prefer to go to school with bicicl or with the schoolbu instead of with their parent ( and their own car ( and are spread a ecolog conscienc in new gener . as a conclus , i believ that own a car could be alway use , but the ecolog awar will make peopl use their car less .
