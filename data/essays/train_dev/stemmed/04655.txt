in my opinion , a broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than just special in one specif subject provid mani advantag . transfer the knowledg of one academ subject to anoth can often simplifi life . good knowledg of mathemat , for exampl , help in variou other academ subject like busi , econonim , physic , etc . other than that , be well educ in mani subject mean that you do not reli on other peopl as much . you have the knowledg ( `` power '' ) to decid by yourself what is right or wrong ( at least in your opinion ) have a broad knowledg in mani subject also keep you away from be a coach potato . if you show your interest in mani area you will see that there are connect that might be excit . then you want to learn more about it , you would to understand how thing are work . your brain keep be use . in thi way you are not just satisfi by know that your good at one topic and just leav the other topic unregard behind . look at senior citizen . mani older peopl that are still interest in mani topic also show good physic health . our societi is chang from a industri orient to a more servic orient one . thi impli chang in the job sector . job in the past will not be need to be done in the futur . but - go with thi - new job will be creat in field that we ca n't think of at the moment . if you just have knowledg in one specif subject rather than in sever one it might get realli difficult for you to find a good , satisfi job . compani are look for peopl that show a big interest in a varieti of topic . they believ that a broad knowledg help new employe to easili adapt to their new task at the compani . often , scientist are hire in the busi world becaus they are believ to think in a more logic , struct way . all in all , special in one topic is not complet wrong . but have a broad knowledg in mani academ subject truli enrich and simplifi life .
