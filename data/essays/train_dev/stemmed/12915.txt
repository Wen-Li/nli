i person disagre with the provid statement becaus i think that the number of car in use will remain basic constant through the year . first of all , i believ that twenti year will not carri enough chang to produc a variat of our habit and way of live . even if the public transport will be presum enhanc , most of the peopl will still need a car becaus the main commerci area such as shop center , cinema and other facil will be locat far away off the citi and they will still requir a car in order to be reach . moreov , accord to the statist , peopl who live in town will move to the adjac countrysid , owe to the high cost of live they are face now . secondarili , the car industri will probabl give it best in order to keep constant the annual incom . solut will be provid in order to let peopl replac their old vehicl , whithout just dismiss it . as an exampl , even now new method of payment are be introduc to allow driver to chang their car regularli dure the year . i suppos that even the western govern will help the vehicl sector in order to inhibit the unemploy consequ to a possibl crisi of the industri . in addit , in twenti year time , the pollut will probabl ceas to repres a problem . new hydrogen engin will be produc with the aim of contrast the rais of the pollut rate in the air . peopl will be more confid in buy new car with a new environment-friendli technolog . own a car will therefor remain a statu of econom wealth that no-on would refus . these reason are in my opinion enough to justifi whi the number of car will not chang in twenti year .
