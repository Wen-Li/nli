in my opinion , i agre with the statement that it is the best way to travel in a group which led by a tour guid . and my reason is basic on follow reason . firstli , travel with a tour group is safer than travel alon , be taken by a tour guid , you can go to anywher which have secur garente , otherwis , it is danger for you to go to a strang citi without someon take you . secondli , a tour guid can tell you were to go and what to see , obvious , they know better than we do , be taken by a tour guid , you can make your trip worth , and you wo n't wast your money which you spend on thi trip . thirdli , if you go to a foreign countri where the peopl speak foreign languag that you ca n't understand , it will be veri difficult for you to commun with other when you want to buy somet or ask fordirect , in that case you need a tour guid to help you . in conclut , it is better for us to have a tour guid and travel in group , becaus it 's safer , and you can receiv more help .
