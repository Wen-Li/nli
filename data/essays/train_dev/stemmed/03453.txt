i think that the best way to travel is with someon who know what they are talk about . when you travel , the main point is to learn from thi new place and it cultur . if one is to go by themselv then how is one learn , if the point of a trip is to learn and see ? of cours , a guid may not be much fun at time but there are trip where you have time off to do your own thing and have fun . when one goe on a trip , one doe not know all the main thing that are avail . sinc it is a new place one doe not know where the best food is , or where the best store are , or even where the most importand and beauti place are . if thi happen how will the trip be ani fun at all ? what if you go to the wrong place to eat . it may be an adventur but not a necessari sacrific for what is suppos to be a fun travel . a guid 's job is to teach the turist about the place they are visit and give them a brief descript of the place . a tour guid is an expert in thi which mean that one will get the right inform . travel with a group of peopl is not onli fun but benefici sinc the discov can be greater with more peopl put their thought in the discoveri . it is true that start from scratch may give a more detail and comprehens idea of the place , but thi is not someth that is done in a short amount of time which is whi have a tour guid is much easier . the group will learn togeth and the tour guid will teach what is necessari and in the free time offer one can ask the guid for place that are known are save and where one can make small person impress about the place be visit . travel with a group led by a tour guid is veri benefici . the tour guid is an expert who know what he or she is talk about . the tour guid will give all the necessari and most import inform about the place be visit . the group would make the trip a fun travel becaus one get to meet peopl and have fun with learn at the same time . basic , i do agre with the satat that the best way to travel is to be in a group with a good tour guid .
