i agre the follow statement `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' i realli think it is more impot to learn the idea and the concept more than the fact . student need a lot of idea to grow not onli their bodi , but their insid such as opinion and the way they think . i am not say that to learn fact is not import , but i think it is more import to learn idea and concept . i think fact come from idea and concept . if there is no fact , there would not be ani fact in my opinion . so i think student need to learn about the fact and concept and then learn about the fact . if they learn the fact first it would be difficult to understand whi it happen or whi it becam like that . today , the offic and the compani look for the idea and how creativ are the peopl when they hire new staff . you might learn some idea or the way it is , but if you learn idea it woud give you more fact and how it is . i believ that both are import but it is more import to learn about idea and concept today . fact might be more import to some other kind of job , but i think most of the job need more idea and concept than fact . in the old day they might need more fact instead of idea and concept , but today , it is more import to learn about idea and concept to improv your opinion and what you believ . final i think it is import to learn both `` idea and concept '' and `` facts. '' but fact need some idea and idea and concept caus fact . it mean they both need each other and peopl need to learn both . if you learn just either one it would not do ani good , but i think student shoud learn about idea and concept more than fact .
