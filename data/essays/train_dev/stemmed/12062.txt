i disagre with the statement that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than special in one specif subject . i believ that special and concentr in a singl specif subject is far more import for two reason . first , our life is limit . we do n't have enough time to learn about everi topic or subject dure our lifetim . if we can live for five hundr year as turtl doe , we can studi and learn almost everi access subject that we need to know . howev , the real is not . for exampl , if all student are educ in purpos of have broad knowledg without ani indept specif knowledg about scienc , they might understand how machin oper but they can not fix in case the machin stop or are destroy . we do not want our children to have onli shallow knoweldg in mani subject without their own specialti . second , i strongli believ that be equip with special knowledg may result in inspir peopl from use the specif knowledg and appli the knowledg to variou other area . in my case , i have been veri interest in collect butter fli in everi differ kind sinc i wa five year . thi hobbi made me read the relat book and articl about insect as much as i could . as i know about the insect more , i wa more deepli inspir from their behaviosr . as a result , i expand my hobbi to my major in colleg : biolog . in conclus , i think focus on a specif topic ha a lot more advantag than be a onli generalist . sinc our life span is limit and societi is well diversifi , we need more specialist than shallow generalist . also our cultur and technolog will be benefici from the peopl who have profound , indepth knowledg on specif subject as the societi 's environ becom more complic .
