some peopl think that most advertis doe n't make product seem much better than they realli are becaus some peopl think the look of product are more import then the quiliti of the product . howev , in my opinion , i think most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are three follow reason which can prove and give more exampl for my persan opinion . the most importand reason i think is that advertis know what comsum think when comsumv are shop . the outsid of look of product is most point peopl will think to buy the product . therefor the advertis speand more time to design what kind of look of better for prodcut then the time which they are design insid of product . thi point can help counpani to get more money becaus they dont have to spand too much time on insid of product design , and cumsum feel interest on product loo , so they buy it . produc insid of product easier then make the good design for outsid look is the second import reason which i have chosen to put here . i wa do a research paper which is about disguess how mani time peopl usual spend on design a new car . the research show me that design a new car engig should speed more then five year at lessest . becaus it ha too mani thing need to do for it , and sometim it ha some techengl gap which is hard to cross . howev , the outsid look is easier to do compar with design insid . therefor , most off time the product seem much better than they realli are . third , peopl usual care about the insid quiliti after they bought it . the thing for peopl to desid buy or not usual is outsid look . so peopl will complain the product when they bough it . howev , in thi point the compani give cumsun ' money alreay .
