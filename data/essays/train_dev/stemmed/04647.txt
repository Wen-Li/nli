i agre that it is more import for student to understand abstract idea and concept , becaus their colleg educ should give them a sound base of knowledg and not a mass of unrel fact . most student want to work at a compani after they graduat . if they had onli learn fact in colleg there is the possibilti that they wo n't need most of these fact . the colleg can not teach all of the divers fact that are need for a student to be an effici worker . it would be better for him to learn concept in colleg and learn mani fact later , when he need them for hi work . so , when you studi electron , and you learn everi fact about build person comput , and later came to a factori that build car comput , most of the fact you learn may be useless , but the concept of creat a comput in gener may come in veri handi . furthermor student who know the concept and idea can connect and thu better understand all the fact they may learn later on becaus they know how everyth is relat . for exampl , if a student with busi major onli learn fact about , say , germani , and not the concept that stand behind those fact , he might never be abl to fulli understand them , or to see that fact he learn about brazil can be compar to them . anoth argument is that fact can be easili access through a book or even the internet just at the time they are need . it would take much more time or even be imposs , to `` understand '' an concept just when need . the student probabl would n't even know which concept ist need , becaus he would not be abl to see the larger pictur . for exampl , if a biolog student in america ha the task to build a fish tank with exot fish , and he had learn what `` normal '' fish need , and how a fish tank work in colleg , he could just look up the differ between exot and `` normal '' fish on the internet , or ask a colleagu . if , on the other hand , he had no clue about the complex work in a fishtank , he might not be abl to complet hi task at all . of cours studi human anatomi or histori may requir more learn of fact than other scienc , like mathemat . but i think that the advantag of learn concept and idea much overweight the advantag of learn fact in gener .
