i think the best way to travel is by alon , not in a group led by tour guid . in my countri , there are a lot of tour agenc to differ countri . howev , travel should definetli alon becaus there is not much time the guid give , travel alon is more flexibl to control time and place to go , and tour inform they five can be found indivisu . in my person experi , tour guid give not enough time to see someth in one site . for exampl , i onc had a travel to northeastern unit state . i went to new york first . one amaz place wa broadway . those music poster , commerci , and store attract me . howev , the guid gave me onli one hour . i want to visit the store and see a music , but in one hour , all i could do wa take photo and buy a suveni . if someon is go to travel , he must have flexibl time to stay and do someth they want to do . music , cup of cofe or shop is their choic . if peopl travel alon or by their person group , they are more flexibl in time and decid where to go . when i wa in cuba , i want to go to the beach , but the day , it wa raini , so i chang my plan to stay indoor . and at even i enjoy dinner on cool temperatur beach . if someon travel in group with tour guid , you can not chang plan , you may go to beach on a raini day . also , you might go to somewher you do n't want to go and wast hour in a bu . peopl find tour guid becaus they are not good in that place . howev , inventon of internet , and so much book about that place , tell everyth about it . peopl can find map , place where view is good , where to eat delici food . then peopl can choos place to go by themselv . my parent , onc went to itali , with onli a book , and enjoy everyth without problem . for these reason , it is fun and also veri practic to travel alon or in a person group . flexibl scedul and indivisu prefer is the most import thing when peopl travel inde .
