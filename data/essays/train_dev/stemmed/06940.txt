i person agre with the statement that `` it is import to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . caus it is enough for a student to understand the idea and concept . accord to me , as a student , it is more import to have a clear idea and concept of a topic rather than go for the fact . the student should get a clear idea and grip on the topic so that he can know the thing well . student should first learn the thing from their lectur and then should have a knowledg on the particular subject , so gain knowledg is realli veri import in build one 's carrier . so the student should care follow the instruct given by the lectur in order to understand all the concept . for exampl , when i wa do my 10th class , i wa veri much interest in learn the fact rather than the subject . i allway use to spend time on find out the fact and concentr veri less on the concept of the topic , as a result i got a poor grade in my acedem . so after thi my teacher advis me to understand the idea and the concept than to understand the fact . i follow the instruct given by the teacher , and perform veri well in the next exam . so it realli import to have the knowledg of the subject than the knowledg of the fact . so as i experienc person , i can sure say that the student should have idea and concept of the topic . be a student it more than enough to get the knowledg of the particular subject , and under stand the concept of that particular subject than search for fact . . so , i person feel as a student , that understand the idea and the concept is more import than to learn the fact .
