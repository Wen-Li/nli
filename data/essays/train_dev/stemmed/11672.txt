i disagre with statement about to have broad knowledg on mani academ subject rather special in one specif subject . it is alway better to have one subject to get specialis more becaus it make the person strong enough to compet for certain job which especi requir special in some particular subject . i have present some exampl below to support my arguement . i have got two friend who are studi their undergradu in `` mechan '' , `` mechatrono '' as their major . the subject involv in mechan are pure relat to concept base on mechan . but the subject involv in mechatron are relat to mechan , electron , littl bit of comput scienc , i.e mechatron is a combin of the subject . when my both friend complet their undergradu in their respect field , i observ that the person who done hi major in mechan were abl to hire or get the job easili . in case of other friend thi ha not happen . here he is elig to attend the compani which requri mechan . electron , computersci background knowledg independ , that sound to be more specif in the subject mention abov . here my friend wa unabl to pursu the job as he lack more knowledg in depth to be requir for a particular compani . therefor for everi individu it is essenti to have an keen thorough knowledg or special in particular academ subject rather than have a broad knowledg on mani subject . thi case can better be explain in case of field of doctor 's profess . as we all know that a doctor who is special in one particular organ of our human bodi , say eye , heart , kidney etc. , are more valuedand paid than the doctor who have got enough knowledg on all aspect of the human organ . thi is the reason whi kidney specialist , heart specialist etc. , have more fame than other doctor who do n't have ani special degre in ani organ of oyr human bodi .
