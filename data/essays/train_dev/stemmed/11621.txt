in my my opinion i would agre that most advertis make product seem much better then they realli are . there are mani reason and way in which peopl can make low qualiti product look brilliant . the main highlight which peopl see is the packag of the product which can be excel and also interest also through tv and newspap advertis peopl give in easili without know the qualiti of the product just becaus they have seen or heard from their friend and neighbour . a product which can be good for other need not be neccesarili be good for you becaus nowadi in the market there are more fake product then their origin . the choic is is your whether you would be comfort with the product and doe it satisfi your need it would be safe to buy form a store where there are more custom which show the market valu . . i would also disagre for the follow reason . first , a new product which come in the market may look bad but can also turn out to be excel eg-a new shampoo which your friend ha use caus her hair to have split end thi may not be neccesarili happen to you you may have a better reaction to thi product like even for perfum you either like the smell or you dont . mainli advertis are the best techniqu to sell a product and a good way to get recogn in the market . other method also includ sell the product through door to door sell . peopl in the world believ mani advertis which come in magazin or newspap eg-for a fit program medicin there are mani fraud in the market sell fake medicin instead of the origin and these caus peopl to destroy their live due to the expens and uncertain of the item . i have dicuss both opinion whi advertis can be danger and brutal to your pocket if u do not pay attent from which shop the product is sold and what the market demand . but i would say that there are more fraud out there then salesman .
