i agre with the statement that young peol do not give enough time to help their commun . but first of in my opinion thi is not a problem of the youth , it is a problem of the societi in gener . commun and groub seem to disappear or be less steadi . often there is no deep connect anymor , somehow more artifici . so how should the youth help more in commun when they doe not seem to be reali involv ? for exampl the famili system ha chang masiv dure the year . some year ago the grandpar use to live in the household togeth with their children and the children ' offspr . so the contact between children and their grandpar wa mutch closer . as a result the teen more often help to take care of the ill grandpar lie in their bad . on top of that not all young peopl went to school espaci the girl often onli should work in the hous so they had more time to heli in the commun ` famili ' than for exampl the girl today . so in these day the young peopl live in differ conditio so in my opinion it is difficult to compar the young peopl action in a comun in the past and in the present . so all in all the whole societi becam more anonymi . on the one hand the peopl have more freedom and on the other hand they are less bound to social group or commun and these logic ha an efect on their behaviour . so to my mind thi feel of bee not respons for the comun is not a caracteruist of the youth instead it 's a caracterist of the whole societi . on top of that the best help that a young person could do for hi commun and countri is to be well educo and get a good job to be abl to pay tax for the commun and to creat new jobopertunuti for other . but finallzi i want to add that it can not be wrong if there would be more volunt social work
