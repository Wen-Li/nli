gener speak i fulli agre with the statement that student should focu on grasp the underli base of a concept than to know all fact by heart . my main reason for have that opinion is becaus today 's strucur of inform flow is fast and constantli chang . today there are mass of inform avail through new technolog e.g. via the internet . new find are constantli publish and replac inform that ha previous been accept . therefor , to me it no longer make sens for a student to memor all fact by heart . it is rather necessari that basic knowledg about a studi field and relat investig method are taught in school and univers . as state abov fact are subject to chang and revis but with a profound basic understand student will be abl to absorb new fact and integr them in their knowledg of the world . thi way they are abl to success face challeng , that find solut to problem that have not been address to yet . if one need to refer to fact , student can look those up in lexica or consult internet sourc . these are the main point whi i think it is crucial for student to have a basic understand and how differ topic are relat to each other , to know aspect that they have in common and where they differ . it 's more a net of knowledg . howev thi doe not impli that fact knowledg is worthless and i can think of area where it is crucial to have the inform instantli avail . to illustr thi thought one can think of a doctor in the emerg section in hospit . thi is a situat where time is a limit recours and second might decid whether a patient live or die . here the doctor should know all fact about medicin and consequ of action when treat the patient . the same is true for pilot and other critic profess . to sum it up as state abov a gener understand of a field is more import for student , consid later challeng in life , than to be abl to recit inform an fail to come to the core of an idea . howev as the exampl of a doctor in the ambul show some basic inform need to instantli access in situat when time is scarc .
