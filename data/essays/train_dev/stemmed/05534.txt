i think against the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . to tell you the truth , my oppinion is just the oppsosit for the reason which follow . first , becaus older peopl have more money than young peopl in gener , they can some activ that yougng peopl can not do . they earn money as offici of the govern , emplye of compani or some els while young peopl go to school and pay tuition . they can do somethig funni by use thi money . let me show an exampl . older peopl can dine at famou restraunt or go lugujuri trip that is what young peopl admir but can not attain for econom problem . second , older peopl feel more on the same thing than young peopl , becaus they have more experi . let me talk about my person experi , sever year ago i made a trip to rome with my aunt and see some sightse spot . when we go to some place , my aunt suddenli burst to tear and talk me about romanc she made with her ex-lov in rome . she sure enjoy the tirp more than me thank to thi romanc . certaili , there are someth that are said to be enjoy by young peopl . for exampl , love . of cours , love we made in our youth is sweet and preciou momori for all of us . but who decid older peopl cannnot make love ? older peopl can make sweet love in the same way as young peopl do , and get wonder memori . besid that woul be more enjoy for their experi as i show in the third paragraph . for the reason abov , i think older peopl can enjoy life more than young peopl . they can do someth young peopl can not do thank to better econom situat , feel more owe to their affluent experi and do the thing that is usuali said as if the privilag for youth sach as love .
