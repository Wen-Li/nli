in my opinion it is better to have knowledg of one specif subject extens , rather than have some knowledg in all the field . there are a few reason name - accuraci , danger of half knowledg and special is onli after some gener knowledg - that i ventur to opin in favour of special . firstli if a person is more wide knowledg in the field of hi own interest , he not onli perform well but also is abl to put in hi own effort in the form of inform to be use more accur . for exampl a doctor , if he is special in heart and it relat aspect he is capabl of help a patient more effici than a gener physician would . secondli like i said danger of half knowledg are not unknown to us . if we have not master even one subject we can not put in ani effort to get someth out of our knowledg . we do not have a sens of direct in which to proceed also we have to stop in the middl of an invent or discoveri becaus we do not know what lie ahead . thi can also be decis for the growth of a societi on the whole . final for ani special to happen on ani subject we start with a knowledg of variou feild relat or unrel which might help in the better understand our field of interest so the knowledg of all academ subject is in a way the foundat stone of ani specializaion and is therefor a part of the learn process . like i state if it is a cardiologist in question then he would have some knowledg of the whole bodi function as that is evid relat . thu i can safe say that special not onli help in develop our skill in our own field of interest , it also is the destin for some knowledg that we acquir in all the subject . eventu help us to matur as an individu , as an adroit in our field and in the growth of societi on the whole .
