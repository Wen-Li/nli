it is state that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . accord to my opinion , i am not agre with thi statement , but i am not neither disagre with it . fisrt of all , i think that it is better to be special in one specif subject , becaus if you learn too mani differ subject at the same time you will be confus , and instead of learn a lot of thing you will not learn anyth . i also think that it is better to special in one specif subject becaus you will learn a lot about the subject , you will be teach everyth you have to know about it , and you will know all it differ characterist . for exampl , if you arriv to univers and you choos to learn econom scienc , i think it is better to take differ cours relat to it than to take , for exampl , one italian class , one class of modern art and . .. that are not relat togetth . in that way you will learn everyth you have to know about econom . in anoth way , i am not total agre with the statement . i think that it is also an import thing to have gener knowledg , or , in differ word , to be abl discuss sever subject . for exampl , if someon onli like learn about natur or anim and so decid to be teach onli thi subject , he will not be abl to have a polit discuss or an histori discuss becaus he will have learn onli one subject . to conlud , i think that everybodi should have the choic to special in one specif subject , the one they like the most , but they would also have to have broad knowledg of mani subject .
