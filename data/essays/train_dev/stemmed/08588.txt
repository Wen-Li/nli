i can not realli agre with the opinion state abov . i think that understand concept , as well as learn fact , are equal import . on the one hand , it is veri import to understand an underli idea . it is the base to appli it to new context and to connect it with other concept . it is an essenti abil to suce in exam and it even enabl the further develop of new hypothes or even whole theori . in my opinion , real understand prove if someon is an intellig , independ think person . and these are necessari attribut for a success research and a satisfi academ career . for exampl , the principl of mani basic learn theori , investig by skinner , where cite by numer other research . the research conduct mani interest experi , result in highli use applic . in the other hand , you can not deni the import of knowledg of fact . sure , the sole learn of fact wa exagger for a long time . whole gener of student onli had to repeat inform without have to prove their understand . i total agre , that thi doe not make ani sens . i also permit that it is hard work to learn them and it seem senseless from time to time . nevertheless , fact are import . it is not suffici if research have understood a main principl . they have to know all includ variabl of a theori , how the experi were conduct , whi , in which content . they should be awar in which time period a theori wa invent and a fact wa discov and by whom . thi is all fruit background inform . the first thing to learn are fact . then understand of the underli idea is the next import step . and final the further connect and applic follow . the last step could not be achiev if one of the earlier step would be miss . therefor i draw the conclus that you can not say which of the two learn strategi is more import for a student .
