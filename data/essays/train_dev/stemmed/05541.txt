i believ that peopl do enjoy life more when they are young than when they age . life is a gift and need to be enjoy to the maximum . consid a young kid about 15-20 year of age , for him life ha just begun . he is open out to a world where there is joy and peac , sorrow and grief both at a time . for thi young lad , almost everyth he doe is hi first time at it and will be excit no matter what . on the contrari peopl age let us say about 35-50 year have alreadi seen all that the young kid ha seen and gone through . for the old life just pass by . younger children often are more energet and enthusiast and yet more vibrant in do someth mostli if it is for the first time . while for the elderli , they have too mani respons and burden on their shoulder that they do not seem to enjoy . that whi they take time off from work for a vacat to relax , just to get back and start all over again . in a way even if the old want to enjoy they still are held back and are circumscrib in their way . i believ the main reason whi the young enjoy life more is that they do not have ani burden at their tender age . all they have to take care is their grade and studi . the rest all are taken care of from their parent . the old even when they retir think of their grandchildren and their educ . the beauti in life as i think of it is to live each day as a gift as thi is mostli found in the young .
