somebodi might say , that as peopl grow richer , more peopl can afford car , while other might argu , that as fossil fuel grow scarc , peopl will abondan car for more energi save mean of transport such as buss and train . in thi topic i will repres both of these opinion , and give my person opinion on it , too . when the car wa invent , in the late 19th centuri , no one would have expect thi invent to becom as big as it is now . a long time after the invent had been done , onli the veri rich could afford a car , and the advantag of have one were veri limit . there were not enough pave road , the car were slow and unreli , and there were plenti of other form of transport around , that seem a lot more promis for the futur . howev , due to mass product the price for car dwindl , highway got built and thank to the world wide econom recoveri in the fifti and sixti most peopl in the industri world were abl to purchas motor vehicl . while the market for car in the develop world might have been satur year ago , third world countri have been abl to increas the number of car in use there dramat over the last decad or so . and as mani of these countri seem to boom at an insan pace , who know just how mani car will circul on thi planet in 20 year time . it might seem like there is no limit to it . howev , i person do not agre with that . thi is mainli due to two current develop that have been taken place for quit a while now : the energi sourc , that most car run on is ga . howev oil reserv are be use up and some expert claim that within some decad from now , all of the earth 's oil will have been deplet . so unless a new way of make car run is discov , fewer and fewer car will be abl to run . the other develop , unfavor to a gro is global warm : peopl all over the globe have realiz , that co2 emiss caus by car ( and mani other thing as factori , powerpl and so on ) is damag the ozon layer , which is need to keep the earth 's temperatur stabl . by use public transport instead of one 's person vehicl a lot of these co2 emiss could be reduc . it might also be possibl that govern , will interfer pute a quota on how much each person can drive hi car . so my person opinion is that car will be less use by the year 2026 than now . if , howev , altern power sourc for car like hydrogen or solar energi , becam cheaper , i person can not tell whether more or less car will be in use in 20 year time .
