to answer thi question , it is also import to know about the intent advertis have . for sure they want to spot their product into a brighter light , becaus they want to persuad the custom to buy their product . gener you can assum , that a good manag doe not want to make hi product better than it actual is , but he want to pictur hi product rel better than the competitor ' product . therefor an advertis sometim make product seem much better than they realli are , but it doe not have to be . in case advertis exagger , it will arous neg disson at the custom and they will be veri unsatisfi . on the other hand the statement depend a lot on the interpret of the potenti custom 's behaviour . if he interpret the advertis in that way , then it is absolut unimport what the advertis want to express with the advertis . due to thi two point of view ( advertis or manag vs. custom ) i do not agre to thi statement entir . mayb , becaus i am tri to be both . a manag as well as a custom . nonetheless if thi statement is true or not , you should alway make the assumpt , that an advertis doe not reflect the realiti correctli . if you do not make thi assumpt , you possibl get disappoint , when you buy a product , mani time . thi probabl will happen , becaus not everi manag take into account , that neg disson can have bad consequ to the consum ' behavior . addit you should not forget anoth parti , which is involv into the process of develop an advertis . it is the advertisement-ag . the alway want to exagger and put everyth into nice and beauti color . mani time the have so much influenc into the ad final , in short word , i do not agre to the statement , but i would tell everybodi , that an intellig custom alway take thi possibl into account . otherwis you eventu put your money into the wrong invest .
