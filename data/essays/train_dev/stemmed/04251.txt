it often happen in school and colleg that student do not understand some topic and so cram it up and often forget it dure the exam time . i believ it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . ofcours it is sometim much easier to just learn pre-stat idea or establish fact then to do reseach on a topic . take for exampl , einstein 's equat of mass and enegi relat : e = m ( c ) 2 . we might just want to learn it as it is in school , rather than tri to prove it like einstien did , becaus we neither have the time nor the intellig to prove it at that level . howev lack of time or `` einstein 's brain '' is no excus to just learn everi fact as it is . it is easier to rememb inform if we tri to understand the concept involv in that particular phenomenon . for exampl , teach a 5th grade student that `` sun rise in the east '' is okay , but the student should also understand that it rise in the east becaus earth rotat from west to east in an anti-clockwis manner . when a person tri to understand the idea and concept , he question common belief and tri to find answer to question that pop into hi mind thu strengthen hi inquisit and improv hi knowledg . understand a topic , make it more interest and make learn easier . it also make recal an idea dure exam easier . other than just improv one 's own knowledg , while tri to understand idea by question the common belief , one might even make new discoveri . it might make a person curiou about a topic or a phenomenon . besid , crame make studi bore and monoton . it reduc our concentr level and thu reduc our effici . thu it is alway better to understand idea and concept than just learn fact .
