i agre the idea that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' , becasu i have three model of the success peopl . first , one of the three success peopl is my old brother . when he wa a junior high schoo student , he did not like to studi veri well . he did not studi , so hi grade wa not good . but one day , he met a high school teacher in the town . then he thought i want to be hi student , so i want to take the hi school entranc exam . but the school studi revel is high . i should studi hard . after my brother met the teacher , he studi veri hard . so he could get better grade than befor , and he could be one of a student of the teacher 's high school . second , one of the three success peopl is mr. toyota . he creat the big and famou car compani in japan . i think the compani wa one of the famou car compani in the world . when he wa a child , hi famili wa poor . becasu he must help to hi famili in hi child age , he could not get studi oppotun well . hi father 's job wa small bike store , so when he graduat junior high school , he wa presid of the small compani . then he creat idea of corpor like big american trrain comopani . the idea wa veri big risk then , becasu it wa not common idea in japan . today , hi compani becam a big compani . third , one of the three success peopl is syoinn yoshida . he wa one of the most famou peopl in japan . he wa teacher in meiji era . when he wa teacher , he thought japan should learn from other contori like england or america . but then peopl , who go to abroad without permitt from govern , wa veri big crime . but he tri to go to america . he swam to the america 's big boart at the night . and he tri to go to america . but then american offic did not permit becaus america did not want to attack . but the stori made japan courag .
