we can see mani success peopl is word such as bill ghate and einstin . bill ghate made a lot of money form creat a softwar call window and einstin made a great theori such as e = mc2 . even the way they succ is differ the common thing is that they gave there entir life to built it . in my opinion success peopl doesn ; t tri new thing but tri to develop the thing they can do well . bill ghate met hi first comput when he wa 14 year old . at that time there wa two famou compani call macantoshi & appl ( well later they unit though ) . he tri to learn comput becaus if wa veri interest . later at the age of 18 befor graduat he made a school comput system by himself . thi kind of result wa abl becaus he constantli develop hi talent . in my opinion for succes find and challeng a new way is also import but constantli tri is also import . einstin is also a succes person is physic . hi new theori about black energi , black hole , time , light and movement destroi newton and platon 's theori and made a new page is the histori of physic . it is hard to believ that thi huge theori wa made by a singl man . in my opinion that the reason it wa abl is becaus he alway thaught about physic . mani book and research say that he thaught about physic 60 percent of hi time . as you can see success peopl develop there talent rather than find a new way . to conclud i think that success peopl find there talent and develop what they alreadi know how to do rather than find a new thing to do . it is becaus no pain no gain . not tri ani thing and seek for chanc to succeed can never make a good result .
