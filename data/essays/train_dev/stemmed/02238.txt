i disagre that it is import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for the to learn fact becaus in today world , in order to achiev success a care plan is need and plan can not be done without fact and figur . for instanc , if a scientist ha an idea or a belief , than he need to experi it to get fact that support the belief and than when he get thi support fact than the theori becom a law and would accept univers . so , in order to prove ani thought belief and idea the fact are requir . moreov , student should learn about fact and thi will not onli help them in their futur job but also in everi desicion either person or profession which they make , will be much more realiabl and result would be certain and fruit . while knowledg and understand of idea and concept is also nesseari as without them the person would not be abl to set goal in live and direct hi full energi to achiev it nor he will be abl to gain success in life . for exampl , suppos an employe ha been given a project . so , the employe need to studi it than understand the concept , plan a idea , plan a stratergi , do research and find factsand figur which support the concept and on the basi of these fact he could also estim the profit and submit the report , than the deal would be sign and succ in profit desir would be achiev and hi work would be appreci and he might get reward for it . thu the knowledg of concept and idea is import but fact are the evid thu , when support the former than it is implement and the success is confirm . wherea , the employe could also complet the report by indic the fact and figur and submit it , but an effici , employe would studi find pro and con and evalu the deal abil to provid desir profit that are expect by the owner and thu work for better of hi compani . therfor , the knowledg of both idea and concept and fact are import as they are interrel , but without fact the idea or concept do not have ani signific .
