i person agre with the fact that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i may say that thi aspect of our contemporari societi is not due to the selfish behaviour of new gener ; there is someth deeper that can explain thi situat . we belong to the internet era ; everyth is flow , everyth is move veri quickli . the societi and it way of live have chang a lot from the 20th centuri : nowaday peopl have less time for themselv and so for the other . although help poor and needi peopl and other remark activ are still commom in our commun , veri few young peopl do that , just becaus they are not educ to ; the will to help their own commun is someth that young peopl have to find insid themselv and onli their parent can help them in thi . to sum up i might say that everi era in histori ha it own children . the globalis era ha been make the world like a big total town ; everyth is near or it seem to . in thi situat we can understand whi a littl commun may not catch the attent of young peopl ; they are son of the world and they might find difficult to look at it from the perspect of a littl town .
