`` young lpeopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . '' thi statement might sound true becaus it is commomli known that a joyfulsoul and a young heart exist in a young bodi . but i have person an object about both statement : a young heart can still exist in old bodi if one know how to enjoy hi life and make himself happi . an old person should convinc herself that she is not a teenag anymor and that she can not do the think she use to do when she wa young . thi way thi old person would adapt to her situat and tri to accomod the thing she is abl to do to the ongo life . mani activ can fullfil the life of an old person and steel away the feel of gettin board . few exempl may support my disagr with the state subject : by read , practic sport if possibl , help peopl , a person may still find herself use to the societi . thi feel break away sad and unhappi momemt . by work as a volont if possibl , someon may feel that he is realli help instead of spend the day wonder what to do . grandkid , most of the time love to stay with their grandpar and listen to stori from the past . dedic time to grandkid strengthen the relationship between parent and grandchildren which will bring joy to the life of a grandpar . mani other thing also help old peopl to integr in the societi , like particip into religi and social activ , work in a natur context ( agricultur .. ) , travel . .. still the problem persist with sick old peopl who are physic unabl to reach anywher or are not enough educ to fullfil their time with intellectu activ . .. these peopl still can be happi if they realli have a young heart , if they love other peopl and especi their surround rel . when one know how to love , he will be love and will have a joy life .
