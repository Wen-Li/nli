there are a varieti of peopl in the world that ha differ profess . between them , there are success and unsuccess peopl use their talent . in my opinion , what make thi differ is that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do that they alreadi know how to do well , when the unsuccess peopl do n't . three reason will support thi idea ; by take risk , they will grow respect to other , understand fear of go out from the comfort zone , and experi differ world that would make hi or her own profess improv . firstli , peopl should know how to respect other peopl for live in a societi . if you could n't understand , or at least tri to understand what other peopl are say , you could not observ import opinion that might help your talent improv . what is true in everi success peopl are , that they observ peopl 's idea , see if it is valuabl for him or herself , and make it their own advantag . secondli , peopl grow more matur when they know how it feel to lose . understand and experienc the fear to step outsid from your comfort zone , and explor the outer world and other peopl 's point of view , make you more thought . if they happen to know onli themselv and hi or her sorround , they would have an extem short-sight and stubborn point of view . they will be overly-confid and proud about themselv and thi will defin not help the person to succeed in their profess . thirdli , exposur to an area that you have n't experienc befor would be veri effici for the person 's own growth as a human be . risk yourselv and tri someth new , or observ new inform and reflect it to your own activ , put spice to your profess that result in an evolut of your talent . in conclus , by risk your own properti and experienc the world you do not know , make the person more of a kind and respect , intellig man or a woman . therefor , i think that it is benefici to take risk rather than stay in their comfort zone .
