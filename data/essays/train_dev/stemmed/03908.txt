it 's the `` etern strife '' between the seller and the custom . as we walk through the street of a citi today and just look around , if we just give a glanc to a newspap or a magazin , if we turn on the tv for a few second , what we see is that we live in a cultur made for a great part of advertis . what they are is easi to defin : short , colour , attract and effect ( or suppos to be so ) messag , call our attenct to product of the most variou sort . what 's behind their glitter surfac ? that 's the question that amaz and sometim confus the custom and that he goe on wonder for some time . unfortun , the answer is that often what we find is not what we expect to handl and we have to conclud that teh singl product is not such a good staff as it wa suppos to be . for exampl , some year ago a famou industri had for some time it car advertis by a short movi , in which the car wa run on the water around mount s. michel , franc . it wa realli impress , but as the car came out in the market , it reveal to be inferior to the standard of the hous . a field especi affect by mislead advertis is that of food stuff : deli present as prodigi or incred tasti have often not safe origin , or not good tast . the reason that hide behind all of that , you can easili track out : market is one of the finest and most expens busi of our time . market is go to look more and more like an art , whose task is not to inform the custom about real qualiti of the product , but to make the best of it , to describ it in the most imagin and intrigu way . it 's also import to rememb that a great amount of money is invest in trade by singl or group seller and the effort to have effect advertis is normal equal to the product effort . as it happen normal in human life , is possibl to find a glanc of good just adopt the right perspect : about advertis , mayb ther will be a time when we should not ask if they are reliebl or not , if they tell us the truth or an amount of lie . just look or listen to the stori and enjoy the glitter tale !
