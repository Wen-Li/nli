the statement in the titl point out an import issu in educ : is it more urgent to memor inform or to develop transvers capabl ? of cours student need to learn fact . how could i understand the histori of my countri without know what ha happen in the last centuri ? further , if we did n't studi the biograph fact of an author , then we would lose import inform that might have been use in order to get the mean of hi poetri . in my experi , it is use to know and display some knowledg also when i have to support an opinion , sinc my idea becom more concret and persuas . consid these advantag , tradit school use to stress the mnemon side of learn , creat well prepar student . on the other hand , these student could be a bit rigid . for instanc , my italian teacher at highschool did n't accept ani altern way of present the content and she expect us to memor page and page , without ask for ani critic develop . the result is that i forgot the most part of the literatur i studi in those year , which is a real shame ! while tradit school use to put too much emphasi on learn fact , modern teacher , on the contrari , tri to focu on concept rather than on mere fact . a deep understand of the key idea of an author , for instanc , impli a doubl advantag . on one hand it is easier to rememb someth that you have thought about : my english teacher , for instanc , use to ask for our opinion regard an author 's idea and she even tri to make sens of phrasal verb , in order to let us memor them ! on the other hand , when you becom familiar with idea and concept , you are like to improv your capabl of think with your mind . sinc in my opinion thi is the first aim of school , far beyond a mere transmiss of content that could be forgotten veri easili , i agre with the statement in the titl .
