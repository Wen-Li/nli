there are huge number of advertis that are be produc these day . in my opinion , these advertis highlight the qualiti of a product , explain whi we need to buy their product and give us an idea of how they are benefici over other product of similar qualiti . advertis provid us with the fact . they show us what the product realli are . firstli , advertis provid us the qualiti or the featur of a particular product . they tri to convinc a consum by provid all the inform about their product . for exampl , consid adevrts cereal . an advertis about a cereal would give us inform about the percentag of calori , calcium or other vitamin that peopl gain becaus of that cereal . the advertis is not exagger anyth about the percentag . they are all fact and we can get the inform on the cereal box . the advertis can not lie about such inform . second , almost everi advertis explain whi we need to buy a particular product . after all , that is the purpos of an advertis . they give us signific detail about the background of their product . for exampl , an advertis about an intel pentium processor iv make us realis that we need an effici processor to run our comput program . they tell us about the nano technolog and how it ha been incorpor into their product to make it more effici than other processor . thi seem to be overwhelm to a buyer . howev , they need to know what is go on with the product that they are about to purchas . moreov , a lot of advertis compar their product with other product of similar kind . thi is onli to show how their product are far better than the other product . in conclus , i think that advertis onli show the best qualiti of their product . they do n't make up anyth to make their product seem much better than they realli are .
