it is a much debat topic in psycholog , in compani or among friend what actual make a success person success . are there certain characterist that all successful peopl have in common ? characterist that are essenti ? do we for exampl need to be risktak in order to be success ? sometim it is state that success peopl are not satisfi with thing they areladi know how to do well . they do not rest on their achiev but rather go out , explor , take risk and are will to do and tri out someth new . i would say that there are a lot of differ way to be success . it is not onli depend on the definit of success ( is not the same for everybodi ) , but also on the area or subject in which you are work or let say be success . for exampl someon that ha a certain special can be success in a certain profess without that abov state charactersit . a model for instanc just look veri well and s/he can be veri success in her subject without ever go new way or take risk . s/he just ha to stick on what s/he alreadi know . in other area i would say it is definit essentail to be a risktak . for exampl when you are work in a research depart it is essenti that you have good and new idea . that characterist is necessari to be abl to perform thi job well becaus if you are alway just think about what you alreadi know there would never be ani progress . anoth exampl is when you want to open up an own busi . you are definitley go a new , unexplor way by do thi becaus you can not predict for sure how thing will develop . in my opinion it is not essenti to tri new thing or take risk in order to be succes . i would rather use thi statement the other way around : when you are risktak and you like to explor new thing you are more like to be success than a person that alway stick to the thing s/he alreadi know .
