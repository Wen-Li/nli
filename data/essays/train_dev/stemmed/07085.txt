mani peolp have one or even more car . in today time they have becom veri import to mani peopl and they can not miss them anymor . i do not agre with the statement : in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in my oppinion ther will not be mani disadvanatg of car in the futur anymor . there will be other sourc of energi for car that neither would be so bad for the environ nor would they be so expens as energi is today . as a result , mani peopl would like to drive their car just becaus it is fun . becaus drive a car will be extremli secur in twenti year , there will be other type of car invent that will be use just for fun . even poor peopl will be abl to drive a car just for fun . drive in a car would be much more comfort than it is today . in addit to that there will be a better system of street ; as a result , there will not be so much traffic anymor . so all in all there will not be mani disadvantag left . in twenti year the peolp will be more bussi than today . therefor they will need the car to move fast from one point to anoth . it will be veri import to have a perfect time-manag . the peolp also will use the car in other way as today . they will use their car for meet with other peopl or to have a braek and eat someth in the car . in my oppinion the car will play anoth role in the whole live of the peopl . all these argument support my oppinion , and show whi i do not agre with the statement . the car is veri import to mani peopl today and becaus of the develop of the problem , not to have enough time , it will be imposs to miss the car for the most peopl . as a result , there will be mani car in twenti year .
