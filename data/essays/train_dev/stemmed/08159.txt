i do n't think travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best way . as i have a lot of travel experinc i am convinc that travel by yourself is the best way to do it . with do so you have much more freedom becaus you can make decis on your own and do n't have to consid someon els . thi also prevent you from possibl argument with the group or your travel partner which could lead to a vacat you do n't enjoy fulli . anoth import advantag , in consider of a tour guid , is that you get to explor place on your own and do n't have to stick to a certain travel itinerari . thi offer you a lot more possibl and you can stay at place you like and avoid the one you do n't like . tour guid have their program which they run through everi trip . i think thi is unperson . when i am travel i want an individu rout that 's the perfect fit for me and get the most out of my time . mostli you wo n't find thi in a guid tour becaus it is design to satisfi the need of a broad rang of peopl and a lot of time cover the realli touristi spot . i am not such a fan of thi . you get to know a countri much better if you go to place where the local peopl are instead of all the tourist . when travel alon you are much more respons to new peopl . while i wa travel in australia i met so mani new peopl which i probabl never would have talk to , if i would have been in a group . but when you are by yourself you are more open for make new friend , just for the simpl reason to not be alon all the time . furthermor it broaden your cultur knowledg and understand . last but not least it is more expens to book a guid tour than to explor the countri by yourself .
