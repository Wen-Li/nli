it is quit difficult for me to agre or disagre with the statement . first of all , it is quit obscur that what the word `` enough '' mean . there are mani young japanes who help their commun , but whether they give `` enough '' time to do it depend on the subject view of how much time young japanes should spend their time on help their commun . older gener may disagre with the statement becaus they may have spent lot of their time in their commun . the gener of the parent of the young japanes of today may think that it is simpli imposs for young japanes to spend their time on help their commun taken into consider the ever-intensifi competit among the young gener . mani young japanes spend huge amount of their time in both compulsori and privat educ such as `` juku , '' a cram school young japanes go to after school . thu , mani parent may think that young peopl do spend `` enough '' time to help their commun , although they have mani other thing to do . i can say niether that i agre nor that i disagre with the statement , therefor , due to the ambigu definit of the word `` enough . '' it all depend on the reader of the statement . howev , i may agre with the statement . young peopl may not spend much of their time to help their commun , probabl becaus there are onli few `` commun '' in japan particularli in larg citi . now peopl move from one place to other place much more often than it use to be , and , as a result , they have fewer opportun to establish their commun itself . when there are no commun as such , peopl can have no time to spend on their commun . thu , the statement impli that young peopl do not spend their time on help commun even though there are commun which young peopl are suppos to help , but they do not give their time possibl becaus the `` commun '' are disappear from the japanes societi now .
