it would be realli difficult not to agre with thi statement . everyon of us ha , at least one time in hi or her life , experienc a supermarket and bought someth from it . it would be hardli the case not to have realiz that a great part of the good that we took home from that supermarket , show to be much less satisfi or valuabl than what we had been present by advertis . it would be too naiv to ask ourselv whi it happen . we all know the answer : produc compani stimul and exploit our wish and desir , about buy someth nice , tast or appeal , in order to elev the sell figur and earn more . instinct , one could say that it 's an immor behaviour and that it could also be defin as heavili cheat . the interest fact , though , is that we perfectli know that it will happen and we are consciou what we will face , onc confront with the realiti of the product we would buy . it 's a sort of a theatral play , where everi caracht ha it place and role : the produc compani know that they will boost the qualiti of their product in the advertis , we know that we will have to reduc by half our expect on the product we buy . so much for the raw , actual situat . but doe thi acknowledg make ani differ about the moral of thi `` play '' ? i do n't think so . i consid such a behaviour , by the produc compani , higli deprec and , at least , a-mor , if not immor . profit ha the upper hand over trust , and that should n't happen . but i consid myself pragmat enough to live up with it .
