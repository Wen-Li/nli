in my opinion , in the first part of our academ path , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . there are mani reason which support my point of view . first of all , peopl need to have a good knowledg of the most of subject in order to understand which is the one they like most . how can we know what we like if we do n't know the distinct possibl ? otherwis , without a 360 degre view , he would n't be abl to say which is hi our favourit field of interest . the second point regard the import of ani singl subject . each one of those transmit someth uniqu and unsubstitut . as mathemat develop our right part of the brain , literatur and art work on the left one . and the same concept could be infer to all other subject . the studi of a given subject , doe n't onli increas our knowledg of it , but improv also some of our person skill and i think we need ani kind of capac in order to to be success in life . anoth import point is about the social consequ of a high bandwidth knowledg . be inform on a lot of subject open us the chanc to have convers in distinct context and thu the chanc of know distinct peopl . i think it is veri import in a man 's life to have a larg varieti of knowledg becaus it could lead to an activ social life . howev , even if it ha to be most consist part , i think a horizont studi of mani academ subject ha to be necessarli follow by a more vertic phase . after we have understood what we prefer we need to get special in someth in order to creat our main interest , upon which we might build our futur and our job .
