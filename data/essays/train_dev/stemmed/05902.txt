is a broader knowledg go to increas onc perspect in busi and life ? let us think about a child in school at the age of 15 . in thi case i would recom that a child ha to learn a wide rang of subject in order to becom more intellig and reciev a good knowleg from hi school . but regard a young person , at the age of 16 or abov , who would like to go to univers it seem neccessari for me that student get a deeper knowledg about one specif field . as everyon know everyon is individu and ha differ interest in differ subject . in regard to that : how can someon who doe not like or is even not familiar to biolog studi thi subject ? in addit to that our environ need peopl who have deep knowledg , for exampl in the pharma industri . onli these peopl are abl to creat new medicin to help peopl with difficult diseas . it is necessari that these person are well inform about what they are do otherwis it is a veri riski oper . further more there could hardli be ani competiton in our busin life if everyon ha the same educ without ani special . how could employe decid whether a person is suit or not for a job which expect deeper knowledg ? and what about a person who is interest in math , but thi is the onli thing thi person is abl to do ? it would get lost in the big competit and would never have ani chanc in improv hi uniqu skill . as a conclus i can say that specif is the onli way to improv a person skill and to keep competit alif . peopl need specif as otherwis the uniti and importac of a person would get lost and as a result of that one person would be unsatisfi , sad and helpless .
