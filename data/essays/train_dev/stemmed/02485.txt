there are mani way we can choos in our trip . there are two major and popular way for trip . one is travel in a group led by a tour guid , the other is travel by oneself . in my opoinion , i do n't agre with the follow statement about `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . '' i have travel in a differ place sinc i wa a child . i travel both in a group led by a tour guid and by myself . dure these experi , i disagre with the follow statement about `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . '' there are some reason and exampl to support my answer as follow . in my opinion , first , it 's wast time to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . mani peopl will choos to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , becasus they think it 's safe , especi they are in a foreign countri . but , i think too mani peopl will wast mani time . becaus differ peopl have differ interest , travel is in a group led by a tour guid , they ca n't make all of you feel the trip is just for you . sometim travel is in a group led by a tour guid will guid you to visit some place which are unnecessari or you do n't like . becaus travel agenc ca n't satififi all of you . the second reason to support my answer is it 's wast money . when you join in a group led by a tour guid . it is certain they can arrang all your plan in a trip total and you do n't have to worri mani thing . but they will ask you to give them extra fee and tip in mani way . third and last reason is you do n't have free and flexibl time . as for me , i went to foreign countri for studi for one month by meself . although i 'm not good at the languag , compar with other peopl i had much more free time and learn mani thing in travel by myself . i have mani differ experi in travel . thi is way i disagre `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
