i agre with the statement . in my opinion it is common knowledg that advertis make product seem better than they realli are . for verifi the statement you just have to think about what advertis is for . what is the sens in advertis ? thi can be answer quit clearli : compani use advertis to sell more of their product . consult a psychologist or take survey is quit common nowaday for understand what the costum want or expect from a product . compani tri to fullfil these expect or at least pretend to do so . they know what the costum want to see or have and they are more than will to give it to him . so , actual , advertis is mostli about illus and psycholog trick . the colour , the music , the script of a tv spot . .. everyth wa set up befor . even the colour or the shape of the product itself . advertis are often so exagger , that it realli becom hard to believ , e.g. whine stain on a white carpet which dissapear within 10 second . these are high standard be rais ! one might say that it 's the qualiti of a product that count , but how often do costum actual buy a product , becaus they had seen it earlier on tv or in the newspap and `` just want to tri it '' ? i guess it happen to everybodi at least onc or twice . some were dissapoint with the result , when the product is not at all as it wa announcend in the media . no matter if it 's the qualiti of cloth , the tast of some new ice cream or the sound of a new cd . often , the product ca n't reach the standard rais in the media . of cours , if you want peopl to buy your product on a regular basi you have to add some qualiti . it justifi the higher price and can convinc the costum of your product . but , nevertheless , it is extrem import for peopl to make themselv clear that advertis do n't show realiti , but are tri to persuad them to buy a certain product .
