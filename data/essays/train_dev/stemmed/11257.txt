`` be young at heart is more import than be young in age '' . i disagre to the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . lot of young peopl of late do not look at life the way it is suppos to be taken rather are carri away someth that is unreralist and is onli depict in certain view . the older peopl who have seen the hardship of life as well as the unexpect situat of life and live up to the expectationsof themselv as well those reli on them at that time , are more like to enjoy their life as they have live up to their duti and have pass the test of life in hardship and endeavour time that the unpredict futur ha had in store for them , on the other hand a younger person in the present third world where competit is the veri word for surviv . the young who is now at the crucial stage of the life with lot of demand respons rest on hi shoulder and the dream to be realis and pinnacl to be reach , goal to be accomplish to save hi face in hi view as well as those who count on him , look at the life and the obstacl in the path onli with the view of overcom them but not with a view of apprecitaion that the troubl and tough time are not forev . in the attitud to win the situat the young often fail to appreci the beauti of veri trivial thing which inde have in them a abund of happi which rather the smart and patient old would view and appreci it for what it is . a research scholar who ha seen a lot of work in hi time and been through test time of lack of result probabl enjoy hi work with a more optimist view and would devic more way to make it work rather than to sulk and lose interest and patienc in work as most of the young are most like to do . a old person for exampl consid a dextrou surgeon who ha understood the real mean of life and the import of the role he is play in save a life enjoy the work he doe due to the perfect he ha achiev of late and also the underli role he play , where as a young and new learn and practis surgeon look at the situat onli in term on hi develop and fail to realis the hidden satisfact and happy of work that a age surgeon gain in a similar situat . thu the real mean of enjoy life is exist in the veri minut detail it bring in front of us , which when view with a optimist and a patient view appear more meaning than with a pessimist view . age definit is not the criteria that determin whether who ha fun or who enjoy life but it the import of appreci thing and look for posit in everi littl thing is the real enjoy of life .
