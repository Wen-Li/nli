i do not agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . firstli , i think that to enjoy life ha noth to do with the age . older peopl can enjoy life as much as young peopl do . sometim older peopl even know more about how to enjoy life and enjoy life more becaus they are older than the young peopl and realiz what is more preciou to the life . for exampl , when my mother wa young , she want to earn more money and brought up the child in a big hous . she work hard . she had littl time to stay with the children . when she wa old , the children all left and went to univers in anoth citi or even in anoth countri . she realiz that she would have spent more time with the children when the children stay at home if she had been young again . obvious noth is more delight and memor than to enjoy yourself with your dear children . there are also mani exampl that the young peopl regret the day that they would enjoy the life better . secondli , we have mani way to enjoy the life . the way are not better or wors . they are not less or more . young peopl may want to danc , to sing , to skate or to climb the mountain . older peopl prefer read , watch televis or just watch the sunset by the sea . dure the differ period in our life , we have differ way to enjoy life . life can be as activ as a tiger and life can also be quiet and calm as a small river . we enjoy life in the differ period . when we are young , we want to challeng and to take risk . when we are older , we can enjoy the peac and normal happin in the life . in a word , i disagre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . it is not a question of age . in fact , it is a question of attitud . we can enjoy life in ani stage of our life as long as we know how to appreci the beauti of the life and to cherish what we have possess .
