i strongli agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . but thi is my opinion , i think the common opinion of the custom ; in the other hand i have to say that the opinion of the peopl involv in the product of advertis is differ . first i want to provid my person experi . two week ago i bought a person comput of the last gener of comput . the advertis wa amaz , the qualiti of the screen and the power of the cpu show incred . in realiti it 's just the evolut of a normal comput , noth of special . thi is just an exempl of a person experi but i think that there are million of custom in itali that everi day are puss by the advertisemet to buy someth that is in realiti differ from what present . i have the chanc to have a friend work in an agenc that develop advertisemnt for both italian or foreign client . her opinion is not in costrast with mine but she thing that the problerm is not the advertis in it self but how the peopl want to see the advertis . her point is that the some custom need to believ that a product can improv hi qualiti of life and then he buy it , but , onc he ha bought the object , he realiz that hi life ha no chang and so he is not satisfi by the object . at the end he believ that the respons for hi disatisafact is the advertis . as conclus i want to say that most advertis show product much better than they realli are , even if part of the respons for an error in buy an object can in part due to the custom .
