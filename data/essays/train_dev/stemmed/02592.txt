mani peopl consid that learn fact is more import for student than understand idea and concept . i total disagre with their idea becaus just get the fact will eventu give the student troubl when they meet the question that need deeper and creativ think , also it will weaken the student 's abil to solv question , and give them a idea of studi is bore . the first reason that i agre with the statement is that it is go to let the stuent to think deeper and have more creativ thought . for exampl , republ of korea , where i wa born , forc the student to learn the fact rather than understand the idea and concept . that actual make the student smart becaus they know the way they have to solv the question . howev , when they confront the question that demand the creativ think or deeper thought , they just do not know what to do and panic becuas they have no idea about solv the question that they did not deal with in the past . that is a realli big problem in korea now , so that i certainli do not like the idea of just learn the fact . anoth reason that i agre with the statement is that it realli weaken the student 's capac of solv question . learn the fact probabl help the student to solv the question that they handl befor , but when they confront with the problem that they never deal with , they got confus and do not know what to do and how to solv it . therefor , it might seem like a good way to learn in the fist stage , becaus they can get a good mark by thi way , but eventu , when they need to think themselv and find method to solv the question , they will not know what they have to do . final reason that i think it is more import for student to understand idea and concept is they can actual get interest about what they studi and find hi talent in some subject . for exampl , nowday mani school teach children in the same way , even though everi singl of them is differ . thu , forc them to jsut memor the fact is not the right way to teach them . that make them think studi is bore and killign their abil . they should understand the idea and concept abouut what the question is ask for . in that way , student get interest in the lesson and might find a gift that they have in some area of studi . to sum up , i do n't like the idea of just learn fact . in my opinion , understand idea and concept is much better way of studi becua it will give them a creativ think , better abil to solv question , and interest of what they studi . becaus i am the person who experiec it
