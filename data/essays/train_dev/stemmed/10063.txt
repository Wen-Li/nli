the issu at hand is whether the young peopl today devot ampl time in help their commun or not . the topic is veri import becaus of it deal with the youth , who will decid , domin and mould the futur of the world . i disagre with the statement . i think that young peopl invest a lot of their time , energi and resours in work for their respect commun . the first and formost reason for believ so come from my person expericeinc . i along with my friend regularli spend time in do commun servic . thi wa a habbit inculc by my parent long ago but i am proud to mention the fact that even now i stick to it , though no parent check is present now . variou survey conduct by promin ngo 's ( non govern organ ) have highlight the fact that , that recent year have wit a steadi increas in the number of young peopl and student who voluntarili come forward for do commun work . sinc ani kind of commun servic would also requir a lot of physic activ apart from the obviou financi invest , it is but obviou that the youth should take the onu of thi task . spring up of a larg number of bodi , organ and other institut which work in the area of commun servic bear testimoni to the fact the youth today ha not shun it 's social respons . infact come across student who spent a mjor part of their summer break do commun servic , ha becom more of a rule rather than an except . infact to encourag thi trend further , now almost everi profession organ as well as educ institut allow their respect employe and student to carri on with their commun work apart from their design assign . in the light of the abov reason i can confid claim that young peopl today devot suffic time in help their respect commun
