the issu state whether it is more import for student to understand idea and concept rather than learnig the fact . abusolut thi a comtrovers issu , and the reaction from the parent and teacher are tend to be veri two polar side , which mean some of the teacher they stand for make student know the undestand concept and idea but not the fact , thu the student are turn to be blindli , for they do not know the fact and onli follow with the idea blindli ; addit , it also restrict student about their thought . the other , howev , the teacher focu on teach student about the fact but not the skill of understand the idea or accept the new concept , therefor in term of thi student would be so easi to be stereotyp , or clich . or they will be treat as a essenctr , as they never follow the social conceousn without be realiz that they have done someth which is so extradonari . as the all the abov indic , both of the veri differ two solut have their own superior and perior as well , so in my opion i would prefer to stand the neutral side ; tri to conbimn with those two idea , as it is better for student in case of be too stereotyp , or abnorm . becaus student should to know the either concept or fact at the same time befor they judg someth , also it is use for avoid student from stay at the wrong percept , in addit , it also help student not to be over-aspect , which mean they are unabl to consid thing around all itself , evenmor , somethim they might go at the wrong direct , and so forth . in conlus , there is no necessari to fugur out whether it is more import for student to understad idea and concept rather than the fact , as it is not make senc for student on their percept and the way how to judg thing justifi .
