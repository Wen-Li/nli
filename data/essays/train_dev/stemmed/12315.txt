in the matter of fact , if peopl invent a new mean of transport rather than use the car it could be true . actual , i agre , howev , i do not think that in the next twenti year , peopl are go to get rid of car , i mean there would be no fewer car , but on the contrari there would be more car to use , and the street are go to be too crowd . becaus if we consid the expand popul , i mean the growth of peopl , we will have a great need to have a car for each person to use . car is one of the most import mean to move and travel from one place to the anoth , howev , the car need ga and thi would be a problem , if car increas in the next twenti year . so , in my point of view , if we could think of anoth mean of transport to help us move and fulfil our need , thi would help to make the street a good environ for peopl to walk and run if they want . let say that in the next twenti year there would be no car , and now i am go to give exampl of transport mean peopl might use to move , for instanc ; are peopl go to use there own leg like the old man did ? or are peopl go to use hours and camel or big anim ? . i am sure they are not go to use these mean , becaus the world recent and in the futur is becom more quick , and what i exactli mean by quick is that the time is run too fast , so we have to consid manag our time well and at the same time we have to think of anoth mean to go from a place to anoth . eventu , we can not ignor the big import of car in ourliv , howev , we can reduc their problem by put alot of solut .
