i total agre with the statement propos . furthermor , for me thi statement more than a predict is a hope . with refer to thi , it is veri difficult to cram in few sentenc my thougth about car and the way peopl are use to use them nowaday . shortli , i think that peopl would not continu to use car in such an eccess way as they have been do for fourti year , for the follow reason : the cost of the fuel ; air pollut ; develop of new technolog in the civil transport sector . the main reason , at least in the nearer futur , whi peopl will will take the car more rare is the increas cost of the fuel . famili have problem in face such an expens cost everi day . in thi respect , in my person experi i alreadi saw peopl live in my build start substitut the car with a bycicl when they do not realli have the need to drive . the second reason whi peopl i think will certainli prefer to take a bu , or the underground instead of the car is repres by the air pollut . air pollut becam a problem of critic import in the citi . peopl can not freeli breath on the street . the level of air pollut ha reach unsustain ceel nowaday and peopl are more consciu about the problem and start think about it and tri to make an effort to solv the problem . final , i think that peopl will definitli prefer to take a tram , or a bu , becaus the technolog ha made great step . in the futur there will be not traffic jam , but onli fast and safe public transport in the citi .
