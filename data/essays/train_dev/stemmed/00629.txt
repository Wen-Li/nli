the idea that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are ha grown to be old-fashion and too simplist . in my opinion , perhap in the earli day of advertis the public wa more naiv and advertis themselv consid that the effect of advertis wa much more power that it realli is . today , i believ that advertis have come to realiz that it is much more effect to convey emot and concept relat to the product than to state it wonder and nearli miracul properti . whi ? for two reason . first of all , the public is n't as naiv as some peopl might consid . they might be tempt to tri a product that seem better than it realli is , yet come to find that it is not as good . thi can be harm for the product 's sale in two way : the consum will not buy it again , and he/sh will feel cheat , misguid and angri . therefor , the imag of the product will be damag . as a second reason for whi i believ that advertis do not make product seem much better than they realli are is that advertis know that it is better to work upon the real-deal . that is , tell the consum that what they see is what they will get . howev , advertis do tri to make consum think that what they will get is what they need . i believ that other than display the properti of product on televis or radio , advertis work more and more on consum 's need and motiv . they wo n't lie , they know that their consum are n't fool , but they will tri to convinc you that a particular product is the one that best adapt to your need . it is a sutil yet power differ .
