educ is differ in everi countri . so ; e countri prefer to special their children in one specif subject , wherea some other countri prefer to give mani differ academ subject to their pupil . my thought is that have a knowledg of mani academ subject is better than bee special in one subject , and thi for mani differ reason . first of all , in our daili life , we all need differ knowledg . as an exempl , we can take a typic day of someon live in a rich countri . let 's say thi person ha to do hi grosseri shop . he will need some knowledg in mathemat for that . if he want to save some money , he will need to calcul in hi head which product is less expens than the other . if he ha a budget , he will have to calcul how much he is spend so when he will have to pay , he won4t be surpris . moreov , we need to know thing on mani subject if we want to have a social life . i think that when we are with friend , mani subject are discuss , and if we do not want to be seen as a stupid man , we need to know thing in mani differ subject . if the school teach us onli one or two subject , we will have to be with peopl come from our social class , becaus they will have the same cultur as we do , so we wo n't feel stupid or reject . thi would be a break to the social ladder . final , if we think in a practic way , have a knowledg on differ subject will allow us to help our children when they will be at school . i think that everybodi , when he wa a child , ha been help by hi parent , or by someon in hi famili . it help keep the gener in touch and it also help the mental develop of the child . as a conclus , we could use a sentenc of a famou philosoph who said that a perfect man is someon who ha a good spirit in a good bodi . it mean that if we want to be in a good health , we have to practic some sport , of cours , but we also have to know mani thing on differ subject . those are the some reason whi i think it is quit better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . but we can wonder what do the polit think of that nowaday if we look what they are do in franc , where they want to special the children when they are 14 . ..
