idea , concept , fact are three import method to know the topic , thi will be there for everi aspect . in somecas all three are import to know the topic in detail . my opinion about thi statement - i am disagre with follow statement . each and everi method is essenti for better know of the topic . some aspect will requir ani of the method for understand . while all some requir all the three for better understand of the topic . for exampl if a boy wa thaught about a topic , and he is thaught all the theori relat to the topic and some reason lie under the subject , the boy will understand partial about the topic . if he is given some in exampl where and when the topic is use and show how it work , then the boy understand the the topic clearli . howev the method depend on the age and in which grade is he stude . if the student is in primari grade all method are not necessari for him , moreov he rather get confus if he is thaught . and the student who is do graduat or undergradu , he requir all the three method as he ha to submit research paper on everi subject . in conclus , i rather believ that all the three method are import to understand , moreov the main reason for thi is the student will be have no doubt on the subject and he will be familiar and perfect with the subject . i think it is better to know all about the topic , so that will be like `` dig a mine of wisdom '' .
