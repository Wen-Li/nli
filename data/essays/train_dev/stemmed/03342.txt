i agre in part with the statement , but i do n't think that those are the onli two characterist a success person ha . in my opinion , those characterist are strongli associ , if not deriv , from self-confid . a person that is self-confid is not afraid of tri new thing and take risk . in a way it ha to be a person that know that whatev happen there is alway a way to make thing work . on the other hand , i disagre in part with the statement becaus there is a good amount of peopl who have success and not necessarli take risk or tri new thing , in fact they do what they know well or are especi in . could it be that success is associ sometim to luck ? there ha been a lot of peopl , throughout histori that they had a good idea , but it wa n't the moment and year later it becam a realiti . in my opinion , in order for a person to have success a variati of factor should come togeth , such as , person trait , knowledg and the moment or period of time he or she is born . success involv a larg scope . a person may be success in hi or her profession life but he or she is a failur in social aspect . take risk and tri new thing may be applic and a desir characterist for a person that run a busi , but i strongli disagre that it will be a desir trait in a relationship . so , to call a person success i consid it is import to see not onli a part of a that person 's life and in order to have success characterist do n't limit onli in take risk and tri new thing .
