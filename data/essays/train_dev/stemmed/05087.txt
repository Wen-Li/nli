i agre with the idea think the car will be replac with the better tool for transport and more friendli to environ in the near futur . car are the most common transpor tool for the present year . they are slower then flight but cheaper in cost , cheaper in cost then bicycl or whatev the vehicl manual forc should be put to oper but a lot faster and the cost is endur for the common peopl compar to flight fare . howev they have been issu with envorment concern that the car produc harm substanc to the natur such as air etc . of cours in twenti year come , peopl will tri to invent the non harm fuel to feed the car for oper howev i strongli believ the smart human be , consid to be ` magic hand ' to invent whatev they need , olni the matter is the time , will get anoth brilient creation to satisfi the speed as plan , cost effect and also need to be friendli to enviro . it may have a form of car-lik appear , howev if you meant the car with speed like today and caus concern like they do today , i may expect the new creation or invent ( will be name differ with car ) to replac the car today . let 's tri to pictur the thing that have same look as car nowaday but no wheel are fli here and there for common peopl 's daili transport . there will be no much heavi traffic in the road as there is now . they are faster as plane and the fare is also endur as i expect in the futur , then not mani peopl will be late for the job or classess be stuck in the traffic . also the concern about pollut by car will be reliev . some peopl might say twenti year are regard to be too short for anoth stage of transport system howev , i reflect my littl hope to have thi ` mighti tool ' for my daili commut to work in the near futur in thi write .
