a lot of sudent wast their time with studi for exam and quiz . thi onli make student learn fact . howev , i think that understand idea and concept is more import than just learn fact for student . the reason are state below . first , i hear that a lot of american student do not like math class becaus it is complec and it doe not make sens . i had a chanc onc to take a calculu class in last year , and realiz whi they do not like math . sinc i had learn a lot of math concept and idea in high school in japan , the class wa veri easi for me . howev , a lot of american student came to me after and dure the class time and ask a lot of question . the reason whi they did not like the math and were not good at it is that the instructor did not teach whi from one question they can get an answer , or the teacher did not even understand whi it is . he just tought us how to solv the question . sinc i had learn a lot of thing in japan , i could understand but , i think that it it veri hard for american student to understand for them to understand whi the answer becom what unless they understand the concept and idea . besid that , i have anoth reason whi i think it is better to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . i took an econom class one time and the instructor just talk and talk to let us learn fact in the lectur , and i did not have noth to learn . at the end of the quarter , becaus i could not understand the question on the final exam , i had a realli bad grade although i studi a lot . last quarter , i retook the same econom class with a differ instructor . he tought me idea and concept of econom ' term easili and i understood these ; therefor , i did not studi for the final but i got a good grade . i believ that the reason is simpli that i learn and understand the idea and concept of econom rather than just fact . in conclust , i sure think that understand idea and concept is more import .
