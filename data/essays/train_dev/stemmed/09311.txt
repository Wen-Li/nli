a lot of controversi exist over weather travel with a group or by alon . howev , i strongli believ that travel in a group led by tour guid is more valuabl than travel without a group . when i trip with group , it can be benifici . also , i can make good relationship with my member of the group . the first reason whi i would like to trip with larg group is that travel can be extremli hel for me . i get inform about new place i want to know from the tour guid and share knowledg with my group member . thi creat more benefici travel for everyon . for exampl , i visit the state last year with a group led by a tour guid . i did not have inform about the place which i view , but the tour guid explain veri care and friendli so that i could understand the place 's histori and charactorist . in addit , travel with a group make me social with peopl . when some peopl are in troubl dure the trip , such as ill or lose money , other peopl can cooper each other so that they can solv their problem easili . also , i can learn to control myself . group activ need to each person 's respons and abil of self control . when i do well in the group , i will be abl to learn a sens of accomplish . it is often said that travel in a group with a tour guid ha some of nag point . howev , if i have a chanc to trip , i will choos travel with a goup of peopl for my enjoy trip . it can be benefici and it offer peopl to social with other . all we should notic that when peopl are travel or explor new place , have a tour guid and a group of peopl are posit influec for their trip .
