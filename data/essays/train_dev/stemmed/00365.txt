i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . the statement is true . young peopl nowaday are veri busi with their schedul . they do not have time to involv in the activ that help their commun . for exampl , my brother who is work as a softwar engin is busi with hi job work late night on task assign to him . so he doesn'thav that much time to engag himself for help hi commun . the young peopl nowaday are lack the sens of help . mani peopl are think about what they get in return after help their commun . for exampl , i met a young minist in our local . he wa veri reluct to help the commun peopl becaus he think that he doe n't get anyth in return from them and it a meagr wast of grant fund to them . although some young peopl are get enough time to help other they are simpli wast their time . for exampl , my cousin who is a teacher , after return from the school , simpli wast the remain time just by idl or watch t.v . the current gener , particularli student are engross in their studi and sport rather than make an effort to help other . some peopl are wast their money by spend it on wast activ such as drink , smoke etc . if they spend thi money on help their commun it will be veri use for the peopl . some young peopl are in the mad race for acquir land . if they donat these land to the homeless in the commun , atleast they can build hous and provid shelter for themselv . final i conclud that help hi own commun is the most essenti function of young peopl . they should spare time for help .
