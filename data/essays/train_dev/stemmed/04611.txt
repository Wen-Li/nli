twenti year from now , i feel that there would be fewer car in use than there are today . i person feel that own a car is a choic between the question of need and question of luxuri . for most peopl now a day own a car is no longer a luxuri . with all sort of loan and easi instal that have sprout out of nowher a common man can easili afford a car . but the question here is , is it realli neccessari that we own a car ? in india atleast the answer is a ye . with the unreli of the public transport system , and unaccessibilti of some region by public transport it becom neccessari to have your mode of transport . but with the dawn of a new it era and henc the look up of the brighter prospect of the indian economi , the question of need is slowli diminish . public transport ha come back in it new and improv form , be it the local buse or the metro and it is even access in the remotest of the region . as for the choic of luxuri , the ever increas hike i petrol price due to limit access to the petrol reserv would limit it own of car to peopl who can realli afford them , and not the gener public . global , the import of pulic transport ha alreadi been conciev of , and ha been in practic for decad . the modern gener be more awar of their environmet issu of pollut and deplet fossil fuel reserv have aslo further establish the need for better and effici public system , that would eventu cut out the depen on person vehicl for transport . also with the decreas in fuel , the world all over is experienc a hike in the price of fuel which would make it more easier on the pocket of the common man if he use public transport . with the ever increas awar of the lack of fossil fuel suppli that run most of the automobil combin with the fact that the emiss from automobil constitut a major reason for the increas in pollut in recent time , i feel that the peopl would start depend on public transport instead of their person vehicl . even though the possibilti of use altern sourc of fuel in the near futur exist , it not go to come easi . the expens for the use of such fuel would perhap be as expens if not more than the fossil fuel , not includ the ad expens of manufactur automobil that can run on such fuel . the viabl solut to thi would be , as i feel , is to reli on the public transport , as it would prove to be more econom viabl . the mode of transport for in the futur as i see it is public transport , which is not onli fast but more econom and environment viabl . henc with the increas in the technolog advac of the system car with would be a thing of the past .
