it is a gener opinion that youngster do not give enough of their time in help their commun . i agre with thi statement . in today 's fast pace life , hardli ani youngster would even give thi a seriou thought . help the commun could mean someth as simpl as organis even class for destitut in the own hall , or organ an event for the orphnag children , to collect fund for build a new school or colleg . but how mani youngster actual think beyond the day ' work ? consid the case of a student in high school . a typic day would begin at eight in the morn , class for the better part of the day , then mayb some soccer or piano lession in the even . and then , of cours , the usual homework session that stretch into the night . not to mention the ` discothequ parti ' that form an integr part of their weekli itenari . how are they suppos to find time in their ` busi ' schedul for commun work ? even fresh graduat , just enter the job scene , are not spare . they have late night schedul , load of work , and veri littl time for anyth els . even their famili expect a portion of their time and energi . it is virtual imposs for them to squeez in some time for a visit to an elder 's home or commun centr to help out . there are a lot of expect from someon who ha just enter graduat school or someon who ha got a new job . they put in their entir energi tri to live up to these expect , and final do not have the energi , or even the inclin , for anyth els . if you consid their side of the stori , it would seem rather unfair , consid their workload , if they had to put in some more effort for the better of their commun . after all , they would say , `` are n't the clergymen suppos to take care of that ? '' but what they do not realiz , is that each one of us ha to contribut , in the maximum possibl way , to help our commun . a proper divis of time and workload would ensur that even colleg student and work youngster find enough time in their schedul to do their bit for their commun .
