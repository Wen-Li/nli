although some peopl may think that advertis do not make product seem much better than they realli are , i total agre that it help the product to be sold out in market with the result of the consum curios , if it is an advertis made of/for women and if the advertis is colour enough . first of all , advertis increas the curios of peopl especi if it is for women . assum that a woman watch the tv , who love chocol and see the commerci on the televis which ha the mother see her son and her husband as a bar of chocol and want to get a bite of them , the woman watch the commerci will give be curiou of the product and will give a tri . it is obviou that she wo n't be the onli one so thi will give a chanc for that product to take place on the market shelf . it will be the consum own decis to keep it there or ignor it on the next visit . the second thing is that women are the best custom all around the world . it may not be the man who would like to give a tri if he wo n't see the product right after he see the advertis but a woman can keep it in mind in the syber shop list and that list appear when it come to shop and she pick up the product and give a tri . for exampl , if it is a man who is in the market to get a pack of coff he most probabl pick up the packag of coffe he is use to but if it is the woman she get her regular coff with the one she saw on the board on her way to the mall . the third one is colour and well prepar advertis . a car you would never ask for may look like a ferrari for you in a well prepar commerci and you may go ahead and see it in the store . the minut you step in the store the staff in there take the control and doe anyth for you to b interest in that car . final , i believ that the right way of advertis the product will take it 's place in the market . the onli thing is that the manifuctur need to follow three point , to have a good advertis to make peopl feel curiou about , to have woman on the advertis to make peopl look at it and to have color advertis to make peopl expect someth out of that .
