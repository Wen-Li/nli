i do'nt agre with the statement . the first reason is that there are no other transport better than car . car are acctual coveni . from door to door we can go anywher we want . especi with a big baggag or small child . no one disturb us in the car . so there are few person who want to give up drive with their car . on the other hand , we have mani problem with car . for exampl , traffic jam and dificulti of findind park . as the increas of car , those kind of problem becam bigger than befor , still , i do n't think it will caus peopl give up drive car . thi kind of disadvantag is toler . the advantag of use car are bigger , and there may be energ problem to car . the oil stock will be exhaust in near futuer , but , to my mind , industri progress will give us other energ power such as water or sollar power to move car . therefor thi shortcom of use car will not have good reason . then , how about other transport ? as for train , the 'll cost a lot to make rail and keep land . plain also cost to move on . car is conpact and flexibl . in additon , the second reason i think we will continu to use car are that car are someway have role as our fasion . mani peopl are euthusiast to chose one 's car . have car is a kind of statu of peopl . so , nevertheless some more conveni and smart machin are prevent , we are use car more and more . and i do n't think no other transport which fit peopl better than car will be prevent in twenti year .
