i do not corrobor with the author that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . on the contrari , i feel that in gener there is an increas awar of one 's oblig toward societi and toward the commun one belong to , and exampl to reiter thi point can be seen in the variou event and activ occur around us . let us first dwell into what we mean my commun . a commun may be huge , as in the case of the countri , or even the world , after all it a global commun all of us live in . it may even be small , like a small villag which may onli have inhabit share a common famili tree . a commun can be a group of peopl share similar thought , for exampl the commun of femal activist who who work toward the commun of femal , their right and their enpower . it may be the alumni of a univers who seek to work toward the develop , in what ever way possibl , of their alma-mat . essenti a commun is a group of peopl share similar thought , motiv , ambit , origin and a whole list of other attribut whose list in itself will requir lot . young peopl , realis what they owe to their origin from where they have come are actual play a lead role in the develop of their respect commun . there are variou instanc of a boy from a small villag of the under-privileg , somehow make it into an honour univers by virtu of hard work , go on to becom a power industrialist or tycoon , and return to hi villag to empow the peopl , to give them and the children out there what children in hi day were depriv of . no matter what the magnitud of help is , it is at least better than noth . peopl belong to thi genr not onli donat money judici , but also their time . let me rather cite a person exampl . i am a member of the nss ( nation social servic ) . as the name suggest , it is aim at help the underprivileg through variou way . more importantli , all of us are undergradu . there are a few student who go twice or thrice a week to teach children who can not afford educ subject like mathemat . other collect newspap and spare stationeri item from student in the campu , and the money we recov by sell these is use to buy book for those children belong to the weaker section of societi . more importantli , thi is not a local organis , it is an organis oper activ at a nation level . apart from such societi in which young peopl have enrol in larg number , there are a larg number of young philanthrop who contribut veri judici at time of tragedi . besid , mani peopl volunt to go to the unfortun site as well to provid relief to the victim , all thi requir a lot of time . there is an explicit line of differ between contribut with time and contribut with money . contribut with money alon doe not necessarili sevr the purpos , what if the money goe into the wrong hand . th emobilis of fund ha to be monitor and contribut with time should be given an equal amount of emphasi , of not more , and a greater number of young peopl today understand it . gone are the day when the victim did not have ani one to look up to when at need as sever instanc of histori such as the recurr draught in the rajasthan area of india ha told us . although much still need to be done , but we can all look toward a better futur when more and more younger peopl will contribut with both money and time toward the uplift of the downtrodden
