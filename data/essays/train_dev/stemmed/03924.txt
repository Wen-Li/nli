i think that thi statement can summar an import problem of the actual societi . in my opinion we live in the societi of appear , where exterior aspect sometim have consid more than the substanc of the thing ! i think that it is evid in one million of situat . let 's think for instanc at our market , they are full of color box and bottl and i am sure that everyon of us , at least one time in the own life , ha bought a kind of food or beverag just for how well it wa show on the box that contain it ! we can think also at the spot on tv , that everyday introduc to us so mani kind of , i call them useful thing , that seem to be the new and perfect solut at a lot of our problem ( and the most of the time they solv just one `` problem '' : how to spend our money ! ) anoth exampl come from the fashion world , it is a littl bit differ from the previou one , but i think that in a differ key it can reflect the same problem . how mani time we have seen some perfectli slim model that seem to be healti and , of cours , satisfact by their own bodi ? and how mani time we have heard ( some time later ) that they had a lot of problem with anorexi , their everyday lunch wa a carrot and their life were unhappi ? it ha happen a lot of time i guess . .. now the point is that the societi present to us some pattern that are almost never real , or better it show to us , thank to some advertis or someth els , what it doe want to show to us , but not all the truth ! i think that it is not easi today to not be impress by the extern side of the thing that are around us but , i think also that to not go into a lot of delus in our life we should start to look behind the appear of the thing that are present to us to understand what they realli are !
