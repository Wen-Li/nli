in my opinion , the best way of travel is in a group led by a tour guid . becaus in thi way , travel who come to the unknown area can do sightse whrere is not onli popular shop and build , but also pick up place by tour conductor who know all thi place , and do not care for dangour of the area . travel may not lost their way . if i had been in situat make travel plan , i should have confus . in contrari , they can not make the plan for travel by themself . if they would have think the place and build they want to go like clearli . in addit to , they may lose oppotun like meet with nativ and local peopl . therefor i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
