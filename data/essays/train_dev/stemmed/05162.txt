someth that we have to have in main are the differ between be a young peopl or old peopl . what can you do when your are young rather that old ? thi question will give you which one is better . night live , respons and money are the differ between then . we have to begin night live . some young peopl between 15 and 20 do not even what a night live is , so if you are an adult , you can enjoy a night culb without ani restrit . other inport point is that you do not have to tell anyon where are you or what are you do becaus you a old and you do not depend of your father . also , other import point in the live of a young or old peopl is the respons . if you are young you allway will have school and that is a big respons , but if you are a old , you just will do whatev you want and you just have to worri about yourself . the last and most importan point is the money . when you are young you have you father and they are the onli one who are worri about the economi . howev , you will not have everyth you want onli becaus is not you money is their money , so if you want to bay someth the do not want you just can not bay it . in conclut , the life for the old peopl wa , is and will be allway better and if your are young you can enjoy but not as much as you want . but you can also wait until you grow up and becom a old man .
