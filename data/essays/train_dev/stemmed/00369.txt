i am not sure wether adolesc or older peopl are the happier one sinc i am myself in my earli twenti . on the one hand , young peopl seem to be much more energet and are certainli physic more vital and attract . therefor they spend more time for social purpos , for instanc go to parti , which could lead to the assumpt that they are enjoy life more . but as older peopl usual alreadi found their match , thi aspect of go out at night is not relev to them . after a divorc it is like to observ that they chang their nightlif behaviour again and becom more activ again becaus they need a substitut for their former partner , which impli that the age is not sole respons for the intens someon live with . addit to thi argument , older one probabl do not enjoy life less than young , they onli have other interest that are perhap less observ . may be they valu more passiv activ like read book and be intellectu more than dure their childhood , which doe not impli that they are less satisfi with their live . anoth point that would support the thesi is that children are rel sorrowless . as they grow up they start think about problem increasingli . i thi tendenc continu , older peopl are concern about a lot of issu that an adolesc would never think of . for exampl , a twenti year is certainli not deal with the problem of near death or the challeng of rais a child . on the other hand , thi could be a reason for older peopl to enjoy life more activ and intens , sinc they feel that they will not life forev . summar , i can not give a clear statement that i am a hundr percent sure of . in my opinion , everi part of our live offer opportun and challeng us with it own problem . it is up to each individu how it deal with it and how it perceiv the advantag and disadvantag of the distinct live phase in order to becom a happi human be .
