i do n't agre with the statement that the less car will be in use in the futur . whi i do not agre stand for a coupl of reason such as experi and observ of the past year , trend , chang in peopl 's tast . .. when we look at the last 20 year , number of car in use notic increas . although it might not be valid for everi singl countri around the world becaus of financi reason and even may be moral reason , my point is made base on my countri , turkey , and mani other countri as well . it is not becaus peopl make more and more money everi year , but becaus they feel or it is impos like to have a car is a need . of cours thi is debat , especi depend on the countri . the chang time bring to peopl also are effect the devic or machin we use or make them becom a ` need ' . for instanc , in my countri mani peopl work veri far from their home , thu they prefer or sometim they have to have a car . anoth exampl is about student , particularli univers student . even if they do n't studi far from home , they still want to have a car to make their univers live easier . if i have to give an exampl from my neighbor famili who ha 4 car , one for each famili member , who are mother and father and two student , my point will be more obviou i assumethes are some of the reason whi the number of car in use will not decreas , at least in my countri . i have to add anoth consider influenc in help increas the number of car in use . that is the improv car market around the world and their promot strategi , for instanc commerci , tv program . in my opinion , they make especi young peopl want to have a car , young peopl such as my own brother who alway talk about car , know everyth about car , learn how to drive befor have a driver 's licenc ! everywher there is so pompuo inform about new technolog and car . it make you feel like you have to have a car . of cours , it is again debat if peopl have to listen to thi ` call ' or not . .. when we think about how hard it is to find oil nowaday , and also how expens oil ha gotten , logic answer would have confirm the statement abov . but regrett , it is not the fact . peopl are not care enough or their tast or conveni is more import , i guess .
