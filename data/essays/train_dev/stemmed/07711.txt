learn and have knowledg are to differ thing . learn mainli relat to therit knowledg or we can say , that it mean lern fact . understand an idea and concept is not lear , but in my opinion i think that understand fact and concept is more better than the learn fact . as fact and concept will help me to implen the idea in more promis way than the learn fact . for exampl when i wa in my ninth standard i got my exibit , project on solar cooker and in that project i secur a+ and when the same question came on solar cooker wa ask on my annual exam i secur onli b+. although i wa have good knoweledg of solar cooker but i better implement it through use the idea and conceopt in the project . and in my opinion in life onli the idea and concept which you have in mind help and not the fact which you have learn . it will onli provid you with good grade in class . and to improv your progress report for get success a person is ask to implement it idea so to show that he is far more better than hi other collegu . although in intial stage of life you have to use your acedem record but they do n't help you for a long run success for long run success you have to perform by your idea and concept . idea are store in mind for peman way but lern fact remian onli till exam . so in my opinion understand idea is more import then learn fact
