some peopl might say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid who ha a lot of knowledg of a place where traver visit . howev , i have to say that travel in a group with a tour guid is not the best way . there are two reason to support my oppinion . firstli , if you visit some place for the trip with a tour guid and other travel , your action may be limit . for exampl , when i went to la vega last summer in a group led by a guid , i could not do all thing that i realli want to do . i choos la vega for the trip becaus i want to enjoy casino like poker , black jack and kino ! yet , the tour guid recommend that we in the group should visit lake of la vega , watch the show , and enjoy the fanci restrant . as a result we did all thing that he recommend . i should have visit there and enjoy casino again and again . also , i had to wake up earli to go to the lake , although i wannt to sleep until noon . secondli , travel alon is realli interist . for instanc , you may have a chanc to get some foreign friend where you visit for the trip , if you travel alon . one exampl of thi is that when i went to israel alon to visit dead sea i made mani friend of israel . furthermor , i learn histori of interact between israel and my countri japan by talk wih them . they taught me that dure world war 2 one jananes help mani isra peopl from german govern , therebi , istra peopl like japanes peopl . thi experi wa realli nice . therefor , as i mention abov , i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group le by a tour guid . i think that travel alon is more interest than that in a group with guid .
