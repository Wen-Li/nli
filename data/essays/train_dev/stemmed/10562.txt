if someon told me that it 's better to have broad knowoledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject i would say he is right . if you choos to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject you have the possibl to choos better in futur in which subject you want to special . in addit you can decid which kind of job you will do in a better way , becaus if you 're not special in one specif subject you can count on your broad skill to do variou job . besid you do n't need to spend a lot of time on the same subject , and it 's for me an advantag becaus studi the same subject for mani year could be quit bore if you realiz that you do n't like that subject . on the other hand if you like the subject you have choosen and if you choos to special in one specif subject , you have the possibl to studi what you like but it can even be possibl that you don'lik that subject thu you will be frustrat for the choic you 've made . i 'm a student of manag engin at politecnico of milan and i took thi choic of academ cours just for these reason . becaus i know that thi cours can give me a broad knowledg of academ subject . in conslus i can say that have a broad knowledg is better than have a special knowledg becaus it give you more possibili to decid your futur , more possibl to chang your futur and becaus thi choic give you the possibl to be more happi of what you 've choosen .
