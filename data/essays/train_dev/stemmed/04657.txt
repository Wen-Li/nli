i complet agre with the statement which say that for student it is more import to understand idea and concept instead of learn fact . i think that the basi for a wide person cultur , which stay forev with a person , are to find in what the person himself understand , not in the quantiti of thing he can learn ; obvious know fact , date , name of histor relev peopl is veri import , but not much as the greater qualiti to understand the idea which bring you to the fact . for exampl , if you have to studi a difficult subject as macroeconom , the most import thing is to understand what you are do , not just studi all the model given by your text , becaus the concept are at the base , onc you have made them your you will be abl to solv all the exercis without know all the model by heart . i would light to highlight that learn by heart is , in fact , someth i do n't realli agre with , becaus i think it is just a loss of time , spendabl in a more use way , also for the long time you need to learn and the short time you use to forget ! it 's true that learn fact is a compulsori part in everyon 's studi , absolut not to avoid if you want to be realli prepar , anyway i would like to underlin that it is not enough , nor realli use , if you have n't understood what is behind the argument you are studi . even if you know all the fact , you have learn all the date written in your book , if there is a lack of comprehens , in my opinion your studi in an useless effort . when i wa young , my grandmoth use to repeat me `` what you understand , none will never steal it to you '' : i realli believ that a statement like thi can support my opinion , becaus memori is someth that can go away in a whisper , but onc you got someth , you have it .
