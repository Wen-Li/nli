in term of limit availabilti concern natur resourc , which is a common topic nowaday , thi is quit an interest question . in the follow i will proceed by depict sever arguement and idea , either support or speak against thi statement . as alreadi mention shortli abov , resourc which are necessari for a car , such as gasolin , do onli exist on to a certain time in the futur . some specialist state that oil will be suffici for at least anoth 50 year , other calcul onli 15 year . with our today technolog , hardli ani car will drive onc these resourc have been wast . therefor , the number of car may have declin significantli in 20 year . a further point support the statement is the fact of grow environment pollut . in order to save our planet , peopl will have to reduc emiss , for instanc by drive around in car less often . instead peopl could reli on public transport . on the other hand , there is a remark trend toward a grow number of car in the world . nation like china or india for exampl still have onli a veri low percentag of car owner among their inhabit . while economi and prosper in these countri are grow rapidli , the number of car is grow even faster . and thi trend is not go to weaken within the next year . besid , new technolog are develop perman . one common exampl in term of the automobil market is the solar energi . alreadi today , solar energi is use in car technolog and presum it is onli a question of time when these new gener of vehical is avail on the market . from my point of view , there is anoth veri import fact one should consid . over the last 100 year , sinc henri ford start to produc car in huge quantiti , the car ha becom a normal thing to own for peopl in the industri countri , repres a certain comfort and as well a statu of social recognit . obvious peopl will be unwil to up thing like car just in order to safe our resourc or environ ! altough resourc are limit and a grow number of car will mostlik not be a support in order to save the natur , i am absolut convinc that the number of car will increas within the next 20 year . peolp will alway find a way to stay mobil , mostli through new technoligi .
