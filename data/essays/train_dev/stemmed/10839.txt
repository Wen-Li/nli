some peopl say that success person will not be will to do what they know alreadi but tri new thing out . i strongli agre thi statement , and i have reason for my thi . peopl sometim talk about thi line `` a hero is someon who is do a common thing in a not common way '' what make a peopl success is that he/sh make a deffer in someth . if the person just follow the rule alreadi there and doe the thing what they alreadi know , how can he/sh be differ ? how can he/sh be special ? for peopl alreadi succeed . in order to surviv among all those succ peopl , they alway choos to tri new thing to make them more success . like most scientist , they could spend their whole life time in lab for research , discouv a new effcient way to make someth instead of what we are use now . in fact , the public recogn those peop who invent new thing or discov someth new which are veri use for peopl . the gorver rise scholoship , the univers provid fellowship , mani compani and organ give money for peopl do research as well . a success peopl will not refus to take the risk to becom for success and make a deffer with those help . all in all , my conclus is success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do , howev , what they are go to do is complet base on what we alreadi know , knowledg is the rule .
