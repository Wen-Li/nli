i believ that success peopl are success becaus thay have taken risk in their life , howev some peopl could argu that a success life stand on what you think is be success for you . it probabl depen on the way you have been educ . some peopl find their success in do what they are do good . other are alway tri to go a step forward . the unexplor part of go a step forward ha a strong risk that peopl ha to take onli if they want to . and thi is what i believ make us be differ or at least , not be as everyon els . success is relat with be strang , in a uniqu way , to stand out of the rest of the peopl . howev , i think it is total relat to you own cultur . be success in the unit state is not the same of be success in china or a small town in africa . my person experi travel aroung the world ha given me a differ idea of what is mean to be success in life . usual , i relat the success with my own cultur and place it in what we call the first world , which mean be success in bussi enviro or economi talk . howev i think it is neccessari to take a step back and think of other cultur : be success could mean be the leader of a small town in india were it is relat to the one how wa abl to do someth ( for exampl bring water to a villag from a long_dist river or to be abl to kill a lyon in the middl of a forest ) . in all those case peopl need to take risk , but risk that had a mean on their cultur and circumst . in thi sens onli peopl how is brave enough to take the risk have the chanc of be differ can be success . i definit agre with the statement , and actual i believ that peopl is success becasu those risk they have taken , have given them their success .
