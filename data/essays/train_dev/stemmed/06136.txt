have a wide perspect and a broad knowledg in mani academ field is much better and necessari than special in a singl subject , especi in our modern and divers societi . thi necess becom much more apper when one consid social studi . academ work in social field , becaus they are mainli deal with human be and their action , unlik engin , requir a broad understand of human behaviour in order to make meaning and accur assest of their action . mani of the issu that we face today are veri much inter-rel . it is veri hard to isol a singl problem from the other and specif studi it without ever engag it neigbor field . for instanc , a sociologist who plan to studi the crimin tendenc among an specif cultur group must not onli have inform about the histori of these peopl , but must also have an adequ amount of knowledg about how econom condit which might influenc human behaviour should be interpret . moreov , she must have a knowledg of interpret econom data , which would also necessi a minimum level knowledg of statist data . henc , as illustr abov , a studi on crimin tendenc would at least necessi knowledg of histori , econom and statist . anoth difficulti with focus in one specif subject is that it narrow your perspect and may result in disorient regard the place that the specif subject occupi within the gener pictur . everi social event , apart from it intern structur or work , is also interact with other part of the social field in an activ way . therefor , mani time in order to get a meaning analysi of the particular social structur that one is analyz , it should be place within a wider context and interpret within the light that the context shed on it . without thi broader outlook , it is possibl to fall into mani clich and misinterpret a social structur . for instanc , some practic concern woman in mani eastern cultur might seem oppress to a western academ , if she onli focus on that specif practic . howev , a broader perspect which put that social practic within the context , for exampl a religi context , could make it much more understand . the act which seem oppress might be reinterpret as base on the consent of woman , and therefor not constitut a form of power relat . therefor , put thing in context and look at them from a wider perspect would yield to better result . we are live in an increasingli divers societi and it is much more easier for differ peopl to interact with each other due to the advenc in inform technolog . within thi divers world , ani academ who take interest onli at a singl specif field would be lack the necessari tool for produc meaning analysi of societi . therefor , what the modern world need is academ who are train in differ field and academ who can put togeth inform from differ field into meaning whole .
