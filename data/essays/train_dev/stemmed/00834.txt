i agre with thi statement . becous i know mani peopl who tri new thing and took risk to success . one man came to studi hair cut to new york 30 year ago by him self . he is japanes who i met in new york . at that time when he came new york by ship , it wa n't common at all . just few japanes were live in new york and nobodi had n't tri to come studi hair cut . when he came new york , he wa so poor and could't speak english at all . he did n't know how he could learn hair cut . so he just went into hair salon and ask to teach . and also he tri to make friend littl by littl . after few year later he got chanc to have a shop . now he ha mani salon all of the world . my father is also one person who took risk . he is live in small citi in japan . he is an archtect and he ha a offic by himself . so he ha to do all work by himself . i think it is a risk . he can do everyth how he want , but when he is sick nobodi do n't hi job . but he success veri well becous of it . pe
