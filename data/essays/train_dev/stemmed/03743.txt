about a coupl of year ago , my friend and i went trip to australia and newzealand for 2 week . we went in a group of 20 peopl led by a korean tour guid . peopl in a group includ us visit the same place at a time and we had a same meal everytim . i thought that it wa total ridicul and i paid money in vain . we could n't even enjoy thing that we could have . it is not a good memori for me but a worthless exhaust trip . there is some crucial disadvantag when we travel in a group led by a tour guid . first of all , it just get rid of my interest about the tour place . a tour guid tell us everyth , and we should go place onli where the tour guid lead us . there can be mani thing that i am go to get interest in that the tour guid is go to miss out . as far as i am concern , i usual search some inform befor i do someth . in fact , i did n't know that i am suppos to go in a group . i expect that i go with my friend i found mani inform about the australia and newzealand such as famou place , fee that i have to pay , the climat , transport and so on . . and i prepar some plan to go and have some special meal . but it wa just a dream . if we go trip not in a group , but indivu , we could go place where we want . we could do thing flexibl and do n't have to take up useless time . it make me have food that i realli want . there are mani thing to see that we need to take some time . it simpli enabl us to do it . go individu could realli help us enjoy the whole trip .
