there are certain reason that contradict with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than today as well there are argument which support thi thesi . to my mind thi statement is not well reason and will certainli not becom true in near futur . first of all , car provid an effect and cheap way of transport that public transport for exampl is not abl to give to it custom . drive a car , is more than a simpl action , a strong emot is involv of feel free and flexibl whereev you are in the world . peopl are depend on thi way of life , for instanc get to work with public transport in some area is not satisfi . one could argu that crude oil and ga will not deliv the proport which is requir to enabl car use in futur . although thi could be right , the car industri is alreadi make effort to develop new enginen base on solar and wind energi . furthermor , it is attempt to make the use of hydrocarbonit more econom and effect . all these develop will have an posit effect on environ becaus they contribut less to pollut . on the other hand , peopl can say that we should reduc car traffic by improv our nation transport system for instanc to make it cheaper and more comfort in order to attract more custom . anoth option would be to stress the import of use plain for small distanc between town instead of use the car . thi obvious could all contribut to use the car not that often than nowaday . to sum it up , i strongli believ that the car is an integr part of life and it use will not decreas but increas in near futur . there is no suitabl option found yet which could replac the car and it great advantag . thu , let us do not abandon thi extraordinari part of life but instead keep it and of cours improv it .
