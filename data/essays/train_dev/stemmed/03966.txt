i strongli believ that the broad knowledg of mani academ subject is far more benefici than the narrow view on specif subject . there are sever import reason which undergird my posit . the first one is that the world is be complic and interdisciplinari . in other word , it is imposs to understand where the world is head without the compound analysi on the variou subject . the good exampl for thi is bioengine . in these day , the field of studi , bioengin , is get more popular . and it properti can be defin as divers and integr of other variou field of the studi . it can be refer as a mountain , which is live and breath . all field of engin and scienc , such as mechan engin or biolog , chemistri , get togeth build mountain , bioengin . insid it , the each field interact and synchron with each other . without the abil which can have himself or herself understand other field of studi , they can not particip in the interact among field and the live mountain can not live anymor result in the collaps both person and social . the second one is that broad knowledg on mani academ subject affect the individu life directli . for exampl , if someon know well about english with mechan engin major , he can teach other english as a part time job . also , the person who ha broad band of knowledg on academ subject can do thing then other who do n't . someon with qualifi foreign languag can make connect between hi or her compani with other abroad . the specialz knowledg on one subject can make research deep well of studi . howev , the depth of the well can be further by broader entranc of it . the wider the entranc , the deeper the well goe . to get their own major is , of cours , import . howev , we should rememb that broader knowledg can make our research more profound and valuabl . it support strong base for your major . therfor , i prefer to arm with broad knowledg of mani academ subfect than to special in one specif subject .
