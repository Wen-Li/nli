in my opinion , young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do for three reason : the younger peopl have more energi to do someth fun , they have greater choic in live their live , and lastli they are not as seriou about life as the older peopl are . the youg peopl enjoy life more than old peopl do becaus they have more energi to do someth fun than older peopl . when peopl are young they have better bodi structur for produc energi therefor young peopl can do anyth they want to do with that energi wherea old peopl can not becaus of their age and health problem . anoth reason whi i think young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do is becaus young peopl have greater choic . while peopl are young , they like do someth adventur therefor they tend to bring in as mani choic as they can in to their live . in the other hand , most older peopl doe n't like to do adventur thing becaus they usual have famili under their control and they do n't want to risk their famili and settl life be advantag . lastli , becaus young peopl are not as seriou about their live as the old peopl are i think the young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . usual young peopl do n't worri about be so matur and seriou as much as the old peopl do . as a result , they are more progress in live thier live . when old peopl often think what they should do and not in decid someth , the young peopl just tri to do whatev they want do to . therefor
