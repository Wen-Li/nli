i would definetli disagre with the statement . i say thi becaus i am of the opinion that nobodi is good at everyth . student can not cope up with the pressur of learn and handl such vastli divers knowledg . to have such a gener base of knowledg with mani subject at onc can bring in the effect of a student not be good at ani of them . i agre that there are case where some except student might be good at mani subject , but that not the gener case . the gener student can take onli so much amount of knowledg . i believ that one must learn aleast one thing perfectli rather than half-learn a hundr thing . in today 's world of highli advanc technolog there is too much inform and knowledg to learn and it becom hard for student to master even one subject perfectli . such be the case , a broad array of subject will onli increas the strain on the student , which may lead for him to get confus about the actual subject that he is realli interest in . for exampl , what good doe a math student get from learn chemistri ? it will onli put him through a lot of strain to learn a thing which he realli is n't interest in . and i think it is realli bad for student who have a focu in their life and have set goal to excel in a particular field , to have mani academ subject . it will onli bring down their enthusiam and zeal to learn more about their favourit subject . and in event like when they fail to clear a subject which they dont like , they have to end up studi it all over again . thi onli add to their stress and delay in tri to studi what they actual want to studi . also , peopl who get the oppurtun to learn what they ralli like will definetli excel in it . their brain will work better for the subject they like . and it will unfair to judg everyon by the same yardstick if we have mani subject . i mean to say that while some peopl will be good at one subject they might fare realli bad at the rest . so u can not have a common benchmark as such , to judg their talent . and so i total disagre with the statement that `` it is better to have a broad knowledg of academ subject rather than special in one subject '' .
