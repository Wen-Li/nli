eventhogh i am not a big fan of car , unlik my friend who have to stop when they see nice car , i think there will be the same amount of car as today . these are well-known turth that car are pollut the air remark and the oil is run out quickli . howev , the car are such importnat machin in our societi , and the scientist are develop new technolog sinc they are well awar of the fact that the air pollut ha becom the one of the biggest global problem and the world need other altern way of run the car rather than onli petrol . the car ha signific import in modern societi . these day peopl are extrem depend on the car , they go anywher either use person car or public transport such as bu . so it is hard for peopl live in mordern to imagin a day without ani sor of car . and the car made our live easir to move from one place to anoth , without car peopl will be less mobil and one movement will requir lot of time and energi for them . enorm number of scientist are work on the research for altern resourc that can be use a sourc of run the car . plu , that altern resourc will creat less or zero pollut unlik petrol , i have been hear the news about make sunlight-pow car which store energi from the sunlight and can work with the enrgi like the sunlight-pow hous . thi will help to solv the problem of not find ani altern sourc befor the complet run out of petrol and air pollut . but it also ha problem of no suffici sunlight suppli , and to solv thi problem , the scientist will still work on the devlop or find new resorc that can be use sole in the car or in the sunlight-pow car when the sunlight is not enough to run the car . the car have too import role in the societi that they canno be disapear and develop technolog will find the way to solv the problem of worsen the air pollut and less oil avail in the world , thu i think there will still same or more amount of car in twenti year .
