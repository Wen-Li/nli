to understand idea and concept or to learn fact alway is a import question when teacher or parent educ children . it is a chicken-egg question , i think . but i prefer to let student to learn fact at first . fact are the real reflect of the idea and concept . it is the real item , visual imag , or true thing happen in everyday live . we can catch it around us , we can feel it besid us , we can heard it from surround eviron . it doe not like the imagin of idea and concept ; it is the real version of idea and concept . how do the idea and concept come from and where do they come from ? thi is the relationship between idea and fact . most idea come from the think and studi of fact . from thi point , we can state : fact are the mother of idea and concept . if everyon just think everyday , and nobodi come to the real world and make these idea come true , what will our world becom ? also , fact will help us to understand idea and concept deeper and stronger . for instanc , mani peopl have taken chemistri , biolog , or other scienc cours dure high school . teacher alway let student to do differetn laboratri when studi a new subject . the differ lab and the observ of these activ are the fact . most teacher want student to understand the idea or concept that they tell student more impress . the visual item or truth can help peopl memor and understand more effect . as i studi differ subject , i usual prefer to know the fact of them . after that , i can see the real reflect of it and figur out how to reinforc the deep think that hide back of the topic . although idea and concept are the basic of almost fact , to see the item relat to our real life is more use for me .
