today , we are face seriou environment threat result from the excess use of car . pass a ga station demonstr us daili that ga price are increas tremend . also on a day-to-day basi , the media tell us about polit conflict mostli result from oil issu in the middl east . thu , it may lead us to the question if the invent of the car wa a good idea . moreov , it is interst to think about the question if there will be as mani car as today in twenti year from now . i do not think so for the reason i would like to give in thi essay . first , oil resourc are deminish veri rapidli and statist show that we will eventu run out of oil and ga . thi , of cours , depend on the pace we are use our oil . but it seem veri obviou that the vast oil reserv will be total gone in twenti year if we use oil as we us it today . thu , as there will be no fuel in the futur there will certainli be fewer car as well . second , the car as we use to know it now is probabl go to dissappear . technolog develop at a such quick pace that there will be new facil which will transport us and our good in the futur . twohundr year ago , peopl thought that the train is go to be the new vehicl of the futur . howev , as the car wa invent , train were not the onli transport mean anymor , thu result in a decreas of train be use . in the same way , it might be happen with the automobil . even today , car are not use that often anymor when cheap airplan ticket becom more and more avail . lastli , i believ that the need to get from one point to the other will be not as high as it is today . in twenti year , comput technolog will have advanc in such a tremend way that almost everyth will be possibl to do from home . thi trend can alreadi be seen today , as mani compani are offer job that can be done from home use the internet . thu , peopl will not leav their hous in the futur as they do now and can leav their car , if the vehicl is still name as such , in their garag . in conclus , i feel that it is obviou from the argument given abov that there will be tremend less car in the futur . moreov , it is imposs to say if such a vehicl will still exist in twenti year from now .
