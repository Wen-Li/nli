in japan , which is my home countri , some peopl may prefer a travel in a group led by a tour guid . howev person , i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . first , a group travel led by a tour guid prevent me from visit place under my own decis and interest . for exampl , when i went to china in 1995 , i chose a group travel becaus chines travel industri wa not matur in thi time and then i had to pay more cost for a self travel by time consum procedur like a visa premiss than i did in a group travel . howev , i miss visit most interest place in china , a great wall by the unexpect chang of tour schedul . second , a group travel led by a tour guid allow me not to studi about the place by myself . for instanc , when i went to spain with my wife , a tour guid provid us with much inform about the place . howev , becaus tour guid allow us onli to listen hi explan , my wife and i forgot almost all inform which he gave . on the other hand , i went to thailand by myself in my colleg day . i prepar for the travel by read mani book relat to the countri . as a result of self prepar , i could enjoy whole travel . furtheremor , i can learn much inform by heart becaus of self effort . of cours , there are some advantag in travel in a group led by a tour guid . for instanc , in a group travel , i can enjoy a travel more safer than in a self travel . i have bad experi that i wa rob my belong in itali becaus i walk downtown in midnight alon . i believ that i could avoid such a danger accid by a group travel . howev total , on my opinion , a self travel 's benefit are not outweigh by those of a group travel . therefor , for the reason mention abov , i complet disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
