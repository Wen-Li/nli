i dont think that in twenti year ther will be fewer car than now becaus sale of car are increas day by day . more peopl are use car as it is easi to own a car today and mani low cost car are come into the depend on demand of peopl an usag . twenti year from now there will be more and more peopl come to citi and town in search of job and other requir and popul is increas day by day . so after few year mani peopl would requir car for their person use . now the number of car are less becuas becuas big car compani donot go into remot place and villag to sell the car as mani peopl dont buy them . in futur they might go into remot place in order to increas their sale . thi is not possibl today for mani car compani becaus they dont have mani fund to do provid car and market them in villag . now a day there is onli one car per famili becaus onli one person work in a famili in india . in the futur both wife and husband may work and both requir car . need of peopl are grow , peopl who own a two wheeler today want to shift to a car tomorrow . popul is increain so to meet the increas demand of the peopl more car are manufactur so that everi person can own a car and not depend on other . car compani are increas their product day by day in order to get more profit and the compani will prosper . they are increas their product see the increa demand in the market . demand is increas in the market as better road are laid , better infrastructur is devlop and polici are made such that cost of the car come down and even common man can own a car . these all reason suggest that more and more car will be use by peopl in the futur . mani bank and financi compani are bring out plan so that it is easi for a person to earn a car . thi plan will increas the number of car on road as it is no longer a burden to own a car . due to advanc in technolog new car are come with more latest featur which make a person 's desir to eard a car . growth in technolog and way of manufactur car are bring out mani car which are advanc to their previou model . through all thi mean it will increas the number of car in the near futur . befor car wa use as just a transport mediun . now it is not like that as own a car is a passion and even desir to some peopl . there were onli few featur in car befor but now a day the featur in car are multipl , with thi you along with drive can do other work like listen to music relax and even offic paper work as car donot shake or give disturbac while drive . improv in technolog is make car drive easi and ride more and more comfort . so with all these reason i dont think that number of car after twenti year will come down but they will increas in number and increas in variti satisfi wide rang of peopl use it .
