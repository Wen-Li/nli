i disagre with the statement . it mat be true that the group tour is a most convini way to travel becaus a tour guid know a lot about the place and there seem no wast time thank to the all well preper plan . howev i think that to travel by ourselv is more enjoy than group tour and there are three reason that support my idea . first , by travel individu , you can go anywher at anytim . for exampl , if you go to one tourrist attract in a group and you find the place attract , you have to just pass through and can not see the place well becaus of the time limit . next , you can meet local peopl . if you are in a group tour , local peopl are not interest in them becaus you alreadi have a lot of conpani and the local peopl see you as one of them . howev , if you go to the sight alon , it draw local peopl 's attent and they might talk to you or at least nice to you . moreov sinc they live there , they know where to go better than guid or guidebook . in addit , you can know what the tradit and cultur of the region , which the guidebook do not tell you . final , you can be independ . to travel alon is not alway just a fun . there are a lot of danger around you . howev you can learn how to protect yourself when you are in danger . what you learn from the danger situat will be help for your latter life .
