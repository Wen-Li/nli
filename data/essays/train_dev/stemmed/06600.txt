i defin agre with the statement that it would be more import for student to understand idea and concept than it would be for them to learn the fact . to support my opinion i will give three reason in favour of the latter . firstli i sure agre with the opinion that student have to learn some fact . it is obvious import to know certain thing but it can not be the main object . as i experienc , the thing you rememb in the end are not the one hardli learn and memoris , but the idea and concept transmit by a book or a professor . to be capabl to memoris you need to connect the fact and to transform them in bigger piec , in concept . secondli it is not just import to know thing , but to understand them . by memoris number and number of fact you do n't automat also understand them and you are not necessarili abl to see them in relat to other factor . you are may not abl to see the overal mean of all the factor learn . thirdli , when actual use the the knowledg learn , you need concept and idea rather than pure fact . for exampl if you are a doctor , it doe not help you to just know where the knee is but also to be awar of all the differ part of the bodi that can influenc and affect the knee . experienc pain in the knee is not necessarili caus by the knee itself . it can also be origin in anoth part of the bodi . summaris i think there should be both , the learn of fact - serv as a basi of knowledg - and the understand of concept and idea , to be abl to get the mean of the knowledg learn and memoris . what count in the end is the abil of use the knowledg and thi is just possibl when have a profound understand of the fact learn .
