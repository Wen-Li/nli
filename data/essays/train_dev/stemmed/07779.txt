the most fear thing that peopl think is a death . then , some peopl may say that young peopl have a lot of time to live compar to older peopl , therefor they can enjoy life more . it is sure that older peopl have high possibl of death becaus of variou reason , such as diseas and weak of their bodi . howev , when the death come are unknown . probabyli , a babi which is just born one hour ago may be die becaus of the sudden accid . therefor i disagre with the statement which is `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . '' first , each peopl have a differ situat and environ . these situat and environ have a great impact on a person 's life . for exampl a lot of children die becaus of diseas or lack of food in develop countri . their live are quit hard . they do not know if they can live tomorrow or not , becaus they do not have ani money and food . they also have to work for their famili at the young age , and sometim , they sell their organ to get money . young peopl are healthier than older peopl , therefor they have to earn money . probabl , most of young peopl in these situat can not enjoy their life . therefor it is not true that all young peopl enjoy life and be abl to spend their all time for themelv . second , older peopl in develop countri may have a lot of free time which they can use for their own . for exampl , in japan , a lot of older peopl can get money from the govern after the decid age . therefor they do not have to work , and they use these free period to do their hobbi , such as sport , music , game . .. and so on . it is not true that all the old pepl enjoy their live , but it is true that a lot of old peopl enjoy their live by arrang their futur . although their death may be com soon , they can enjoy their live . as you read , if the person can enjoy the life or not is not depend on their age , but their situat , environ , peopl around him / her ... and so on . by chang their situat and way of think , peopl can enjoy their live .
