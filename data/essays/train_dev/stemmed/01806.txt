ye , i agre with thi statement , it is more import to understand what you are stude in spite of understand few fact , but it is also true that usual fact improv your knowledg of idea and concept . i mean , if you want to understand an idea you probabl need an exempl , thi exempl is the fact . i show you a situat in which fact are extrem releat to the knowledg of a concept : we are in a histori classroom , the teacher of an elementeri school told hi student that the second world war wa a veri horrorfi event . the children understand the core of the statement , but they do n't know whi it is so , or if they realli do understand the thing . so the teacher show some event that occur dure the war , like hitler 's polici , like olocaust , ecc . . now children ha theirown opinion and can actual say that war is bad , becaus thay understood the concept , that is substain by an exempl , that mean , by fact . it can be also state that learn fact over fact can not realli help you , becaus if you do n't pay attenct to what you are sa you 'll never be abl to have a true opinion on some topic . you have to improv your knowledg by add idea and concept , with an array of clear fact . infact it can be infer that fact are the basi of knowledg becaus they prepar your mind to a concept , onli in thi way you can add inform . more over is true that understand idea and concept is more use for you than learn just fact , inde fact can be learn with a mnemon process , viceversa an idea have to grown up in you , it have to suggest you someth . in conclus mayb the statement should be `` it is import for student to understand idea and concept , support by an array of fact that cleari explain the content of those idea and concept '' , so i actual can say that i agre the statement .
