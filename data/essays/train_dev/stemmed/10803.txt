understand fact are more import than understand concept . some peopl said `` we have onli some real fact and other are theori . '' but i disagre about that becaus of make problem when we make standard , make confus , and attitud . when i wa in high school in second grade they have problem in korean sat . they make a question about univers . but the fact is differ from the answer becaus our text book is old one . some student complain about the question . the gover have to agre about that . so they have to make two answer at one question . even it suppos to ha one answer . our countri usual think fact is more import than concept . but thi kind of problem alway happend when they make standard test . make confus is other import reason that i disagr . if school teach concept more import than fact they have to make mistak when they teach their student . they have to make some exampl for explain their concept . but concept is more import than fact they use wrong exampl but easi to explain that concept . mabi thi problem make student dum . if school teach concept more than fact student atittud can go wrong way . in everi work or problem they just think about the problem 's concept . if they get bad grade becaus they use wrong fact they alway complain to teacher and school about their grade . they think they are right becaus they use right concept . their fact are not import for them . learn concept is use for studi ; becaus it 's one of the easi way to unerstand problem . and it 's work pretti well at socail work . but in math and other import sceinc subject it never work becaus it doe n't need wrong fact for explain their concept .
