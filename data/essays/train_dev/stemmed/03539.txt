in the western world most peopl consid that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i have recent been ask if i agre with that line of thought . contrari to what most peopl think , i consid that old peopl enjoy life more for a number of reason : they have life achiev to look back to and be proud of ; they can see the influenc they exert in their children and grandchildren ; and , they are experienc and see life from anoth perspect . through time older peopl have experienc posit and neg event . they have been through moment in life , where everyth ha been about accomplish and triumph , like get marri or becom a well-known doctor , and other where failur and tragedi , like close a busi or face a close rel 's death , have play an import role . howev , throughout the year they have learn to balanc all these experi and see that life is beauti , and that everi accomplish should be a reason to be proud of and everi moment should be enjoy to it fullest potenti . at the same time , older peopl are abl to enjoy the influenc they exert in their children and grandchildren , and see the effort they did throughout their life reflect on them . it is difficult to see a higher pride or degre of accomplish , than that shown on a grandfath 's face when play ball with hi grandson . that is a sign of enjoy the littl moment of life at their greatest potenti , without worri about the next day 's meet , or the undon project sit in front of the comput . older peopl see life from a differ perspect than young peopl do . and as a famou latin american poet write , `` if i live again i would worri much less about be so care , about wear sweater and alway leav home with an umbrella . .. i would travel without luggag and not be concern of the day i have to come back . .. '' for these reason i think old peopl enjoy life more than young peopl . the good news is that we are still young and we can start enjoy life just as all of our grandpar do , take from them an exampl for the rest of our live .
