i agre with thi statement . up to a certain point , i think academ educ should be base much more on theori than on practic . there will be enough time to get acquaint to practic and more factual inform later , especi dure our profession life . thi doe not exclud induct approach to concept . start from factual observ can be a veri good way to understand complex concept , but the aim remain to give the student a knowledg of the theoret tool , which must be the main object sinc it is the most difficult . it is from such theoret tool that a human be can develop hi or her abil to go deeper into ani specif subject . as part of a specif societi , we all have a common histor and philosoph heritag which influenc our way of think , sometim without us even know it . to learn more about the concept and idea that other have brood upon befor us make our judgment firmer . it is onli onc we have master an idea that we can realli reject it . moreov , practic speak , it is much easier and faster to learn fact than to understand idea . thu it seem the perfect time for the student , while he is studi , to spend time on idea rather than on fact . the danger of cours lie in lose connect with realiti . but as soon as one goe a littl deeper in the histori of idea , it becom veri difficult to be a genuin idealist . howev , there is an advantag that could stem from the learn of fact - student could draw their own conclus from those veri fact , and be in a way more activ than the student tri to understand concept with the help of teacher or author . but the thing is that thi happen perman and spontan in everyday life , wherea strain to understand a passag from hegel would not spontan be a man 's activ . start from the concept creat a virtuou circl between fact learn and concept understand sinc when a student realli get the core of a concept , he will natur look for applic of it .
