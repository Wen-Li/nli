i do not agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . the statement is veri vagu and gener to begin with , and furthermor , it provid no support as to what enjoy impli . it is not correct to gener or stereotyp such larg number of peopl . young peopl , as well as older peopl , are veri differ amongst each other . some young peopl enjoy life , while other hate it , and the same happen with older peopl . assum that gener is correct , though , i would still disagre with the statement . one can not compar `` appl with orang '' . when it come to young peopl , enjoy life might mean enjoy go to parti or club to danc and meet new peopl . when speak of older peopl , enjoy life could mean enjoy read a good book or listen to classic music , or even sleep ! even though at first glanc a parti might sound more fun or enjoyabel than sleep , the older person might actual enjoy sleep much more than the young person enjoy parti , and therefor be enjoy life even more . a past experi with my grandfath illustr my point perfectli . i alway thought he wa veri bore and that hi life wa pretti sad , given the fact that he stay home most of the time . howev , i onc walk into hi studi where he wa just sit on a couch hold my grandmoth 's hand , quietli listen to classic music , and i realiz hi eye were wateri with emot . he wa enjoy that moment so deepli it wa hard for me to understand , but i realiz he simpli enjoy life in a veri differ way that i did ; not more , not less , simpli differ . furthermor , `` the older the wiser '' explain my disagr even further . with experi , peopl experi mani activ and situat in life , and they learn to identifi which one they enjoy more . a more experienc or older person ha learn over the year to enjoy specif those thing that make them the happiest . by focus more specif on those thing that they like , older peopl enjoy life more deepli . on the other hand , young peopl tend to expos themselv constantli to new experi , and even though there is a thrill to get to know new thing , it is usual with time that one learn to actual enjoy experi to their fullest . young peopl , in their constant attempt to explor new thing , usual dont have time to focu enough to actual get to enjoy thing to their deepest . the statement is a vagu and unsuport gener , which make it difficult for me to agre with it . everi person is differ , regardless of age , and what one person might enjoy , anoth might not . thi doe not impli that either person is not enjoy life , or enjoy it to a differ degre .
