first of all , it 's hard to say if there will be or if there wo n't be fewer car in twenti year than there are today . thi issu ha to be discuss , and both point of view have to be advoc through good and reliabl argument . on the one hand , i think that the number of car will increas in the next two decad . inde , there will be more peopl allow to pass the drive licens . everyday , the earth popul is increas so , it 's mathematicli logic that there will be more car in the next twenti year . furthemor , i think that there will be more automobil becaus of , or should i say `` thank to '' , the develop of tourism . along the year , peopl have use to use the car for go on vacat for exempl . as well , the more the societi is chang and evolu , the more peopl can provid them with a car , thi locomot mean is no longer a good for rich peopl . as well , we live in a period where it ha becom natur to use our car . nowaday , we take the car to go to the supermarket as well as to go to the butcheri with is 500 meter far from our hous . becaus of the develop of the automobil industri , we have becom complet lazi or , at least , we tend to becom veri lazi . .. on the other side , i think it 's possibl that there will be fewer car in the next twenti year : as a matter of fact , peopl are more concern about the environ and we can see the emerg of new environment organis struggl against car pollut . furthemor , the govern might have plan to make downtown pari , a discrict where peopl will have to pay for enter it . in london , the congest charg wa implement a coupl of year ago and there is fewer car and less pollut in the center of the british capit citi , accord to the environmentalist peopl . moreov , a lot of peopl take the commun transport to go to work , to go out at night so , whi would thi chang ? a lot of inhabit of pari have understood that it wa more simpl to move by the subway or bu instead of by car . my last argument will be that the cost of oil will increas for sure . .. that will be prevent peopl for use their car as they usual do !
