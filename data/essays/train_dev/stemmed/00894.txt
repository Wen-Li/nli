do you agre or disagre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun ? mayb some peopl nowaday do not realiz the import of commun , howev , i think peopl can not surviv when isol themselv from the crowd , becaus poepl need help from other peopl . so in my opinion , i total agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun , becaus they do n't understand help other peopl is vital in the societi . and here is my support reason as follow . firstli , i think it is an excus that young peopl do n't have enough time to help , becaus they spend too much time not onli in studi but also in play , and they do n't pay attent to the environ they llive in . they should discov that here are mani help from commun like there are alway some peopl who give help to clean up the trash . the second point i want to express is perhap there are some young peopl do know that help their commun is necessari , howev they just do n't have time to give . then , i think they should know how to schedul their time , and to use their time well . to sum up , in my person opinion , i think all peopl , includ old and young peopl , should give enough time to help their commun , becaus peopl alway give help to each other . i hope young peopl can understand that point of view , and contribut their time to their commun , and then make their commun much better .
