i partial agre to the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . thi is veri much true and applic to the present day situat as knowledg of onli one subject is go to reduc the number of option a person ha in hi career . have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject will help a person view a particular situat or issu in differ angl and can be more care in take a decis after take into consider all the in and out of that situat or issu . for exampl , if we consid a market execut tri to sell a wash machin , he should have knowledg though not in detail on the differ small electr system that make up the total machin , also he need to have knowledg on differ kind of textil fabric and how the wash machin should be use in case of each fabric . he can be success onli if he convinc the custom and to convinc he need to have broad base knowledg on all the those discuss . peopl with broad base knowledg can easili shift career accord to what the industri demand and have a great flexibl to work in ani area of special . on the contrari , the world would not have develop so much if there were no peopl with special in one subject . onli if one understand each and everi concept , can he implement them and bring out a new product . there would not have been new discoveri if there are no specialist in thi world . refer to the wash machin exampl , onli a specialist and not generalist can build such a machin and can improv the featur of it . specialist are veri import when it come to the technolog develop and advanc . conclud thi , have special is also import but what i feel is there should be a good mixtur of complement each other .
