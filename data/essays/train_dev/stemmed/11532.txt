thi is a problemat issu we are go to speak about . it is not easi to steadli take a posit regard thi statement : i can just provid my person experi on thi matter : it 's true that i do n't use to spend time in help my commun but first we need to make clear what we mean with `` help mine commun '' . i 'm not into ani social organ or no profit compani and in thi way i 'm not help my commun , that 's true . but simpli becaus i have not time to do that sinc i made a choic : i am a student and i chose to give the prioriti to my studi in order to get a seriou job , which obvious , if well done , will bring help to my famili , my citi and hope my nation , or better my own commun . probabl you'r gonna ask me which kind of job i 'm look for , what background i have and what studi i 'm take to have such a weird idea about `` help your commun '' ... well i 'm a normal student and i 'm go to graduat in engin , and that is quit common ! also the job i will find will seem normal , but not the way i 'll work . i am sure that if everybodi work with interest and good purpos they do help their commun , instead of work not motiv and not well prepar . infact work not well prepar of cours is neg first for you , and for your entir commun as well . so , my job right now is to studi , and i have no time for be a volunt help my commun in the `` standard '' way . i think that the best i can do in order to help my commun is to keep studi hard , find a good job and work hard and in a posit way , and of cours my job will bring benefit to my commun . thi what i mean for `` help our commun '' .
