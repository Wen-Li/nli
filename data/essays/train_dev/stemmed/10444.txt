as the technolog advanc , societi ha learn to train peopl in certain field for it develop . it ha been an issu to all , whether peopl should go for understand in numer cours or go for profession in certain cours for deeper understand . and be a student myself , i believ that it is more benefici to go for understand in numer cours , becaus it is my belief that it is import for student to be inform of varieti of subject area . first , it is becau it make student to be more awar of mani opportun that may come in their futur . a student can not even think of be a psychologist , when he doe not know that certain field exist . and by do so , divers of job in the societi can be achiev . second , individu perform better at work , when they are awar of mani other fact or mechan in differ field . for exampl , an architect who is profound in the principl of physic work better than who doe not simpli becaus of more knowleg in differ field . therefor , we can now conclud that peopl are more competit at work by learn about differ field of educ . of cours , some may argu that peopl have to promot profession for the advanc of technolog . it is veri true inde . no one can disregard the fact that more inform about the chemistri can help an individu to mix the chemic , but thi profession can come after educ , where peopl are actual be train for their work . to conclud the reason abov , i believ in the import of educ on varieti of field , becau it alert student on possibl futur career , and it provid peopl of the skill to integr for the better understand of the subject he would like to pursu . and although it is true that an individu can work better with special in the field , i still believ that thi can wait until the day we are go to be train as profession , but till then we should promot to understand varieti subject to help us more .
