when you want to travel to some place that you do not know , you have the posibl to visit interest place with a tour guid . i am agre to travel with a tour guid for mani reason : first , becaus you can know a lot specif inform about the place , that you do n't know . frecuent , a tour guid is a person that is prepar to give inform about the place that you visit , not onli with the inform that is written in the bulletin . for exampl , when i went last year to veracruz , i could know mani histori about the place , that i did not know , it not wa necesari to read the inform and it wa so great the time that i expend there . second , a tour guid could give inform about where and what is the best place for buy a present that could rememb the place . becaus some time you may find the same thing or git less expens in the place that he or she recomend . third , he or she could give a recommend about the best pictur , that you can get for you album . besid my opinion is agre to have a tour guid when you travel , sometim i am disagre when i do not have a lot of money , and i prefer to spend it in other thing , for exampl : typic food or cloth . also becaus sometim to take a tour take a lot of time and you may arriv late at place and you do not have enough time for expend by yourself if you have a guid .
