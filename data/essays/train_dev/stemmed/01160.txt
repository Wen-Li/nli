i agre with the the statement , young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun and are too busi spend time on other thing . the young peopl of today claim to be veri busi and not to have time for idl pastim . how much of thi is realli true ? cant a youngster fit in about two hour a week into hi busi schedul dedic to commun servic ? too mani question with not enough answer . young peopl of today do lead more compitit live . compitit today is much more than what it wa 10 year back . with increas compititit , the student ha to put in greater amount of work just to get notic . howev , what youngster fail to realis is that more leverag is been given nowaday to peopl who serv the commun . as an exampl , a compani that had come to recruit student from my colleg had given prefer to those that had done some amount of commuinti work as compar to those that havent . moreov , i feel that , the main time spent by a youngster today is in watch movi , spend time with hi or her friend or surf the internet . the advent of the internet ha caus peopl to becom more insul from one anoth . peopl claim that they are veri activ on the net . some go to the extent that they use the net for `` social '' caus such as creat a blog after a disast , such as a flood , war or earthquak . the same youngster goe on to feel veri proud of himself . at some point of time , the young person need to understand that a blog onli help in voic opinion but dosent help solv problem . thirdli , i feel the one major thing absent in all youngster today is a concienc that tell them to do good for other . youngster seem to have becom a selfish lot by care onli about themselv and their comfort . they seem to lack the enthusiasm to go the extra mile to help other peopl . i feel , thi is due to a lack of awar . henc , at some time in the school level , all student must be made to do someth good for their class or for their friend so that they realis how good it feel to help other . in conclus , a young person must give more time to help the commun sinc , if everi young person could do just that , the world would becom a better place to live in .
