the issu state by the topic is wheter or not in twenti year there will be fewer car than today . i believ that it is imposs to have less car that today . one reason i believ that will not be fewer car is becaus to have a car mean to be indipend , and who want not be indipend ? i mean that in a normal famili evreyon want to have a car , for instanc a car is necessari fot the husband to go to work , anoth car is necessari to the wife to go either to work and make shop , and we can not forget son or daughter . so the situat is veri preved , if everyon want a car , the number of these car wiill increas in the futur . anoth reason i think there will be more car in the futur becaus a car is look like a stutu symbol . for exampl who ha a expens and sportiv car , like ferrari , want to show to other peopl that he or she is a rich man or woman . anoth reason i think that there will be more car is that today as in the futur there is the opportun to chose your favourit car , i mean that there are a lot of kind of car and a lot of brand . automot factori are tri to satisfi custom need with specif kind of car and give to them the possibl to chose almost everyth in a car , for exampl the colour and the materi of the seat , the colour of the whole car , and also the model of the engin : diesel or not . as we can see peopl can obtain it whise realiz and often without pay a lot for a car . in conclus in the futur the number of car wiil be higher than now , becaus peol need to be indipend and choos a custom car is not anymor difficult .
