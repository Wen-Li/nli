young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl ? i think thi is a realli hard question . both side have their own benefit . the role in life are kind of invert . when you have the health to enjoy life , you dont have money , have to work , and cant enjoy it . then , when you are old , you have the time and money , and becaus of your health , you cant enjoy it as much is if you were younger . i dont agre in part with the propos statement . when you are young , you have littl problem and consequ live without stress , enjoy . onc you start grow the problem get more seriou and you start to feel the stress . i like veri much to be young and am now detrmin with the thing i am pursu . i am not go to tell you that i enjoy work as do sport , but i enjoy my work too . if i could choos , i wouldnt chang my posit . life is about stage and i tri to enjoy each of them . older peopl enjoy life in a differ way . their knowledg and posit allow them to enjoy specif situat ; obvious depend of the stage in which they are . they could have had retir and be travel aound the world , they could have had their first nephew , they can enjoy read about their real interest , they can spent some time in their beach hous , they can play some tenni , they can develop their entreprneurship interest , etc . summaryz , they have more experi and are in total control of their life . if they have a stabl econom situat , they can do whatev they want and realli enjoy life .
