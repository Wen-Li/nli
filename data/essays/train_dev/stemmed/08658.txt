today , scientif technolog is develop continu . the field of scinc is help our live a lot in mani way . one exampl is transportaion . peopl should spend a lot more time to move from one place to anoth place when they did n't have transport but it becam possibl as they have mani differ way of transport . for exampl , subway , train , airplan , bike , car and so on . they brought us a lot of advantag . howev , the transport have also disadvantag . in my opinion , in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are toay becaus car caus pollut and are danger . first , car bring pollut to us as produc a lot of exhaust ga . to move car , we have to use gasolin ga or lpg ga now . howev , those gase are extremli harm to our societi . they affect us to end up the variou diseas and increas of carbon dioxid in the air . as we breath , we are take dirti particl from the air . also , increas carbon dioxid is seriou problem now in the world . it could lead to bigger problem such as global warm which also caus mani differ event includ melt ice mountain so that the level of the ocean is get higer . use more car mean that we are go to bring more environment problem to the world . second , car are danger as i said befor . there are so mani accid occur everyday by car . we can reduc those accid by practic not to use car . instead of use car , we could use other transport which caus less accid . also , the issu of traffic jam affect by car accid in the middl of the highway could be the problem . as they solv the problem of accid , more peopl could have damag from it . car could bring us danger accid includ death . in conclus , develop of scientif technolog would help to creat better transport than car so that peopl could use it without caus pollut and accid . therefor , in twenti year there wilil be fewer car in use than there are today .
