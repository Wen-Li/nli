i think that most advertis make product seem much better than they are . thi is , of cours , a kind of cheat to the custom on one hand . but on the other hand it just normal . it develop like thi over the time , cours by mani reason . i think there are two differ issu about advertis : touch and see . if peopl watch advertis , for exampl in the televis , the are just abl to see the product , and not to touch it . as the touch af a product , and the develop person feel base on the textur of it , is veri import for human to get an opinion about a product , advertis is alwa kind of cheat . .. well , in my opinion thi is cours enough not too watch advertis , but mani peopl still do . i state , that if peopl do not touch a product , they can not get a real opinion of it . the statement that most product look much better in advertis is even more correct as mani compani treat the advertis product veri hard befor use it . a good exampl fot thi is the mc donald burger . mc donald is , trueli , paint the burger they use in their advertis . thi paint make the buerger look more juci , more tasti . thi behavior is what i realli call cheat . the compani can not do anyth about the fact that peopl can not touch their product in televis . but they should not chang the origin view of the product to give peopl a wrong , but better sell view , of it . advertis ha alway been the best way to introduc new product to the peopl . through the last centuri it apear in mani differ kind . start with local advertis in small newspap or just on the street mani year ago , the increas develop if tecnologi over the last year make advertis appear nearli everywher in the world , at ani time of a day . it is possibl to find a big sign of coke advertis in the middl of africa . through the tecnologi campani from japan are abl to advertis their product in germani as well as in india . my opinion to the advertis of today is that nearli all product seem to be better than they realli are , becaus the worldwid produc and sell compani are all abl to use the new tecnolog for their advertis . the new tecnologi like televis , mobil phone , radio and so on make the human alway avali and reachabl for new inform . and as the human do neari all reli on the tecnologi , ( even if they are not awar of it ) it even more easi for compani to introduc and , in fact , fake their advertis product .
