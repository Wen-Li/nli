i think that to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to special in onli one specif subject , and i have three reason for thi conclus . first , let 's think about one situat , there were one univ-educatet student and he would work at a conpani , then if he learn mani subject , i think that he could get mani type of work and he could show hi all abil . in thi case , if he learn onli one specif subject , i think that he might do good work , but he could get onli one type of work and he could n't show hi all abil . thi is mainli reason that i think it . second , i think that larg studi might lead the person to a big heart . if you learnd mani academ subject , you might have a big heart enogh to get the subject . for exampl , some learnd econom and polit at an univers and the other lean onli econom at the same univers . the former ha a kowledg about polit whether it is deep or sarrow and the latter ha no knowledg
