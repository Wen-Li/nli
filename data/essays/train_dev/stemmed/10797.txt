i do n't think that success peopl tri new thing and take new risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . of cours we all no famou exampl of peopl bee success in make a new invent , tri new way of buisi or start new direct in art , music and literatur . but i think thi is not the major of the success peopl . i rather think that the person of them is usual anoth one , which is my first point against the statement . it is alway easier to do what peopl accept somebodi to do and to use old method to becom a success person . it might be sad , but it is rather like to becom successful by use old `` trick '' , your famili background or connect . so i think the person of most of success peopl is rather one , which use the old way , than one , that tri new way . we onli sometim think that the opposit is true , becaus peopl , which were success in make a new invent for exampl are more import for other poepl and for us . so we know them better . and when a success buisinessman tri for exampl a new trade practic , he ha a better chanc to make good money , becaus he ha alreadi a helful background . and onc more we will hear about him more like , althow most of success buisinessmen would not do thi . my second import point is , that a person , which is work and live success ha no reason for tri new method or chang hi live . whi should such a person take a risk ? the histori show for exampl , that most of the peopl come to america were poor peopl , which had noth to lose . the richer one usual stay in there countri , where they had a safe live .
