some peopl think that the more import thing for student is to understand idea and concept ; other peopl think that the more import thing for them is to learn fact . both way are veri import , but i prefer to lean fact . there are three reason . first of all , learn fact is basic of studi . for examl , when i wa high school student , i had a histori class . thi class 's purpos is learn histor fact , not idea and concept . second , student can get the specif while they are learn fact . for instanc , in math class , student are suppos to learn formular . thi is the fact . final , learn fact is to understand the truth . in other word , fact never tell a lie . howev , if student understand idea and concept , it ha possibl for them to misunderstand . for exampl , everybodi ha own idea and concept even though they are correct or not . if these idea and concept are correct , they make sens and have no ploblem in their live . howev , if they are wrong , they do not make sens and have a lot of troubl . in order to prevent that , student should studi fact , not idea and concept . i do not mention that it is not import for student to understand idea and concept . at the same time , i do not mention that it is import for them to learn fact onli . as i state , both way are veri import for student , especi young student . in japan , a lot of school such as a elementari school , a junior high school , and a high school , teach their student fact . howev , a lot of universti teach thier student idea and concept becaus they are not young . in addit , they have abil to understand idea and concept . in conclus , it is more import for student to learn fact becaus they need foundament of studi , especi young student .
