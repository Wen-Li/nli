i disagre with the statement that twenti year from now there will be fewer car in use than there are today . nowaday peopl are realis the benefit that the automobil provid to peopl . it more convieni to travel by a car than by other mean of transport as car provid us with a sort of freedom that we do n't get from other maen of transport and sinc the economi is improv more and more peopl can afford to buy car . thi will lead to an increas in the number of car in the near futur as m nowday the automobil compani provid varieti of comfort with the car and henc make travel more fun in the car . and thse comfort will onli increas as the time goe on . the safeti standard of the car is also be steadili improv upon thu make a car journey much more safer . the safeti standar can onli improv with time thu make car much more safer than other mean of transport . moreov it is easier to buy a car nowday with the reduct in price and the varieti which is avail . and a few year from now we will see more varieti thu prompt peopl to discard their old car and buy a new one . also the one thing that will never go away is the enjoy one get while drive a car . thi will never go away and will make peopl buy car . then their is the reason of econom superior that we human tend to show which make peopl buy mani car . thu all these reason suggest that their will never be a reduct in the demand of car and henc we will see more and more car on the road few year from now .
