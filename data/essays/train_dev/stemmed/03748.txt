the technolog ha been improv so much past decad , solv all sort of problem that we had , and still keep develop . even though the technolog is fast improv , there are major problem rema which is increas of car that pollut our enviro . i cast doubt that twenti year is too short time to prove the problem . first , the speed of develop in technolog is unbeliev fast . no one thought that they can talk to each other and see each other in same time with the wireless phone . howev , with the technolog have so far , onli will be abl to creat anoth car such as fli car or car that can go under the water . thi could not be the solut as the amount of car will be same as now or even more . it will be great improv but would not help the problem of pollut by car . secondli , last twenti year there ha been dramat differ on tranfer matter , di believ that twenti year is too short time to think whether amount of car will decreas . i strongli believ that one day it will ; howev with the technolog we have at the moment , can not solv thi problem . in conclus , we are have pollut problem becaus of increas number of car such as air pollut , nose pollut . with the technolog keep develop , one day amount of car will decreas or even disappear by use new way of tran . nevertheless , in my opinion , thi can not take place in twenti year .
