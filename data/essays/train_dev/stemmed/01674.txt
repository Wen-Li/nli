the idea of advertis is to help the compani to sell more product . while compet with other compani , compani tend to make their product look better in their advertis . i agre the fact that most advertis make product look much better than they realli are , but i do n't disagre with the way compani do it . the same as a movi preview , the director alway want to show the most excit part of the movi . compani tend to skip the inconvi and disadventig of their product . instead , they alway show the best of their product . sometim , the compani will use special edit and film skill to make their product look even better . for exampl , when the new i-pod nano first came out in the comerci , peopl were amaz by it pretti disign and how small it wa . howev , buyer soon realiz that the i-pod nano wa veri easi to be scrach . moreov , the i-pod nano ha a veri small menmori compar to other i-pod . the funni thing is that i bought a i-pod nano right after i saw the comerti . of cours , the nano wa not as excit as the one in comerti , but it wa not much wors . howev , i wa realli angri when i saw the first scrach mark on my i-pod nano . in now day , sinc peopl are live in a materi word , there are mani product are meant to make our life better , happier , but we do n't neccesarri need them in our dayli life such as a i-pod , cabl tv , comput , fanci cloth , and more . becaus of these product are not neccesarri for our life , compani have to make peopl want to buy them and do not expect a stabl market without have ani advertis . of cours , sinc advertis are the onli way peopl will know these product , compani tri to make them look as good as possibl . therefor , most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
