travel is veri interest for me , but there is a controversi how to travel ; go alon or in a group . i disagre with thi theme and i rais four reason for thi . first of all , i 'd like to go wherev i can go . it is veri use to go with a tour guid , special to the place that i 've never been to , becaus i have littl knowledg of danger place to visit . but in guid tour , there are someth that i do n't want to go to . also , plan for the place that i want to go is also preciou time . itim to traval is limit , and from plan to travel , it is a start point ! secondli , travel is expand our eye . i travel brazil a lot and i wa capabl of know foreign peopl . to know what they do , think and like wa an veri interest chanc . i like foreign , includ brazilian , and also want to commun with foreign peopl . trave is know and expand friend , but thi will happen onli when go abroad alon , and i would have never had such an experi with travail by myself . at last , travail is a chanc of think what i am and what i am go to be . in a place where we live , i ca n't be stimul and there are n't good for my health , but in a new place , i can be fresh in my mind , and i want to know about thi . i know that traval with a group , for exampl with friend , famili , but it is not interest larg becaus i ca n't see , think alon . it is a chanc to go , think , enjoy by myself , not for other . i want to go everi year alon travail wherev i want , and expand my abil .
