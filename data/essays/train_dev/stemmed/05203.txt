it is alway up to the person whether one like to keep the track of other or do someth new , someth which 's not tri befor . so accord to thi idea of mine , i believ that success is a reflect of person . in my opinion success come from product and innov . if you do n't tri someth new and do the same thing those have been done for year , you dont produc much . we can clearli see that from the current situat of the economi of the countri in the world . the biggest economi which produc the largest amount of nation incom are the one which alway produc and sell new technolog innov . they are the one who are successful in the world economi . becaus , take risk is the most valuabl input of the econom activ . tri new thing alway includ much more risk than the do what they alreadi know how to do well . as take risk ha a price , risk avers peopl or societi can not be successful . if we go on from our exampl , far east countri which onli produc already-invented-good , can onli have a littl profit sinc they dont take the risk of tri new thing . the same thing is valid in the extend of person . in my view , do the thing what someon alreadi know how to do well , is a thing which can be achiev by an ordinari man but not by a successful man . becaus tri new thing need courag and effort to succeed . and thi effort and courag must be at a level which can not be obtain by everyon sinc everyon can not be successful . it is to be sucessful to creat thi differ .
