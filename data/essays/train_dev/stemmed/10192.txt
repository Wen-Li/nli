i think that to be a successuf peopl the peopl can tri new thing and take risk much than do onli what they alreadi know how to do well , but when becam succes they often do onli one thing . in fact often the person , who becam succes , doe one thig veri veri well : he know how to do someth and he doe it . for exampl an succes artist doe hi work veri well . but for some other peopl that do n't have particular abil , a good way to bacam success is to tri new thing and take risk . but when they know how do well someth , often they onli do thi thing . thi is a piti becaus thi beahviour make their work so bore and i think that there is n't someth that a person can know complet . in everi materia there is new knowledg , for exampl in biolog the scientist discov a lot of new thing everi year . anoth seriou problem is the `` knowledg divis '' : for exampl an expert in lecteratur can do n't know the common problem of pictur . for the cultur of peopl is a damag : everi person ha to be a bit interest in a lot of thing . i think that real succes peopl is peopl who have a great knowledg in a lot of thing .
