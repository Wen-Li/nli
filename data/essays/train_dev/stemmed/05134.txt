when peopl travel , they usual go place where they have not been befor . depend on the characterist of thi place , a tour guid can be more or less help . discov a new citi by travel , mean that there will be a lot to learn about the histori , architectur , cultur , etc. of the citi and the region . in thi case , have a tour guid , who know the citi well enough , will help you get to know the citi and see place you would not have found on your own . it can be veri frustrat , to be somewher and not know what the place is realli about . on the other hand , thi problem can be overcom by do research beforehand . with the advent of the internet , a larg number of sourc are avail for liter everi place in the world , and peopl can find everyth they want to know . i person , like to read about the place i travel and learn about them befor i go there . howev , you will never get to see a citi form the point of view of somebodi actual live there . therefor , have a tour guid for at least part of the travel is my favorit choic . if you travel in order to mainli go hike in the mountain , to go ski or snowboard , or to just enjoy relax on a beach , there is definit no need for a tour guid . such travel is to address the question whether or not to travel in a group , i would prefer go on holiday with as mani peopl as possibl . experienc new thing , or have fun in a relax holiday , is alway more fullfil and pleasur in a group . i alway need somebodi to share my thought with . also , go to bar adn club , or just have a nice dinner , is part of a good travel . for those reason , have peopl around to chat and have fun with is a must when i travel . sure , the issu of travel with or without a tour guid and in a group or alon , is a matter of person . sinc i am a veri social person , i like to have peopl around me . also , i am alway curiou about other countri and their cultur , so i want to learn as much as possibl form a travel and like to have somebodi from the region to tell me , from person experi , what the place is about .
