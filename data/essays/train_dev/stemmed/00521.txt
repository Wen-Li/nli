i disagre . i have three opinion to support thi reason . first is the way to travel with a group led by a tour guid is not free to activ . they made me unhappi to put me just one cous where we have to go and even scasul when we should go there . in everywher , mayb we could find impresst on the specif place , but i can not stay more the place such a hard scasul or with the group . second is it seem inexpens on the surfec , but they let me spend moni littl by littl , as aditt praic . if i traveld alon , prohap i can more economicali to stati the citi in oder to make fraiend . threrdli , we can not to make mani local friend in the trip , if i led a such group . if travel up to alon , i can more closs to the local tradison . therefor , i disagre the way that led by a tour guid .
