young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i will argu in favour of thi statement by use sever support aspect which are directli relat to the topic . one big reason whi thi statement is true , is that individu and person achiev concern the own career are becom the ultim goal for everyon in societi . there is no time and room left to help old peopl , take care of children or foster public compound . due to that increas egot , young peopl show a lack of respons and care of their direct human counterpart in their nearbi commun . modern art of life is strongli indic that person achiev is a must-hav and a life surviv necess to everi young , ambiti and aspir man or woman . so if everyon is preoccupi by reach hi own goal , there is no progress of societi anymor . in fact , societi would decreas and loos all it valu or achiev it ha reach over the centuri . so individu and egot inevit lead to a downgrad societi and is a real danger to everyon live in thi societi . so young peopl should spend more time by support societi in a way each fit in best . it is even a duti for young energet peopl to supplement their power and vital to support their surround commun . a equilibrium between help commun and person achiev must be reach by everyon . but thi must be taught bei the elder societi member , and thu thi messag must be convey from top to bottom . if the adult can ' t reach the young peopl no more , one must not wonder about the grow egot and refus to support local or feder commun . in my opinion thi is a real problem to societi and will preoccupi us a lot in the futur . the failur of the previou gener are now seen in their offspr .
