i complet agre with these statement . when a new product , whether is a servic or an item , is launch , almost all the time , the market peopl ha to find a way to enhac it qualiti in order to convinc the final user to buy it . research say thi is almost psicholog base in the client expect about the product , for exampl , if the product will make the user feel or look better , or if the product will give it user some kind of social posit , special talk of a trademark such as loui vuitton , rolex , etc. , so the market crew reflect those product or servic attribut that will make the final consum feel he is adquir a great thing . but thi doe not mean the product will be abl to reach all the client expect . there are some time , when the client buy someth , gui by a great advertis , which enhanc to the top all the qualiti of the product , and , mayb , other qualiti that actual are not part of it , give a great decept to the consum when he use it . thi also make a disadvantag in advertis which show product much better than they actual are , becaus if a consum is disappoint with it buy , chanc are that he will tell to at least ten person that the product he buy , atract by a fals advertis is not as good as they offer , thu , these other ten person will also chat to other peopl the feel of the first disappoint consum , make them consid other option in the same rang of product to buy instead of the one advertis . there even have been some legal action against the `` lier manufactur '' . tri to avoid some of these case , manufactur are actual put some `` littl label '' on their product , to explain to the consum that some of the product qualiti ha been enhac in order to show them better . for exampl , in cereal box , almost alway show the littl phrase , `` enlarg to show textur '' , but not to make the consum that the product size is actual like the photo on the box . to conclud , i think it is better to show the real qualiti of a product , just as they are , or at least , to make ani statement of the reason they enhanc their product , just as the exampl i made of the cereal box .
