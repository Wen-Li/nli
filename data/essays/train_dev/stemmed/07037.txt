although i think i am young , i can not enjoy my life becaus of lack of money and time . i had to studi hard to attend a good univers sinc i wa a child . after graduat from univers , i also had to get a job to earn money for live . as a result , i disagre that young peopl enjoy their live than older peopl do becaus of lack or money and time . i think that the older can enjoy life more . first of all , the older have more money than the young . we need money to do someth . if i like read novel , i have to buy book . if i like a travel , i have to buy a car or buy a expens airlin ticket for go abrod . becaus of thi money problem , i can not often travel abroad . howev , my parent use to go abroad for their enjoy becaus they are rich . they have enough nomey to buy expens ticket and to pay for luxuri hotel room . i am enviou hi welth , so i am work hard to earn more money . secondli , young peopl have no enough time to enjoy their live . when they were child , they have to studi hard . becaus their parent want to go more high repuataion univers , they have spend all time to studi . they also have no time after graduat from univers . becaus tuition fee of univers is veri expens , the young peopl would have a lot of depth after graduat . after all , they have to work hard for the depth and then for marriag and for their children . in contrast , old peopl would have a lot of time if mani old peopl alreadi retir . thu , old peopl were not worri about lack of time . in conclus , although young peopl have more high physic power than older peopl , young peopl can not enjoy their life more than the old peopl becaus young peopl have no enough money and time . as a result , i disagre that the young enjoy life more than the old doe . i think that when young peopl work hard , they can be seen a good peopl .
