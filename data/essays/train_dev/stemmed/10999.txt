some peopl argu that when student studi , they just learn import fact , and memor those fact without understand real mean that fact have becaus it is more effici . howev , i completli disagre thi opinion becaus student who learn just fact can not adjust the fact that they learn to differ problem , also can not go next level easili , and can not have lot of knoweledg . first , if student learn fact , they can not use those fact for the other situat becaus they do n't know real concept that fact have . for exampl , student who learn the fact about the part of american histori , the civil war , can know what happen dure the war time , and who achiev some import job . howev , they do n't understand the real mean of civil war that affect whole american histori , and can not find common or differ thing from the other similrar histor event . second , they will have a difficulti to learn some fact that is hirher level . in the math class , some student just learn the fact about formula of the limit and memor specif rule . if they meet some higher level problem , or problem that is more complic , they can not answer . also , if they forget the formula that they learn and memor , they can not solv the math problem . howev , the student who understand concept and idea can use their concept for the question that is higher level . final , student who understand idea and concept can enhanc their knowledg and inform . know fact will be forgotten over time . howev , understand basic concept and idea will last over time , and it will be their knoweledg dure their life time . therefor , i strongli believ that it is the most import thing to understand concept and idea at first for sutdent becaus it is help for understand the other thing and more difficult problem , also earn valuabl knoweledg .
