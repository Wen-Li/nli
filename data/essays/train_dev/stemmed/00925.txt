i believ that it is better to have a broad knowledg of multipl academ subject than to be a specialist in onli one . the primari reason for thi belief are the balanc a student gain from have broad knowledg and the interrelationship that exist between differ subject . let start by look at the import of balanc knowledg . be good in multipl subject such as financ and strateg manag will allow a manag consult to give advic take multipl scenario into consider . on the other hand , a specialist in financ would be abl to give a solut sole in term of bottomlin result in a less practic solut for the custom . the second advantag is that a compani need to hire one student compet in two field , rather than spend more resourc hire two expert . in addit , have two expert who do n't understand each other could result in an inferior solut becaus of the lack of agreement . the final reason is the interrelationship between subject . for exampl , a physic scientist ha to use complex mathemat formula for prove some of hi conclus . if he wa special in physic alon , he may not be abl to prove hi theori unlik a scientist who is good at physic and math . in conclus , while a specialist may have valu in certain situat , the better valu proposit that a balanc student bring to the tabl and the multipl option he ha in hi career outweigh the advantag of special in one subject .
