i do agre that most advertis are some time mislead to the custom and the custom end up spend huge amount of money . although there are law which will take in to consider about the product which are mislead and in bad tast , there are mani product which are come into the market . for exampl in the e commerc , the custom reli on the perticular supplier and some time the custom reciev an inferior qualiti product and it is time consum for the custom to return back the product as he ha to follow the procedur . advertis should have a proper inform about a product for the layman to understand . the advertis should act accord to the law and the custom should have a easi accessibl to return back the product if such product is not how it is describ in the advertis . there should be custom line for everi product for the custom to explain how he feel about the product and whether there ani suggest on the product . in the third world countri custom endup in pay huge amount of money reli on the advertis and they hardli have custom line . in my openion there should be proper inform about the product and the product should give inform in case where the custom is not fulli satisfi about the product and the consum care line should be there wherein the custom can complain about the product to the specif author . lack of custom care line and not have a check on the bad advertis , the custom will be in loss . the law should be strict and custom should be inform where to complain and whom to approach to give a complaint . there are so mani product which are advertis but dosent give clear messag , custom often get confus and mislead with the advertis .
