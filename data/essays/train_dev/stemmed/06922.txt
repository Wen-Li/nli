one day i woke up i heard my dad fight with my mom for who take the car and goe to work and the other to go by a cap , from that reason my dad bought to my mom a car so i disagre that will be fewer car in the come twenti year . car is one of the most import thing that peopl cant live without , without car peopl wont be abl to go to work or live their life the way they want . car is the main thing that is make life easier these day . there are mani reason whi number of car will not decreas for the come year . one of the most import reason is that car is the object that help someon go to work and get what the famili need . first of all , peopl use car to go work and do their job and get everythin that the famili need also it allow them to do mani thing they like . also one of the most import reason is that the car help from move from place to anoth . mani peopl need car for go from their hous for exampl to visit their famili . after that car are made for move from place to place wheither it far or near . final , these day number of car increas becaus amni student are graduat from school and they close the age of 18 and they appli for the licens to have a car . all peopl like to drive and mostli teenag . these day who turn to the age of 18 appli for the licens test and later on they get a car . in conclus , i dont think that number of car will decreas no matter what and through the exampl i mention car rate will keep on increas for the come day and year .
