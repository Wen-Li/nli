risk or hesit ? in my opinion take risk is someth that make your life worth live . off cours take risk is not someth that all the peopl are abl to do , becaus you may have to put up with the eventu neg effect of have done a certain choic . so if you have a strong person , if you are audaciu , you can go throgh the `` experi of risk '' and most of the time you will have posit feedback . in my person experi someth happen that make me strongli support thi idea . my father ha been work for all hi life for some technolog compani , but one time he had to handl with the terribl `` mob practic '' which are conceiv to put a person under a psycolog pressur . he decid to leav the compani befor be fire , and so he took a great risk put our famili in a condit of econom uncertainti . then he took anoth great risk decid to start run is own bussi . right now he is realli happi and satisfi becaus everyth is go in the right direct . i 'm not tell that everytim you take a risk there will be someth more posit wait for you , but if you 'll never tri to do that you might regret the fact of not have been enough brave . furthermor if you keep on do someth that is realli familiar to you , someth of which you have a perfect knowledg about the possibl consequ , you won ' never experi excit and your exist will be flat and annoy . so take the risk is someth that everybodi should do , in order to gain self-confid . becaus most of the time thi is a way to understand as far as you can push your limit let you know that possibl are infinit .
