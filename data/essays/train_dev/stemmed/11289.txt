it is hard for me to choos on whether learn the idea and concept are more import than learn the fact . the two concept given are kind of complet each other so choos one and leav one out would creat problem . still i would say that when start to work on a new subject or issu it is realli import to first understand the concept and idea becaus without them it is worthless to learn fact that you would not have someth to base the new inform and the new idea given or tought to you . as a metaphor i might say that the idea and the concept can be seen as the cement and the new fact can be the new room be decor in an apart that wa built with that cement . lead from thi metaphor still i can say that the fact so the room are import too becaus without them whi would you build an apart ? as a student what i gener do is that , firstli i start and tri to understand the deep concept and idea then i work on with the fact which help me to understand more in a much deeper way and the most import thing with the concept and idea part is that they are most effect tool for me to analyz the fact offer and given .
