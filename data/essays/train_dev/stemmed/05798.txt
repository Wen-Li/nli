`` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' i complet disagre with the abov proposit due to the follow point technolog innov : the abov proposit actual take a backward step with respect to the world which is evolv technolog at a breathtak pace . in the next 20 year the technolog would be so advanc that car would be more effic , more cheaper and environment friendli . with the way automot innov are progress , a time would come when everyon in the world would opt for a car . industri and develop : till date the major of car are found onli in the develop countri . but with aggress industri and develop take place in the develop countri which constitut a major consum base , the scenario would complet chang . in the next 20 year , the develop countri would reach a stage where peopl in these countri would have more earn power and a rais standard of live . thi would natur translat into more buy capabl which would mean that , 20 year from now , major of the of car would be driven in these develop countri . thi in effect would increas the alreadi exist number of car . emerg market : it ha been estim in the next 20 year , develop countri like india , brazil and china would increas their econom prowess to the extent compar to the like of u. and the european union . as these 3 countri constitut a major chunk of the world 's popul , they would natur form signific market for all kind of consum good which would also includ car . with the explos and continu growth of these develop countri , there is no doubt that there would be a high growth trajectori for the number of car pli on the road in futur . henc the abov 3 factor are the princip reason whi the abov proposit state is fals .
