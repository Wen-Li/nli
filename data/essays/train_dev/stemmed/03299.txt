car are associ with the twentieth centuri -- they were creat at the begin of thi centuri . nevertheless , sinc a decad , the sell of car in europ and in the unit state of america are decreas ; gener motor and ford are still in the top 5 of the best car compani , but the first one is not an american . becaus of environment issu such as the greenhous effect caus by emiss of carbon-dioxyd , we may wonder if in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . even if , in my opinion , in the industrialis world car are tend to decreas becaus of the pressur of some environment think-thank , group or organis , i fierc believ that there will be more car in twenti year than now . inde , a host of countri which are nowaday in develop , may reach their matur in these twenti year -- for instanc , when the asian world , such as china or india , will be consid as industri countri , i suppos that an indian or a chines car constructor would be next to the toyota 's rank -- a car major compani . in other word , even though the industri world may do a host of invest in common transport such as bu or subway , i assert that in twenti year there will be more car than now . oil rersourc , which is the first car energi , are plummet , and on the opposit , the demand is skyrocket ; thu , it 's tantamout to say that if there will be fewer energi in twenti year , there will be fewer car . howev , i still maintain that there will be more car : dure these twenti year , i suppos that altern car 's enegi might be found or creat by scientist or ecologist , and therefor , that car would be still abbl and allow to be driven . the twentieth centuri is the centuri of car . thi one may be a bridg between two kind of transport . nevertheless , the gap is still deep , and that 's whi i think that there will be more , and not fewer , car in twenti year .
