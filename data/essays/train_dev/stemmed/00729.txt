i disagre with the mention statement . a success person will be have complet knowledg of hi special . he is gener perciev to be a master in hi field . thi , gener is true . howev there is also anoth particular trait of a succes man i.e he will also tri to explor new avenu to improv hi knowledg and skill . thi is again perciev to be an over the top move or a `` risk '' . but thi is not true , becaus knowledg is an ocean whose depth are unknown . a success person is not satisfi with the knowledg he ha got and alway tri to do one better . a success person alway believ that if he lose the quest for knowledg he will lose the will to succeed . also if a person is satisfi with whatev he ha got and achiev it lead to it stagnat and he doe not grow as an individu . henc it would be inappropri to term thi quest as a `` risk '' . a success person alway enjoy the pain for tri out new thing or ventur into new topic . it may appear as a risk to teh watcher but for a success person it is the divin pleasur of learn . thi learn could be of variou type rang for wide rang of subject to learn someth which is embib in the natur . as long as it is construct in build hi charact he is happi . more over tri new thing make us gain knowledg which is the biggest gain in life and nullifi ani other loss that we could experi . a success person can start hi life fromani advers he face util the knowleg he gain by ventur into variou diffrent thing . henc it would be inappropri to say that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' .
