in my person opinion young peopl do not spend enough time help their commun when it is need . our person goal focu on ourselv wherea other gener 's goal focus on commun . there may be mani reason whi thi chang came upon us , howev , i guess the most import one is relat to thi our new style of life . our way of life push us to worri about person thing rather than global one . we care about our person imag , our person grant and our person skill . we have to . howev we must tri to chang and we ought to realiz what it is happen outsid and in fact we should give our help hand . anyway , i think young peopl are no blame of thi kind of selfish but they are unawar . first of all , we have adquir a new way of life . we do live comfort . our parent usual provid us everyth we need . everywher it seem as if nobodi need anyth from us as long . our commun is rich and everyon can reach a good posit as long as thi person work . thu , our goal is not relat to our commun in which everyth run `` perfectli well '' but it is focus in ourselv . our own complain and artifici need are highlight . we have to be perfect not just good , but perfect . we have to worri about such thing in order to surviv in thi `` ideal commun '' . inasmuch as we are so worri about ourselv we are not abl to see the problem our commun ha , we are not awar of that . regard thi lack of awar we can explain whi we do not help but we can not avoid tri peopl realiz their selfish . we have to take a look over our realiti . we must do more for our commun than we are do up to now . it is a good chanc not onli for the commun but for us to grow
