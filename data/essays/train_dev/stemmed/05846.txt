i neither disagre or agre the statement that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun for variou reason . first of all in past time peopl especi youth ha much more spare time compar to present time youth . morev the oblig of the youth are much more than the former one , as an exampl in my countri due to econom reason almost 80 percent of collag undergradu ha to have a lte night job to cover up for hi or her collag fee and expens . therefor it is imposs to make a fair comparison betwwen gener . secondli , in my countri , turkey , although the share and help commun of past turkish cultur doe not seem to exist as it wa 15-20 year ago , there ha been an signific increas in both quantiti of chariti union and their member number with comparison . moreov , accord to my observ , 3 out of 5 peopl who join thi kind of organ are mostli in a age rang of 18-30 . they help peopl with disabl to adapt the societi , arrang a support group for misbehav children and women , give lectur for poor famili children . today the commun servic and chariti work are done much more organ compar to way back then . in conclus , the condit of today and past gener are veri differ than each other . altough it may be seen that youth spend less time for help their commun stillplay signific role to help it ,
