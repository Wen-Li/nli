i 'm not agre with the statement , at least i 'm not agre if it 's a gener statement . i think that a gener knowledg it 's import becaus allow peopl to be abl to do so mani work , or to be inform on the topic argoment of aour time . but a broad knowledg at our day is not requir from the market . for exampl : in my futur work like an architect , the market ask for peopl that have a gener knoledg of the complic world of architectur , but at the same ask a special knoledg on one subject . thi is the reason whi the italian univers , like the european univers , chang the ordinari studi cours from five year to two kind of cours , from three and two year . thi divis allow the student to have a gener knowledg in the argoment in the first part of their studi and have a specif beachelor in the second part of their carrer . the most import reason to prefer the specif knowledg is that special ourself on a specif subject , argoment , cours or everyth els , can introduc jounger peopl into the world job and thi is posit for a nation that need to increas is product . in our situat , dure thees day of chang , thi way of think is import becaus i think that the age of gener knowledg it 's end ! we must be special in someth , first to be earli a worker and the specif knoledg can be a strument to find a differ work in anoth nation or countri too . thees are the most import reason to prefer a specif knowledg to a gener one but i thik also that we see thi import chang in the world of work onli from some year , becaus it 's an hard chang not also in the school and in the market , but in the peopl ay of life !
