i agre with the statement about travel with the tourguid with a group is the best way . becaus of the follow reason . you can learn lot of inform about the famou place . i t 's cheap , you wo n't be lone dure the travel . and you wo n't have problem talk to the foreign . these are the follow reason and exampl to the question . the first reason is that by travel with a tour guid , you can learn mani new inform about the famou place you are travel . the tour guid can expain all the import thing and histori about the place and help you understand more easili . second reason is that it is cheaper when you are travel in a group rather than yourself . you can save a lot of money and if you are a student thi can be the advantag to save money . money is realli valuabl , that is whi everybodi is save them . i onc visit itali with school friend when i wa young , we save alot of money . third reason is that you wo n't be loney dure the journey . when i wa travel around itali with my friend i saw some peopl travel alon and i thought that they look realli loney . when you are with the group you can chat and discuss how you feel about what you see and stuff . and also you can make good relationship with the member of the group . you can talk to friend you have never talk with . i made alot of friend while i wa travel and i 'm still in contact with one too . final , sometim when you are travel alon , you can face problem talk with the resid that live on that countri or ani other foeigner . at thi point a tour guid is veri use . he can translat and talk to them at your point of view . you can be confid with no frustrat . for the conclus i think travel in a group led by a tour guid is better becaus you can gain mani thing . inform , save money , make new friend and be confid .
