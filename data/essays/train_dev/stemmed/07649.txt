i strongli disagre with advertis activ make product seem much better than they realli do . thi is a case of manepul custom decis . some time thi concept might go further to demonstr a stau of cheat when mention fals inform about product or give unreli guarante . compani and good seller should talk and descib the actual advantag , featur and servic they have . present these item to the custom in an attaract way shall not be consid as a manner of cheat or tell lie . way of present good and advertis to them in a proper and honest way is mention the compon and item utel to amnufactur these good . compani utel materi with qualiti might point out the how good are the materi use in manufactur . anoth way of fair advertis actitv , is highlight the effort were requir to get some good produc and point out the profession and continu plan to tachiev thi perfect . market trend in some cultur by attract consum with utel cultur concept ( e.g. cultur and tradit say as a logo ) . anoth exampl of fair advertis is studi the trend and behaviour of consum ( e.g. pack children ' toy in a bright color box ) , and we shall not consid thi a manner of manepul wherea no fals inform were mention about thi product . by observ intern market , manufatur and good seller all over the world are now tri to give gloriou and attract name to their product which is n't a sort of decis maker manepul . focus also on the custom need and make pruchour point out the posit side and promis of fulfil their requir can be consid a way fair promot to some good . i do beleiv that all advertis activeti should be care studi to give bright imag about ani product to the custom without mentoin fals inform or make them look much better than they realli are .
