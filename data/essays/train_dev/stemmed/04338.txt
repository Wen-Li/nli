the statement say that there will be fewer car in use than there are today , in twenti year . howev , i do not think that the number of car will decreas in twenti year . i have two reason to support my opinion . first , car are the most conveni vehicl we have ever had to move wherev we want to go . for exampl , most place on the earth can not be reach onli by other mean such as train , airplan , or by foot . i imagin that global will have spread more in twenti year , which mean that peopl will move more activ than they do now . when popl move more activ , car must be the most conveni tool to satisfi their desir to move . furthermor , if more car are produc , the price of car will decreas , which result in more peopl to be abl to afford car . when consid the world popul will get enhanc in twenti year , i am convinc that more peopl will poss car than now . thu , there is no chanc to think about the decreas in the number of car in use . secondli , there are hundr of car manufactur in the world . i do not think they will reduc their number of product , becaus their profit may decreas by do so . manufactur are good at market and catch consum ' need in the first place . natur so are car manufactur . the world concern may be inclin to eco-friendli system in twenti year , but i am sure that car manufactur will creat those car which match the need of consum and of the earth in twenti year as well as they do now . addit , there have never been period when the number of car decreas so far . therefor , it is like that thi trend will continu , as long as car manufactur desir to produc mani car under the support of appropri market . in conclus , becaus of these two reason cite abov , i disagre the statement that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are now today .
