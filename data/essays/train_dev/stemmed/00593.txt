i agre with the statment that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . today , mass media ha a great power on human be . boy want to wear nike shoe becaus michael jordan wear it on tv and girl want to buy some specif type of dress , for exampl , levi 's low rise jean becaus jenif lopez or brittani spear wear it on tv . if those product , such as nike shoe or levi 's low rise jean , were not on tv or magazin , i do not think they would sell like that much even though they had still same qualiti . we watch tv almost everyday and the commeci say that we can be as good at basketbal as machael jordan if we wear nike . tv tell us that we can be as pretti as brittani spear or jennif lopez onli if we wear levi 's low rise jean . there is korean say that `` if the food look good , it make tast great . '' it doe not necessarili mean that the look of food make ani differ on tast . but peopl are easili influenc by what we see , and it effect on what we think about the food . i read an articl about a clean machin when i wa in korea . one small compani invent the clean machin . it wa a small machin with wheel and it could go around the floor and clean up by itself . after it came out , other big compani start to make same kind of clean machin . they advertis it on tv and in newspap . which one would you buy , the small compani 's cheap but nice one , or the big compani 's more expens , but ween on tv one ? after the advertis , the small compani could not continu that busi becaus peopl onli bought the big compani 's clean machin . thi is a true stori . advertis can make product seem much better than they realli are becaus we are veri easili influenc by what we see .
