nowaday , one of the most intrigu issu is that whether the major of the advertis make their merchandis look much better than they realli are . as far as i am concer , i agre with thi opinion , with three follw reason . firstli , the advertis attract the public attent by make full use use of the `` clariti effect '' . although the cost on the super star is alway unbeliev high , the produc can also gain profit by the advertis act by the clariti . it is true that sinc the super movi star or singer appear in the advertis on the screen , peopl have memor the product becaus of their favor clariti and are probabl buy the product . but unfortun , the public know littl about what they have bought . secondli , the advertis aggrand the function of the product sometim . for exampl , an advertis mention that you can keep all day long energit by drink an energi drink . in other word , you are still activ even after you stay up for 24 hour . if so , whi doe the scientist alway mention the import of the 8 hour sleep time ? lastli , the advertis sometim emphas one it benefit of the product but deliber ignor the neg effect . a brand of medicin to keep fit point out in it advertis how much weight you can lose after a coupl of wek . howev , the medicin ha a bad effect on the nerv of the taker to prohibit their desir to take food . all in all , most advertis make their product seem much better than the origin . although it will add the profit for the produc , in the moral light , it is a decev behavior for the public .
