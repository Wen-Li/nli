i disagre that travel in a group led by a tour guid is better than travel on our own . from person experiec , i 've learn that tour on our own give more oppurtun to be more knowleg about the place we 're travel , more time to travel unknown place , and more chanc to commun with local . as a person exampl when i went to cambodia last winter , i went with a tour group led by a guid . befor i went i knew i had to studi about the place i would go , but i postpon such duti becaus i wa expect the guid to explain everyth . just as i expect , when i went to ancient site in cambodia the tour guid explain everi littl detail , leav no space for me to further find out . howev , when i went to europ by myself thi winter , i felt oblig to studi about the background inform or about the european histori becaus there wa no guid to answer my question . the fact that i wa plan all the journey on my own gave me more respos to studi about the place i would go to . such case are not mere limit to my person exampl . also when we travel with a group led by a guid , we have to follow with the tuor compani 's tight schedul . out itineri is often schedul and we mere follow where the guid take us . we do n't have much free time to rambl around new place other than the famou tour cite . howev , when we 're on ourselv we do n't have to move accordingli to a fit schedul . we are free to go anywher we 'd like . other than famou tour cite , we could simpli go to local market or take a walk down the street -- place that are ordinari but also place where we can smell the local 's custom and cultur . furthermor , when we 're travel with a guid we 're too busi follow the tight schedul to acut commun with the local . tour with a guid often end with visit famou cite and take pictur . but when travel on your own , we have more chanc to actual be friend with the local . although there might be some languag barrier , we can use bodi languag and talk with local about their life-styl , custom , and cultur . travel on a group led by a guid lack the preciou moment to learn about a countri in a first-hand experi . travel in a group led by a tour guid sure doe have some benefit . we do n't have to plan all our schedul , and we do n't need to worri about not know someth becaus the guid is there for you to explain everyth . howev , so far from all my journey , the most memor and long last experi were those that i travel by myself . start from schedul my itinerari , studi about the countri , explor new place , and meet peopl from walk of street is truli the valuabl and the real journey i never forget .
