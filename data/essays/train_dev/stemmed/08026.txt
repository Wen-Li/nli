there are mani reason to think that the number of car will decreas in twenti year . but thi statement is probabl too optimist . mani thing must be taken in consider to know if thi statement is realist . one import reason for the idea that it will be less car in the futur is that ecolog is take more and more place is our live , thi will make the consum drive less or use public transport . mayb instead of have two car famili will onli have one . these chang in our behaviour are caus also by the polici of the gouver . they will tend to creat law that will protect the environ . their goal will be to lower the use of car increas tax ( london 's dool ) , promot a more effici public transport or limit the place were car can go ( an exampl will be to forbid car in some street down town ) . the problem of the statement is that it mayb onli refer to occident countri ( europ and north america ) . actual china and india are grow veri fast . thi will mean that globali it will be more car in the futur . develop will mean that all the peopl that could not buy a car will now be abl to do it . and china and india are two veri big market . in north america and europ the economi can not grow so fast , car consumpt will not grow that much . anoth raison whi it will not be less car in the futur is that even if a lot of money is use in the public transport the structur of the commun will not chang in twenti year . our countri are built around the car , we will need more than twenti year to chang that and car at actual the onli option in most of the case ( an exampl can be the person that live in the suburb : if he doe not have a good option to replac hi car he will not do it ) . as we can see the object is to reduc the number of car . the problem is that car are everywher and twenti year will not be enough to realli observ that there are less car . mayb the number will just be the same as now .
