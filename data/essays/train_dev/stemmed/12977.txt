whether in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today is an interest question . in the world there are peopl with differ way of think , cultur , behaviour and need . as a result of thi there are peopl that support that there will be fewer car in use than there are today becaus gasolin will finish , while on the other hand there are peopl that argu that will be more pollut so peopl could not drive their car . befor i decid which posit to support i want to consid both point of view . i think that car are veri import in human life becaus with car human can move in same part of the world faster for instanc than hors . for exampl i am a univers student of politecnico in milano and i live about 10 km near univers , so i alway take my car . moreov i think that gasolin will finish but fisic will invent other thing to move the car . nowaday for instanc there are electr car . i support besid that pollut of car is a wide problem but if fisic will invent other solut pollut of car can be elimin . if a person ask me if there will be fewer car than nowaday i am sure that i suddenli answer that i do not think thi . in the end i can conclus that i disagre with the abov statement becaus car are much import for the peopl yet . moreov i think that with car that can not produc ani pollut in the futur could be more car than today .
