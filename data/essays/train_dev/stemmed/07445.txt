i agre with the statement , as the the most import thing for a student is to understand idea and concept in order to develop critic think and good judgement . first , onli by understand idea and concept student can use what they have learn in school and appli it to real life situat . by understand concept and idea , a student can develop the so call `` critic think '' that is the capac to judg a fact or an idea with matur and good judgement . without critic think , propl woul n't be abl toassess everyday life situat matur and make the right decis . for instanc , how good a lawyer would be if he could recal all the regul in a certain area of law but could n't interpret the regul itself ? he would certainli master the fact but he would n't understand the concept . i am sure most lawyer would agre with me that in law , more often than no , know how to interpret a law is more valuabl than know the written reguataion . second , by learn and memor fact , student onli develop skill that are not as necessari for busi or other profess . for instanc , there is not much valu in memor hundr of page of a market concept if a student is not go to appli that specif knowledg in a financi analyst profess . much batter would be , if the student understand and master market idea and concept that can be appli to hi profess as well . the same appli for other subject such as math . if a student know onli memor formula but ca n't appli those , hi knowledg of math will be probabl usless . third , when student learn and memor fact they do it onli for the purpos of take a test and not for the purpos of learn someth . the result that most of what the student learn will be lost few week later . thi is clearli an ineffect way of use the student time as memor requir a lot of time and energi that could be use to understand more idea and concept . to sum up , i believ student should focu on learn concept and gener idea instead of wate time memor fact .
