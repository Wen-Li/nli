in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . thi is becaus a person with a gener knowlegd of mani subject is usual more prepar for a lot of thing in life than a person that know perfectli everyth about a singl subject . i believ that a person who know about thing like scienc , math , histori and art for exampl is much more prepar for live in our nowaday societi than a person who know onli about cook let say . there can be a man who is the best chef in the world , he can be veri succesful in what he doe , but how useful can it be to know how to make the a wonder birthday cake when you do n't know how to divid it in exact piec for everyon ? or how would he know what food is good or bad for human be ? or how would he know how to advert hi food ? how to manag and creat a restaur ? these and so mani other reason are whi it is import to have at least a littl bit of knowledg in mani subject . also for person satisfact , i think it is import to know about differ subject . i believ a person alway feel better when they know more . i certainli believ that a someon who know everyth there is to know about a subject , like cook , also feel pretti good ; but go to back to the chef exampl , how would he feel if he goe to a dinner with all hi friend and they start talk about histori or polit or world affair ? in my opinion he would rather stay home next time and onli meet hi friend when they want to eat hi wonder dish . i think be ignor in a lot of thing can creat a low self-asteem for mani peopl , even if they believ they are the best in one singl subject . in conclus , it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one becaus it doe n't onli help us with our daili live but it also give us a person satisfact , becaus we know about more than one thing .
