i agre with the statement . the reason are mayb not as straightforward as they seem and i would also argu that depend on the person , differ reason appli . for the most part though i think that educ on behalf of the parent but also the teacher need to instil a sens of social respons in a child . the need to help other that were not as fortun or the commun as a whole ha to be develop . our educ system ha increasingli becom a job train center where mani of the aspect need to be a leader in other set than on the job have been neglect . while i think there are differ between urban and suburban commun , you often get the sens that peopl are onli focus on their littl microcosm . the famili is much more detach from the commun than it mayb wa a coupl of decad ago . children are unlik to feel they need to help the commun if their famili is not an activ and integr part of one . young peopl tend to have a whole host of attract altern to spend their time . whether that mean sport , meet up with friend or just spend time infront of the televis . lastli , the financi situat of the famili might also requir the child to take on a job to chip in . help out in the commun gener is voluntari and henc , unpaid . bottomlin i think it is too easi to just blame it on the young . the environ also play a larg role in whether or not a young person will spend time help in their commun .
