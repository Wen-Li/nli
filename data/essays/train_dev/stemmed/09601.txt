some peopl said that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , i think i agre thi statement . there are mani reason to support my opinion , first of all , sinc young peopl often own a younger and `` fresh '' heart , so in them eye , everyth are shine and intrest , they have mani hope so they want to tri everyth in their younger time , by thi way , thay could have more changs than old peopl , even through they could make some mistak , but those mistak still can becam young peopl 's valubl esper , like poepl said , there are alway a thread by sunshin under the dark cloud , the sunshin alway come and gose in a secound , to keep up hope is how can make the sunshin stay . secondli , young peopl were abl to get more new idea or messeg than older peopl , thay brave to make more new way to sove problem , by thi way , they can enjoy the fresh feel too , so it make young peopl enjoy the life . moreov , whit the time go on , more and more involut come into peopl ' life , for instanc , comput , internet , ktv and so on , those thing offer more chang to young peopl enjoy their life . fanilli , besaus older peopl had a full life , so mayb they fell tire , so they want quit and pice rather than `` tri '' , it is so differ with young peolp . in one word , in my opinion , young peopl have more energ than older peopl to enjoy their life , and also young peopl 's bodi are abl to help them to finesh their hope , so i think young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl .
