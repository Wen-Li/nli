thi is a veri difficult question to answer becaus i 've seen some old peopl enjoy their life everyday and some young peopl worri about their futur and it challeng . in my opinion , in gener there is that idea that young peopl enjoy life more becaus they do not repons or compli to certain paramet or rule that societi ha construct over us . thi give us the impress that they are more relax but as alway realiti is by far more complex and come in differ colour and form . depend on the upbring some young peopl can be veri method , work veri hard for their futur and are often in a constant battl against time to get a place in societi . anoth point i would like to mention is the definit of `` enjoy '' or perhap `` joy '' . as i mention befor peopl are complex creatur so they enjoy a wide rang of activ . some of these activ can be consid not veri enjoy for some other peopl with differ interest . take botani , plant scienc , as an exampl for some individu spend day and night look at plant and check their part is veri reward and definitelli it form part of the joy of their life . on the other hand , somebodi whose main interest is robot or club , just to mention two extrem exampl , would have some difficulti understand other peopl sourc of joy . older peopl especi the one who are alreadi retir tend to have a veri tranquil and quiet life , but then again thi ha a lot to do with the efford they made when they were younger plan their financ so they can have a decent pention and as a result a more enjoy life . i 've seen peopl who plan veri care to make sure they will not becom a burden for their famili and societi . as a conclus i think you chose to enjoy your life regardless your age . howev to reach a sustain state of secur and stabil , so you can enjoy life more , some plannig is inde necesari at ani stage of your life .
