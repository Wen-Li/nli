i agre to the statement that yound peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i think that they are not like to join the commun event , they are not frequent share the burden of the commun and it is not often that they help the neighbor who are in need . first exampl of thi is that young peopl nowaday do not join event that are held by support of commun such as festiv and commun meet . there may be sever reason to be claim by them . they may be veri busi for work , they may have move from their hometown and may be not familiar with the commun . whatev the reason is , it is true from my experi that the younger the peopl are , the less frequent they will join the commun event . anoth exampl is that they are not like to share the burden with commun member . for exampl , when the commun ha a rule that everi member need to go on a patrol by turn , there could be a case where onli middle-ag and old peopl work as assign . younger pepl are reluct to serv for their own part probabl becaus they are busi , or they are just selfish . moreov , it is not frequent observ that young peopl help the neigbor when they are in need . even though one of the famili member die , young peopl who live next to such famili will not help them or , in extrem case , will not pay ani attent to them . thi can be partli explain that peopl ha becom more person than social and it would be help to keep privaci . thi can be a good exampl to illustr that young peopl will not give enough time to help their commun . as these exampl as mention abov , low frequenc to join the communiy event , unwilling to share the burden with commun member and unlikelihood to help neighbor show that young peopl give insuffici time to help their commun these day .
