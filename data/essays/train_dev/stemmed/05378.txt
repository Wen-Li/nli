mani peopl argu that it is best to do what they alreadi know how to do well , and not take risk . person , i strongli believ that success peopl are those who constantli tri new thing and reach for the unknown . in fact , as my middl school french teacher onc told me , `` you learn from your mistak '' . i agre with her . from my experi , i can tell that mistak often help you to improv , becaus you rememb them afterward . therefor , you know what you should n't do next time . if you never tri new thing , though , how can you `` learn from your mistak '' ? you do n't improv , becaus `` improv '' impli that you are deal with someth new , and want to get better . also , i think that ambit is veri import . it make learn excit , and often contribut to your success . if you keep do the thing you alreadi know , it can get veri bore ! for exampl , back in franc , i play the piano . after seven year , when felt like i had reach a realli good level and did n't need a teacher anymor , i decid to play the cello as well . i do not regret my decis . to be abl to play sever instrument wa veri interest and excit ! final , i believ that take risk is import becaus when you succeed , it give you a lot of satisfact and pride . in fact , becaus you reach a new goal , you feel like a whole new person . for exampl , i will alway rememb when my father told me that we would soon be move from franc to the unit state . at first , to be honest , i wa veri sad . i did n't want to leav my friend and i wa afraid of the unknown . a few month after we had move , i felt veri differ . thi experi ha been great . now i know how to speak english , i made new friend . .. i even plan to attend colleg here in the u. . if my famili had refus to emigr becaus it meant take risk , we would have miss the best experi of our live . in conclus , i agre with those who say that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk '' . of cours , when `` take risk '' is too danger , i would not agre but in gener , ambit is great .
