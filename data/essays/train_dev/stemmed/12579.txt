i agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . in my view there are some reason that whi i am think the travel with group . first the tour select the the most beauti place and also most import histor build . the second is the travel with a group is much cheeper than travel alon , with hi or her fammili or with coupl friend . everi thing is much cheep ; airplain ' ticket , hotel , food without your own shop . and also while you travel with group you can meet some peopl creat a new relationship , in addit you can keep your friend ship after travel and it will be good memori for your futur . the tour give a guid who respons to explain where tourist travel . he give a some inform about the build , museum . a you can learn about the countri of histori , cultur and tradit . if i travel alon i just travel around the citi or look the build and skip . or you have to read the book , tourist guid and travel which is not good for me . in everi tour there is a free time and you can ask the some interest place or shop canter to go , he or she advic to see good place . in conculs , becaus all thi reason i prefer to travel vith tour . and i believ that it 's more enjoy .
