i believ that we should attempt new trial and take some risk for more success life . becaus trial and error let us realiz our limitaion , and so , we can correct our error and tri to overcom our defect . in addit , though there are some danger in attempt new work , it creat unexpect result , give great inspir and make us stronger and better . i think that most peopl have limit physic or mental or financi . if we just satisfi with our current situat , we never improv our life and never experi better and hidden happi . for exampl , beethoven , a renown musican and a great human , had an ear diseas . he did n't even hear audienc 's loud applaus after the premieur of hi last symphoni . howev , despit hi sever sick , beethoven tri to overcom hi defect and creat mani new and innov classic music . due to hi effort , today mani peopl hear mani except touch sound . if he satisfi hi situat and did not make effort to overcom himself , not onli he could be rememberd as a great artist but we also never meet mani great music . moreov , i think that crisi and danger sometim produc unexpect result and make us stronger and compet person . for instanc , mani scientist have research some riski and doubt fact and they have found mani wonder solut . thse discoveri have develop scienc and our life . in addit , in my experi , when i face difficulti in my job , i did not avoid them and tri to resolv those problem . as a result , i could find variou solut and develop myself into a compet staff . in conclus , i do believ that trial and risk make peopl stronger and better . we all have a brain and a heart . i think that we need to use and devleop them through effort to overcom our current obstacl .
