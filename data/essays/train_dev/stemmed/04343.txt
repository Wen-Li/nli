i strongli disagre with the statement that there would be fewer car in use twenti year from now . `` necess is the mother of invent '' , the necess to travel faster , better ha lead to the invent of the motor car . ever sinc their invent car have been modifi and upgrad gradual . what that wa consid a statu symbol ha grown in to an essenti requir with time . car have gradual revolutionis the mode of travel and thu lure peopl in to invest in buy car like never befor . the number of car have increas dramat due to the decreas in cost and the variou offer that a compani ha to offer to the buyer . the sens of competit among the mani car manufactur ha brought in a cultur where peopl get to buy car at a veri low rate or also buy in an instal method thu increas the number of custom . the incraes in popul also lead to the increas in the number of custom buy car and also the industri revolut and the increas in the per capita incom coupl with the variou offer given by the car compani increas the number of car be brought by the common man . a sens of comfort and pride ha lead to the greater buy of car by the common man . initi , there were onli a few compani that manufactur car and the transport of the manufactur car also wa a tediou process and the whole thing wa a costli affair but with the advent of more and more car compani and the easier mode of transport of manufactur car the number of car brought ha becom higher and thi number is increas . at the initi stage there were onli a few car to be seen but as time progress there were mani varieti of car and the number of them alo increas tremend . there is no reason whi thi number would decreas in the year to come as the popul is alway increas so are the number of car be manufactur and sold .
