one statement i will support for sure is the follow `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' . in thi essay i will tri to demontr my opinion use specif reason and differ exampl . the mean object of adverstis is the purchas of the product by the consum . almost everyth is allow to make the product appear better than it realli is . thi is one object of advertis . so obvious when you discov the product you might be a littl bit desappoint . for exampl , almost everyon ha been desappoint by one product that appear to have incred properti on tv . i rememb have been desappoint with a christma gist becaus the toy i saw on the tv wa not the same as the one i receiv but actual but it wa the same but wa not that fantast as the tv said . anoth strike exampl is advertis for candi and chocol bar , in the advertis they say that it is good product made with natur ingredi , but what they do not say is that it is bad for health to eat such junk food . almost all advertis do not state the bad side result in the consumt of the product , or tri to exagerr the good properti of a product for instanc a product might appear bigger in the advertis or more shini . as a result with the help of all these exampl i support the opinion that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
