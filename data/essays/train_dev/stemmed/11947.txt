from the primari school to the end of highschool , in franc , england or in the unit state , student learn a signific number of variou subject which mean they not have to oper a decis choic in one or two subject they will have to studi . thi choic of specialis happen when they are graduat and have to go to the univers . somebodi who know littl thing about a unbeliev number of academ subject is cultiv and often it is interress to talk with thi kind of peopl becaus they alway have someth to say whatev the subject of the convers but becaus he is not special he will mayb never teach you someth . in anoth way , speak with a too specialis man could be fast becom bore . but here is not the question . i realli think that is essenti to master one subject perfectli , to possess a domain where you are excel but i also believ that is vital to remain open to other academ subject . for exampl , great thinker from the past like r.descart had knowledg in mathemat , philosophi etc . .. and i realli believ it help them to improv their predilect subject caus all or almost all academ subject are relat . to my mind , bee unskil or too skill in a subject are not good thing . between these two extem model , everyon must find hi own way . to conclud i would like to add that our educ system , often highli criticis , are final not so bad . it offer the opportun for the student to learn about a lot of thing , it give them the choic to eperi the subject they would like to studi later .
