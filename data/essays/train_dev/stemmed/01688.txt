there are differ type of peopl in our societi and everi individu ha hi or her own ideal . while some of these peopl prefer to continu the way the situatuion they 're in , some alway tri to do new thing and to improv themselv . in my opinion , first of all , one ha to improv himself everi pass second . you should never stop at a point and say ` well , that 's enough for me ' . in order to do thi , though , one should alway tri new thing , otherwis there would n't be ani develeop . at thi point it should be consid that there might exist some risk at new thing . new tri could lead one not onli to success , but also they could lead one to failur which would be an unpleas eperi for everyon . in order to give an appropri exampl to the subject , i should mention about my fahter who ha come to germani as a worker and work for mani year as a humbl worker . by the time he ha been work in germani he receiv a salari which wa not that immens . but he than save hi money to make a capit form hi earn and to tri some new bussi with hi save . he got involv to estat bussi and succeed . but there wa thi big risk that could have lost all hi save by invest it in an inappropri bussin . if he would n't took thi risk , though , and kept work at a factori for a low salari , he would n't have been abl to be in the situat current he is in . but thi doe n't mean that one shoud alway risk to be succes . one could be succes in other way as well . some charachterist of an individu such as ambit , hard and steadi work never givin up , could also enabl the person to achiev hi or her aim . though i think that it would worth to take risk in order to achiv import goal . therefor i agre with the statement that one should take risk to be success .
