it is hard to agre or disagre with such a statement . in my opinion it is obvious a doubl edg statement . first of all it depend on the way one may defin the express `` success peopl '' . what doe `` be success '' mean ? someon who doe someth well is success . howvev it is true that if you understand the express `` success peopl '' as be rich then the statement might be relev . let 's take the exampl of financi market . the more risk you take the more money you can earn . thi is what is happen nowaday and what can explain the grow number of financi mecan . the success , or the money here , is consid as a counterpart of th risk one may have taken . it doe n't necessarili mean that peopl who simpli do what they alreadi know to do well are not success , in fact it mean that one may becom even more success take risk . nevertheless , in thi case success is not assur . and the statement is a doubl edg one in that sens as well . the more risk you take the more you can loos . as a consequ the statement could turn out to be revers . final , take risk is even differ from tri new thing . tri new thing is not necessarili veri riski . and success in thi case could be understood as `` recogn '' , by societi for exampl . for instanc , an inventor . someon who invent object or who discov phenomena , becaus he is veri smart and becaus he ha tri to go beyond what he alreadi knew , will be consid as a success person and will be recogn and rememb as a success person . as a conclus , i would say the relev of the statement depend on the definit one can give to the word and the way you understand it .
