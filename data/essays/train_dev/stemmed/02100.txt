the statement infer that advertis often make product seem much better than they realli are . on the one hand i believ that thi suggest often might be true . on the other hand you have to consid that everi enterpris want to make the best of hi product and advertis is alway a good way of address custom . the enterpris are do great research work to produc the best possibl advertis for a product . they pay other enterpris to make studi on what custom are attract by . of cours they have to present their product in an veri attract way . for exampl the advertis for bodi - lotion often includ veri good-look women . the custom are firstli attract by the advertisemnet with the beauti woman , then they relat the woman to the product , they buy the product and then they might be dissappoint becaus they do not look as the woman on the pictur after have appli the lotion on to the skin . it is understand that the custom is dissappoint but the enterpris ha reach it goal and ha sold it product . at thi point i will come to the other side . it is not fair that the custom ha spent so much money on someth he believ in but wa dissapoint . of cours an advertis ha to be attract but nobodi is allow to lie . the custom often loos their confid in the enterpris and will never buy anyth of thi enterpris again . i believ that it is more effect to stick to the truth . the custom would not be dazzl by promis result and might buy the product again . addit advertis are not onli been made on tv or on the street but in convers . peopl tell each other of somenth new they have tri and they give good reputit so other peopl might tri thi product , too . sometim it is in my opinion even more effect to make advertis in form of promot in supermarket where a real person talk to you and let you tri the product . have tri the product and have talk to somebodi who know more about it is in my view better than have unperson advertis on wall in the citi . in conclus i would say that there are much better way to present a product than to overr it and lie to the custom .
