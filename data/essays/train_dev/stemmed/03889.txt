i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is true that learn fact is import but not importan than idea and concept . as my experi , most of the professor give test base on the idea and concept of the what we learn . purpos of test is the how much student get idea and concept of the content and how to appli it . none of my professor want the student to get pass the class without understand idea and concept . accord to korean newspap , most succec student are get idea and concept of the subject , not the fact . reseach test experi in one high school . they had fifti peopl were studi onli concept and idea , and fifti student were studi onli fact . the result of the experi wa forti out of fifti student who were in the idea and concept group got a 's and ten out of fifti student who were in the fact group got a 's in the test . after read thi research paper i focu on the understand idea and concept of the content . as a result my grade were higher than studi fact . i think understand idea and concept is more import that learn a fact . just get a good grade is not the good point for the student . student have to understand idea and concept and walk one step forward to the featur .
