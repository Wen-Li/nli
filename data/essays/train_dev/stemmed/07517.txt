mayb right mayb wrong but i 'm not look to thi topic so dark . . becaus i 'm also young person but i dont think i 'm not give time to help my commun . . or at the topic what it 's tri to be ask by help ?? what i see in turkey is mostli young peopl studi in univers just for studi . few of them are realli studi to be someth or to make someth for their commun or for thier countri . . but in other way not onli the young peopl is the one to blame ! so mani univers graduat young are still ca n't find a place to work in turkey . . in turkey i say becaus thi is onli what i can see . . i do n't know if it is thesam in other place . . but for sure thi is be happen in turkey and i 'm realli afraid . . in such small town still small girl are be sale for money ! and so mani of them ca n't even go to scool . . so how can we wait from them somethig to help thier commun when they grow up . . they could n't save their selv . .. what is import first is to prove the parent ; the father , the mother and also the brother . .. first we have to blame ourselv befor ask to agre or disagre about what young make for their commun . .. let ask thi way then ; thu commun give enough time to help young peopl ? ... so last thing to say is ofcours i do not agre thi . . i wish it to see young peopl spend so much time to their commun but i do not agre also what world or life give to them . ..
