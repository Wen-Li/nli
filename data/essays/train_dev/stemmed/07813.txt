take risk and get into the job you do n't have an idea about , make peopl frighten all the time . we get affraid from loos our money , our respect or sometim loos the peopl we love and care . i think we have to ask a question to ourselv here , do we realli loos these thing when we fail . thi can be answer posit . like ye mayb we can loos money but on the other side if you dont tri you loos the chanc of learn if you could earn much more money . let take bill gate and hi support as an exampl . for such a thing which nobodi beliv in , they spend their energi , time and money and they took the risk . what did the risk of loos money bring to them is the rich of the world . there is an other subject we 'd be afraid to loos when we fail to success in the new job we 're tri , is our respect in other mind . in my point of view there is noth to be concern about thi subject becaus while some peopl think you are a looser becaus you fail , some may admir you and the courag you have show by risk your commod . sinc you can not be the most regard person in everyon 's mind you do n't realli have to pay attent for thi subject . sinc we all have peopl whom we love , care and hold special in our heart we of cours may not desir to get close of loos them . if we realli ask ourselv the reason we keep these peopl special in our life , we will infer that these peopl are alway behind us and support us even if we success or fail . they are alway besid us to take our hand for help us to stand up . as a result i can easili say that live in a routin manner life would be veri bore and there is no reason for us to stay away from from risk becaus without take ani risk one can not learn to do what he do n't know to do ,
