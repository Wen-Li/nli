it is better to have broad knowledg of mani accadem subject than to special in one subject . we will see in a first part whi i schouldn t agre with thi statement and in a second part whi i schoud agre . i schouldn t agre with thi statement . inde , i think in a first way that it can be better for a pupil to special in one specif subject . everi bodi have a favourit subject , a passion . it would be more interrest for the student to work in hi favourit subject , he would work with happi , and would like what he is do . for exempl , a student who love mathemathiq would rather prefer work in a scientif subject than in a art subject . he will have an idea of what to do for a job , he will be in good healthi . i schould agre with thi statement . firstli , i think that it can be good to studi differ academ subect . inde , thi might be verri interriss to have variou subject , from scientif to philosoph . for exempl , if a student doesn t like a subject , he would have other subject that he should like . althought he would have lot of assign , he would know about lot of thing in the world moreov , a student can be bore , annoy with just one specif subject to conclud , i can say that i m alway at school and i am more scientif . next year , i would choos just one specif subject and i think it s verri interress to chang my way of life . i think i would rather prefer next year becaus i would have just my favourit subject math . but , it wa verri interress to studi differnt subect dure my studi .
