some peopl like to travel in a group tour led by a tour guid , but other like to travel as they like without a tour guid . i definit like the latter type of travel . if you travel in a tour , your schedul are usual alreadi decid . it is good for some peopl becaus they do not need to worri about the place they go and the transport they need to take to get each place . howev , the tour schedul might not includ the specif place where they realli want . also , as for the time , if they want to stay a place longer , or if they happen to find a place where they want to stop by on the way of the tour , they can not do that in a tour . when travel not in a tour , i think peopl can enjoy the place and the cultur there more . when i went to australia to travel from japan by myself , i need to speak english all the time , but it wa great chanc for me to talk with local peopl directli . in the tour , usual the tour guid take the respons for everyth , and you have less chanc to contact local peopl and stop by the local and small store and restaur . also , if you do not join the tour , you even do not have to decid the schedul beforehand . you can just do whatev you want and go wherev you feel after you get to the place . you can ask the recommend to the local peopl or other travel ' there . from my experi , i think there are mani small but good place where the regular tour do not visit . it might be nice to join a tour when you want to travel but you do not want to think anyth and just follow somebodi . howev , i think the travel is kind of an adventur , and that it is one of the fun part in the travel to think and plan the place where i go and the schedul for my own trip .
