i agre with thi statement becaus sometim when we watch tv we see news which is about peopl help their comun such as clean road or advertis , but most of those peopl who help comun we see is old peopl . whi young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun are becaus young peopl think it the old peopl 's job or they do not care about their comun . even though they do not help their comun , some of them complain to their comun . i think it just wrong becaus if they have someth to complain to their comun they should go and complain it and work the problem out with the other comunitiy worker . that the best way to get work out the problem . howev there are heap of young peopl who do not care about their comun . they do n't even know who is the leader of their comunitiy or what their comun work for peopl , if they know that who clean road or park , they would not make a mess on the road . as we can see , usual the mess on the road were made by young peopl that mean they do n't clean their road and let the other peopl to clean them .
