today 's youth is a dynam one , everyth is instantan and at a rapid pace . as much as i agre with the amount of work load the peopl of today 's gener have , i still feel that the young peopl nowaday are not do enough for the better of their commun . peopl especi young peopl complain about the problem face by them in their citi such as traffic , corrupt , crime etc . but rare is there a person among them who is readi to jump into the system and take step in solv the problem . in my opinion if you do not have the capabl to stand up and take the matter into your own hand , you should quit whine and live with what you have . the youth nowaday doe not understantd it respons toward it commun . they maintain a veri laid back attitud , care slightli about the problem face by the commun . it is the young peopl who should step up and take control of a problemat situat , as it is they who are brim with energi , have fresh idea and will be respons for the futur of their commun . for e.g. in a countri like india where the averag age of a polit leader is not less than sixti year corrupt is rampant but none of the youngster feel the need to join polit and improv the condit , they feel that join polit would mean a wast of their academ degre . for today 's youth help the commun is a veri unimport thing , for them their person success come first . they are veri self-cent and selfish and would rare wast their time and energi on a project for the better of the commun . they seek person advantag first hand . seldom after a natur disast or calam do we see the young peopl help the affect peopl . it is alway the older peopl help themselv or the young school go children collect fund . in such condit it is the youth of the commun that should step up and bring back the much need stabil . wherea instead of help in disturb condit today 's youth doe not bat an eyelid about it . they feel it is a wast of their preciou time . an ideal exampl of a respons youth would be bhagat singh a revolutionari of india 's freedom struggl who fought and even sacrif hi life for the freedom of hi nation . i think that today 's youth should follow in the step of the great bhagat singh and realis their duti toward their commun , and also take whatev step necessari in improv their commun .
