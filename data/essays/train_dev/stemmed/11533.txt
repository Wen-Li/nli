while mani adult agre thi statement , i disagre with thi statement . i am a teenag , so i can see both side of viiw . it seem enjoy for older peopl sinc they have got knowledg in their life . there are two detail exampl which i think enjoy . first of all , older peopl do not have to be care about anyth what they do by anyon els , becaus it is hi or her own respons . for exampl , i have to go home at certain time , otherwis my mother worri me , and get angri . that is stress for me . i want to hang out late with my friend , but my mother doe not allow to do it . i can not wait to be an adult , and go to downtown at night . at the time , i will applici my mother 's kind . second reason is that i suppos that older peopl can see live more serious than young peopl . i can not think the time when i marri , have children , and die , becaus i feel that those event will happen in an ahead time . howev , older peopl have enough idea toward those event , for their friend had alreadi experienc and talk to them . it would be fun to see near futur with such a big event . in conclus , older peopl can enjoy life more than youngr peopl , unless they have enough respons , and knowledg . younger peopl can not have respos for their act . furthermor , it is difficult to enjoy life without obviou knowledg such as stori from peer . therefor , i disagre with thi statement .
