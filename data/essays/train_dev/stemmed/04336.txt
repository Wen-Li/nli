i am disagre with the statement becaus i think that the older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl . in fact i think that today a young peopl have everi thing that he or she want and therefor doe n't fight to conquest hi dream or hi desir . therefor after a bit time the young peopl is tire , becaus he know that he can have everyth . in opposit , an older peopl know how to fight for conquest hi dream becaus in the last time there are less thing . in addit today there are more and more problem in opposit the last time , becaus the societi is becom more industri and the peopl are alway quickli . thi troubl caus a gener unhappi and the young peopl doens't enjoy hi life . therefor i think that today when a young peopl say that he is happi , it is n't true , but there is a way to hide a gener unhappi .
