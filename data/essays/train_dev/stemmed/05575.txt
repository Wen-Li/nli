first of all i have to say that i can not give an answer which match on everi young boy or girl . henc peopl , especiali young peopl , are veri differ from each other . but , by look on most of the young peopl nowaday , i have to agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . most of the young peopl were veri focus on their owen life . they see onli themselv , nobodi other . the best exampl is , when you take a regulari bu , which is drive around in a bigger town . as i wa young , my father told me to leav my seat , if an older person want to set down her - or himself . i had to learn that sutch thing were noth special . at that time it wa a normal educ . nowaday nobodi of the young peopl would do thi . in most of the case i could watch , they did not take a notic of the older person . peopl do onli what they have to do , what they want to do or if they think they might get an advantag out of it . for young peopl thi mean : go to school , do homework , play comput game , meet friend in the shoppingmal and so on . but i do not want to give all the mistak , young peopl do , back to them . they did not lear how to do it in a right way . that is the mistak of their parent who did not done well in there educ . perhap becours they did not have enought time or onli becours they were not intrest in teach their children . most parent think the tv-screen is a good babysitt for thier children , but in the tv thing like help your commun is not shown veri often . young peopl have to learn that they are not the onli rock on the beach , but tri to explain thi to them would like carri oral to athen .
