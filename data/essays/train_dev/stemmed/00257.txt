i disagre with the veri idea that in the next twenti year there will be fewer car in use then there are today . insta of decreas it is better to expect that as the standard of life is get fairer and fairer by the pasag of time one should expect tremend increas in use of car . at the begin of thi centuri when the car were a symbol of statu a few percentag of the global popul ha financi condit to bear the cost of car . out of these few percentag major were from north america and european countri . howev as the more number of nation start gat independ and as the globalis magnifi , the scenario took a complet u turn . take the exampl of china and india which have popul two third of the world popul . with ther boom economi one can easili guess the gigant incres the use of car in these two nation alon . if other poor asian and african countri also join the leagu of these two nation , an with ever last western countri , one can just imagin what will be the scenario take the number of car manufactur compani that have increas hundr fold over the past centuri . now to surviv in thi battl of fierc competit and outway other one , one can expect the price of car to be down to such a point that one would not have ever imagin in hi or her wildest dream . the price of car would be in the domain of common man pocket . car which were onc consid to be the priveleg of richer section of societi will be common day entiti to common peopl . with the ever incres technolog advanc one could also expect greater incresrs in use of car . say besid provid other common facil that a car , which is made for common peopl provid , if the averag of the car are increas mani time from the current valu and if the life time effici of car are incres more , one can sure say a huge increas in the use of car . so go by all the norm one can safe say more car to be in use then ever in the next twenti year .
