is it more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ? i think not . first , becaus fact are thing that can realli be chang . fact are the way they are and there is noth we can do about then to chang then or to modifi the thing they tri to let us know . in the other hand , idea , as the name give us a clue , are the thing we think or believ about someth . as an exampl , we all know that we need air to live . if there were no air , we all would die . but instead of onli teach thi we get the idea of whi air is necessari . we breath it , it goe to our lung then the oxigen is transport to the whole bodi travel by the blood . we can get to know that it is import . follow the same exampl , we can find the concept of `` breath '' then we get all the idea we mention abov . with that inform we can reach a fact : air is need to live . anoth reason whi idea and concept are better than onli fact . with the first i mention we can find out more inform than with fact . thank to the concept , we can understand the way thing are , the way whi the sky is blue , whi our blood is red , how is it that the light is reflect , etc . . fact let us know thing someon els , thank to investig , concept and idea discov . someon may say `` what 's so wrong about it ? '' if we are not motiv to investig , to satisfi our necess of know , we will onli take the `` free sampl '' we reciev from fact . besid , if we cook our idea , and bake our spici concept then we can find a complet menu of knowlag . free to whoever who want to tri it . and onc you tri it , you are go to look for it . it is better to cook thant just to but a pack of cooki . to make my point clear , with fact we do n't reall y get to investig or to make a research about thing . but with idea and concept we can creat our fact , thank to the inform we look for . and that is whi i disagre with the statement on the first line .
