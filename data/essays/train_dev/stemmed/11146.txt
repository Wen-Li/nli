i disagre with thi statement for two reason . at first , it would be quit difficult for student to understand idea or concept , if they do not learn fact of them , or even let the student a misunderstand , to learn fact is not necessari . when a histori teacher in high school teach student about a compar between industri socialti and agricultur socialti . both of the defnit are easi to remmeb , but how to understand the differ ? acturlli student have kown the fact of industri by their live , even befor the teacher explain the fact . they know that industri ha product our model life , from telephon to internet , from car to jet . to tri to understand , what doe mean agricaltur ? just let us live without all the fact of industri . howev , to understand idea and concept is not the full task for student , and not even the goal to studi from the begin . as adult , we know it now , the right way to handl the knowledg is to use it . teacher should let the student know , good memorri about idea and concept is just help in some exam , but not in work and live . in china we have mani neg exampl , becaus school were onli concerntret on teach about exam in last 20 year . a famou emplory complain that he did not dare to hire the peopl who achiev doctor degre in china . becaus they knew the concept veri well , but fail to use them in practic , and they did not know a good commun is the key in a team to use the concept in fact . as i went to germani and began my colleg studi in stuttgart . i knew in first time , most of thing i had learn till my high school have onli one goal , that is to use them in fact . i began a lot of cours to learn fact there , from commun to techiqu . that is the key .
