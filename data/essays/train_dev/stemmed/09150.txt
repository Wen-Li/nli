i agre with thi statement , becaus the ultim goal of educ is to promot knowledg of a subject . knowledg of a subject onli come from the full understand of the idea and concept relat to the topic . it is as import to know the main set of fact as it is to understand the idea and concept around those fact . in my experi be abl to understand the idea and concept have often time help me to arriv to the same set of fact , prove that i have acquier the knowledg necessari , but also the tool to conduct individu research and investig . while it is true that there are exact scienc ( ie , chemistri , physic , or math ) which depent on specif unchang fact , it is import that student of those subject are abl to deconstruct the formula , paradigm , and algorythm that have produc such fact . thi creat a deeper understand of fact and when the research is face with a problem it is easier to solv it in a succesful manner . educ should not concentr on mere fact , special in scienc where new discoveri are happen everyday , which chang the way we understand our univers . in the case of social scienc , such as histori or anthropolog , where fact are the build block to understand later develop it is import to realiz that those fact are normal told from the win parti in the conflict or the prevail speci in an environ . in these case the understand of idea and concept will help the student investig how differ event may have chang the final outcom . full understand of idea and concept would lead to more complet and complex research , which will help to understand our world better and not remain in a statu quo where fact are unchang and becom dogmat with time .
