the topic given to me is that broad knowledg is better than on the knowledg of a specif subject . i dont agre with the follow statement becaus broad knowledg can not help us alway . it is necessari to have a specialis knowledg over a particular subject . by have broad knowledg over mani academ subject can not fetch you in get a job . thi is becaus the compani want student who were specalis in a particular task for their work . moreov he can not be confid in ani of hi subject and face mani problem . if we are specalis in a particular subject we can do research in that particular subject and can improv our knowledg . by do so we can reach great height in our career . for exampl if we consid the presid of india , he is a great scientist who use to work at isro got great fame becaus of hi sucess in the field he ha choosen . we must take him as inspir and must tri to develop in our futur . if we tri to have knowledg on all subject than it just like stand on two boat and definetli we have to face mani problem in the futur . though he is talent he can not reach great height in hi career . he may also face the problem of earn money as he can not get a good job that bear hi expens . for exampl if i am interest in both scienc and social it is better to concentr on onli one subject than the two . thi is becaus if he studi both he can not be a knowledg person in ani of the subject and and he will come to the stage of confus to choos which subject for hi higher studi . i final say that it is better to be a leader in one field than to be a member in mani field . so final i feel that it is better to specal in one subject due to the reason given abov . moreov by do so we can be the most knowled and experienc person in a particular field .
