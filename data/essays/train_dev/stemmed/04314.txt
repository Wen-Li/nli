some peopl believ that they must not help other peopl if the action do not provid ani benefit to themselv . other , like me , believ that few hour everi week must be use to help the commun . i would support my view with a coupl of reason . first of all , live in itali , i know that most of the young peopl in my countri work or studi not more than eight hour a day . other peopl , like chines , work for at least 12 hour a day and they have not time to do other activ after they have finish studi or work . convers , italian could spend a lot of hour do social activ that could help the commun . for exampl , someon studi in the univers locat in the centr of rome goe back home at 5 p.m . .. probabl , he could remain in the citi and dedic hi time to disabl peopl help them to come back home easili , for exampl help them to get into the buse or to take the subway . unfortun , italian guy prefer to watch soccer match on televis or go to the restaur with friend . second , in my opinion govern should think a law regard young peopl activ in social commun . my view is that few peopl would do help social activ without a strong committ from our state . in the case of itali , there is not a law regul action that young peopl can , or must , do in order to help the commun . probabl a good law should oblig young peopl that are not still work to spend on thi activ at least 2 hour a week . in thi manner , the state would help both the commun and the young peopl , take them far from televis or playstat . in conclus , i strongli agre with the statement . in my opinion , everi person that ha some free time dure the day should spend few hour in social activ in order to give benefit to hi commun .
