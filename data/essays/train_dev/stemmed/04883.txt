as scienc and technolog develop , societi burden peopl with a huge amount of knowledg . an import question aris for each individu , when he tri to build an amount of knowledg for himself : is it better for him to concentr on a subject and ha a unifi knowledg on that subject , or is it better for him to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . i think , it is better to choos a subject and concentr on it detail . first , dure my undergradu year , i tri take class from as broad subject as i can . i took economi , physic , classic ballet , histori of scienc and german litretar cours as my elect cours . in thi way , i have gain knowledg on each of these subject . but i could studi each of them for at most two success semest . that 's whi i could gain onli a littl inform on each of them . now i still have curios to further improv my knowledg on mani of these topic , but i could not have time and energi to accomplish such a great task . second , the number of academ subject increas in an incred speed . what is call broad today , will not even be enough tomorrow . and the amount of knowledg that ha to be gain on a topic in order to have an idea of it will also increas as time pass . so , it is also veri diffucult to develop a good and broad knowledg of variou academ topic . last , but not the least is that , a person is requir to find a job to surviv . so , he ha to have adequ knowledg in one specif subject in order to be abl to work on thi subject . and it will be better for him to concentr on the topic he work on . all in all , to have a broad knowledg of mani subject seem attract . howev , it may be an imposs goal to achiev .
