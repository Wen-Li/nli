i definit agre with the statement expos befor , sinc my experi show me that understand idea is more import that just learn fact . i think that build model of event and thing is the onli way to studi what surround us . sinc i am studi engin i will bring two exampl deal with my field . if you can elabor a mathemat model of how an engin work , than you will be be abl to produc it and mayb also to understand , if there would be a damag , whi that kind of misfunct ha occur , which is the first step toward an improv engin . while if you onli had seen somebodi build an engin , you will also be abl to build one follow the same step but you would not be abl to understand neither how the engin work nor whi a damag could occur in certain condit , or what is due to . also if you have understood a concept you could probabl happen to appli it to mani differ event . for exampl if you know what graviti is and whi it work , will be abl to appli your knowledg to ton of experi . you will then understand both the reason of appl fall down the three when matur and not go up in the sky , as probabl newton did when he first explain thi phenomena , and the reason of the moon rotat around the earth and not leav hi pattern becaus the equilibrium between the graviti strenght and an opposit strenght due to hi speed . anyway i think it is veri import not to loos the contact with realiti . i mean that elabor abstract model which do not have now and will not have in the futur ani concret applic it is an unus think . thi is the risk of give more import to idea than fact : find ourselv think to the best idea , forget none of them will be then applaybl to what is our final purpos .
