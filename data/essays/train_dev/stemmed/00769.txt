i agre with the opinion that understand idea and concept is more import for student than learnig fact for them . i will explain the three reason . first , i think understand concept is basic . you ca n't build a high build without rock as a basi even though you may build a short block like a hous on the sand . if you learn the fact without accur concept , you may hear you are smart at first . but eventu you will confus the mean and the pile of thr fact will collas . second , i think you should experi the proper process . everyth ha an order in process . understand concept is a start . so you ca n't understand further fact without them . if you skip someth , you will meet the troubl in the end . speak again , if you ignor the process of understand accuratli , you will find you did n't know even a easi thing . third , you should undersand the academ thing as a whole . all the thori and fact link togeth . you should understand someth through anoth thing . if you learn fact separ , it seem like you see the tree but ca n't see the forest . so i think that understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact . a pile of there is no mean without basic understand .
