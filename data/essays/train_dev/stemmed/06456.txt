good market strategi and a lot of psycholog are place in advertis . they want to make the costum think they buy the best product on earth , but sometim the compani are cheat . in my opinion it 's true , that most advertis make product seem musch better than they relli are . the big boss of the economi want to make the big money by sell a lot of their product . to reach their thought , they would nearli do everth they could do . there are mani reason whi the manag tri to reach much more money . one is per exampl the stock market , which open mani peopl the possibl to be a sharehold of a compani . they invest their money with the thougth to get more money back in an futur time and so the put the manag under big pressur , becaus he 's the man who ha the invest of the sharehold in hi hand . i think that mani manag do n't want to be unemploy and so they start to find the best way of sell . some make their product without good qualiti , so that the costum need a new one after use it a few time . the disappoint of thi is , that the product are present like unbreak wonder which can chang the world . thi strategi get a lot of monez for the compani , but onli the first time , becaus the costum are not stupid and after buy one or two time thi product they wo n't come back to the compani with such a bad qualiti . so if the compani want to have success it ha to improv the product , but they onli do small chang and sell them the same strategi thez do the first time . in my opinion a lot of compani do it that way and that make it veri difficult to separ the good product from the bad one . the costum have to test the product even more clearli . ha it becom that wors case ? i do n't think so , becaus the state ha to improv the law and give more right to the costum .
