i complet agre with the statement : even though fact are import , i think it is more import for student to understand idea and concept . in fact , sometim idea and concept are behind a fact , they are the main caus of them : understand them is the best way to have a real comprehens of the fact . i will show two exampl that can support my opinion . in a scientif theori , for exampl the theori of graviti , i think that the most import thing to know is the main concept of the theori : an object is attract by the center of the earth , becaus everyth in the univers ha a forc of attract becaus of it mass . thi is the concept , the basic idea of the theori : understand it it 's more import than studi the formula . onc i have understood thi concept , i can studi the fact : the formula of the earth 's graviti , how scientist discov thi theori , what experi were made in order to demonstr it et cetera . .. in the same way , i think that is more import to understand idea and concept also in other subject . for instanc , it could be realli import in histori . for exampl , when someon ha to studi the period of the fascism , in itali and in europ in gener , i think that a good comprehens of the fact should focu on the societi in these year , on the econom condit of these countri after the i world war , on what peopl though after a terribl event that happen in europ befor . fact , date , event , are import , but in my opinion come in a second time . if a student doe not understand that fascism can occur when a man with a big person ha the power where there is a particular , social and econom situat in a countri , he will not understand the main caus of the event . on the other hand , if he understand it , he could understand the caus of fascism and whi some european countri have had a dictatorship after the world war i . in conclus , i think that idea and concept are fundament in order to understand the caus of someth , then fact deriv from these caus .
