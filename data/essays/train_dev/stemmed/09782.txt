i agre onli partial with the statement that broad knowledg in mani academ subject is better than to special on one specif subject . in my opinion it is not enough to have a vast knowledg in one subject . peopl tend to be narrow-mind if they do not know about ani subject but their specif one . a mathemat for exampl can make up a theoret statist about the spread of a diseas for exampl but he will have to conclud certain irregular to show the real process . furthermor , a certain amount of basic knowledg is import to everyon to particip in daili discuss or to built up a polit attitud for instanc . and everi employ expect basic knowledg from hi potenti employe . for exampl about the current polit and econom situat . therefor it is definetli import to be familiar with more than one singl topic . nevertheless , it is obviou that student have to concentr on one academ topic if they want to compet with other in a job . they have to know as much as possibl about thi one specif subject and they have to pay attent to learn about the newest chang and innov in thi subject . and apart from the competit it some situat it could also be veri danger if someon ha onli broad knowledg of a subject . a doctor with broad knowledg of medicin for exampl is the worst imagin danger . apart from that the whole servic sector is base on the fact that peopl know about one singl topic in detail while other know about anoth . nobodi can learn enough about everi subject for profession would be superflu . to draw a conclus , student should special on one specif subject and apart from that they should learn as much as possibl about other subject . everybodi should use hi talent to the greatest extent .
