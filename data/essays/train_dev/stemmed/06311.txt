i agre with the statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . the reason whi i think so are mani peopl who suc someth mostli tri new thing , tri new thing can be found the new thing that no one know yet , and poepl can do thing that alreadi know , but not everyon can not do new thing . first , in the world , most of peopl who succed are tri some new thing and succed . for exampl the new invent like internet or comput made the campani big and rich . second , it is not easi to tri new thing or the thing that take risk , becaus sometim they fail or veri denger . so , most of peopl do n't want to do that . but other way , no one want to do , so if you do , you will find somet that the peopl who do n't want to tri don'tknow . so , there are some opptun that you can find someth that no one know and it will be alb to connect to suc . at last , you can not be success if you do what peopl alreadi know haw to do , becaus if you can be success to do what you alreadi know , mayb everyon can be success becaus everyon can do same thing . if you tri someth new and you can find someth thatno one know , onli you can do that and other poepl ca n't do same thing becaus they do n't know . so most of the big compani tri to search new thing that o to tri someth new and take risk is difficult , but it mean you can find someth new and it may be abl to make you suc . so , i believ that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
