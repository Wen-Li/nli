the question ask to discuss the usag and the effect of advertis on product . first of all , my opinon about thi question is that advertis do chang the point of view in term of it qualiti or usag . mani custom becom manipul in the way how a product is present . for exampl the store aldi in germani sell mani differ food product . these product are not advertis at all and have no nice brand and design . that make them cheaper and mani peopl buy these to save money and still get veri good product . these peopl are the minor of all custom in germani . most of the peopl buy their food in great warehous . these market use a lot of advertis to offer their good . even these good come from the same product or have the same qualiti as good from aldi . the peopl buy them becaus of the better style or the higher price . qualiti ha it 's price they think . in fact thi show that peopl trust more in the qualiti and tast of product if the advertis tell that . anoth exampl are televison advertis . usual there are nice-look peopl act to manipul the spectat . the spectat think he or she could be thi human and get more atract if he or she buy the product . the import of the product is not import anymor . to manipul the custom and give him the illus life can not continu without buy thi product is a veri common procedur nowaday . therefor mani magazin offer test report on product of main interest . they test each item and rank all of them afterward in term of qualiti or price . mani peopl today do not buy electron item befor they have research test report and comment from other peopl . it is too unsaf for them to buy in an affect of a nice advertis . it is more import to get what is need .
