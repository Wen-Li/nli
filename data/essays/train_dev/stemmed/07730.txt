in normal , as a natur of fact , young peopl and older peopl have some differ idea and approach even to the same situat . therefor , i complet aggre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . thi is becaus due to the follow reason . to begin with , young peopl and older peopl have differ attitud and experi , so they are not expect to behav similar against the same situat . for instanc , young peopl can tri to enjoy life by travel , danc , do so mani sport activ such as swim , track , ski and so on . howev , in gener , older peopl think to live a more stabl or routin life and they usual do not want to enjoy life by do whatev young peopl do . furthermor , young and older peopl of cours have differ metabol which mean their hormon are realli differ to each other ' . therefor , one can not usual expect to someon , age of 75 , to make bunge jump from a skyscrap but as you guess , a young boy tri to feel thi adrenalin in hi vessel by jump from 250 feet height . moreov , similar to these , young peopl have no such a hard respons for their famili or someon around them . howev , mani older peopl are grandmoth and grandfath so they alway have to think not onli themselv but also their children and grand children . for exampl , think a boy , at the age of 15 , he/sh can go to a holiday for two or three month with his/her friend becaus if the school are close , they have a great time to make whatev they want , but older peopl have a limit time to do so . in the ligth of abov discuss , last but not at least , i wish to conclud by say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl due to their differ experi , differ hormon metabol and differ respons as well . therefor , as a young and dynam boy , i tri to do whatev and whenev i want becaus i do not want to say when i am 65 year old that i wish . ..
