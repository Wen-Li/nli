i agre with the statement which say that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today becaus i think that the transport system such as train or buss will be develop more than now . even now , in the big citi , peopl use train or buss more than car . mayb peopl think convini to use transport better than use a car becaus of dens of the peopl and car . nobodi like the rush hour and everybodi want to avoid it . the other reason i agre with the statement is the think of environ . it is a seriou problem the mount of co2 the bunch of car make . i guess and i hope that peopl will care about environ more and for that , use car is not so good way . if mani peopl use train of buss instead of car , much of co2 is reduc . one more last reason i agre with the statement is the cost of the car . to have a car cost much becaus of ga , insulu , maintainc , and itself . becaus of these cost , i think in next twenti year , the number of the peopl who use the car will reduc . and also , it is more healthi than car becaus it make peol stand and walk . these are the reason whi i agre with the statement which say that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . howev , of cours , there are mani good point about car . it is convini , use , and for some peopl , it 's cool to have it . moreov , transport such as buss and train also have mani problem such as the rush time or time it take . but for mani reason i said abov , i hope the improv of the transpot system and i think it will be .
