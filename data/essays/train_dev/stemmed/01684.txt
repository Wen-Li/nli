the issu state by the topic is whether the student need to understand the idea and concept rather than learnin the fact alon . thi is a veri import issu becaus it is relat to the student and the applic of the knowledg they have gain in their school . i complet agre with the statement becaus of variou reason . firstli i feel that understand the idea and concept is better option becaus the student will be abl to judg by himself whether the fact are true or not instead of ask the student to blindli follow the fact which may creat confus in them . secondli by get familiar with the idea and concept . the student will better understand the outcom of them and inturn will be abl to appli them correctli . for exampl if the student understand the concept of graviti thorougli rather than just know that all the object throw up will come down , the student is more convinc and be care with the object he is handel . anoth point whi i feel that understand the idea and concept is the right option for student is becaus they can retain the fact for longer period of time . for exampl if student understand how the fact have obtain instead of just what are the fact they can alway appli the concept and get fact . but if they learn onli fact then if they forget them it will be difficult to rememb . lastli school is never complet if the student come out of the educ institut with just gain knowledg of the thing , that is just knowin fact . if the student are not abl to appi them in their daili life then there wont be ani mean for the knowledg they gain . in conclus i believ that student should understand the idea and concept thorougli thaught in their school and not just mere learn the fact inord to fulfil their educ and inturn to evolv as a complet human be and be usefulto the societi when they come out .
