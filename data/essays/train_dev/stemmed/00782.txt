is realli everyth you see in advertis is better ? it hard question to answer becaus ther are some product are realli better than it show in the advertis and the other are do n't . i disagre about the food 's product becaus they do n't care by the peopl at all , the import think for them is how to collect the money from peopl , but no bodi ask him self thi quistion is that realli thi food healthi ? . no bodi from them ask how mani one will suffr if they use thi product . let me be more spacif and talk about kind of food which is the humberg . we watch alot of advertis about it , in tv , newspap , magazin , and we hear them in the radio station , but i never heard from those peopl explan if the product is healthi or not . is the product help peopl have a bad colestrol or not . in fact the humberg increas the bad colestrol , and it cous alot of heart problem such as the hart attack . unfortuanatli , the govern do n't care . they care onli for colect money from them , but the peopl it do n't matter if they will go to the hill . in the same time i agre there are a product show in advertis help the peopl . for exampl the product help the handecab peopl , or ani kind of product give a real advic to the peopl such as , the medicin product , of cours we will ask our doctor abut it . also i disagre about the product becam an a denger . for exampl the advertis call peopl to jump from over the mountain , or eat some insect like fear factor program , i know there is a warn in the program , but the peopl do like them exactli , and they got hurt . so we need to be honest with our advertis and with peopl .
