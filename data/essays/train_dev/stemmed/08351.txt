i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . to my mind , the main reason for thi is that today in the age of mass product there exist a graet varieti of product that all want to be sold . sell a product make it import to draw the attent of peopl to it . thi aim is normal achiev by use exagger in the advertis of product . for exampl , advertis often state that a certain lotion make look one 's skin ten year younger by take away all wrinkel . i actual do not believ that thi can be achiev just by the use of a certain lotion . a lotion might help to moistur your skin and by thi make it more soft , but i do not believ that it is abl to make you look ten year younger . thi is a typic exagger often use in an advertis that make the product seem to be much better than is in realiti . furthermor , peopl 's attent in our hectic world is usual drawn to so mani thing at the same time that an advertis that just give us clear inform on a product will not help the product to be sold success . most of the product advertis in tv . the cost of thi type of advertis depend on how long the product is shown . thu time often will be rare und use in a way that draw the attent of the audienc veri quickli . the easiest way to do thi , is to make peopl believ that the product is much better than all the other product that it could be compar to it . thi goal is normal achiev by tell peopl someth about the producht that make it seem better than it is in realiti . at least , all the mean of our modern media societi make product often seem better than they are in realiti by propos them in a certain light or colour . thi is whi i want to state that in conclus that one should not believ everyth present in advertis .
