in my eye it is wrong to say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . obvious , one could state the fact younger peopl are healthier and that they still have to make all their import choic in life , they have no regret . furthermor they can tri a vast rang of activ . becaus of their youth and health they can do variou sport , learn how to play muscial instrument , travel spontan to danger place and if they have not start work yet , they have a lot less respon . all these choic might be out of reach for older peopl becaus of their health and social statu . in addit to thi older peopl could be in a wors emot state than younger peopl . with increas respons such as bring up a famili , pay for their children 's educ , they are less carefre . health issu , e.g. age relat ill such as alzheim 's or accord to age impend death can turn life itself into one long hardship for older peopl . also , they might have lost a love one such as their spous or sibl . but nonetheless one ha to take into account older peopl 's life experi and what they are look back on . in the cours of their life older peopl have experienc all kind of emot and thing that turn them into the person they are . thi could be a marriag , the birth of a child , the further extens of their famili or a huge succ or achiev . they can alsway look back and reliv the most wonder moment of their life , someth younger peopl have yet to experi . and final , older peopl are in a way the foundat of their famili . to know that one is appreci , need and reli upon is someth that make life veri special .
