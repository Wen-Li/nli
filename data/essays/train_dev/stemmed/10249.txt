for me , as i am one of the young peopl accord to nowaday , i beliv that we do give enough time help our commun . i would like to introduc our work for our commun . in school we are ask to do volunti work for an exact amount of time . accord to my knowledg i believ everi school ha the same amount of time to do volunti work . our school ha to do more than 20 hour of volunti work for 3 year of junior-high school . thi may feel that we are forec to do it , but even though we are forc to do volunti , i say we eventu help out commun . young peopl nowaday do n't onli spend time help their commint but also spend alot amount of time help their countri . korea is a small countri with no fossil fule or what so ever . the onli resourc that can help korea to keep on go to the top would be student or young peopl intellig . a few day ago i found out that not even japanes student studi as hard as we do . what i also knew wa that korea 's student had high grade in math and scienc than other countri student . mani adult are count on young peopl to lead the countri better than now . the result to thi , mani parent of korea 's young peopl are make their children to work harder than ani bodyels . for exampl by send their kid to after school academi and so on . accord to my thought , i think young peopl nowaday do give enough time help their commun . although help by volunti which is forc to do from school , i believ young peopl do realiz they are help out their commun . for a small countri without ani natur resorc like korea , young peopl are studi harder than ani other student in the world to eventu help thier countri .
