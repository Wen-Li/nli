today , we go to vacat to variou place such as itali , franc , or switzerland . when go on a vacat , some peopl prefer be in a group of tourist led by a tour guid . howev , in my opinion , i believ that the best way of travel is travel individu without a tour guid for these two reason . first of all , travel with a tour guid is too limit in time . for instanc , even if you want see someth leisur , you would be cut off on time and have to assembl to a certain place the tour guid want you to . you would n't be abl to spend lot of time as you want buy postcard in shop area or have time watch street perform . i believ a trip will be more enjoy when spend time leisur with your famili or friend , so i think get limit on time is n't a good choic to make . also , follow the tour guid in your trip will make you feel uncomfort and also may caus some bad interact with the tour guid . for exampl , if you are tire or want to see some other part of the countri such as beauti scenari , or place where a famou movi wa taken , you wo n't be allow to go there becaus you have to move as a group through out your trip . onc when i wa on a trip to austria , there wa a suggest of visit the hous in the movi , `` sound of music '' by the major of tourist , but it wa not taken by the tour guid . so that day end up in have misunderstand and neg feel toward the guid . in conclus , i think the best way of travel is travel without a tour guid , but rather travel by your own will . follow the guid all day , week , or month will be too limit in time and make you feel uncomfortal . therefor , i believ that travel individu will be more fun and will allow you to have more chanc of look around place and be free .
