i total agre with the statement given abov . first of all , advertis onli show the advantag of a product and not the possibl disadvantag . i made thi experi for my own for quit a sever time . i rememb the first advertis of the ipod from appl . the custom realli got the feel , that the ipod wa not onli a simpl music player in a good look design , but even that it is the most handiest player on the market . i wa one of the first peopl who bought an ipod but after a short period of time i wa a littl bit depress about my decis . the advertis did not show , that for exampl it wa onli possibl to chang the record music with one singl softwar program and onli one comput at onc . i have still got the ipod , but in fututr i will be better inform about the featur of a product , befor i buy it . furthermor , quit a lot of product do not aim the characterist in the way the advertis show . a good friend of mine is work in the market busi unit of a compani , which is do the advertis for differ compani . it is allway veri interst and funni when we are get togeth for a drink and talk about our job . everytim it is the same that he tell me about new of hi custom and their product . my friend and hi collegu sometim do not even see one advantag of a product which should be advert by them , but it is their job to present the product in a kind of way that peopl have the desir to buy it . as i have shown abov , advertis do not allway show the truth about a product and put much better light on it than it is . i made these experi for sever time and i learn from thi . i think everybodi should be awar of , that the product she/h buy is perhap not as perfect as the advertis of the product show .
