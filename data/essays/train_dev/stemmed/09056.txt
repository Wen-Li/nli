peopl have differ opinion about whether they should travel in a group led by a tour guid or not . in my opinion , i strongli support the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid becaus of sever reason . first of all , a tour guid know where is the most wonderful palc . peopl do not want to spend their money and time by go to unexcit palc and they want to see somth they have never seen in their life . last year i went to canada and i did not know about niagra fall , but when i join a group ha a tour guid he took us their and that wa one of the best place i have ever seen in my life becaus i did not know about that befor . anoth reason to support the idea for have a tour guid is that usual a guid know the best way to go to the palc that we need . we could save time insead of use map or gp and wast time and our vacat look for the direct or ask peopl in the street how to go home back . my father went to new york and he could not find 5th ave. and he spent all the day look for it in the map . final , when we have a tour guid usual we will go by the same can or in a big bu so we do not need to spend money to rent a car . i went with my wife and we both were happi becaus we did not worri about have a car which will cost us alot of money . to sum up , thi reason that i cite are about travel in a group led by a tour guid when we travel insead of travel alon . if we talvel in a group ha a tour guid we will enjoy the trip and spend most of the time by go to place we did not know about it and in the same time we could save
