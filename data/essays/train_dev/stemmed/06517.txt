the success of peopl is strictli relat to the level of risk taken . the real success is the materi of the peopl 's abil to differenti themself respect to other . a good exampl of success stori could be the steve job adventur in the technolog world . steve job , that is the father and the creator of the appl compani , know veri well , that to be a success man , you must take some risk , and tri to do the thing in a differ way respect your competitor . as professor porter say the real and most valuabl competit advantag for a compani , but at the same time for a person , is the abil to be differ . be differ , not mean , onli do new thing ; be differ could be do the old thing but in differ way . everi time that we tri to do a new thing , we take at the same time more risk , but to be success , we must be abl to evalu the differ risk , and to figur out what could be our return , and what or in which measur the failur could affect our life . then , from my point of view , success is relat with a multipl seri of differ factor : abil to creat , to immagin , or to perform someth in differ way respect to other peopl ; predisposit to the risk , in other word , could be veri difficult reach the success , if the subject is a risk advers ; but at the same time , is veri import , the abil to measur thi risk , and to creat some differ scenario , to be abl to predict what could happen if everyth take the wrong path . return to the steve job exampl , what sign the success of the appl compani , wa the visionari abil of job , in figur out what will distingu a product like ipod from a differ mp3 devic . he choos an innov path , he calcul and evalu the risk correl with hi idea , and , reach some failur , take some lose , he final suc with hi devic . then , when someon have success , is at last , caus he wa abl to understand and to learn from hi failur and hi error , that could deriv from tri to be differ , and take some risk . success is in my opinion , the prize , reserv to who have the courag to be like no other .
