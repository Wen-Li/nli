i am absolut convinc that it is much more import to special ourselv in one specifi topic if we are strongli interest in it . thi idea is deep root in me , becaus i am sure that a person will be abl to achiev higher aim if that individu decid to focu hi studi on few specif topic . nowaday there is a strong competit run both in profession field and in academ field . that is whi i am convinc that onli if you are abl to perfectli manag a topic you can suc in your field of interest . moreov it is necessari to consid that , if you have a broad knowledg of a lot of differ subject , you can not have a deep knowledg of anyon of them . you probabl will be abl to talk about a lot of differ thing , but you will not be abl to deepli analys anyon of these . howev , it is just a matter of how deep is our need to command and masteris a specif topic . our societi is a veri superfici societi , with the massiv use of the internet we have been teach to surf on inform and just to obtain what we need from these inform , without analys the differ item stend behind a subject . otherwis it is veri import for a student who want to achiev high aim , to analys mani differ aspect of their field of interest . i am convinc that it is charm to analys a problem and to studi it from mani differ point of view . thi will give peopl a strong opportun of improv and of growth , both as an student and as a futur worker . special in one topic , and leav all the other subject , is a veri strong challeng , and actual it is a risk becaus you have to take a decis about the main field of knowledg you are go to develop probabl dure you whole life . but , if you like challeng , probabl you will obtain higher aim . life is full of choic , and thi is a veri difficult choic for you career , and for you life . but i think that challeng and chois make life colourful and funni .
