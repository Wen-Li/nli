i think that is better to special in one specif subject , becous today a lot of work are done by team of peopl , and ani person ha a specif function . thi is valid for team of doctor , for team of arquitect , for team of engin : to realiz a big project is not use to have ten peopl who are quit good in do the same kind of work , but it 'd be realli use that each of these ten peopl would be special in a specif part of the work need . in thi way it 'd be faster to realiz anyth without the interfer of differ peopl on the same problem , and the qualiti of the interv can grow . to improv our busi , technolog , medicin and all the other field of the societi , we need special peopl , to be abl in solv ani kind of problem by ask to the ` right man` ! i think that to have a broad knowledg could be a good thing , also on academ subject , but at the end you need to special . it 's fair to know , for exampl project a new hostip , what kind of thing need to be done befor and which after , and how they have to be done , but just for gener knowledg , as global cultur luggag that everi peopl can build by hi own . to special our knowledg in a specif academ subject , will be good to find a job that we like . howev , with a more gener prepar you can suc in find a job , it could be a bore job , link with a part of your studi that you did n't enjoy so much , and you will be unhappi for the rest of your life , becous all the compani seek special peopl , and you have just a gener knowledg of some subject . your job can be more flexibl , but you will repalc other peopl for the rest of your life , without the possibl to suc in a specif field . is for these reason that i prefer to special .
