i complet agre that student should pay more emphasi to understand idea and concept rather than superfici mug up fact . a mug up fact with no basic understand of the idea behind it may seem less time-consum initi , may enabl you score quit well also but in the long run it doe no good to you . for . e.g. in a math test in primari if you mere cram all word problem solut , then pleas be readi to cram anoth set of word probelm in primari 6 , 7 , so on . . but if you have understood the concept , you just need to appli the same . and score a in all the class . thi is my person experi . primari 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 , i onli studi word probelm in primari 6 and never thereaft . mere cram not onli hinder your clear vision toward the matter but also block your mental abil to think deeper and in a way block your mental growth . if we dont ask ourselv question about subject and donot tri to find out answer we are block our own vision . for e.g. if newton didnot ask himself or make himself to think of whi the appl fell , he would not have gone to find out answer and give hi theori . deeper understand of a matter not onli enabl you clearli understand but on it own or in other word automat gener your interest into a subject . and what better than thi if you are realli enjoy what you are do ? everi art come with practic , demand time , devot and , of cours , interest . learn , not onli paint , but infact do scienc is an art as well . for e.g. , if in your secondari school you learn and understand what titrat is conceptu , you will definit enjoy the moment spent in chemistri lab when you are perform it with your own hand and then see ph becom neutral . anoth interest exampl is that of understand cancer . if you realli understand what is the cellular mechan of cancer and what gene or protein are increas or decreas dure the process , it will be so fascin to studi the respons or develop of cancer mere by studi the level of gene and then see the result and then understand them also and then make other to look at what result you have got in your laboratori with appropri explan and relat them to cancer , rather than mere act as a foolish worker in your own lab . learn a techniqu make you mere a worker , as good as a blue collar guy , learn a subject make you a scientist . so in-depth knowledg is not import but mandatori . mug or learn fact make you a worker but to realli enjoy and rule a subject one should understand the concept which is someth that is go to take one a long way .
