i absolut agre that the imag of the product given by the commun ad is , in most of the case , much better than how the product is in realiti . for exampl let 's take a campaign about pre-cook food as roast chicken : in the ad the chicken is alway so beauti , crispi and tasti . but onc the product is in on your tabl . .. well the colour is mayb the same but the chicken is not tasti at all . actual it tast as plastic . anoth interest exampl is a new mobil . the advertis state that the batteri will last for sever hundr hour and the softwar will do incred thing for you . but in realiti the batteri charg will last for few hour onli , two day maximum . the softwar will take age to get readi and from time to time it will just be stuck for quit a long time . that is what happen to me with my new mobil . i guess if a product ha to penetr the market is ha be shown as extrem appeal and absolut new and fantast . to convinc someon to buy the product the commerci ha to be veri effici , catch the attent and make grat , and fake , promis about qualiti and custom 's satisfact . so approach the product custom will not onli buy the product itself buth all the valuabl thing the commerci attach to it . i think there are so mani me-too product , all look more or less alik , that the market peopl are forc to reli on thi kind of adverstis to make the peopl notic their product . for exampl comput from differ firm all have the same featur , someon ha a bigger memori or screen or viceversa but none is realli differ . the real problem is that there are not enough differenti valu in product . even qualiti and the fact that they are realli use product is not enough anymor .
