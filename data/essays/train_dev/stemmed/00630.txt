t is a fact that young peopl are the back bone of the nation , they are the one who could strongli contribut to the countri success and eventu in develop the nation in each and everi aspect . each and everi one would dream to be post in a prestegi job after the educ , but there are some peopl who lend their hand to help the poor and peopl who are both physic and mental retard . i believ one should be in a posit to help other without ask anyth in return from them . to develop thi kind of natur the govern should releas some documentari which will explain the kind of help the other which will inturn develop the countri . i strongli disagre with the point that young peopl are not spend enough time to help other , becaus in my graduat i accompani with sever classmat and visit oldag home to help them as part of a lend hand program conduct by our colleg , we dint expect ani thing in return either from the colleg in form of certif or from the old peopl , i myself had a great time help them for that coupl of day . my sir alway use to teach me one thing , if u help some one dont expect anyth in return from them even a thank , rather ask them to help atleast three peopl in their life and ask those three peopl to help three other peopl individu , thi concept i have implement in my life from that day and ask mani other to follow the same . i am sure it will spread throughtout the societi and one day the entir nation follow it in which not onli youth will be involv but also the children and elder . i am so confid becaus i have tast it fruit in the earli day , some unknown person repeat the same thing to do when i have reciev a help from him . so , i conclud that anyon who believ that young peopl doesnt have time to help other are on the wrong assumps and i want each and everi one to follow the abov mention concept .
