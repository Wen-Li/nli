as a student , we learn a lot of differ type of knowledg from teacher , classmat and textbook , includ idea and fact . the essenc of fact and idea are differ , and the skill to learn fact and idea are also differ . some think that learn fact is the most essenti thing ; other argu that understand idea is more import in learn . there have been an agruement for a long time . in my opinion , i agre that to understand idea and concept is more import . my first reason is that understand concept is the basi when we studi , but memor fact will limit student ' think . onc we understand the concept of the question , it will be mush easier to solv the problem by use the concept and idea . on the other hand , if student onli focu on the text and memor the fact which is found by other , they lose the chanc to think about the question on their own . anoth reason is that understand concept and idea will help student to extend their own idea . know the concept is the basi for innov . for exampl , although mani inventor do not accept regular educ , they practis and extend their own idea and imagin just base on the concept . most of the invent are from the concept of materi and the inventor 's creativ . in other word , without just learn the fact from book , understand concept give student more space to imagin and tri . to ummar , i think understand the idea an concept is more import than learn fact . to learn fact is to learn someth dead , howev , concept and idea are aliv . know concept ecourag student to think deepli and creativ .
