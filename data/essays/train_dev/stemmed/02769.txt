it may be true that everyon want to be success . but to becom succeed is not easi . if we refer to some peopl who have succeed in their life , we can find that what they did in order to succeed is not as same and simpl as normal peopl do . it is common that peopl who were success have a common trait . that is , they tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well and i agre to thi . we can find the evid of the statement as we read the articl of the live of famou peopl such as thoma edison who wa a geniou in invent . also , there is a rule in the busi that success busi peopl tri new thing and take risk . i rememb readinig an articl about the life of thoma edison when i wa young . while read it , i did n't understand whi thoma edison tri to hatch an egg by himself , do experi in the train , and other `` unpredict '' thing he did . howev , i now know that tri new thing like him led to him as one of the success peopl in the world , in invent . it is becaus he learn from hi tryout . he sometim fail and succeed . when he fail , he learn whi he fail from what he did by figur out what went wrong , what need to be improv , and so on . for exampl , he fail to hatch an egg becaus there is a certain condit requir to hatch an egg , the condit that hen have . on the other hand , when he succeed , he becom more confid encourag himself to tri other thing . without these trait , he would not be one of the success peopl . in busi studi , i learn that it is one of the fact that a success busi person tri new thing and take risk , which is fairli true . for exampl , if a person want to start run a busi in ice-cream market , he should have superior and interest idea that catch the attent of consum . to find uniqu idea , he tri new thing such as make new flavour of ice-cream which peopl did n't tast befor , make interest shape of the ice-cream , and so on . moreov , he should assum that he will be respons for take risk as he tri new thing . if hi idea fail , then he should replac the financi problem result from the failur . howev , as he get over these factor , he will later becam a success businessman in ice-cream industri . peopl want to be success but it is true that most of them do n't know how to succeed . for them , i want to suggest to tri new thing and take risk , as statement said .
