i believ that understand the idea and concept is more signific than learn fact for student . there are two reason which make me think like that . first , when the student tri to understand the main idea of a particular subject , it is easier for the student to examin what is realli meant . by thi way , the student gain the opportun to think and critis the concept of the subject . when the student ha the abil to critis , the student may draw new conclus for that subject , i mean the student may have a differ point of view , and discuss it advantag and drawback with hi classmat and professor . thi realli help to improv the think skill of the student and veri use for further research such as attend a graduat program after the school , if he intend to . second , as we know the human brain is open for new idea , memor what is told in the class would not be help to the student for hi upcom class . becaus when you just memor the fact without know it caus for a specif time period , for instanc memor classnot befor the exam , it is inevit to forget all of it after a meanwhil . to conclud , i think learn the reason for a certain subject is for the student 's own good to understand a specif subject clearli .
