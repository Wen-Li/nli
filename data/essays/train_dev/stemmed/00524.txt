i person diagre with the statement that say that young peopl do not give enough time to their commun . i disagre with it becaus it is a veri gener statment and it is a typic stereotyp and categor of young peopl . in addit to that the statment is a non credibl statement becaus it is abviouli base on person opinion rather than on fact , sinc it is not support by statist or ani menaingful number . the statment carri alot of hidden mean or even insult to young peopl becaus it pictur them as selfish peopl who doe n't care about their commun . not onli that but it also indirectli indic that young peopl are irrespons peopl who do not posit contribut in their commun , and are not active/useful member of their own commun . in addit to that , the statment that ha been made against young peopl is a veri gener statment , sinc not all young peopl do not give enough time to their commun . there are some young peopl who are addict to chariti work , and who dedic a lot of their time in help improv their commun and in help other . thu we ca n't gener . i also disagre with such a statement becaus i person think that it is a weak statment becau it is not support by ani kind of eveid such as a survey , statist , or ani mean full number . to me thi statement is just like throw accusas on other . such statment are not accept to me not onli becaus i disagre witth thi particular statment but becaus if i accept such stereotyp it mean that i might as well accept other stereotyp . and by do that i 'll be encourag stereotyp that might be more seriou or even danger and that might seriouli affcet our societi , commun , or even the way or even the qualiti of our live .
