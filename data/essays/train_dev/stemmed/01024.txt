mani student at some point of their live wonder if they should choos a special in their studi or if they should go into a gener univers to choos class in mani differ field . i think both can be good , but everyth depend on what you want to do . first of all , i believ that it is import that student do n't specil too earli . in high school for instanc , it is import that student learn about mani differ field befor be allow to choos which major they want to studi . it can thu make student discov field of knowledg they did n't know befor , but some field that can also attract them a lot . besid , i think that choos to special or not depend on what kind of job you want to do later . some job requier good knowledg in mani academ field . thi is for instanc the case of journal . some of the journalist do decid to special , but the major are abl to write about everi topic , whether it concern a pension reform or a footbal match . on a person point of view , thi attitud - to make the choic of not choos a special - can be veri interest . somebodi who decid not to choos a major field of interest will be interest in much more numer thing than somebodi onli interest in histori or philosophi . but i also think that there is a danger for peopl know lot of thing , in mani field . the societi also need specialist who deepli know some aspect of the societi . for instanc , teach biolog requir to be a specialist in biolog . and it is the same for all the teacher . in some countri , teacher are teach two subject , but i think it is not such a good idea sinc they ca n't know veri well two field of knowledg . to conclud , we can say that societi need both - specialist and peopl that stay in gener knowledg . but personali , i like have learnt mani differ subject befor special myself . thank to thi , i discov what wa biolog , physic and mani other field that i would not have discov without my high school class .
