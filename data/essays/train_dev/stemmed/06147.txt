in my opinion , i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , sometim the what we see or hear is not the fact . like long time ago peopl think the earth is a rectangl , becaus the road are flat . but after sever year of search and experi , now the fact becom that the earth is like a ball . so it is import to underatnad the idea and concept , then we wo n't be cheat by what we see by our limit vision . second , it is import to understand idea and concept becaus it 's the way for us to get the truth and concept . for exampl , after a stuent learn and understand the idea and concept , then they can use it to discov or creat new stuff . i think that 's whi we envent lost of new thing like car and plain to make our life easier . so i believ that understand idea and concept are more import for student . third , it is more import for student to understand the idea and concept becaus in thi way , student start to think , and becom creativ . they can use their imagin to creat new idea and concept , and their imagin is not limit by the fact . it 's a good way to encourag student to search , think and find the answer they want . so it is not that import to let the student learn the fact . in conclus , i believ that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . becaus in thi way student can imagin and think freeli , and creat new thing that 's uniqu . and it 's good for us to find the truth and real fact .
