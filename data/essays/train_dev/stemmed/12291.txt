thi statement ha been greatli discuss in mani didact environ for the simpl reason that some consid the theoret knowledg to be more import than the practic one and some consid the opposit . i wa lucki to have person attend school that agre and disagre with the statement sinc i attend an italian high school ( that reli mostli on idea and concept ) and a canadian high school ( that focus more on real fact that occur ) . thi is whi foreign find that italian know how to talk about a certain topic but they do not know how to actual solv ( or i should say ) `` fix '' it . my uncl , an engin who live in canada , onc attend a confer here in itali and he notic how italian honestli might know more about the theori ( in thi case physic or math ) but need help from the more `` hands-on '' engin from abroad who consid real case dure their educ give them a higher experi . in my opinion learn about fact is defin more enjoy and gain a higher interest within the student . it also give you a better insight of today 's world situat . the reason whi we studi histori is becaus we ought to learn about event that occur in the past and to prevent the same mistak or find a better solut . onc i came back from my school year abroad it wa n't easi for me to get use to the old and stricter method . i tri to make my teacher understand and realiz how a fact that occur implicit ha the concept in it . experi also play a key role and to discuss about real fact certainli help a lot . as onc oscar wild said `` experi is the name we give to our mistak '' . thi is whi i believ that it is defin import to learn and understand idea and concept but the next fundament step would be to consid a real fact that concern it . itali ha a veri ancient background on it shoulder and it would be veri hard to chang it attitud or point of view .
