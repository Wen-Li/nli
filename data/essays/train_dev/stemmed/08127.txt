i disagre that it is more import for student to understand idea and convept than it is for them to learn fact . fist , onli student have learn fact , then they will understand idea and convept . student have learn fact by themselv that they would have a deep express of what they have done . if we just let the student understand idea and concept , they might not realli learn fact . to let the student understand idea and concept is a requir , but to let the studnet learn fact are more import . second , how doe student to undetstand idea and concept are not better than learn fact ? for instanc , we read a novel stori , we know what it talk about , but sometim we might mistakenli know what we have learn about . on the other hand , if you have learn fact . then it is more easier for you to understand idea and concept more clearli . for stundet ' stude , the main point is to learn fact no matter what kind of subject . it is prove that it alway ture . so if you what to learn fast ? learn fact ! it will help you a lot . last , as what we know , learn fact are more difficult for student to understand idea and concept . for most of student , they alway did the idea and convept fist , then go on to research fact , at the end of it , it will spend lot of their time on it , and it did not deserv it .
