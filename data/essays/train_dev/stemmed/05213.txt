advertis campa , to my opinion , are most of the time fill with unreal inform about the product they are tri to sale . for exampl , i alway see on tv advertis about loos weight that they tri to sale a type of medic or lotion that make you loos weight , and then they first show a woman so fat , and on the other side of the screen you will see such a beauti and skinni ladi , that anybodi , or , at least , an intellig person can realiz that such a chang is not possibl that easi . i believ that those advertis alway say what peopl want to hear , but they do not usual say the truth , but the onli purpos of thi is to sale the product to be abl to make money , despit of what the consecuens are . that is whi advertis make thi product or item seem way better than they realli are . i can also mention some other exampl , such as food , cloth , medicin , even cologn and perfum , that can chang your live for ever , and make you the perfect person of thi world , but unfortunali , i do not have enough time to talk about all of them , but what i can say is that , at the end , these campa have the same mean , and result . there is no doubt that advertis , and i strongli agre with that statement , are a good invent for those who want to make money out of peopl ignor , and common senc ; and advertis also know that , in some occas , peopl like to spend money even thought they are awar of those product are not realli good , and that they hide someth behind the imag the advertis creat . all in all , my advic , do not buy everyth you see on tv , magazin or other place , becaus they do not usual say the truth .
