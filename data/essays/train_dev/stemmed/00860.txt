the statement about advertis is , in my opinion , complitey correct . i perfectli agre with it . the reason are variou : the possibl to presenc of famou peolp , the use of particular word or even the use of a combin of differ colour . these can influenc the qualiti of how to present a product . first of all , the presenc of a famou and known person can determin a better reaction than not have one . for exampl an advertis for shoe can be of better impact if a known actress is seen wear it . or differ if you want a child to buy a specif school diari , a possibl is to show next to the object , the presenc of a known disney charact . second , the use of select word can provid a good result for the aim . the combin of particular word can creat doubl mean that influenc the peopl that watch the advertis ! thi mean that if you talk about choccol and you write a sentenc where you state that thi food help when you are sad and give you energi , peopl might forget that it can also make you gain weight ! it is therefor possibl to convinc just by a particular phrase that one thing is good rather than bad . third , colour can be an import compon for a good result in the creation of an advertis . thi is becaus specif doctor have studi the influenc of colour in human mental thought . an exampl could be advertis for medicin . usual doctor say that light blue is more propper for thi purpos . differ , red and orang have other more complex capac . thi is whi some colour are use and some other are less commenli chosen . in conclus , it is possibl to confirm that some product seem much better that what they actual are thank to the possibl that advertis provid . i agre with thi statement . nevertheless , human tast may vari and therefor find some advertis less effect than other .
