when i read about success peopl 's wrting about their live , their success is alway base on their veri special new method or invent . moreov , nowaday new challang is develop brand new idea . everi human be alway seek new idea and new product to make them success . present world alreadi ha been develop too much for regular idea or invent . moreov , peopl who succeed alway had hard time with them . in my opinion , becaus they face with their problem and they overcom it , they can call success peopl . first of all , the success peopl 's common stereotyp is not satisfi to the present situat and alway challang to the new one . walt disney did not satisfi with hi current societi 's broadcast . he invent varieti disney charact such as `` mikki mous '' or `` minni mous '' . thi new charact contribut to obtain children 's attent , and it becom the fuel for walt disney 's success . in addit he never stope to creat new charact , hi unstopp tring also make hi success more shini . second of all , the peopl who reach their success took lot of rick than ordinari peopl . it is not true that person can make their forturn in one tri except the lottari . success peopl alway took higher risk to obtain more new and valuabl result from their tri . when the bill gate wa young man , he wa attend to harberd univers and he wa respect by other to just attend in the harberd . howev , when he tri to make the microsoft program , there are some episod about he fail at hi class in univers . bill gate gave up hi reput of harverd . normal peopl usual not do it . third of all , success peopl did not stop to develop themselv . they alway tri new thing with risk but never give up about it . they tri and tri until they get satisfi data or result about it . then they start to new tri base on their collect inform . piccaso is the famous artist of the modern age and hi one paint valu like more than million dollar . hi work at that time wa not that notic becaus hi paint wa too creativ . howev , he did not give up draw . he just kept draw and draw by hi way . after he die , until now , we thought hi paint is veri creativ and we gave him a creadit for it . in short , success peopl tri new thing although they could take seriou risk , and they never give up until they reach their goal . therefor , i strongli agre with the statement that is given .
