i disagre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in my opinion , learn fact is more import and effici for studemt . there are three reason . first reason is that fact are effici in a real situat . second reason is that fact alway follow a realiti . therefor , it help to solv a problem . third reason is that peopl learn the idea and concept through the fact . first of all , the fact are alway effici in a real situat . for exampl , in busi , peopl do n't know what to do when they face problem although they have knowledg about a concept of busi . concept is just a concept . fact and the skill that busi peopl need in real situat is mostli differ from the concept . busi peopl who know pefectli about concept and idea do n't alway succeed in busi becaus a market is veri complic and alway chang . in anoth word , the fact in the market is alway chang . therefor , they have to flexibl keep up with the cahng of the fact . secondli , the realiti doe not alway follow the realiti . there are so mani accid . therefor busi peopl need to know as mani case and solut as possibl which may be need in realiti . thirdli , peopl can learn concept and idea through the fact . learn concept through the fact and real experi is more effici for us to work in realiti than learn onli concept and idea . if i do n't know about the fact , i will not be abl to have a good solit
