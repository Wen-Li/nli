some peopl believ that , in about twenti year from now , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in my point of view , i do not agre with such assert , and i have two major rearon for my view . firstli , i am awar of the fact that peopl love car . from the time the human were abl to build airplan and automobil , these dream and the realiz becam the pride of the centuri . the histori of the automobil stand for a turn point for the modern world . poepl design car , and they cherish what they have done to open the market and world for automobil . success exampl such as the volkswagen and the bmw have been the symbol of the glamour of thi industri . therefor , in such a period of time of twenti year , car will still hold the love for million around the world . the number of prodction will onli be steadi , if onli not to increas . secondli , we need the automobil industri to provid job opportun . as a result , as we need thi industri to grow at a steadi pace , we need automobil in our live . imagin thousand of commut board onto the public transportaiton in a singl week . it would not onli be a huge burden for the the transportaiton system , but also affect mani aspect of our live . overal , in the next twenti year , i do not think that there will be fewer car . we need car regardless what the world will becom .
