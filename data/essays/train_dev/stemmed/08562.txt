although i do agre on the fact that student shall understand idea and concept about their particular field of studi , i do n't think that those idea and concept are more import that learn the fact about them . much on the contrari , i think that learn about the fact of a particular field of studi or subject is as import as understand gener or specif idea or concept . actual , the use of appropi inform about certain fact can help the student to better understand the ( sometim veri abstract ) idea , concept or principl of their field of studi . for exampl , a professor can give a lectur about the common featur of all human societi . he can talk about how differ societi , both isol from the other , can develop norm and custom that are strikingli similar . thi is the main idea , or concept for an antropholog of sociolog class . but by show certain fact , the student can better undestand these idea . the teacher can talk about the similar between the myth and legend of nors and celtic peopl which , despit the geograph and chronolog isol between those two group , develop form of see the world around them that are quit similar . anoth exampl that support thi could be found in biolog . you can learn that all live organ share common trait , like cell , dna , protein , and so on . but despit these similar , life in earth is so divers that is actual hard to see how can plant and anim , for explampl , be close relat to each other in ani way . it is by the studi of the fact that student can grasp the fundament concept and idea and better understand them . one can better undestand how plant and anim are relat to each other by , for exampl , watch sampl of each under the microscop , or by perfom chemich analysi of their tissu . the fact relveal by experiment and observ can not onli help understand abstract idea or concept , but it help the student develop new idea and concept , which in turn will be nurtur by new fact . and that 's how knowledg , wheter in the scienc or even the art , grow over time .
