in thi issu that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject , i larg agre with the issu , in other word , i mainli consid that have broad knowledg is much better than just focus on one specif subject . there are some reason whi i support thi assert . first of all , in thi morden and mechan age , i do not think that a person just know onli one specif subject . becaus the human be in a new technolog world , such as internet , media , and mobil phone , we are expos in the explos of inform surround . everi person , if he or she want , can tri to gain inform , like math or chemic , from everywher ; moreov , everyon could be not complet far from everi new inform . besid , almost the mordorn worker or schoolar must know mani aspect of knowledg to use them better in one way , becaus mani compani and reaserch organ need thi kind of peopl . second , for sake of surviv in the morden world , peopl at least have to know new inform for live . peopl could not live too comfort if they do not know how to use comput . for exempl , student have to log in the web of the school to know what program it ha and might regist the final exam by person . if some student is unabl to use internet , he or she must go to offic of school or ask the proffesor about thi problem . in the nutshel , although we still need some specif schoolar to reaserch much detail in one subject , most of peopl can not be just limit by thi statement becaus not everyon could be the great scientist or artist . consequantli , i mainli agre that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject .
