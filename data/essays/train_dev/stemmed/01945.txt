in my opinion , i agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well becas of creat a chanc to be success and possibl of sucess . first of all , if i am do what i were alreadi get use to , i could never get a chace to make a lot of money or to sharpli develop by myself becaus i would think same way and situat . when we see a sucess peopl , they tri sever aspect and a lot of way with the risk . for exampl , i went to a seminar which donald triump open in new york citi two week ago , i heard that onli peopl who catch a good idea and chanc with risk can be sucess . moreov , if i tri to get new thing , i believ i have more percentag of develop . there is an articl press by korea time in 2006 that introduc a man graduat from seoul univers in korea with bechelor degre sell a sandwich and kimbab ( korean sushi ) . he make more than $ 100,000 per a year . therefor , i firmli believ that in order to get new chanc and good idea and grow up my possibl of sucess , i should tri new thing and creativ experi . that is whi i agre with that .
