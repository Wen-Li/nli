if you ask me if advertis make product much better that they realli are , my answer will sure be posit . in my opinion there are a lot of reason to support thi fact . these reason have a featur in common : that advertis are alway base on deceit . first , when you see one product on tv , you see not the real product , but onli a `` visual manipul '' of it . it will alway seem bigger , brighter , better than what it realli is . in order to explain thi , are you realli sure that the famou big mac is realli as `` big '' as it seem ? i do n't think so . so , befor you chose to buy a product , go and see it in realiti . most of the time , it will be a delus . anoth point is the fact that , dure an advertis , there are a lot of `` distract '' . in other word : it is not the product itself what is import , but what is around it . for instanc : haven ' t you notic that , in a lot of advertis , there are a lot of beauti girl or men ? what is the connect between a product to paint gate and a young pretti girl ? so , the advertis remain in our mind not becaus of the product , but becaus of `` other '' factor . the last point is that advertis play on our imagin : we do n't buy the product for what it realli is , but onli for what we believ it is . thi `` imagin factor '' is creat by a combin of the previou mechan , and yet other , that gain their strenght upon other , even unconsci , weak . so the bottom line is , never trust the advertis , becaus they will alway play trick on you .
