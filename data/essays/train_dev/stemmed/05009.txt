i do not think that the best way to travel is with a group led by a tour guid . first , if you limit yourself to the movement and decis of one group , say of peopl from your own countri , you may not be abl to know the local and learn from their worldview and tradit . how mani time have you seen a pack group of tourist interact onli among themselv and think that the guid 's opinion and belief repres the opinion and feel of all the commun ? when visit anoth countri or place , i like melt with the local , meet as mani peopl as i can and learn directli from their everyday actitivi and their own idea . second , you may think that tour guid visit are more inform or convini in term of time and money . howev , truth is that mani time guided-tour are more expens and time consum than individu , self-inform visit . tour guid in costa rica for exampl usual charg excess amount of money to tourist for activ that would not be so expens if done alon or with the help of a local friend . depend on the site you are visit , in a guided-tour you will onli get the inform that ha been includ in the guid 's `` menu '' and , sometim , thi inform may not be as accur as you think . for exampl , in costa rica mani time tour guid are brought from a differ place just becaus they know the languag of the tourist or becaus they have more educ than local . they were not born in the place or citi where they work and , therefor , they frequent do not know all the particular detail of the place or it hidden histori . guided-tour are usual onli offer in certain schedul that may not be the most suitabl for your interest . besid , you may fall into the trap of overplan your trip , and end up stress by the pressur of get up earli to catch the shuttl or have to compli with time-limit break for breakfast , lunch or go to the bathroom . final , in guided-tour you have to follow the pace of the group when walk around the hall of a museum or an old church . if alon , you can stop whenev you want , skip what you consider unimport or just go somewher els . definit , guided-tour and travel in a group is not as fascin as travel on your own , have the time to interact with local , take certain risk that will definit enrich your experi abroad and will give you enough materi to entertain your friend and famili back at home .
