i totallay agre with the statement , that it is better , to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one subject . i did a professin educ as a media design and now i am studi media scienc , polit scienc and cultur scienc , and therefor i can tell from my own experi , that it is veri import today , to have knowledg of a varieti of topic . first of all , my studi show me more than onc , that mani develop , they may be cultur or technic , are connect in some way . so , when you have knowlegd about differ subject , you can develop a much better understand concern the whole situat . what is more is , that a broad educ is veri use for later busi life . today , job are not that restrict and limit anymor . almost everi modern job appli an excel gener knowledg . dure my eduac , for exampl , i had to show creativ skill on the one hand , and mathemat and technic skill on the other hand . studi also show , that few peopl would keep one job for their whole life . there is a certain tendenc , that peopl will have two ore more job dure their lifetim . my mother is a good a exampl for thi develop . first , she did an educ as a nurs . when she becam mother , she stay at home for 10 year . now , back in busi life , she work as an german teacher . all in all i think , i made clear , whi i am convinc that a broad knowleg of variou subject is necessari . the key word for the 21th centuri definetli is flexibl and i think , that univers in particular should support that develop by offer a huge varieti of academ subject .
