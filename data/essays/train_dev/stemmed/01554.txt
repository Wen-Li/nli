it is true that fact could be help sometim . it is for exampl quit good to know some import date of histori or some name of import politican . howev , i complet agre with the statement that it ha a bigger effect for student to understand idea and concept ! there are sever reason whi i think so . one is that if a student realli understand a concept he can adopit it to new issu or circumst . a good exampl is the concept of fieldwork , the basic method in anthropolog . if i had learnt just the fact about that method , for exampl who invent it and so on , i would have had a lot of problem dure my first real fieldwork in cameroon . but becaus i learnt the concept and idea behind , i could adopt it do my specif situat . anoth reason whi i prefer understand concept to learn fact is that dure that process of understand you will made up your own opinion and you will creat your own idea . so understand is an import basi or fundament for further research question or further thought in other area and by the way you will learn all the import fact anyway , i am sure . as a last reason it is just much more interest to learn concept than fact . so all the class and book i have taken or read which were base on concept and idea , i realli love . and i can still rememb the thing and topic written in these book ! but the fact i had to learn for some multipl choic test i forgot the day after . . for all these reason i think it is much more effici and fascin to learn and understand idea and concept on scientif issu dure univers time . and , after all , i think it will be much more use for a further academ or other kind of career .
