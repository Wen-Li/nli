when you travel in a group led by a tour guid you will know the most common place that are import and familiar for most of peopl . thi way of travel ha mani advantag becaus you have all thing plan and you dont have to think on solv certain problem that you could have when travel , like food , hotel and transport to all place you want to see . if you have to get ticket for an import event or show you wiill not have ani problem to get them . besid , you are spend you time with other and you will be safe in case of visit a danger countri . in addit , you will have specif time for everi activ you decid to take and the warranti that you have a safe space in everi transport you need to take . those are the good reason you have for travel in a tour guid . in my case i consid the best way to travel is when you do it by yourself and you plan all place you want to visit and the time you like to spend on everi one . i do not like to be tie to other like when you have to be at specif time at a certain place becaus i think it is better when you are spontan and you act under the circumst . for exampl when you got a place that you realli like if you were in a group you have to do what most of the group want and you are not free to decid what you want to . when visit a differ countri the best way of know it is by go to mani place and not onli to visit the most popular one . if you want to know the real food , the actual econom situat and the most import part , the peopl , you should go to common place not for the tourist but for the peopl that live in the countri . if you want to learn or practic the languag you should go to place where there is no help peopl to do the thing and speak for you in case of need it . in a word , i agre the best way of travel is when you do it by yourself and do the thing you want to without consid ask other peopl and visit onli the popular place that you will not know veri well becaus of time and peopl you are travel with . i do not like tour guid .
