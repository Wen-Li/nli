today , mani student seem to choos to studi more than one major in the univers for certain purpos . to know more than one subject or major can be a benefit for peopl , but i believ that to special in one specif field is a better choic becaus in the long run , more knowledg of divers subject will be benefici to the futur career . in addit , it encourag peopl to think more creativ . to begin with , gener knowledg on everi aspect of academ subject is essenti to perform a job of higher posit and lead peopl in the futur . to be sure , special skill and knowledg help peopl to get better job and give them more abil to achiev what they want in work place or in academ field . howev , as peopl go up to the superior posit , or to take more respons , they will have to see the whole forest , not a singl tree . that mean , without gener knowledg in everi aspect that is relat to the entir goal or process , you will like to get lost in how to manag and lead other peopl in the respect field . in thi sens , peopl need to broaden thier view and thi can be done by studi mani academ subject . furthermor , with their broad knowledg of mani academ subject , peopl are abl to develop their potenti creative-think abil . it is wide know that creativ evolv from variou academ background . for exampl , i have a cousin who studi a lot of subject in the univers . she is major in english literatur , but she also studi on other subject such as music , physic , and golf . thi made her think and act creativ . she won the most innov essay of the univers twice and a lot of professor say that her problem-solv way is alway fresh and new . thi show that mani academ knowledg encourag the creativ . in summari , to have special and profession knowledg on a certain subject may a benefit to peopl , but becaus gener inform will help peopl in the futur and it gener creativ , i agre to have broad knowledg .
