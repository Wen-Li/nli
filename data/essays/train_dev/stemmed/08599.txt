car are indispens for our life sinc they are use veri commonli and sinc they facilit our transport to high extent . even though thi statement is a fact , some peopl still think that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year time . what i think is just the opposit due to two reason . the first reason is that the technolog in twentieth centuri is improv veri fastli that might lead to a decreas in the price of car . as most peopl experinc from comput world , when someth new is introduc into the market , the older one get cheaper and more peopl can have the opportun to buy the older one . i think same situat is also valid for car . sinc mani compani are work on provid car with superior qualiti , the price of some old car , still with realli good properti , will declin and therefor more peopl will be abl to afford to buy a car . the second reason is that there are mani research go on the develop of altern energi sourc for transport other than petrolium , which might provid cheaper fuel for car . as most of you know , nowaday mani car are run on natur ga instead of petrolium make the travel expens much cheaper . thi alreadi lead to the increas in the use of car as i observ . sinc the fuel is becom cheaper , peopl reluct to buy car sinc they do not want to pay huge amount of money for drive will chang their mind . furthermor , some hope research is also go on about the use of hydrogen in transport vehicl which might even further decreas the price of the fuel sinc it is realli an abund element in the world . in conclus , due to some technolog advanc in car product market and hope research about altern energi sourc such as hydrogen for vehicl , which will lead a declin in the price of both the car and the fuel , peopl will tend to buy more car in near futur .
