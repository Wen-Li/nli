`` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . '' that is a statement which i do not necessarili agre with , due to a varieti of reason base on the sheer word of the statement , as wella other issu like the current circumst of individu , their definit of `` enjoy life '' and what activ it involv . the veri first issu that need to be address when discuss thi statement is how we are to characteris the `` young peopl '' and the `` older peopl '' ? doe young mean children , age 1-12 while older is abov that ? or doe young includ all pre-adult and older includ those beyond 21 ? the term `` young '' and `` older '' are veri subject and therefor greatli limit the credibl of thi statement . in order to be as precis as possibl , for the purpos of thi respons , let us assum that young peopl fall into the age bracket of one to twenti nine year of age , while older peopl are abov thirti . the pleasur involv with enjoy life for young and older peopl vari tremend , base on the stage of life in which they are . for instanc , a child could deriv immens pleasur from spend a day on the beach , simpli build sand castl . on the other hand , an older person could deriv even more pleasur from drive a million dollar sportscar . how can we measur the rel enjoy receiv ? therefor , without be abl to do so , it is imposs to make a claim that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . it is possibl to argu that in gener , the pleasur of the young are more simpl and pure as they tend to be carefre , with littl respons , especi when compar to older peopl who probabl have job to go to everi morn and a famili to support . look at it from thi angl make it seem like young peopl have the better life . howev , anoth way to look at it is that at a younger age , peopl tend to have more restrict place on them , like parent rule , school code etc , while adult or older peopl are free from such restrict , to a certain extent , which give them unlimit access to enjoy . older peopl also tend to have stronger financi capabl that enabl them to enjoy mani perk of life that youngster do not have access to or can not typic afford . therefor , for the abov state reason , i can not agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl becaus that involv have to make mani assumpt which are unrealist . it all depend on the individu himself/herself , the circumst in which they live , their like , dislik , their person trait and so on . a child could enjoy hi life just as much as an fifti year old adult . there is no limit that can control such a feel and so agre with the statement is complet out of the question .
