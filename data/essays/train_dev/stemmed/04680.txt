i strongli disagre with the statment which suggest that young peopl nowadi do not give enough time to help and aid their commun , becaus young peopl are current much educ and orient than other young peopl who live in the past due to the advanc in all field of educ , technolog , social servic and becuas of the emerg of the activ social chariti and commun all over the globe . young peopl nowaday repres a major part of the commun , and they are awar of how hard and difficult maintain a good life can be , they are notic how the crime level is escal severli , and how there are an increas in the number of homeless children , and that a lot of peopl are not reciev good health servic . all of these mention exampl will caus young peopl to be scare and forc them to ask question like : - how might we surviv through all thi ? - is what i am se now will happen to me or to the peopl whom u love ? - what wait us next ? well , by ask all these question , anoth one come in mind and that question is : `` what can i do to make thi place a better one ? '' and the answer right away will be : '' act now '' . young peopl can do a lot of thing , for instanc they can particip in social activit , they can voulent in commun and chariti which are direct to promot and encourag peopl life , other can enrol in program that focu on environ preserv . i truli believ that young peopl can and will be of great help , yet we must provid space for them express themselv , and provid them with all the mean neccessari to ensur the integr of their work becaus , sometim the problem lie in us , that is adult in realli understand what young peopl can do , therefor we must quit the idea that these young can not do ani good , becaus they can .
