in my opinion , i agre that it is better to have broad knowldeg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . thi is not onli becaus the gener we live is an infrom bomb gener , but also becaus if we can have broad knowldeg of mani academ subject we can see thi world in differ way . accord to some data , there are thousan of new inform creat everi second , that is whi we feel time is lost so quickli . though we ca n't read or experi everi new creation , we still need to tri , otherwis , we wo n't get up with the world . take my mother for exampl , she is a principl of junior high shcool , she is not veri good at the new technic materi . everi time she want to add a new cell phone number into her cell phone , she need ask me to help her . one day , she had to manag a new shool , and she would like to make a websit to introduc her new school . i think she work veri hard on thi , and then she made it . she made a veri beauti and praticl websit on her own ; of cours she ask mani peopl for thi . after thi event , i admir her more over . on the other hand , my father is a teacher , too . two year ago , he retir , and final he could go back to farm as he wich . compar with my mother , he rather grow some veget than to learn new techon . until now , he ca n't do someth with the comput by himself , although he alway say he would like to do that , and of cours it never happen . i do n't mention that my father is useless , but if he could tri and learn more about new subject , i think hi life will be easier and independ . i know there mayb some peopl think that it is enough for us to special in one specif subject , but i suggest them to look forward to the real world . we can find new thing everi day , and we should handl those new thing , either . if we would like to have a variou kind of life , it is better to have broad knowldeg of mani academ subject .
