i disagre with the statement . young peopl have hard time love their life becaus of the stage of adolesc . on the other hand , older peopl spend their live as they want to becaus they are far more experienc than the young . i am a teenag , and i have seen a lot of my friend struggl in their live becaus they do not know what they should be do . also , thi is the time of adolesc where mani teenag view the world differ from adult or children , and often becom too emot or revolt . for exampl , when i first enrol in my high school , i wa veri depress . thi wa becaus i kept believ that school wa a place where young peopl my age were be measur by the grade that they receiv . as i kept think that thi wa a horrid idea of recogn one individu as good or bad , i found anger in my self , and i could not enjoy my life . i also did not know what field i want to persu my career in , so i wa veri confus and pressur . i think thi time of my life wa a time of struggl becaus i wa quit young and did not have enough experi in life to make import decis . be young mean learn about life and go through differ emot . young poepl suffer intern and thi is whi i believ that young peopl do not alway enjoy life more than older peopl . my grandpar are one exampl of whi i think that elder enjoy life more than that of the young one . sinc my grandpar are both retir from their job , they have plenti of leisur time to spend . my grandpar travel everi month to differ place in the world . sinc they have earn enough money in their younger year , my grandpar are abl to entertain themselv more than other . also , they have more life experi , which mean that my grandpar are abl to figur out what is the most fun and benefiti to themselv . like thi , i believ that older peopl can live a free life , do whatev take them to be happi . young peopl often have to go through difficulti in their live , such as find their true talent , peer pressur and worri on how they will surviv in the `` real '' world . on the other hand , older peopl can live a relax life do what they find the most joy in . they also have more experi in live , so they are wiser and know what is best for them . therefor , i believ that older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl .
