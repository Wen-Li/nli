i total disagre with the statement that `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' i strongli feel that thi statement is be made by a novic person who actual do n't refer to the weekli report and tabloid as publish by the bussi sector regularli . now a day a car signifi much more thing than to be a mere vehicl to carri out the routin transport . it ha becom an indespens commod like televis and telephon . as compar to the primit era , now a day peopl keep more than one car at their dispos mark seper for their well defin purpos . becaus of the rapid expans in bussi sector , the increas distanc do n't actual matter ani more for the work class . there are major of peopl who are work at the compani locat at quit a larg distanc . in that case , they prefer take their privat vehicl such as car , for commut . it make them feel more comfort and save their time as well . as recent be conclud through a survey , most of the peopl feel that owe a car is alway a better deal than owe a two wheeler as the former is more safe and secur . accord to few , car are alway faster than ani other two wheeler and comfort also . one can drive them in almost ani climat condit . they are also less subject to the uncondit accid such as slippag and skid . it also help them to avoid irrit pollut on the way . some peopl also consid car as their statu symbol . the larger the car , the higher recoginit they can manag to beg in the societi . in my own societi i could see that there were mere 20 car five year back . but now the situat ha come up to the extent that the park place can be seen alway flood , with car of almost all type be park all over . the recent boom in the manufactur sector ha bless us with the advanc of the technolog . the spare part are now avail at much cheaper rate than ever . the car manufactur compani are also devis mani way to produc econom car which can be afford by almost everi sector of the societi . such car consum less fuel and are special desingn keep in mind the gener ergonom for peopl drive everi day . with all such effort in place , i realli do n't feel that the number of car in use will go to declin in the year to come . rather we would be abl to see some realli sophist and less resourc intens model on the road in the come year . last but not the least , i feel that the statement is simpli base on the subject knowledg and lack the pragmat approach consider .
