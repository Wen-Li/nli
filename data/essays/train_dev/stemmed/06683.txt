some peopl think it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject while other think it is better to focu on one specif subject . i do think it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject for two differ reason . first , student who studi more than one academ subject are abl to understand better the world around them . they will have a more open mind view . they will be abl to talk with differ type of peopl . howev , it is import to notic that it is sometim veri hard to studi two veri differ subject at the same time . in addit , you are sometim prevent by your colleg to pick up two subject . it is whi i do think that the idea of broad curriculum introduc in some univers is a veri good one . last year , i studi law and wa grant the right to pick up one subject of busi . it wa definit a good thing becaus my busi class help me to underdand my commerci law class . second , in a lot of job nowaday , you need more than one qualif . for instanc , one of my friend studi engin and busi at school . he is now the head of the sell divis of an electr compani thank to hi doubl diploma . as far as my concern , i work part time in a properti develop compani . thi type of compani is a perfect exampl of a job where you need the knowleg of mani academ subject such as engin , busi and law . you are face with the writ of contract ( law ) , the financ of oper ( busi ) and sometim a lot of problem relat to the plan or the construct of the build . to conclud , it is veri import to have a broad knowledg of mani acaedm subject becaus of the differ type of problem we will have to face .
