most adverti that compani made for themselv look realli good and perfect conduct for everi consum . howev , consum have experienc that conduct , they alway made bad compliment about their conduct that they had alreadi use becaus of too much expect about conduct . howev , i agre the reason that whi most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are to consum . there are two reason . the first reason of most advertis emphas much better than they realli are is appeal to consum . if compani want to appeal to their consum , they have to make a kind of ` fantasi ' to them about their product . if they do n't do that and they say about the truth , that could n't appeal their consum ' market at all . in addit , if consum heard just truth , they would think about their product as just normal other thing . then , it can be same thing like other product . there are no differ . therefor , for use some fantasi about their product , it would be a good way to appeal their consum and market . the second reason of most advertis look better than they realli are is about their goal . natur the most import thing in each compani is about their goal that sell their product as much as possibl . when the compani make some advertis , they have to think a new and creativ way to sell . on advertis , most compani have to show onli good side about their product to consum . therefor , consum might think that compani make fun of their consum . howev , that is not true . in conclus , it is the onli way to appeal and sell their product to consum for show much better thing than they are . when consum are see some commerci and they think '' wow , that is go to be realli use ! i want to have it ! '' . i think that the conduct is readi to be sold . that commerci is realli good . the last my think about commerci is that commerci is made for ` cheat ' to consum .
