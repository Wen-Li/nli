first of all , i strongli disagre the idea of young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i am think that older peopl could enjoy their life . evid , young peopl are busi to prepar their futur life . special , after start school , they spend the most of time to studi and learn skill . also , they have a lot of question of real life as they are grow and tri to figur out the problelm through talk with friend or parent . they could enjoy life to spend time with friend but thi is not enjoy . i would like to say that is one of learn how to stand between peopl in our societi . some young peopl are not like that i mention in abov . they are just spend time for fun . they do not think about their futur . howev , in thi case is not onli for all of young gener . on the other hand , older peopl could enjoy their life . they have comfort time and money . older peopl who have a career on their job and good health , of caurs they can do . also , it cuold be good model to young gerner . even my parent usual have a short trip togeth on weekend . when i see them , i am veri envi them and i could have a chanc to think about my life . there are mani kind of way to enjoy life and everyon do . i support that mani older peopl do comfort enjoy life .
