it is n't difficult to me to answer thi question becaus i have thought sinc i wa a child the same thing . accord to my own experi i 'm sure that the better way to creat and improv my student career and first of all my person is to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . i refus the idea that the best way is to special in one specif subject . i 've grown up into an academ system that ha alway gave me all the chanc to learn about everyth i 've want . dure these year i spent a lot of time to read about a larg amount of materi as scientif paper , historian one , literarian one and much more . i think that for a person with a broad knowledg is easier to find job , to creat relationship with other peol , to follow the most part of televis , paper , and book discuss . moreov if you do n't close ani door on your back you can alway come back and start with anoth subject . by the way i trust that also is import to special in one specif subject , becaus nowaday the world of work requir more and more specialist worker . for exampl i 'm attend a cours of biomed engin and i know that the societi want to hire person special the deepest as possibl . and the world of scienc is not the onli one ; also in econom field there is a great special . the univers are follow thi way of learn propos a larg number of special cours . in conclus it could be seem a contradict but for me the two idea are relat : i believ that befor is more import for a student to have broad knowledg of mani academ subbject , and then , onli at a second moment , to special into specif one .
