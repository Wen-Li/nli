the success of a person is onli measur on a just way by himself . if it is not a person prioriti to live in luxuri but with knowledg we ca n't assum he is not success if he doe not have a big hous and a big suv . we can acknowledg that he ha had success in hi life becaus he reach hi goal . even so , it is my belief that peopl that succeed in their goal are peopl that have to , on some circumst , take the risk and play their chanc to what they believ in . if you do onli what you know what to do well , you will onli do what you were taught . and you wo n't stand out from the rest and succeed if you do onli what everyon doe . peopl follow pattern in their everyday live . mani even have routin and feel secur with them , but the key to succeed in life is to take risk when you have to and play to your strenght . not everyon is the same in attitud and experi , but the fact that someon ha knowledg and inform equal to that which we possess is a possibl , the differ come to what we decid to do with what everyon know and what make you special . when we tri to leav possit mark in the world and it inhabit day by day , we are succeed on a level of moral fiber and charact . then , that kind of success will translat into a seri of event that lead to what we chose when we decid what we would do with our live . it hard to fail and believ that we have not succed , we are forc to believ that becaus we fail some prototyp imprint to us by someon or someth , but if we are realli whole and concient peopl , we will see that to fail to ourselv is the onli way to fail in life . money , fame and women are n't success unless you want to think so that way . media give us a vision of of what is accord to them a true success life , but it is we who make the choic of what to believ . success innov , success creat , but more than anyth , success give you peac and interior calm .
