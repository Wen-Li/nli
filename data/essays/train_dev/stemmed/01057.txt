i agre with the statement that understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact . for three reason . the first reason whi i agre is understand idea and concept is more import than just learn the fact is accord to my experi . when i wa 10th grade i hate math that is becaus i am not good at math . i just memor the fact but i did not know whi the answer is . but , when i wa 11th grade , my math teacher said that i have to know the idea and concept to do well in the math . from then , i did not memor the fact , instead , i studi the idea and concept . after the few month , i becam to do well in math . accord to my experi , i think understand idea and concept is more import . second , to understand idea and concept we have to think long , patient . dure thi process we can learn the fact automat and we will not forget the fact . and dure the process , to understand idea and concept , it will make us to think more flexibl . and make us more logic . and the last as we understand idea and concept we can understand the fact more . beacus , understand idea and concept may make us to think more flexibl and more logic , may we make us tounderstand the fact more and accord to my experi i agre with the statement that understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact .
