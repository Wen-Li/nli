nowaday advertis occupi a central posit in our life . some person beliv strongli in it , instead ani other are sure that it can produc neg effect in the qualiti of our life . in my opinion advertis make product seem much better than they are in the realiti , and so in the follow paragraph i tri to explain my point of view . when we watch televison or when we walk to the street , we can easi see adversti ; they talk about food , for instanc , or cloth , car , bank servic etc . . in all these situat the object , or the product , appear beauti , confort and in same case chip , nethereless when we decid to buy one of them we have a surpris . for exampl , the last year i saw a beauti photographi machin in a televis advertis , it seem veri small , easi to use and with a lot of differ function . in thi way , i convinc my boyfriend to buy thi model becuas i thought it wa an incred occas , infact the price is not so high in relat wiht the qualiti . the day after he decid to buy thi photographi machin , and unfortun my boyfriend and i , use it , understand that it use not so good . the same situat happen when we buy a food onli for the fact that it is present in a particular way in the advertis ; for exampl , the advertis use a specif enviroment , color or situat to expain the caracterist of the food , and as a consequ we immidi decid to buy it . to sum up the adertisemnt make product seem more differ and much better or more cheap than they are in the realiti , and so we note the differer unfotun onli when we decid to buy it , i think it is not right !
