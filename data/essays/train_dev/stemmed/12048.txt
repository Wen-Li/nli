in my sens it is better to special in one spesif subject in a globalis renov and invent world name in today 's world as an exper in a specif subject . twentieth and thi centuri have been the lead centuri in technolog enhanc and progress . so much inform is be circul so fast that sometim it is veri difficult to fallow up the develop . in suzh an environ it is more use and effici for person to specialis in a specif topic and improv himself in thi field . to me we have to special sinc thi is the onli way to go in thi centuri . just give an exampl you can not go to a doctor specialis in the heart ill for a headach you are suffer . the veri broad rang of field in medicin requr doctor to special in one of those field . we can consid thi requir for all of other scienc name social scienc math and etc . .. while you have the oppurtun to examin detail from mani aspect of view in one subject it is veri hard to do thi if you care about the all matter . and have thi oppurtun will contribut the effici and product of the studi . by special in one subject one gain the confid to carri out new research and he/sh is encoureg with new find . on the other hand a close cooper among the field of studi is necessari to yile fruit result . sinc some subject are interrel and have veri close tie with eachoth we need to achiv thi cooper in order to have more advanc result . final i beleiv it is better to have an expertis in one subject . thi is not a choic but an obligatori situat in today 's world . morov some sort of effici mechan must be promot to establish connect among the relat subject .
