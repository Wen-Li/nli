i total agre that most advertis often make product seem and sound better than the actual are . there are meani reason whi adevertis seem that way . first , becaus those product maker want to target and attract the biggest amount of peopl , they will tri their best to `` putifi '' their product by use color and mainli by use attract word . mostli the will use word and expressin like `` 99 % gurante , '' and '' it will chang your life '' . one good exampl of a product the use color attract word if a beauti product call `` aveeno '' . on it written , `` recomend by dermatologiest . it will make , not it make , your skin veri soft , it will whiten it and will give you a beauti skin for a life long . '' my wife have been use thi product for a preiod of few year and i never notic ani chang . asecond reason is that dvertis use tricki and mislead word like `` help '' , and `` aim '' or 99.99 % , never 100 % . by use these word , they make their product more convenc to the custom and consum , especi hopeless peopl who tri other product , but did not get ani posit result , will run after thrie product . as an exampl , i have been complain of teeth [ problem for few year and i tri differ kind of toothpast . i wa attract by one of those kind call call `` crest senstiv '' . i use thi product for a long time , but my teeth never get better unti i wa seen by a dentist who clarifi to me that the use of a toothpast may help in some xcase but not in all . after he examin my teeth he said that i had a bad infect which can not be treat mere with ani of the tooth past brand . instead he said i need to have a clinic treatment at differ session . my visit to the dentist confirm that product advetis use fake and mislead word which do not give enough inform to the custom . to conclud , in the field of advertis and promot , advertis use color word and express , fake and mislead word and umproven fact just for the sake of attract custom and consum and sell the biggest amount and make more money .
