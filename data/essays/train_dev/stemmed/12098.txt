to know and how much to know , that is the question i alway defin my gener as base on the lyric of a brazilian pop song of the 80 which said , `` i know a littl about almost everyth , and almost everyth i know badli '' . on my day and age , a popular teenag would have to know about a vast array of topic , rang from boy georg to the cure , not leav asid shakespear . of cours , these are not exactli academ subject , so an academ knowledg of boy georg would not be necessari , but we would have to at least have heard of him . shakespear , howev , is not onli part of the academi , but also of a canon . would it be better , then , to know everyth about the bard and all of hi forti play , or to know a few vital fact about him and still have time to studi orwel , huxley , nabokov , saling , woolf , twain and steinbeck , not to mention less canon author ? it 's hard to say , sinc there are advantag and disadvantag to each approach . one obviou con to have a broad knowledg of sever subject is that thi knowlegd will eventu becom superfici . lack of time will make it imposs to dedic too much attent to one subject , and it treatment might be shallow and futil . on the other hand , know mani subject will sure enhanc our convers skill in social gather . let 's just say that know macbeth superfici wo n't be enough to write a thesi on the play , but it might impress some friend at a parti . it depend on the situat . although i do n't have a fix opinion on thi subject , i 'm more inclin to have broad knowledg about mani topic than mere know one topic exhaust . in school at least , we have to be introduc to mani academ subject , for how will we know where to choos from and what interest to pursu if we onli , say , know algebra ? as we go deeper and deeper into our studi , howev , we will inevit have to narrow down our interest , and dedic more time to fewer subject , even run the `` risk '' of becom specialist . nevetheless , as much as i love shakespear , dedic all my academ exist to him and him onli would give me the impress of miss someth .
