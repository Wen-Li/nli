i think that it depend on what is the field of the academ subject you are studi . if the acadm subject is about scienc or other similar subject which need some profession knowledg , that will need to special in the specif subject . if the academ subject is about educ , bussi or other similar subject , that will need to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . in my concentr , educ , i think i need the broad knowledg of academ subject . to have broad knowledg of a lot of subject is veri import in studi educ . teach ha a lot of work to do . if you want to make the learner understand what you are talk about , you will need to explain . but if you know less , how can you make your learner understand what you want to talk about ? the onli way to solv the problem is to tri to explain in mani differ way until your learner can know what you are talk about . that is whi you need to have broad knowledg . becaus when you know more , you can teach more and you can make more peopl understand what you want to talk about . in other hand , if your subject is in those subject which need profession knowledg , it is better to speclial in one specif subject . take scienc as an exampl : if you are studi the molecular biolog , you need mani profession knowledg about biochemistri or molecular biolog . if you can know more , you will studi more . that will need more specif knowledg to make you learn more . that is the reason you need to keep on studi specif knowledg . to get the conclus , my opinion of thi topic is that it depend on what kind of subject you are studi . if the subject you are studi need to explain or combin other knowledg , you will need to learn more from other subject . but if your subject need the profession knowledg , you would better to keep on studi more in your specif knowledg . that is the onli way to help to learn more and better .
