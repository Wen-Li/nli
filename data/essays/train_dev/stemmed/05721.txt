it ha been rightli said , `` littl knowledg is a danger thing , drink deep or tast not the pierian spring , there small draught intox the brain , while drink larg sober us again ! '' inde , i believ that instead of limit kowledg to small draught of one subject , it is much more benefici to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject just like drink larg from the pierian spring . if we special in one subject , our knowledg is contain onli within the narrow boundari of that subject while the vast ocean of truth lie undiscov befor us . we becom ignor about other impot thing that we need to know in order to attain a high level of intellig and understand . by special in one subject , we tend to forget that there are million of other possibl in store for us , that there is so much knowleg to gain in thi world and so littl time . with a broad knowledg or sever thing , we widen our vision and expand our horizon . we realiz that we have mile to go befor we sleep . broad knowleg enlighten us about the vast of thi univers and make us awar that even if we spend out entir lifetim gain knowledg , there will still be thousand of thing that we are ignor about . anoth import fact is that variou aspect of knowledg are relat to one anoth . without be awar of other subject , knowledg of our own subject becom constrict and we tend to have a narrow mind approach toward thing . moreov , if fact are brick , accumul of fact is as much knowledg as a pile of brick is a hous . we need to know what is go on around us to put our knowledg to good use . also , practic speak , what use is speacial in one subject in our daili live ? is a ph . d in microbiolog go to help us cope with the obstacl of everyday life ? onli awar of everi branch of academ can enabl us to practic gain benefit . so , it is my firm opinion that one should tri to learn as much as possibl in thi short life given to us . i , person , would prefer to be a jack of all trade rather than a master of just one .
