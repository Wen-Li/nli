dure the last year , we have seen a big differ in the way of life of all peopl . a lot of event have occur dure the 19th , like the world war , the develop of capit , the conflict of religion etc . .. and all of that have modifi our societi in franc , or in other countri . i will take for my exempl the situat in franc . what happen in may 68 have contribut to chang peopl mind . befor thi period , young peopl were more obedi and structur in my opinion . moreov , i think that they were gener less individualist than today . capit have develop that feel and the consequ of all that is the fact that young peopl are obses by their individu success becaus time are more and more difficult and peopl know that it will be certainli more difficult in the futur . so young peopl are pressur and they are conscient that they have to succeed . they work harder at school or they have two job like i can see around me , and they have less time to make anyth . to resum , i think there are two princip caus : one becaus young peopl are nowaday more individualist and do n't think in help other person , two becaus they have less time due to the new social model . howev , we can see in a few situat that young peopl are abl to help everyon that is in a difficult situat . for exampl , dure the tsunami , we have seen a lot of young peopl give a gift to la croix roug or other associ . mani of them have express the desir to go there to help peopl who were reach . in fact , we can see that these young peopl can help their commun when there is an accid . so we can say that it 's ponctual and they g can give the best of them at certain moment . but i think too that these type of popul do n't make enough effort to help other peopl who need their help .
