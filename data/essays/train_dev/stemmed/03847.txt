`` jack of all trade and master of none '' . well ye ! i total agre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i look at eductaion as primarili an aid to better live , enrich live of the recipi with it vast and vari databas . life itself can not be compartmentalis into few specif . it is actual the amalgam of a wide gamut of experi , problem , oppurtun , success , failur , emot , relationship and the like . thu , to deal with such a vast rang of thing definit requir some sort of formal educ about the broad featur of variou academ subject . for exampl , for a home-mak , to success run and manag the hous , onli an educ in basic cook or rather the home-sci is not enough . he/sh need also to be equip with the broad detail of mathemat , econom , social scienc , etc. to be abl to better execut the respons at hand . further i believ that knowledg of divers domain promot the all-round develop of an individu . the person is much better awar of the socio-polit factor affect him and hi surround and is abl to make inform decis about hi life in particular and the societi in gener . on the other hand , a specialist in a particular field might find it quit challeng to deal with issu that are beyond hi domain . thi will put him at a great disadvantag as compar to the other generalist in hi surround . in term of interperson relationship also , the specialist find it quit difficult to relat to peopl who are not from their field of studi . on the other hand , have be expos to a broad spectrum of topic , the generalist find it quit comfort to get along with even radic differ peopl . thi help in strengthen their contact and improv their commun skill . lastli i feel that sinc we have onli one life to live , we must make the most of it and fill up our live with as mani possibl experi that we may perciev so that we may not have ani regret on have miss out on anyth in life .
