car are the most common mean of transport now-a-day especi in citi where reach the destin in time is of utmost prioriti . the number of car use is alway increas with the increas in popul . but , i strongli believ that after twenti year , the number of car use will be much less than those be use now . as the number of car use keep increas , the amount of air pollut caus by them will also be on the rise . thi will caus global warm as a result of which , there would be mani coastal area that will be submerg in the year to come . i feel that thi will caus an awar among the peopl and will encourag them to use public mode of transport in order to reduc the number of vehicl caus pollut . anoth reason that i feel would result in a decreas in the number of car use is that the increas traffic would caus big delay in reach the destin . the onli feasibl solut that i see for the traffic problem is the reduct in the number of vehicl . widen of road might help to some extent in solv the traffic problem , but beyond a limit it is not of much use . i feel that as a result of thi , peopl will be forc to voluntarili give up the use of car inord to meet their requir on time . apart from all these reason , i also feel that there is a lot of risk associ with car journey . as an effect of thi , more and more peopl might opt for rel safer mean of transport like the train . furthermor , in most of the case the train can be reli upon to take us to the destin on time . thi is one of the primari reason for the increas use of local train in citi where peopl are in a hurri to reach their offic , school etc . . final , i wish to conclud state that the abov mention reason are clear indic that there could be fewer car use in twenti year when compar to those be use now .
