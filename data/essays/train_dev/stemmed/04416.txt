school is a veri import social structur where student can form their mind thank to the inform given by teacher . usual teacher believ that the exposit of fact is the most import part of what is call `` didact '' . they expect pupil to learn the fact and to repeat them exactli in the same way the teacher taught them . thi cleali creat a kind of disfunct of learn in the student who ha to learn mere fact . accord to me the best way to improv both teach and learn is the use of fact as the materi support of a new element : the elabor of idea and concept deriv from those fact . obvious it is also import to learn , sometim also by heart , some specif fact , but what doe matter is the abil to search and to find the sens of a fact . peopl usual believ that learn fact is more import than elabor them becaus peopl suppos that those fact carri the so call `` truth '' . unfortun the truth is not given one time forev , truth depend on who is speak , name think . the mere exposit of fact is not a guarante of truth . student should learn that idea are more import than fact : for exampl is more import to understand the deep reason that caus the two world war rather then the day in which they start . it is clear that also the histor fact are import but they are senseless without a specif interpret and knowledg of the idea . idea and concept are what move the world , they are at the basi of what we defin ideolog . everi societi is base on a specif ideolog which is , properli , the melt pot of the idea and of the concept that creat that specif societi .
