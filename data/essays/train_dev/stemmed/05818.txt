i complet agre with the statement ` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . ' there are so mani exampl that prove thi statement to be true . i am take a psycholog class at my school and we actual had an assign about thi . we had to bring an advertis to class out of a magazin or newspap that repres a product . advertis are alway exagger to be better than they actual are . peopl advertis their product in order to sell it . it is a busi and no busi will be success without posit feedback . of cours , if the product seem good , peopl are go to want to buy it . the advertis that i brought into class wa a cigarett ad . i found it on the back of a magazin lie around at school . the cigarett brand wa `` kool . '' the ad show a young man laugh and seem happi . he wa hold a trumpet trumpet in one hand while hold a cigarett in the other . thi advertis made cigarett seem much better than they realli are . everyon know that cigarett are bad for your health and are in gener just disgust , but ad like these make peopl think twice . anoth exampl of make product look better than they trueli are , are food product . mani food compani that produc the same food as anoth compani , will compet with that compani . both food compani will have to make their food look better and sound better than that of the other compani 's . these advertis will start pop up everywher like on tv . advertis like these are found everywher you go . when you are at home , you will se advertis on tv or receiv it in the mail . when you are walk through the citi , you will see poster hang on the side of the street or on the side of a bu . peopl can not get away from it , which is good for the busi , but bad for the peopl . peopl will automat be attract to certain product that seem veri good on an advertis .
