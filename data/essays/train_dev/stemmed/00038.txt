for the follow reason , i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first , use car will be more conveni in twenti year . for exampl , when i wa a univers student at a hitotsubashi univers in 1995 , i went to hokkaido , which ha mani natur park in japan , by my friend ken 's car . becaus the car had no car navig system , which show the map where we were automat , ken and i had a troubl to find the road we should go . howev , now most car in japan ha car navig system . we come to know the road easili . although now we are not abl to see the map about all over japan , in the twenti year we will be abl to see it . use car will be clearli more conveni in twenti year . second , a lot of more safeti car will be made in twenti year . for exampl , now in japan , where i live , there are more than ten thousand traffic accid annual . last year , one of my cousin , kumiko , who wa six year old , came across a traffic accid and becaus she ran into the road in order to catch a ball she drop . the car driver , mr. suzuki wa not abl to stop immedi when he found her becaus it wa suddenli . if the car coul have stop automat , he coul have avoid the accid . now i hear the news that car compani are tri to make safeti car that can stop immedi when someon or someth suddenli appear in front of the car . i believ these car will be made and use in twenti year becaus we will not have to be anxiou about traffic accid . a lot of more safeti car will be definit made in twenti year . therefor , i strongli disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
