today , we tend to prefer chang lifestyl , tri new thing and take risk rather than hold on to what we have and what we alreadi know . but think about it , i believ that it is sometim worth the pain to stay with what what we alreadi know . take risk can inde be seen as the better way to live one 's life strongli . it is the best way to avoid a bor life , for exampl wake up everi morn , fourti yer along , to go to the same place , work with the same poepl . it is clearli more appeal to decid one day to becom a teacher , becaus you alreadi know everyth bee a doctor could bring to your life . thi viewpoint allow you to feel adventur and to have , mayb , sever life in one life . howev , i would like to defend my point thet sometim hold to what we alreadi have is more respons , more interest , and can lead you to a happier life . it appear to me that it is better to deepen one 's knowledg in a particular field than to tri to know everyth . for instanc , one should rather concentr on a specif field of studi than tri to tempt everyth becaus he want to tri new thing . it is better , then , to tri to make the thing we alreadi have work well than to escap each time we feel ennoy . i believ that thi is a valu peopl are tend to loos today in our societi , and thi may be an explain for the spectacular increas of divorc . to conclud , i think that we are too often tempt to escap from what we have , while we should rather hold on and tri our best to make the thing we alreadi have work .
