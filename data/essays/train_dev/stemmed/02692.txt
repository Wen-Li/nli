i disagre with the statement that it is better to have broad knoledg of mani acadam subject than spesial one . one of the most imoprt thing is time factor , so spend much time on one subject we will me good and master at the subject . for exampl , in the higher level educ univers offer onli in perticular subject rather than on prefer in more subject . broad knoledg will keep a person in the top in the posit and everi problem regad that will be solv by the person . speacial acadam subject will produc more bettr resulet , when the person is more intrest in that subject . for examl , in the school some peopl get good mark in the perticul subject when compar to the other subject , at thi time we will encourag him in hi intrest subject rather than other . in later year he will be master at the subject and will take research in the field he will discov more intrest result in that area . let 's take an exampl from the hestori of math , great mathamatician pythagar , in hi school day he alway preffer to solv math problem to that of other subject like social , scienc . after few year he becam a great mathametician , thi is truli becaus of hi broad knoledg in that perticul subject . from , thi examl we can say that the perticul subject should hi intrest subject . so , from the sever reason and exampl we can conclud that it better to have broad knoledg in one subject .
