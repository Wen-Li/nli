i agre with the idea that youn peopl enjoy life more than older do . as one of the young peopl , i think it is true . i think enjoy life mean enjoy do thing they like to do . in term of it , younger peopl have advantag when it come to enjoy thing becaus of number of opportun and physic abil . first of all , young peopl have more oportun and much time to do thing . sinc they are young , they have more year till their death if here we just think of averag life span . they can do whatev they want to tri and they can tri it again if they like it and never have to do it if they hate it . older peopl need to think about what they can do dure rest of their life and it might discourag them to do everyth they want to do . know that they have limit time left to enjoy , older peopl might be too nervou to tri thing . young peopl do not care about it , so they can enjoy thing more . second of all , whenev someon doe someth , he need to think about hi physic abil . for older peopl , they tend to have more physic problem and deseas than younger peopl do . for exampl , my grandpar love to travel around the world but they can not do that anymor in these day becaus of their bodi problem . it is veri easi for them to be tire and stress out by go somewher by plane and by stay hotel in countri they do not understand languag . also , it is hard to recov from that . in contrast , younger peopl have stronger bodi and physic abil that can get over such tire and stress . they can do their favorit thing more often than older peopl do . in conclus , i believ that young peopl make their life more enjoyn than older peopl do . they have longer time to do thing and stronger physic condit to tri thing they like than older do . such unchangen situat make me sure that young peopl enjoy .
