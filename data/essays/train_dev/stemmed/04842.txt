regard the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' i think it depend on the situat and the countri or place where you are go . travel deal with a lot of thing like : languag , cultur , natur , weather , kind of inhabit , avail time , etc. and for everi case it coulb a differ oppinion about the statement . for instanc if i 'm in china probabl i will prefer to be guid by a skill tour guid , otherwis anybodi can get lost , but if i 'm go to an european countri in that case i will prefer to go on my own . time is also import if you have littl time for travel then an experienc guid will be veri heplful to know as much as possibl in short time . regard group , if you are with a group where you do n't know anybodi it will be veri differ experi if you know all of the peopl in the group veri well , like in a footbal team or schoolmat . on the other hand , if your intent is to know new peopl in the place you are visit , then travel alon it could be an advantag . other import factor to consid is the reason or the final intent of the travel . for instanc , if you are travel to rest and be away of nois , to have a time for yourself or , on the contrari , you are will to know new place , peopl and citi . in both case , the group or the guid is a big differ . as explain , it is necessari to take a lot of thing into account befor to agre or disagre with such gener statement , but if i have the oppotun to travel , i will prefer to go to europ in a group and without tour guid , in thi case i do n't agre with the statement .
