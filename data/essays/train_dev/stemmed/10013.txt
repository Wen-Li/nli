i am in complet agreement with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . although there are , of cours , except to thi situat as with all other aspect of life , it appear quit clear to me that in gener , youngster these day simpli do not have the time nor the interest to engag in commun work . youngster these day may not be requir to plough the field and run the famili busi as in olden day , but that doe not necessarili translat into a sudden increas of free time . as technolog advanc , youngster suddenli find themselv in an increasingli competit world , where everi skill , everi achiev is of the utmost import . suddenli go to school is not enough ; student are pressur into score better than their peer , and thi is achiev through send youngster to cram school . learn how to play the piano or danc ballet may have been a privileg in the past , but thi is not so now . all these `` extra '' skill have becom commonplac - even necessari to ensur that one will not `` lose out '' in the long run . thi is where all the `` free time '' ha gone to - tri to surviv . there are no more weekend ; onli endless `` option '' class to go to . is it a wonder that young peopl nowaday do not appear to have enough time to help their commun ? anoth reason is pure apathi . young peopl are gener more self-cent than adult . thi is probabl becaus we are all , in gener , pamper from the time we were born until well into our adolesc . henc , youngster , yet to face the harsh realiti of life , are inevit more narcissist and fail to see how the welfar of `` other peopl '' is of ani concern to them . to them `` the commun '' is someth adult should manag and worri about . these youngster may read about the ongo problem of their commun in the paper everyday and still regard it all as happen in an unrel place far , far away . parent are partli to blame in thi matter . by pressur their children to be an overachiev in school , they have fail to instil the right amount of compass and empathi in them . instead , children are brought up look at life in term of reward . get good grade at school and mommi or daddi will give them a shini new bike . so when it come to help their commun , it all invari boil down to the question : `` what do i get out of help my commun ? '' . school and other educ institut are equal to blame for mould children into apathet youngster . in certain less develop countri , such as malaysia , children are requir to learn `` moral studi '' in class . howev , it seem highli puzzl that student do not go out on trip to clean up the street or hold chariti sale for a good caus . instead , they are requir to memor specif word or phrase in order to get good grade dure their final . moreov , the exampl use in the textbook do not keep up with the time . most of these exampl still speak of villag and broken wooden hous , and thu fail to reflect the situat in urban modern life . is it ani wonder that student feel alien from these `` commun work '' and end up not do enough of it ?
