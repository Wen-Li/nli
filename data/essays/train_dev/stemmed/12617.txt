i do believ that it is veri import to have a wide cultur in mani and apparent differ subject . subject that as a fist approach can seam radic differ are in the end just a differ develop of the same initi path . an exampl come from the classic greek where phylosoph were the fist astronomist and mathematician . i think that onli have a broad knowledg of differ subject is possibl to go deeper in a specif one with later studi . the risk to be too much special from the begin is to not be abl to approach an eventu problem in a differ way . an exampl is when i wa a student at the univers and i wa attend the mathemat class , at that time i wa realli surpric how student cominig from classic studi , after some first difficult , becam the best of the class . they were abl to use the broad knowledg of differ subject and use them in a specif fild . i am worri when i see school becam too specif in the earli stage of student path . i think that industri and econom world is too in hurri to have a technician , a kind of robot abl to use some specif skill well and fast . i am sure that the real progr is in the had of peopl that are abl to solv problem in a wide rage , becaus it is import that for each small chang in one direct someth , mayb far , will chang as well . i had a specif educ and mani time i suffer my lack of istruct and i use most of my free time to read classic poem .
