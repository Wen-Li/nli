academ educ is base on specif subject that one can choos in order to persu their studi in someth that interest them . dure one 's year in school , some subject are recommand - or i may say impos . sometim one find oneself studi for a subject that doe not interest one at all . and so one make sure not to take such a cours in colleg . everi student want to go to colleg in order to be `` free '' and to do the subject that they enjoy the most . it is usual someth that they are pation of . well at least it should be , concid they will make a career out of it . i doubt that anyon would studi for someth that they find bore . howev , have a good knowledg is necessary. a knowledg person is someon who is smart and open to ani inform he/sh can get . it is of cours someon curiou . for that matter , i can agre to thi statement . have a good cultur can open a lot door to success . it is also a good mean to be satisfi with one 's conscien . thi may be a veri philosif matter but it can be concid . for instanc , a housewif , who ha 4 children-of differ age - is the sourc of answer for her children . whenev one of them have a question - it can be for anyth from school to social life - they will come to their mother . for them the mother is the sourc of reason . but what if the mother wa illeter or ha veri littl knowledg , who will they go to for advis ? who is the person that they can trust to tell tehm the whole truth ? in that case , the answer is no one . so , in my opinion , i think that have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to special in one specif subject if it come to cultur knowledg - for exampl the housewives-but if it come to a 18-year-old who is enter colleg to prepar hi futur , i think that a specif subject is better becaus then he/sh would be concentr on thing that they will make in the right way unlik those who ruch into thing and end up not finish them . like they alway say : it 's the qualiti not the quatiti '' .
