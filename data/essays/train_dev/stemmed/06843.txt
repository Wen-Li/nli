i strongli agre with thi statement which say `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . nowaday , commod by car ha becom a major problem as it take or kill lot of time in travel becaus of drastic increas in traffic in the countri . and one can not realli control the traffic instead one can travel by motor bike or take gover servic ( by train , bu or air bu ) . so in next twenti year technic we can hardli see peopl travel by car . one of the most promin reason could be , peopl are not secur when they are travel by car as they see mani acccid occur in the citi without ani mistak . peopl usual might visit late night parti , club , disco and peopl may cosum alcohol and after that drive car can lead to disast as drunken drive is anytim not advis . the other reason can be , when you are go on a long drive and if your car break down and we realli cant fix the problem in that situat we have to call ourselv helpless and there could be ani problem we might have to face in such terribl situat . but when one travel in gover servic and one can realli enjoy all the benefit been offer by the gover in that particular bu or train . one can also consum food , can sleep , chat , play , etc . .. and the best part is that they can travel safe and in a secur manner . we are all awar of the fact that human be are veri intellig and they realli have idea of what the import of life is and would prefer to take a secur mode for travel instead go by car which is anytim not safe . finalyl , i would like to conclud that in the next twenti year there will be fewer car in use as peopl love to travel with differ mode and are fulli satisfi with facil that they are get in differ mode of travel than travel or use car .
