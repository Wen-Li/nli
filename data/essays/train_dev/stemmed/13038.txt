the the best way to travel doe not ha to be in a group with a specif tour guid . i have visit mani countri with my famili and veri few of them had been with a tour guid , most of the time , we do research on the countri we are go to visit and prefer to get as much inform about the tourist place as we can . and we plan our own tour as a famili , if we want to make a stop or stay more time in a specif place , we can do it , but we would not be abl to do thi if we were travel as a group becaus we have alreadi a schedul . which we have to respect due to the rest of peopl we are travel with . we have also travel with a group , with friend of the entir famili , it is a lot of fun becaus we share lot of great moment , but even tough , we do not travel with a tour guid , we also plan our own tour befor the trip . six year ago , we took a trip to vail colorado with anoth famili , great friend of our . in total we were 10 peopl , five from my famili and five from their famili . we went ski at the vail mountain , even tough my parent , my brother and i had alreadi skyi , thi wa a new experi . we enjoy it that much that i can dare to say that it ha been the best trip ever , we got the opportun to share with the other famili as well as we share with our . we had such a great time that we made anoth trip togeth . thi excit trip made me sure that the best trip are not necessarili with a guid tour by your side .
