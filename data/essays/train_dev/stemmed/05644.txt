`` do anyth as if it were your last and up to the point of perfect . '' i firmli beleiv in the statement but i do n't realli beleiv that onli by tri new thing and take risk a person can be success . you can reach the zenith even if you are do what you know how to do well with sheer hardwork and perserver . behind everi spectacular event lie unspectacular prepar . i would rather like to work hard on my asset and plan to excel them other than tri someth new and excit which ha the probabl that i might not like it . the root of success lie in the will to exceed in life and a continuaci to a purpos . i love help peopl , deal with the children so pursu teach . i think if i continu my same profess of teach i would be more success other than tri a new thing all togeth like nurs . if i continu to teach , i have an enrich experi in the field of teach and later on i can also appli for the posit of a princip . but if i chang my field to nurs i have to learn all about medicin and have to start from the veri scratch . secondli i think a person get a lot of satisfact if he or she is do someth they alreadi know . it give a sens of self content and hapi after that hardwork . if i offer to cook anyth for my friend but i do n't realli know how to cook , i might have an unpleas experi after that chore becaus that dish might not be veri tasti . so instead of take ani risk i would rather do someth i enjoy and know how to do well . and i do n't think if i wo n't tri that i am unsucess . instead i know how how to avoid ruin my day and how to get the most of it . when you are do someth you alreadi know you develop the sens of perfect and there are more chanc to excel in that field . well in the end life is a tin of sardin and we are all look for thye key . so sometim we might have to tri new thing but my main chore would alway be what i like do the best .
