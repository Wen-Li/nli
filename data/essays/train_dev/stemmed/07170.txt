i total desagre with the statement which say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do for mani reason . it 's a common idea that these day , becaus of our extrem consum societi , young peopl must be happier than older peopl but thi is complet fake . first young peopl have more and more troubl then older peopl are total taken care thse day . we can see the world of today offer to young peopl a real pressur . first they will have to save the planet earth by clean it which is a crucial mission , planet which ha been destroy by the older one . secondli , we all know they will have to continu to take care of their parent , mayb grand-par while they are work hard in thi more and more expens world , for a great part of their own life . also , nowaday , young struggl in order too make good studi becaus the elit ha becom incred aw . they have been constent under pressur see their brother from the south die in these terribl situat we watch on tv . on the other side , older peopl enjoy life more than anyon by live of their children 's money . spend a lot , destroy the planet even more by pollut or take expens holliday . they becom the littl children afterward , take care by their own child . born after the war it 's even worst becaus they have been live in insouci dure their whole life . let 's take an other exempl , they are not product at all wherea they have a lot of power ; block the entir econom system , an enorm polit impact . they make stuck the state and the young civilian who want some chang . in conclus we ca n't admit that the statment is right becaus , base on the situat of today , everi young peopl will tell you that he is scare for hi futur and that he think he will have to sacrific for hi children not to have the same destini . young are n't happi at all and the older do not care about it . thi situat show the crisi our planet and it popul will have to face .
