i do agre with the statement `` most advertis make product seem much better then they realli are '' . we all have a great infuenc on all these advertis item . there are mani mean of advertis like the televis , newspap , ad on road and mani more . so , everi one get an opportinu to see one or the other . one exampl or the reason whi i agre with thi statement is that , onc i brought a cream which say it remov all the blemish and left over mark in just few day . the advertis wa soo well that i wa just impress by just see it one time . and it wa just not more then a moistur , which just did noth which it had to do , but made my skin so oili . one more exampl is that onc i brought a solut which say that remov all the dirt in the crak of the leg , and make them smooth , but it remov the dirt by not onli remov onli the dirt but also remov lay of skin . i wa just shoke and even scare of use new product from that time . these are not onli the exampl but they are mani more , just take the car insur compani , it say too much but never doe all that it say , by say mani rule and condit for all the instrut it gave . we can have one mare exampl like the call card it say , which say the voic would be veri much clear with so mani minut . . and mani more . but what we get trueli is thatonli the minut to talk which are are realli not worth or use with out a clear voic . we can take one more exampl like the alarm which we use for safeti purpos by get impress by see the advertis , it do work as it say , but is it taht use as we heard from that advertis , we need to just think of that . there are mani more like the cloth , gold , food , restaur , fast food center , and mani more , whch are just differnt from what is said in the advertis . these are few of the reason which make me agre with the abov statement .
