in my point of view , to travel in a group led by a tour guid ha two main advantag : - first , travel as a group one ha the opportun to easili meet new peopl which i consid as part of the fun to travel . the experi that is share combin with the proxim in which are kept the member of a travel group will render the exchang realli easi among them . - second , when one travel , by definit , he doe not know what to see nor do in the place visit . a lot of peopl find it more convini to take a tour guid rather than gather thi inform from other sourc such as internet or travel book . the tour guid is generali a local that , accord to hi experi , know depend on the amount of time hi group ha , which site will interet it the most . although those two argument can be true , i disagre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . even though it is of cours more easi to meet peopl within a group you are travel with , the interest of travel is to discov the cultur of the place visit . the best way to achiv thi is to travel alon and therefor be motiv to go and meet local peopl . those person exchang teach a lot about a local cultur and can creat long last link between peopl . also follow a tour guid ha more inconvini than advantag . first , you can not choos what you want to see , thi choic be taken by the tour guid . with the inform now avail there is multipl cheap sourc that can let you decid what to see and do . second , unfortunatli , even more in some foreign countri , the tourist are onli consid as a possibl sourc of money . therefor , veri often the guid will be partli paid by local build , shop , restaur , ... to make you come to their place although they are of minor interest . in conclus , i would recommand to travel alon without a tour guid .
