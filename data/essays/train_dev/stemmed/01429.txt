a lot of peopl think that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i person believ that peol whoo onli do what what they alresdi know how to do well are more success than those who belong to the other categori . i have mani reason in support of thi opinion of mine . first and foremost , i feel that by do what one is alreadi good at one ha a good grip over the subject to be dealt with . thi provid the person to think probe more deepli into hi or her subject of special . thu success can be obtain quickli . for instanc , a friend of mine who graduat in financi engin tookup a job as an analyst which involv hi branch of studi . he tast success within no time . hi salari doubl within a short period of six month . in two year he grew to the posit of a senior analyst . a nother friend of hi tookup a job total differ from hi subject of studi and end up earn not even close to half of my friend 's salari . thu thi kind of success come faster and is more long last . the risk involv is liter noth . it is ani day a safer bet . adit , take risk and do new thing may give nore scope for creativ . but , the amount of time and work it consum is is too much . the result are not seen immedi . a person who follow thi path requir to have oodl of patienc . it is imposs to judg if the new thing will click or not . in most case the risk factor is high and the person ha no idea of what he is do . base on the abov discuss , i feel that success peopl are those who do what they are alreadi good at rather than those who tri new thing and take risk .
