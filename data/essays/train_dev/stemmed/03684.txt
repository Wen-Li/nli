i agre with the idea that peopl should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject instead of just special in one certain subject . there are mani reason support my opinion . first , i believ that academ subject are the path lead to the knowledg of the world , therefor one should n't limit hi or her time devot within onli one subject ; peopl , especi colleg student , should take variou cours in all kind of field befor they decid what certain academ field they wish to receiv further educ . if we onli studi one certain field , we will loos the whole forest for one tree . second , i believ that although knowledg is categor into assort academ subject , each individu subject is relat to one anoth ; therefor we could not possibl understand one subject without studi the other . for exampl , math is consid as `` the mother of all scienc , '' but peopl studi in philosophi still need to learn math in order to understand the foundat of logic , no less than research in physic , engin , or financ field . last but not least , as the old say goe , `` learn is like bulid a pyramid ; the broaden you build it , the taller it reach . '' by learn wide initi we can easili understand a specif subject later . moreov , if we can not absorb a broad rang of academ subject , our perspect will also be narrow . we wo n't be abl to accept opposit idea and multipl opinion from other , nor will we be will to adopt new thought and imag from subject outsid of our own instantli . in conclus , i believ that `` jack of all trade is also master of one . '' a person who acquir broad knowleg of mani academ subject could undoubtedli achiev special in one specif subject too . therefor , i agre with the idea that the former is better than the latter .
