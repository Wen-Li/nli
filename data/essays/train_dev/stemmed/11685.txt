accord to the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today i think these statement is wrong . in my opinion car are the most import transport vehicl in our societi . in modern buis flexibl is one of the most import thing . onli the car allow everybodi to carri distanc at everi time he want to everi place he need . public transport system have a lot of advantag especi in big citi whith onli littl space . in these citi most of the peopl are travel everyday on the same rout . but for longer distanc public transport system are not flexibil enough . anoth argument for my opinion is that have a car make life more easi . for exampl a car is veri useful if you go to the supermarket buy a lot of box of water or beer . it is imposs to carri these thing by bike or by bu . but one of the most import reason is that peopl feel more independ when they have car . they are not depend on other peopl ore public transport system . in my opinion peopl wo n't never give up these advantag unless they can not affort a car anymor . for exampl i need my car nearli everi day becaus my parent live in a small citi which ha hardli ani public transport system . there ar onli few buss and they do not reach most of the place . i think public transport system are to exspens for small area or citi . but most of the peopl in my countri live in small town or villag . that 's whi a car is so necessari for a lot of peopl . of cours car caus a lot of problem , especi the enviroment polut . but these problem can be solv by invent new altern technic . for exampl it is a good idea to resarch in hydrogen fuel or develop a fuel made of plant . becaus of all these reason i do not aggre with the statement i 'm ask about .
