some peopl say that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . certainli , mani compani spend much money for advertis becaus it may have much effect on the sale increas . but , person , i think mani user are get wiser to find out that mani product are not necessarili as good as they are promot in the advertis . therefor , i do n't agre that most product seem much better than they realli are . my primari reason is that we have becom wise to find out whether the product are realli good or not despit of the advertis . recent , we often hear the news that peopl were deceiv by the fals advertis and paid much money for the worthless product . for exampl , where i live , japan , cosmet surgeri is veri popular among young women gener . howev , i have read the articl that mani women suffer damag by cosmet surgeri although they paid high price for it . mani advertis of cosmet surgeri describ onli the good effect and doe n't mention the possibl of bad supplementl effect after surgeri . as a result of these bad news , women tend to cast a doubt on the advertis and investig the hospit enough befor pay money . as a result , mani privat hospit which provid bad treatment is suffer from the loss of custom . the anoth reason is that some advertis exagger the product too much and they do n't seem the product much better than they are . for exampl , in japan , we often see the advertis of english school or materi for studi english . some of them say that we could master english if we go to school for 10 day . who believ such an advertis ? i think some advertis use unrealist word too much doe not look the product well . in conclus , i do n't think most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . we have learn that we should not believ what advertis say without have a doubt on it .
