i would agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . there is a say that `` experi is the best teacher '' . a person who is veri success must experi more in differ way and learn how to surviv in differ environ and not afraid of risk . i will explain my opoin from the follow aspect . first of all , one of the most import charact that a success person should have is curious and a desir about learn new thing . normal a new opportun , new atmospher and new peopl around can bring new sens and new pentientail for a person . for exampl , a veri famou chines writer lu xun . he use to be a doctor , but he realiz that doctor can onli treat peopl 's sick instend of think . so tri to start write articl and book , then hi book influenc a gener of chines in 1920 . secondli , as a success person , he must be veri brave and take risk in all differ circumst . for exampl , chairman mao is a tipic success leader who wa alway take risk in thi world . he led chines peopl to stand up and build a new countri in the east asia . thirdli , i do n't think that a person who alway keep a posit and never tri new thing in hi life will be success . keep do one thing for long time , peopl will becom lazi and incr . they just want to do the daili thing and never think about do some differ from other . on the other hand , i also think that persist is an veri import charact that a success person should have . for exampl , a scientist is do lot of studi and research focus on specif field and progect . the job itself requir that he must know how to deal with hi studi and also must know how to do well . it is essenci for a scientist that he must be pacient and concentr on someth instead of tri new thing and take risk . in a nutshel , the success peopl should have an courag and disir for tri new thing . it is an import part for a success person to take risk in order to get new oppon and petenti so that he can make a differ in thi worl .
