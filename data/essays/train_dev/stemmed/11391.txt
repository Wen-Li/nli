dure hi or her educ period everybodi ha to decid wether to base on broad knowledg or to focuss on a specif subject and special . the choic is difficult and both choic , of cours , have differ advantag and disadvantag which should be care explain in the follow . at first i would like to make the point that all `` high-end-economi '' in general base on share of work . for exampl in the western world , for instanc in the u.s. or in germani nobodi live onli from the crop of hi or her own garden . everybodi focuss on what he or she can do best and tri to get hi own advantag from thi behavior . advantag in thi context mean to earn money . thi special is one core factor of wealth of our nation . therefor special can be call the key to acc in today societi . as shown abov our today societi are veri base on share of work , but i would like to state anoth import point . in my oppinion broad knowledg mean mostli few knowledg . thi might sound strang at first , but let me explain it in a more detail way : if someon , for instanc , studi mani subject simular he or she doe not have enough time to get into the deep of everi singl subject . as result the qualiti of what he or she learn about a singl subject is lower than what somebodi would have learn who focuss on the one subject . lastli i think that that you should not forget that the educ time is usual to short to reach a broad knowledg . a `` normal '' student in germani ha for exampl about 4 year to finish hi or her educ and to start earn money . thi is veri few time to studi two subject simultan for instac . i have a friend for exampl who studi econom and engin and he alway claim about to less leisur time . becaus of the abov mention reason i have come to the conclus that it is better to special in one specif subject . by special myself on ecomom and wihin thi subject especi on tax and tax law i am veri sure to have made the right choic .
