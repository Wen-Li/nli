lear a fact , we ( human ) are alway curiou about know a fact . we whant know what happn , what wa a result . i disagre with the statement that student learn fact is more import than learn concept and understand idea . first of all , the reason whi i disagre with the statement is becaus i strongli believ that understand idea and concept lead to develop student think skill . specif , if a teacher teach about the global warm , and say just a fact of it ( like `` global warm is progress now badli , and the earth 's temperatur is increas . '' then how student will take that teacher voic ? most student will understand that the global warm is happn , but they could not know what element are caus the global warm , becaus that teacher onli did teach a fact ( global warm is happn ) and did not teach how and whyhappend ( ideas/concept of global warm ) . therefor due to a lack of key idea and concept of global warm , student onli knew about a fact and they do not understand process ( ieas/concept ) of the global warm . onli know the fact is a big problem , becaus if they do not have insid stori ( ideas/concept ) and onli know the fact . then they could not evalu the issu from there , becua they do not have data to estim the issu . so , if they onli knew about the fact , then they could not solv the global warm issu or other issu which happn on the earth . from abov reason , i disagre whith the statement that teach student fact is more import than teach idea and concept . more over , teach onli fact is not ideal educ way . to develop student think skill , educ must teach idea and concept of each issu to develop student think abil .
