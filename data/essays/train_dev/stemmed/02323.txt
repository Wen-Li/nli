will the advertis make product seem much better than they reallt are ? i 'm go to have to say that i agre with thi statement becaus i am one of the peopl who watch advertis show and buy product that i want . i do n't think thi is a good way to choos which product to buy , but how are we go to buy the product without an advertis ? and whi dose it make product seem much better than they realli are with advertis ? the answer is realli simpl , it 's just that some compnay make look the product better in advertis . basic what they are do is lie . in ored to find a good product without use the advertis , peopl should ask their friend about the product they want to buy . one day , i bought thi watch that wa said in the advertis that thi watch never brake and could hold on to great amount of graviti . when i went into the deep pool , it wa broken . i wa realli sad and mad at the same time . advertis make the product sound better , but the product it self is n't good as what is said on the advertis . sinc the product it self is n't good as it say on the advertis , the compani who pruduc the product would not make a great amount of money . like i said in the beggin , i do agre with the statement , but i do n't agre use the advertis to sell the product . without a advertis , it would tough for the compnay to sell . same as peopl who want to buy the product . for do thi , onli the good product which cost less and ha good qualiti is go to be sold . what is the purpos of make an advertis ? custom could be the advertis .
