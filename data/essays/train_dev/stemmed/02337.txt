of cous , i am agre ! becaus if someon undertand the concep must undertand the fact . if a person onli learn fact it will be onli a dadta base , it will not have a logic reason or brain storm . in a part it import to learn all the fact about a subject . meanwhil you can describ it but , not analz it . thi is extremli import to student , espaci for a investig or a speech . caus undertand a theme is the base of educ , and scienc and mani diciplin more . to undertand someth , a person learn first the fact , them put on test and theoriz and finali goe for a conclus . thi is learn explor fact and deatail to make a comprenshion of a studi object . for exampl the statement on my left view bege with a univers condit , than mean that is a deduct ideal . the part say undertand realiy mean `` know everyth '' and the fact mean `` know a few . '' `` it is more import to undertand idea and concept , than learn fact . the pasag cantain a view logic order , is almost undenailbl to destroy it . not onli that also express tan a student must visual problem and solv them . in a conclus the statement it 's a invit to kow eveyth , to explor ath world of knoleg . everi student hope to achiev that in all clase and think of than i believ than i go righ way .
