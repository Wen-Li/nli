in thi morern , peopl are easili find the advertis , they take place everywher . peolp can find the advertis not onli in the tv , but also in the newspap . furthermor , peopl buy mani thing becaus of the advertis . the advertis alway look realli good and make peopl want to spend money on them . in my opinion , i think that the most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the reason are the owner want to earn money , and the advertis are decor and exagger . first reason is becaus the owner want to earn moni from these commond . for instanc , if the asvertis look realli terribl , no one would desir to buy them and spend their money on them . therefor , the owner wo n't get the money and welfar from them . secondli , most of the advertis are decor and exagger . for exampl , the ipod is realli fasion these day . the advertis of ipod allway say that it can contain over 1,000 song and wo n't out of batteri at least 14 hour . howev , after i spend my money that come from my salari of part time job , i wa realli sad about that . my ipod ran out of batteri befor 8 hour , and it had no more space befor i put in the three hundr and fifty-third song . therefor , i strong believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are for the follow reason . the owner want to earn money and the advertis are allway decor and exagger .
