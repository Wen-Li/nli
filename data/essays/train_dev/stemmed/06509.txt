as the maxim stand `` noth succe like success '' , hold true in either case , whether an individu take risk and becom success or he doe not take risk and still turn out out to be success . in my opinion , success is about take risk and rather than onli do what they alreadi know . thu , i agre to the given statement . in my opinion peopl do becom success even when they adopt the old opinion but by do that , ther are not the leader in the societi but follow . for exampl , a compani x open chain restur and decid to franchis it restur . the compani x wa successful . compani y decid to follow the the foot print of compani x and did not tri anyth differ . compani y may be success in the long run but may not a leader while as compani x is a leader and other organis will follow him . same is true with the individu . secondli , by not take risk , peopl alway live in shell . they lack creativ to do some thing differ and their potenti as an individu is not absolut harnass . take the exampl of director steven speilsberg . when he wa work on hi movi `` titan '' , most peopl though he wa do imposs and would not succeed . we all know what happen after that . chang in ani field are inevit . an individu who is stuck to hi old thought and do onli that what he / she know , may not respond in an optimum way when chang warrant differ . the individu may not be abl to cope to the chang and thu may turn out to be a failur . last but not the least , the success involv in tri new thing and take risk is fast . an individu may be success in tri onli what they alreadi know but it may involv lot of time . if the individu want the output to be posit and quick , he may need to take risk at ani stage of life . to conclud , risk take abil is an essenti qualiti of an individu to succeed . howver , he or she should not get carri away with the amount of risk one is take . they should measur the risk benefit ratio befor take risk and thu final decid if it is worth it to take the risk to be success .
