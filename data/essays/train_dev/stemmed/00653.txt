well in my view i dont think there will be a reduct in the usag of car in the near futur . firstli , sinc mani new car are been come into the present market . one can sure expect that mani peopl in the near futur will be buy those . moreov by use latest mechan these day the car are been manufactur at a lower cost than befor . so thi may even lead to a reason for buy a car as they are veri cheap . secondli , sinc technolog is been develop day by day and also human show a lot of interest in lead a luxorio life . some peopl consid that without have a car it may affect their statu . each an everi individu will be interest to buy a car . even the student in colleg also use the car these day . so i dont think there will be a declin in the usag of car in the upcom year . thirdli , when come to popul , as there been a massiv increas in almost all countri no surpris the car user also certainli will increas . and also when safeti is been consid mani peopl prefer a four wheeler such as car rather than a two wheeler such as bike . sinc two wheeler are more like to be danger as there are no proper safeti measur done in it design . final the onli point i can see about declin the usag a car in the near 20 year is becaus of increas in number of deseas due to pollut . major of the car exhaust smoke will gener contain cabon content which may combin with oxygen and form carboxyhaemaglobin . due to the consumpt of such gase mani may suffer with differ kind of diseas like breath problem , asthma etc .. , so if the peopl becom awar of such danger diseas then they might stop use the car . but still , i stick to the fact that thi may not happen so soon .
