i agre with thi argument , and i think it is veri import not just for student but for all of us to first of all understand the basic idea and concept and then to learn fact . a good comprehens of the basic is import becaus the idea and concept actual make up the fact . therefor for anyon to learn the fact it is imper they have a proper grasp of all the factor that go in it 's make . it is a fact that physic exercis is veri import for the human bodi . now if the student just learn that , it will not have much relev and will not realli contribut to anyth that is product . on the other hand when the student understand whi it is import --- the idea behind that particular philosophi it will be much more relev and thu more meaning . the student can understand how physic exercis releas stress , how it increas a person well be by alter chemic in the brain etc . physic exercis in the form of a team sport teach peopl to be abl to interact and cooper and work togeth . thu the fact will make much more relev . anoth exampl is the fact that it is much more difficult to breath at higher elev . it is veri import to understand whi it is so . if i were plan to be a mountain for exampl , i would be abl to deal with the whole situat much better if i understood that air pressur is much more at higher elev
