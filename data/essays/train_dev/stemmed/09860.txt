i arge with the point that young peopl nowaday do not give enough to help their commun . with the develop of technolog , more and more funni product are come into exsit and enter peopl ' daili life . so it is not surpris to find that young peopl would spend hour on pc game alon , instead of take care of or talk to some old peopl in hospit . take comput as an exampl . a survey show that global comput sell is contuni grow , and so with the demand . and some teenag do claim that comput is their best friend . with comput , they are abl to chat with oversea friend , watch latest hot movi , or surf on the internet . sinc the time in a day is 24 hour , which is eaqul to everi one , they of cours do not have more time left to help their commun . by contrast , teenag in the old day did not have such kind of entertain . therefor , it wa common for them to visit and help other ' famili in their commun . moreov , freedom resolut start in california of unit state in the 1960 show a wrong exampl to young peopl . instead of have a steadi belief in god in mind , more and more peopl choos to believ noth , which ha alreadi prove by a report on european citizen . it is inde correct that the natur of human be is to help each other , but have some belief will enhanc your feel to give a hand . so lack belief ha sure a neg impact of those young peopl nowaday . to sum up , i argu that too mani kind of entertain and lack of belief lead to the fact the young peopl are not give enough time to help their commun . but i not say that they are more selfish than befor , render that there are just more aspect of life to pay attent to . in order to make some chang to thi situat , i would advis parent to spend more time on their children and show them some posit exampl .
