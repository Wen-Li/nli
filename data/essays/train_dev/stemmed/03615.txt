in the past young peopl help their famili in mani activ such as housework , in crop and they were veri import for the life and the surviv of famili . they had not the possibl to go to school becaus there were not much money to do thi type of activ . in thi condit they were abl to help their commun in differ work becaus they had more time to spend to do thi thing . nowaday the rythm of life is chang . life style of young is differ in compar with the past . they go to school where they do mani activ . in the afternoon they do homework and usual they do some sport . these activ are onli for futur or amus of them . so they can not help commun in a good way . for exampl , in my famili we are three children . my brother work all the day , my sister studi and i , for the moment , i am look for job and so i have a few time to spend for commun . in free time i prefer to relax . the situat is differ from the past becaus nowaday there are too much thing to do . in my opinion , help commun is import for all peopl but if there are not possibl to collabor with member that are in a commun , it is right that govern help the societi and it member to organ differ and interest activ for all peopl .
