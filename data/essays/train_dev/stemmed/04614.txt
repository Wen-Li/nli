there are sever advantag as well as disadvantag of whether an individu posses a broad knowledg of mani acadam subject or mere one specif field of studi . to my mind it is necessari and help to gain , at least to some extent , a bit of each of thi two oppos kind of knowledg . firstli , it can be said that special in a certain subject is definit veri help with regard to one 's futur career . if a person ha accumul a lot of knowlegd about one topic in a veri detail way it enabl him to work veri effect in that area . have a lot of knowledg usual also impli a lot of abil one is abl to perform in a suitabl job posit . furthermor , with a lot of detail knowledg one could contribut to the advanc of the studi field in variou way . for instanc , somewho who ha studi the develop of one specif topic of research such as group process , is abl to use hi knowledg to actual design new experi which might chang the current point of research concern that area . thi would definit push one 's career toward greater success or mayb even fame . in contrast to that , a broad knowledg of mani acadam subject also ha some benefit to offer . it impli that one doe know about a larg varieti of topic in a gener manner . thi varieti not onli broaden your horizon , but it also offer you new perspect and give you insight into mayb even quit contrast topic . whenev you need to appli or know about one specif subject in a more detail way , you can still do that and just enlarg your former inform . howev , to my mind , neither of the two way of knowledg taken on their own are appropri and suffienc enough . the ideal solut would be a combin of the two : a great amount of special knowledg which qualifi one for a job posit on a high level ; and some broad knowledg about a varieti of topic and issu . to conclud thi would enabl each type of knowledg to benefit from the other and give the individa
