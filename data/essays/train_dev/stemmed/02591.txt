i agre with the opinion that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i have two follow reason : first of all , to enjoy life lead young peopl to think by theirself what to do to enjoy and how can they make it . becaus to enjoy is not the thing given by other peopl , young peopl have to abount how doe they make the thing ejoy . to think by myself make charactor of young peopl agress . it is import for young peopl to make and produc their own charactor as earli as possibl in their life . to think that way is veri use for young peopl . second reason is that the feel enjoy is gotten by variou kind of the experien . thi process that young peopl challeng and experi mani thing and fell enjoy through such challleng and experi is veri use in the growth of young peopl . in fact , older peopl may challeng and experi mani thing also , but in view of the import gain through such experi , it is more neccessari for young peopl to enjoy life . as i mention abov , i definit agre with the opinion that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl .
