i do not agre nor disagre with the statement . travel with a group led by a tour guid is intrest , the tour gui will stat inform about the place we are visit , so we can get knowledg on the place . also he is an expert with the famou place which attract visitor from differ countri , so we can denifit from hi expieri . furthermo , we will guarante that we did not miss anyplac with in the tour . the beauti part in travel with group is we can share inform about differ cltuer from peopl all over the world . i like to learn about cultur it is veri intrest to find that some beleiv that are forbbiden in some cultur are allow in other , therefor when peopl visit other countri will knoe how to react with some peopl . for exampl certain word are allow to be use in me countri but not allow in other contri , so when i visit that other countri i would say a wore that would caus a big troubl for me on the other hand , when travel in a group the individu will be tie up with the group , sometim we need to spend some famili time to explor the countri wear visit and tri some restaur , spend more time in a musiem and buy some sevoni . in my opinion i will tri both travel ina group led by a tour guid or travel alon with my famili , becaus each one of them ha it own experi and adventur that we can keep wonderful memoris in our mind , i would like in some day to visit all the lovley place that i heard from peopl . each individu ha a differ point of view , and everi person will make the right select for themselv to enjoy what they can to make good time la
