mani peopl dedic a lot of time on know and investig difer topic , but when you ask them about someth specif they do not know what to say . while other peopl spend their time focus in one subject and you are sure that whatev you ask him , he will be abl to answer to it . i total disagre with the statement becaus i think that when you tri to know more about everyth you just ca n't becaus is too much inform from difer topic and your brain ca n't support as mani inform as you want . for exampl when i wa a littl girl for about four moth i tri to memor all the math oper even if a could n't make them there wa alway a calcul but after that i got confus with everyth becaus i could n't recogn the oper anymor . i 'm not sure if it wa becuas i forgot or i did n't practic but i wa n't abl to make them , not even with calcul . after that i start with my normal class some thing were familiar but all my effort of do all those math problem and graph and everyth did n't have ani result . whatsmor i realiz that in my ambit of know everyth i lost a whole vacat full with fun and distract . therefor i never tri again to learn everyth from one step . i go step by step instead of jump . and now that i 'm just to start a new part of my life i know that everyth come at it ' moment and that know to mani thing can distract you from what you realli want for your life . i 'm not say that you have to be an ignor or like a poni that is not abl to see the side and just look the road , what i mean is that you have to be focus on what you are do and on what you want so when it come the time to show your knowleg you are sure and you do n't hesit .
