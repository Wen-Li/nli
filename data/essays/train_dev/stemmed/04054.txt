i agre with that fact the most advertis product seem much better than they realli are . it ha to be that way , would you want to buy anyth that doe n't look good or seem not use ? like it say , it 's `` advertis '' . for exampl , the m'c donald 's big mac seem realli big , yummi , and tasti but the real big mac is n't realli that big as show as an advertis . they just put more stuff to make it look bigger and use frash ingredi for the advertis . if it doe n't seem like that big and tasti , peopl wo n't want to eat . it 's all about the advertis that peopl want to eat and buy thing . and also , i think the better advertis satisfi peopl 's mind . for exampl , on the car advertis , who doe n't want to buy nice merced or bmw ? but all the poepl ca n't afford them . when you look at the honda civic 's advertis , it look fanci as merced , too . you know it 's not that fanci or nice as them but you just look at the advertis and satisfi yourself . the advertis use certain place , model , concept , light , and ect , to make the product look better . on the cloth advertis , someon who extreamli georgou model wear silk coctail dress , you would want to buy it . that 's what model are for . in conclus , the adversit are not lie but it just ha to be look good . that 's what advertis are for .
