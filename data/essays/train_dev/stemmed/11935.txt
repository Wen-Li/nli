we are deal with the issu of whether it is more import for the student to learn fact or is it more relev to understand the idea and concept behind them . the issu is import becaus it is veri essenti to keep thi requir in mind when teach the student . i person feel that learn concept and idea is definit more requir than memor the fact . the first reason i would like to present for thi belief is that fact can be obtain from a variou varieti of resourc like book , internet or ani other knowledg center wherea the idea and concept are not that simpl to obtain . they requir consider effort and time both to teach and assimil and they are compulsori for the better understand of a topic . they are much difficult to unlearn for a long period of time and henc are more use and play a much import role in everi person 's life . secondli , the student need to be provid with practic knowledg on how to surviv in the world after they cross a certain age limit and they do not have their parent ' support and constant guidanc . they will have to fend for themeslv for which they will need logic and concept more than fact . therefor , these should be provid without fail to all student . final , if the student are provid with more number of fact then they are prone to forget them easili as they shall not be abl to appli them to real-world situat . the concept provid to them will have numer exampl that can be cite and henc thi form of educ is like to be retain by them for longer period of timeor most probabl will last them an entir lifetim . to conlud and summar , i feel that provid a student with educ base on logic reason and fact is benifici than just help them to learn fact as thi will make them independ and will help them in everi aspect of their life and will be with them for their entir period of their life unlik fact .
