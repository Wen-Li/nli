the issu at hand is that most advertis make product seem better than tey realli are . thi issu is import when it come to choos a product . in my opinion a lot of advertis make product seem a lot better than they are . i believ thi becaus advertis a product is n't usual about how good they are and what qualiti it bring with it.a product need to be sold and that 's whi compani need to advertis in a posit way about it in order to sell the product . for exampl take a deterg to wash cloth with . thi product get compar with other derterg , and usual the compani who want to sell thi specif product tell the consum how much better it ist compar to it competit . the consum might believ it and buy it , but the he find out that it doesn ' work as well how it wa promis . anoth reason i believ that advertisemnt doesn ' alway tell the truth about it 's product is that there are a lot of competidor out there who might produc the same product . everi produc want hi product bee sold the most . in order to to that the costom need to hear a few great thing about it . on the other hand advertis can be help in archievng a specif goal . for exampl you are in the music buis and want your work publish , it is necessari to advertis your product in order to reach the public . someon can do thi through flyer , happen event of the band and so on . thi exampl show that advertis need to tell the correct ambitions. , otherwis the consum wo n't believ in thi product and wo n't buy it in the end . in conclus , most advertis though use ooverexaurr on order to get a product sold .
