as car are partli respons for pollut and global warm , it ha becom a big issu that the number of car in use is alway increas . will our govern be abl to restrain the number of car so that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use ? it seem to me that thi is not go to happen soon . first of all , the world popul is increas , whi would the number of car decreas in a short-term futur ? nowaday , develop countri are develop more quickli than ever befor . and they will soon have the same demand for car as develop countri , where nearli each one in the famili own a car . on top of that , car constructor are provid develop countri with car that correspond to their standard of life , so as to be abl to earn money from the market in develop countri . then , we could also think that when there is no more oil to power the car , the number of car will decreas . well , that may happen for a time , but those car will quickli be replac by car promot by sustain develop , and power by clean or renew energi , which will be as perform and as access to everyon as the oiled-pow car . howev , i think thi increas in the number of car wo n't last for ever . as a matter of fact , i am convinc that with the help of the govern , the number of car will reach a kind of limit , base on a polici to restrain the number of car and a balanc between the use of car and the use of mean of mass transport . otherwis , and increas number of car will not fit in the citi ' traffic . to sum up , i think that twenti year from today , there will be more car , but thi phenomenon is not gonna last for a long time .
