i think i would agre with the statement that it 's better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . have vast knowledg in sever kind of subject allow you to have an opinion on such or such topic wherea if you special in onli one area of studi , you can not form a rich opinion on ani other area of studi but your own . if you take the french academ system versu the american one . it clearli show thi differ . in franc , when you enter univers you have to choos a section , for exampl if i want to major in english , i wo n't be abl to add psycholog as a minor . so you have to special yourself quit earli . although thi system tend to chang , littl by littl , now with the ect system , which basic premit french student to go and studi through europ with the transfer of their credit and vice versa . . wherea in the unit state , each class is assign to a specif number of credit , dure your first two year of colleg you are abl to choos within the larg catalog of class as long as you get a enough credit to valid your academ year . thi mean that you can take an anthropolog as well as an algebra class . thank to thi system , it enabl you to get to know variou subject and to be abl , later on , to choos in what realm of studi you want to pursu your studi . in my opinion , thi system is part of the reason whi so mani intern student want to come and studi in america . they want to see what each subject ha to offer befor special in one in particular .
