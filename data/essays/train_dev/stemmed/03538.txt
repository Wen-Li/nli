agre or disagre ? ! when i first read thi statement i thought it 's hard for me to choos if i agre or disagre with the follow statement . after think for few minut , i now know an answer ! i agre and disagre at the same time ! i think it good to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject and at the same time , i think that special in a a certain subject is perfect too ! both condit have advantag . one of the advantag of have broad knowledg in more than one subject is that thi knowledg can help you alot in understand what peopl say . for exampl , if you are a person who ha a broad knowledg in variou academ subject , you will somehow understand a program that talk about polit ! but if you were a person that special in one specif subject and that subject , for exampl wa astronomi , it 'll be hard for you to understand a polit program ! an advantag for a person that ha knowledg in onli a specif subject is that thi person will have deep inform in the subject that they studi . for exampl , a person who special in busi will have good inform and detail inform in thi subject . in contrast , a person that is not special in a specif subject will not know detail inform in a subject like busi for exampl . there are more advantag and disadvantag for both condit but i just want to state these that i actual can think of for now . i think that it would be perfect if a person ha broad knowledg of variou academ subject as a well as special in a certain subject too , but who will actual do that ? ! as for me , i realli want to but it 's hard !!
