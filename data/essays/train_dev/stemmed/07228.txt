i total agre with thi sentenc . attract a new client is the base of advertis and in a wider mean of market techniqu . i graduat in market two year ago and the first thing i have been taught dure my lesson is that , as a futur manag , i would have had to sell the idea of a product not the product itself . thi statement , that might sound quit absurd at first sight , ha turn out to be veri use in my job . the main reason to support thi concept is that a custom , when get in touch with a product , doe not act in a ration way . mani research base on custom purchas have clearli demonstr that the custom wa n't sure of hi choic after a few step he had made out of the shop . thi exampl clarifi how it 's not import what a person think about a product after she ha bought it . the produc must focu hi attent on what a custom want to find in the product . if a person in charg of a market depart of a compani fail to do thi , he 'd hardli be abl to sell the product . moreov , as the rang of possibl item is constantli increas , advertis help the custom to do his/her first choic . if a product show mani possibl upsid from it use and multipl possibl utilis it will attract a person for sure . the more you exager in show an item , the more you will catch the attent on it . of cours , thi doe n't alway work becous you will alway find a segment target awar of the fact that you are probabl hide someth . to sum up , i would say that advertis is an art . someth you can not learn . someth innat through which you lead peopl to buy everyth you want , but . .. someth that can improv a product onli in the fantasi of a consum not in realiti .
