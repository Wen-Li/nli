i 'm agre with thi statement , first of all , i think thi is a result of the global of the economi , that push some industri to compet in a market place and as a result we see advertis that show some product better than they realli are . i 'm not again the global but i believ that , as it is posit in some way but also ha a neg side . the advertis we see on thi day , show product like food , cloth and electron devic in a better way they realli are . it veri comon on the food industri where constantli we see in tv comeci , and poster on the steet , that some restaur show they product bigger than they realli are , also we can see a pair of tenni shoe that can give you the abil of jump higher that ani pair of shoe in the market , and when you final wear the shoe you see you just make the same perform . there are profession staff dedic to emphat the caracterist of a product line , and one of the common rule is to show the product in a veri atract scenario , like the car in a road besid the sea , or the same car in the mountain with a spectacular view and a famou model behind the wheel . i think that global ha some respons on thi , but not all the respons , becaus even befor peopl start to talk about global thi use to happen in a lower scale . there are other factor that will have to be consid , like the media , the industri and the cultur of the countri . i will not defintli blame a singl factor , i believ that there are a lot of factor whi advertis make product seem much better that they realli are .
