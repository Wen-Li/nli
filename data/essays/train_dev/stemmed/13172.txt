i disagre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i realli think that travel should be a person experi . thi way you can travel alon or with someon who share same interest . you can even travel with your love one 's and spend more person and qualiti time . travel is not alway fun if it 's lay out for you by the tour guid . travel should be adventer and it can accomplish onli if you travel with out a guid . you can have more adventur and stori to tell when you travel with out a guid sinc you can find out new way of do thing . it give a great boost on how you could achiev thing which you might have never imagin . travel should be an experi not a reserv . it also provid some time to think about yourself and how you have aciev it . you dont have to time your travel and can spend time base on your interest . you can alway take a break at ani place you want , if you are tire or just love spend more time at a specif locat which is not possibl travel in group with guid . travel in a group ha lot of disadvantag than advantag . first of all you are group with lot of peopl you are not even familiar with . even though it all lay out for you to make it easi , it realli take away the person beauti of travel . your interest might not realli match up with everi one in the group . so you end up spend time where you realli do n't like to be . so person i would like to travel by myself rather than in a group led by a tour guid . and make the travel more peron .
