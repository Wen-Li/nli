so differ are the person experi and emot among peopl with divers cultur that thousand individu might hold thousand opinion . as far as i am concern , i gener agre with the assert that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . first of all , one of the central reason that can be present my posit is the thing have been done by the success peopl take long time experi to make it better . exampl can easili be found to support my view . the most famou inventor , edison , he invent light in veri earli period . howev , he did n't spend time on how to improv hi invent well . after long time of life experi , other improv the light better , such as the clour and the use time . under the circumst , successful peopl tri new thing and take risk is much better in addit , anoth equal crucial aspect is that a new thing 's come out can increas the possibl of other relat new product ' invent . thi exampl can tell it right . the light came out soon after the discov of electrc , becaus these two invent have someth in common or relat . as a result , the siccess peopl alway succeed in make list of new thing after they made one . thi can demonstr beyond ani doubt that success peopl should keep on go , but stay behind . howev , i dont want to overst the advantag of my agreement , sinc it also still suffer from some compar merit in some speric case . firstli , when peopl tri to invent new thing , it take long time to reach the achiv . seconli , to sum up , accord to abov mention reason and exampl , success peopl should tri new thing and take risk becom more convinc to me , although it ha some own neg aspect which we can not deni .
