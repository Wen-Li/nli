i think that learn fact is more import for a student than to understand idea and concept . but i do think that idea and concept are also import . i think thi way becaus if a student is abl to know the fact in realiti then he can understand the concept veri well . i can take myself as exampl in the statement which i made . dure my school , i wa tought about variou concept and idea of biolog scienc but i wa n't abl to understand veri well becaus the teacher were not give a fact about the scienc that is experi which were given in the textbook wa n't be demonstr in the class . due to that i wa not clear about the topic or concept cover in my school . in my bachol i took biolog scienc as my major and here it wa not the same case as that wa in the school day . here i wa abl to understand the concept and idea what are be thought . thi is becaus i wa appli all the concept and idea in the real life . i do n't say that concept and idea are not at all import but they are a littl less import than to learn fact . i can tell that it may be ani subject which a student take but he can better understand the concept if and onli if he find that in realiti . i also agre that onli a few student can understand the subject through idea and concept which are given in the textbook and the other case of student find a differ sourc to studi that is muge up the idea and concept and present them in the final paper . thu , atlast my statement is that learn the fact should be given more import than understand idea . a student can better understand an idea onli when it is appli in realiti .
