in the modern world that we know , a lot of differ product are avail . are we alway awar care about all those product ? should it be the respons of compani to make sure custom know everyth about risk that could creat by use their product ? in fact , the law want that all risk concern a product be identifi by the produc . some believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . personn , i do n't agre with thi . those advertis make you think twice , and at least , they make sure the custom is awar about risk . first , those advertis make you thing twice befor to buy a product like alcool are tabaco . also , usulli those argument are pretti stronght and they make yourself consider it a littl bit more befor use it . also , i have seen on pack of cigarett , in canada , photograph which are illustr deseas that can be caus by tabaco . thi is ugli , that freak you out the first time you see it . thi wo n't make a product more attract for custom . second , at least it inform about some risk that custom may not know concern the product itself . it could be hard to believ for some peopl , but it may happen to anybodi to use a product and do n't be awar about the effect . if somebodi have n't told you or teach you , how can you be awar ? compani must be respons about what they are offer to the popul . final , i believ that the law is not too stronght concern advertis on product . they do n't realli make product seem much better than they realli are . they make sure that everybodi is awar about what they will consum or use . it avoid all misunderstood and surpris .
