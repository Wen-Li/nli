we do n't know whi some peopl can success easili than other ? mani peopl may think becaus they are lucki or they have alway had some peopl to help them . howev , in my opinion , i do agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk raher than onli do waht they alreadi know how to do well . becaus they are more creativ and they know how to integrat their knowledg than other . first of all , creativ peopl have more chanc to be success . if a person ha a new use idea to chang old stuff , the person could have more chanc to be success . for ecxampl , one of my friend , he ha alway had new idea to open hi new busi and he can find out the new busi that other peopl ca n't see . even thought , there are mani rsik but he is will to face thi challeng and to get over it . what i mean is that if a person ha a creativ person and understand where the rsik are . thi way a person will have more chanc to be success . therefor , i would say creativ and awar of risk will provid peopl more chanc to be success . secondli , the abil to integrat our knowledg can help us success . in the case of my friend , he ha studi in bussi school . dure the school time , he studi mani differ subject such as account , fincial manag or case studi . base on these skill , he knew how to combin hi knowledg in order to find out the risk and creat new busi . henc , i would say the abil to integrat our knowledg is a basic skill to be success . to sum up , mani peopl wonder how can they be success ? the problem is that we do n't integrat and use our knowledg , be more creativ and be awar of the rsik . howev , in my believ , i would say these are import characterist to be success .
