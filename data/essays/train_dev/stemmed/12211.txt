there can be mani opinion in thi topic that twenti year later car will be fewer than today . actual the oil and ga will be gone in 21c . howev i disagre with thi statement . becaus car is develop veri fast and in some year we can need just 1liter of oil to go 30km . moreov befor the oil and ga gone scientist will make new car that go by electr or by sun light . first , car is develop extemli fast . befor 10year normal car can go 5or 6km by 1liter of oil , howev now car can go 18km by just 1liter of oil . and now car is develop veri fast that , we can not imagin . for exampl , their wa a car that , go 5km per 1liter of oil . and in the futur car will go 30km per 1liter of oil . than oil need 1/6 than the past . howev scientist calcul that onli 40year left to use all of oil and ga . howev when car develop like thi , the time will be spent 120 year to use all of oil and ga . and of cours you will chang your car when you use 15 ~ 20year . than it mean after 20year there will be a plenti of car by develop of car . second , scientist will develop and make the car that do not need ani oil and ga . like electron car or sun light power car . now vent the car compani is develop the electron car and sun light power car . and vent compani will make that car in 20year . that mean in 20year peopl do not need oil and ga car anymor . for exampl , the oil and ga price rise up , like 3time than now . after that oil price rise up car compani made electron and sun light power car . than what do you prefer to buy ? new car or oil and ga power car . mani peopl will buy the new power car . than there can be a plenti of car on the street like now day . in my opinion i think there will be plenti of car after 20year . becaus car will be develop veri fast and scientist will make electron car or sunlight power car . and thi will make peopl to ride car after 20year
