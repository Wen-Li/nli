in thi point of statement , i think is difficult to peopl who tri new thing take risk . i disagre with statement becaus i think peopl tri new thing have lot of avantag than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well becaus when you tri a thing like cloth or shoe they can see if it 's good or not and if it is their size . but onli do what they alreadi know how to do well is extrem difficult and take risk , they just feel if that product is good . it 's not usual feel show that product is good even though it is new . the second one they can not tast it . mayb , after bought new think without tast and go home at far place where thing were bought what whould they do ? there mani disavantag when they onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i prefer tri new thing befor , at least i would make more
