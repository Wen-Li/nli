firstli , i thing that have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject may be , cultur speak , realli interest but that it can also lead to a confus profession guid line in the futur . therefor , the first object that each student should have will be , to my point of view , to find out what they will be in ten year in order to have a clear object dure all their studi . even tough , it is , obvious , realli hard to now at 18 year old what you will be in the futur , i profundli believ that the question should be rais care in order to creat the student motiv . moreov , i do believ that at one stage or anoth we have to find out what we realli want to do and then , in order to achiev , thi object to special ourselv . to take a simpl exampl , at the end of my bachelor degre in foreign languag i did realiz that thi section wa not diversifi enough , so i decid to chang for anoth direct : intern commerc . my point , is that it is import to focu on a specif guid line but without be too specif . nevertheless , be stuck in a specif subject can be prove to be a handicap for the search of a job latter on . in fact , for some subject a specif can put the student in a veri difficult posit , for exampl we all know that nowaday some depart or branch or no longer relev or can not be provid ani more . student that are special in these subject will therefor have problem to find a job at the en d of their studi and they will probabl have to pass anoth univers diploma to get a more gener degre in order to find a job .
