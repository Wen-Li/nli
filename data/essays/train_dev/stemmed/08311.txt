a plethora of method of travel are avail these day . the main two way would be travel privat and travel publicli . in other word , a person can travel by himself/herself or with a small group of familiar peopl and he/sh can also travel in a tour guid . although travel in a group led by a tour guid would allow me to gain more inform about a particular place that i travel in , i would rather travel by myself or with my friend or famili . one of the requir of tour guid is that there is a specif schedul that everybodi ha to follow . therefor , the peopl in a tour guid have to chang their daili lifestyl . when i went to a colleg tour with my friend , i had to wake up much earlier then i usual do and eat meal at time that i wa not use to . in addit , if somebodi fail to follow the schedul , everybodi els ha to wait and the trip would not be as pleasant . consequ , it is better to travel in a privat group . not onli follow a schedul , but also confront unfamiliar peopl could be uncomfort dure a trip . there are usual a myriad of peopl who are unfamiliar ; therefor , they can not act natur or be themselv with each other . sinc be comfort is veri signific and valuabl in a trip , travel in a tour guid is not prefer . anoth aspect of travel that a tour guid lack is the limit of time and place . sinc there are specif time and place , peopl might not be abl to go somewher they want to or stay as long as they want to . therefor , travel with a tour guid is not an effect way to fulli enjoy a trip . some peopl who consid travel in a group led by a tour guid as the best way to travel might suggest that peopl can go to import and histor place that averag peopl might not be awar of . howev , thi advantag can be easili achiev by simpli research or read book about a particular place . as a result , a profession help from a tour guid is not necessari to accomplish the best experi of travel .
