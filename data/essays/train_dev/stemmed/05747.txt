in my opinion , knowled is present the fuel that is drive the engin of the global economi today . howev , the exact natur of knowledg that is fuell growth is new-knowledg rather than re-hash of old knowledg . it is henc my assert that thi is the day and age of special . henc , i disagre with the statement that it is better to have a broad knbowledg of mani acadam subject rather than special in one field . success , in today world is monopol my super-specialist . be it the invest banker who make million deal oni in hedg fund , or a doctor who onli treat with patient with one ailment . the human race in gener , and scienc in particular , ha advanc so far today that it is imposs for someon to replic madam curi uniqu achiev of be bestow with two nobel prize in two seper field . i would like to draw an analog between acadam knowledg and day to day life . in a marketplac there is a barber shop you go to to get your hair cut . in the same marketplac there is a bakeri where you buy bread . the barber doe not know too much about bake while the baker is not realli adept at cut hair . the market place thrive , despit not have a barber shop cum bakeri . if the market place can thrive use special how can acadam knowledg be wors off by it . in ani case knowledg is so infinit that what i ( and thi hold true for even the smartest person in the world ) know , is but a small fraction of what i do n't know . if there is no chanc that i am ever go to know everyth regard all the subject , whi should i not choos a particular subject and master it .
