in my opinion i disagre with the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well. '' the reason for whi i do not support that statement are written below . firstli , when a person doe a job for a long time and repeat the activ of hi or her work over and over again , they becom special in the work that they execut on a daili base and thi suggest that the person do the job is best suit for it and that also mean that that person doe not have to worri about be unemploy ani time soon wheara when a person decid to take on a task that he or she know noth about , thi mean that they are unsur of what they are good at and that they live their live by the moment which is not a smart decis for anyon . also when a person is firmiliar with their work , new way on how to preform a task are develop and thi save time for the person do the job , and also increas product which in turn increas profit the buis make , but if a person keep on jump from job to job and not get himself firmiliar with ani one job , thi will most probabl end in a buis lose profit becaus the work wa not done by a profession . so mani peopl in the world today take risk in the job they do but it is a known fact that onli a few of them ever prevail and achiev their dream . so final , i would like to end thi essay by say that eventhough take risk can sometim turn out good for a person we should not think that we will be lucki enough to have such goo fortun and instead we should work on the thing we know best inord to succeed in thi life .
