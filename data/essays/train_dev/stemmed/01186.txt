i disagre with that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . theer are three reason i disagre with thi statement . it is import for student to learn fact befor they learn idea and concept becaus learn without fact must be hard to understand what they are learn about . after they know the fact , it would lead student to understand what they are learn easier . as my experi , when i wa learn about the world war two , i could not get what the teacher want to tell us . and my teacher brought a video of peopl after the atom bomb . it wa show the smoke of the bomb and how the bomb affect peopl 's bodi . then i could start focus on the histori of war . the fact can get attent from peopl to learn . for exampl , the discrimin of african american in 1970 wa not big deal for japanes teenag for now , but it is absolut big deal for the african american still . to know the fact such as what happen to african american in 1970 make peopl to understand the discrimin and how bad it is . thi mean peopl get concept of studi someth import , and it is veri signific to be educ or have knowledg what is go on thi world becaus to see the fact make world peac . the world peac are not abl to made by onli one person . all of the peopl in thi world need to have same level of inform and truth . if peopl tri to hide the truth , fact , other get a fear and anger . it is go to make misunderstand among peopl in the world . the fact in the past can not be chang , so peopl need to admit what they did or what they have been by other . it is import and easi for student to know fact first when student tri to understand concept of the studi . the concept need to be though the fact becaus the fact make peopl to know and understand even thought it is not about their problem . then peopl might be start what they need to for the fact .
