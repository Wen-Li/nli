in my point of view , young peopl enjoy more life than old becaus they have less experi in the life . i agre that young peopl have more fun becaus they have no or less problem than thi older . besid they have less respons . for exampl someom who ha a child have a lot of respons , he doe not give a bad imag of him to hi child . sometim , they have mayb sometim problem of money in to pay tax or someth like that and thi braek the envoy life . moreov , i think old peopl have aleradi live a good time when they were young . for them , i think it ' more difficult to find anoth way in order to have fun becaus they have alreadi do thi . young peopl have more fun becaus they need it and in the most part of time they are lone , they can make what they want to do without to be judg by anyon . for exampl in the street you can ware what you like and got the color of hair like you want . howerv , older peopl have more time in order to envoy life , in the most of case they have finish to work and have enough money to do their hobbi . in the other side , i think when we have a passion in your life you can enjoy your life like no other as if you are more older . for exampl , a older who like sport can enjoy hi life becaus they do what he like . as a result , i think enjoy your life no depend of your age but onli of the situat and the problem or responsabiliti and then i think it is so a question of passion .
