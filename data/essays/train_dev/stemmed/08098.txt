i disagre the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid for sever reason . in my opinion and person experi , there are mani disadvantag of travel in a gruop such as time limit , bad servic atitud and worng shop locat . the first import reason whi i disagre thi idea becaus time limitaion . there are mani locat in one day and never have enough time to spend . therefor , we do n't enjoy ani locat and also wast our time at some locat are not necessari to stop by . furthermor , sinc the group trip ha so mani locat need to go , most time of the trip spend on the bu in stead of walk around and talk with local reisdent . also , a tour guid 's servic atitud affect the whole trip . i use to travel with a tour guid who is not think care and rude sometim . if ani vistor in a group with a bad tour guid , thi trip wo n't be fun . it 's sad that most trip we ca n't choos tour guid . furthermor , everytim we travel in a group led by a tour guid who alway led us to a unreason depart store or other shop where shop owner and tour guid can share the grant . thi is the most reason i will not travel in a group . it happend a lot in south asia and china . whenev i want to travel somwher , i will ask for peopl 's opinion and research ani good locat . it is the best way to travel . i will not recomand to anyon who want to trave in a group in south asia and china .
