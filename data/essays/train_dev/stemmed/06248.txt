in my point of view i would agre that in twenti year from now there will be fewer car in use than today . lack of non renew fuel , stress on ecofriendli environ and new technolog will perhap reduc the usag of car in the futur . the fuel which most of the car in today world use is the deriv of crude oil like petrol , diesel , ga etc. these are consid as the non-renew sourc of energi that they can not be recycl . onc consum they are lost for ever . keep in view the current demand of thi fuel usag , and the shortag of resourc of suppli , the product of oil will reduc rapidli . the price will be increas abnorm which doe not fit the budget of most car owner . henc they have to shift to other mean of public transport such as railroad or buse . the present soceiti around us is slowli gain the `` eco '' feel . issu like global warm and the greenhous effect are increas the public awar and therebi less pollut free environ is in contin demand . henc peopl of the futur will be forc to use eco friendli mean of transport . technolog develop is an unend process . everi decad wit newer technolog develop that benefit the peopl and societi . the usag of electr and other eco friendli fuel in mean of transport is slowli pick up . may be advanc version of the present day car will come into use . these new transport may gain popular as they compli with the abov two reason of non pollut and also oil and ga free . final as the time advanc mani more chang can be wit which serv in reduc pollut as well as ensur better comfort and effici . who know ? the tradit `` car '' that ha becom a part and parcel of today life may be own by a few and may also decor the platform of a mani museum !
