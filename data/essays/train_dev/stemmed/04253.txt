i agre with thi statemet becaus , gener , and even if certain old person larg enjoy their live , young peopl are more like to enjoy their live for mani reason . first of all , older person often have disabl or ill . when they begin to grow older , peopl 's bodi begin to be less and less effect , they may loos some reflex or their mind for exampl . they may also have heart diseas and be afraid to do some thing . usual , they do less and less thing . howev , young peopl will have a more effect bodi , they are at their optim age and are most of the time abl to do sportiv activ , to danc , to go to bed later . .. they are abl to do some thing that older peopl can not do . most young peopl also enjoy life more than older person becaus they think they still have a long life to live , and they prefer live their live as best as they can and do the craziest thing while they are young and still abl to do them , and also crazi enough to do them . when peopl grow older , they know their live may be end soon , and they often think that they have live enough thing in their live to die peac and happili . moreov , peopl often do less crazi thing when they grow older becaus they often have more respons . they may have a famili , children or grandchildren that younger peopl do not have , and they do not want their famili to loos them , so they live a quieter and a more peac life , and thu sometim enjoy less their live than younger peopl . but i also think that some peopl may enjoy a quiet life , but some peopl may like to do crazi thing , even at an old age . i think that some peopl who like to live a quiet life may still enjoy their live when they are older while those who like to live a less quieter life but who are oblig to do so becaus of diseas or ill must not enjoy their live veri much . some young peopl may also not enjoy their live . in a conclus , i think that young peopl often enjoy more their live than older peopl , but i aalso think that old and young peopl can both enjoy or not enjoy their live . i think it is a question of charact and person .
