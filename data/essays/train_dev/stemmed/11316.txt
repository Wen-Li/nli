nowaday most product are advertis in order to be well sell . but do advertis make product seem much better than they realli are ? first an advertis is made to sell a product that could be brought back to the shop if it doe not suit the custom , who might dispis the brand and not onli the product if he is unhappi with it . therefor it ha to aim at the good buyer . it need to describ the product in a posit way , of cours , but in a honest way . but mani peopl do not realli care . and as some advertis make a hole stori about a useless tool , it competitor have to go further to make their product look better . for exampl , we first got `` the wash powder that wash white '' . then a coupl of year later as peopl got use to thi statement , we got `` the wash powder that wash whiter than white '' , whitch doe not mean ani thing at all . what is whiter than white ? coluch say , in one of hi scketch , that he wa afraid to use one of them becaus he wa afraid it would make hi cloth disapear ! but as peopl buy product with such an exager advertis , i think it encourag the brand to make them . anoth thing that make advertis make product seem much better than they realli are is that everyth about the product that is not good , all it downsid , are onli written in so tini letter that nobodi can read them . that partial hide the truth about the product and , of cours , make it more attract . for exampl , when you see an advertis about an internet connexion for 19 euro a month you are happi . but when you sign in and you notic it is 19 euro a month onli for the first three month and then the price doubl , you are disapoint . that is whi i total agre with thi statement : `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are ''
