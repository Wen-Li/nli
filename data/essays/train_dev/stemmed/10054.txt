i agre with that statement becaus innov , experiment are part of the risk peopl need to take in order lo learn new thing . if we keep do thing the old way is not room for improv , knowledg , advanc in technolog just to name a few , and it will be no progress at all . in order to suc we need to keep look for new altern that allow us to grow fast enough as the rest of the scienci , like for exampl when sir isaac newton creat the ligth bulb wa after mani attempt hi mind wa hungri to discov new thing . if he did not take a risk and keep on tri we will be still use candl to illumin our home . in the same way construct compani they have to keep loke for better solut for all the hous problem , everi day is a new and advanc equip in the market that will help them to provid to the popul a safer , confort , affort and prettier look to the construct . not so far down , what about the medic advanc we have now and all of that thank to peopl that doe investig even though sometim they are exposs to sever degre of pressur , but at the end everyth is for our own good as a societi , for the better futur . no to mention poor peopl that were idealist and start a bussin just base in hope and nowday they are veryr succes in wathev they decid to do like for in gener term i believ that the person that doe not take risk is loos somenth whether is an opportun to grow , to suc , to creat , etc.in my countri we have a popular say that say that if you do not risk an egg you would not get a chicken !!!
