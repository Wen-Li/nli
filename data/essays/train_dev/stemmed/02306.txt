we all are familiar with the phrase ` knowledg is power ' . which is inde a truth in itself as knowleg af ani kind nerver let you down when you are in a crunch situat . therefor i agre that it is better to have knowledg of mani subject as it make an individu intellectu sound and impart in him the qualiti of decis make . it can be a good option to special in one specif subject if one is realli interest in ani reasearch activ but otherwis it should be divers and should consist mani interest topic within hi select cours and also have some gener subject like art , ecolog , biolog etc . it help individu to be more power in thi competet world . in order to surviv in thi world one should have a qualiti to adapt to ani situat and that is onli possibl if he ha a chanc to navig through the vast ocean of knowledg . i can give my own exampl . i had a subject in highschool name scoteer-motor cycl repair . it wa an option subject which taught me some basic of how to servic our bike , how to maintain them . the advantag now i am have that i can servic my own bike free of cost . it also help me in keeop by bike in good condit . so we can see that the subject which seem to have no weightag in my acedema rather help me in my futur to save money , which is inde a requir of the time for me now . so we can conclud that no knowledg goe wast . somewher sometim in our life we may requir to use the knowledg which wa learnt just as a formal in the classroom . so it better to be prepar for our life with vast knowledg from broad knowledg rather than have a approach of get limit common-sens knowledg by learn specif subject .
