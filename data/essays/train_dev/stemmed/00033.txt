i disagre with that understand idea and concept is more import than understand fact . i think lern fact is better than understand idea and concept . first , understand idea and concept might be difficult for some student . howev , they would be abl to guess what idea and concept are by lern fact . onli be lern by someon doe not make thier thought develop . think by themselv is best thing to halp their thought . second , even thogh understand idea and concept is import , thing do not alway happen by follownig idea and concept . sometim other result that student can not expect from the idea and concept which they understand may happen . yet understand fact tell student that whan kind of result would happen , and thi make them easier to understand thing . third , some student might misunderstand these idea and concept , and they would make mistak , but student who understand fact at first can get along thing , becaus they alreadi know what kind of thing they have to be done . for these reason i disagre thi statement .
