thi question can be answer differ depend on the context we are speak about : if we are look at the profession environ , i tend to disagre with thi statement , wherea as regard the person life , i would rather agre with thi asumpt . fistli in the profession world , my opinion is that is it better to know deepli well a subject or a to be particularli perform in one specif compet , than to know how to do a littl of everyth ! it is quit obviou , especi in big compani , that you are design for a mission that peopl want you to perfom the most correctli as possibl , and even better , to be realli good in your specif job , impress and reliabl at the same time . it is useless to be capabl of accomplish some of the task of each servic but do be unabl to occupi a function in it total . i do not have the same point of view concern the person life : inde , i think that have broad knowledg of mani subject , either academ or cultur , is realli more valuabl and use than have knowledg onli in one or two particular field . becaus all the time when you are speak with peopl about all the subject other than the one you are compet about , you look complet ignor and stupid . howev , i think that what everi person tend to do inconci is to focu on some subject that rais her interest , and for which it requir less effort to memor inform about . it even doe not requir ani effort at all to learn thing about someth that anyway passion you , it is rather a pleasur . one exapl in my person experi is that i am fond of horserid , and consequ know a lot of thing on my favorit hobbi , but all thi knowledg is one i meanwhil do not have on other subject . the problem of know a lot of answer on a lot of differ topic is a problem that i know well , as what i am tri to improv in my daili life is my person broad knowledg . dure the whole of my initi school train , that is to say until the french lyce , i complet disinterest myself of all the academ lesson that bring you with gener knowledg , such as histori , geographi , litteratur . to me , at that time , these lesson where of no interest in my daili life , but today i struggl to recov my lack , becaus they are sometim use in the daili life , but rather more becaus now my interest final wake up toward a lot of variou subject . also becaus travel open the horizon , the spiritu and philosoph awar , i hope i will have the opportun to accumul a lot of experi in my futur life , and that my children will have thi chanc too . it is realli a trap , the fact to limit oneself to one 's daili life and special profession task or context , and to stay in one 's own routin . we should tri to learn new thing everi day and to take initi , to take profit of all the treasur of life
