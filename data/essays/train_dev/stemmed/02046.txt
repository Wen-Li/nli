i am in complet agreement of the statement that it more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , due to sever reason . first , understand of ani concept or idea or one can say the concept behind the idea will ultim lead to the `` fact '' . at thi stage student will be abl to figur out the underli principl behind the fact . in other word they will be abl to understand the principl govern a fact . for exampl , if you throw anyth upward it will come down , thi is a fact . now in other word we can defin thi phenomenon by first introduc the concept of gravit forc . moreov if add a littl detail to the concept that if someth is thrown at it certain veloc will not return to earth , it becom more interest . now at thi stage the student ha understand of the concept fo gravitaion . he will be abl to understand the rule guid the fact and he would move one step further to understand that critic `` veloc '' . thi make learn more fun and open door for explor idea . secondli , learn onli fact without their understand will invok sens of mug . the student will not bother about the hidden principl and thi will restrict their scope of educ . in the gener situat also we hardli bother about other rout to a destin if we have a shortcut , if it fullfil your requir , even though it congest and pollut . so it a gener human tendenc . final , if we limit our scope of knowledg then what would happen to the billion of book in the liberari ? isnt it worth think of ? access to the knowledg is a fundament rite , limit learn to fact onli will definet hamper in one or the other way of a person fundament rite .
