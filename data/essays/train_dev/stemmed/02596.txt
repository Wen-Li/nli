inde i disagre that young peopl enjoy their life more than old peopl becaus i believ that old peopl have more time to enjoy themselv , have less respons and have a good life experi and resourc which they can use to enjoy themselv . old peopl usual have much time for enjoy . they are almost retir after they finish their work time and so they will concentr on enjoy theirselv through travel abroad or did their own favorit hobbi like read , paint , etc . .. other import thing which enabl elderli to enjoy their life is the fact that they are free . they have no much respons to do . they are alreadi retir from work so they will not care about their boss or their duti . their kid are independ now so they will not worri about them . all these factor give old peopl time and chanc to enjoy themselv and not anyth els . the life experi and knowledg usual old peopl gain from their long enrol in work , read and deal with peopl will sure offer them the capabl to enjoy their time . they know most place which worth visit . they know how to choos their friend and peer , and they can deal with ani problem might face them . in addit to that old peopl might collect much more money than young did , so they can use their money in enjoy . in conclus , i believ that old peopl can enjoy their life much better than young peopl do , thi is becaus old peopl have more time and money , got better experi , and lastli they are free from respons which the young peopl have .
