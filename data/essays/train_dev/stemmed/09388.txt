i beleiv that , it is onli peopl who will to take risk would becom sucess . onc a person is sucess he would alway want to incres hi popular by tri out new thing . he would never want hi busi or compani to be stagnant . in today competit world , peopl are paid for their creativ and creativ is noth but tri or find new way and thing . first of all let us consid the field of act . a moviestar would becom sucess becaus of a particular kind of role . for exampl shah rukh khan , becam popular for the role of a lover . but he doesnt portray the same role in all hi movi . he ha act as a villian , an action hereo etc , and still he is the number one hero in india . hi sucess in the role of a lover boy did not constrain him from tri other role . infact he is one of the most versatil actor in india . let us take up industri as anoth exampl . a compani would becom sucess for a particular produt say a chocol . the peopl of the compani would not stop at thi point by sell onli their popular product . instead they would tri to ventur other area like ice cream or even soap or shampoo . carri out the same techniqu may alway not lead to sucess as mani other peopl could have copi the same techniqu . well it is alway safe to carri out thing the way one alreadi know and there may be no fear of loss or failurewhil take a new way may end up in a problem . i feel it is better to take risk and enjoy the sucess it bring . thu take risk and tri out new way ha it own advantag and disadvantag , one need to be dare enough to take the risk .
