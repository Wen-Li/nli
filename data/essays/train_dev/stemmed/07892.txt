micheal jordan success as an amaz nba basketbal player , just as much as tom cruis success as one of the most popular actor in hollywood . they both becam to be well known peopl , howev they are known for differ reason and talent . thi show that peopl are good at differ thing , and focus on their best talent is the key to success . i disagre to the statement , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . special in one scecif subject is a more definit way to suc , it let you focu better , and it is less stress . one reason to support my opinion , is that special in one specif subject is a more definit way to suc in the futur . i feel that have a more broad knowledg of mani academ subject , onli help you in your childhood . tri to earn good grade in all of the class you are take , may be the pressur for think that it is better to have a broad knowledg . have a broad knowledg may also set you off to find what you are good at . howev , i believ that what is most import is what you becom as , and work hard on what you are good at would actual get you somewher in life . anoth reason whi i feel that special in one subject in better than to have a broad knowledg of variou subect , is so you could focu better . tri hard ro on subject when you know you have to for anoth one , could be distract . i feel that work hard for one subject would let you concentr better . final , i feel that it is less stress to special in one subject . for exampl , i believ that it is difficult for someon to be good in both write and mathemat . i believ that peopl usual do not like what they are not good at . if there are subject that you would prefer not to take , becaus you know that you are not good at , you should rather work hard in a subject you know you like to do . my friend who is veri talent in art , is unfortun not veri talent in mathemat . so , what she doe is that she doe not take ani mathema in conclus , i feel that special in one specif subject rather than have a broad knwledg of mani academ subject would lead you for a happier life .
