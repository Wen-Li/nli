i think that actual it is better to special in one specif subject rather than have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject ; becaus in thi way a person will have a great knowledg of it 's own campu and will be abl to investig more about it , get deep into it , and dedic enough time to get a complet manag of thi subject . our world is special , everyth is divid and classifi . everyth is organ and put in a way that everi littl thing is differ to the other . the perfect examapl of thi is a carreer in colleg . the program are divid into faculti and the career that a person can pick of , like : engin , busi , teach , music , medicin , etc . everi singl one of the mention befor is special in a field of studi , and deal with differ aspect of knowledg , math , biolog , languag , polit , etc . a world of possibl . it is not possibl to a human be know all about someth ; just a littl bit of everyth . if a person dedic it 's entir life to studi astronomi ; investig , make studi , ask question , promot project , etc. , sure will get far and will adquir a huge knowledeg in thi field . that person will go beyond than someon who studi a littl bit of mani academ subject . thi take time and effort , and there is not enough time in a human be 's life to get knowledg in mani mani differ subject and get as far as if there is special in one specif subject . in the school , the kid get all the basic knowledg they need to start . then is their decis to go for the subject that they are more interest on . thi doe not mean that a person ha to special in one and onli one subject and can not know anyht about anyth els . thi just mean that that person will be more wise in that specif field and will contribut more to societi and the world . special in one specif subject is equal to a better and deepest understad of it .
