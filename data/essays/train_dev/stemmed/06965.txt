thi question ha two answer for me , becaus i agre and disagre at the same time . i will first tell you whi i think it is better to be special on one subject , and then i will explain to you whi for me you gain more by have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . first of all i have to say that if you know a lot about a great deal of subject you can not be a specialist in one subject . you can talk about a lot of think , but you will keep on talk about the basic of those think . you would not be abl to go deep into a convers . howev on the other hand i think it is more interest to learn about differ topic . i do not think your brain is limit to a number of knowledg , so for me it is alway good to learn new thing . the more you know about thing , the more you are open mind . i personali think it is veri import to be open mind , becaus then you becom more toler , and you accept more , and learn more again . if you know a larg rang of thing , you are also abl to talk about more thing , so you are not left over on certain convers . in my opinion it is veri import to be curiou , to discov and to experi a lot of thing . the more you do , the more you learn , and life becom more interest . howev it is also necessari to be specialis in one subject . when you are specialis you becom more precis , and you can go deeper into the subject , it becom more interest than to stay on the basic of one subject . like everyth in life it is a question of balanc .
