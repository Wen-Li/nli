some pepl agre to the statement becaus the duti of young peopl is consentr on studi at school . howev , i think three much benefici point for youong pepl to give enough time to help their commun . the first reason is that young peopl help their commun can experi not at their school . they may go to the hous whitch the elderli person live , and help to eat food and walk . and they may be babysitt , and be abl to studi how to deal with babi . those experi are not given from school . the second reason is that help their commun bring mani friend who are not belong to their school . from my experi , when i wa high school student , i paricip in the english educ school for children of my commun . i made mani friend who are not high school student , and they are now the best friend for me . the third reason is that pepl can not make time to help their commun when pepl work in compani . so , young pepl , who have much free time than worker , should pay much time to help their commun . terefor i disagr to young pepl do not give enough time to help their commun . there are much better to belong the commun .
