from my point of view it is right , that peopl nowaday do not give enoguth time to help their communit . i have the impress that the world we live in is a world of individu . everyon just seem to live next to each other but not actual togeth . in the past peopl , were forc to do certain thing togeth and help each other . nowaday the technoloci chang ha made mani thing easier and less harder . thu we have becom lazier and concern mani thing we do not have to reli on each other ani more . that 's the reason whi we becam more selfish and lazi . mani peopl choos to spend their time in front of the tv instead of help their commun . as an exampl the amount of young men who do civil servic decreas over all . most men neither go to the armi , no do civil servic : they just do not do anyth . but without civil servic our whole social system would not function ani more . it is extremli import , that the young peopl take care of the old peopl and help them with their basic need . in the end it come down to a discuss of valu . i am convinc , that there ha been a moral chang . nowaday for mani peopl it seem to be most import to look after their own , to focu on their live , sucess and wealth . regard thi help other in the commun doe not seem to be relev ani more . everyon is respons for hi own life and luck . moreov it might be a problem that peopl do not indentifi and relat enoguth with their commun ani more . thi lack of identif hamper them to play an activ role in the commun . due to immigr peopl with differ cultur rood and with differ kind of religion live togeth in one commun but do not feel connect to each other . in addit the problem we have to face as a commun todaz have becom more complex in the process of globalis . they are no longer as limit as the might have been in previou day . but especi regard thi , i come to the conclus that even more help in the commun is need
