i agre with the statement that most adevertis make product seem much better than they realli are . as a matter of fact , i believ that thi is precis the whole purpos of advertis : convinc potenti consum of the good qualiti or advantag of a specif product or item . it is the ultim goal that the consum , buyer , or custom doe what is be recommend in the ad . unfortun , peopl in advertis busi may use all sort of techniqu to sound convinc and be effect , which goe from mention onli good qualiti - and exclud those which are not so good - to emphas the bad qualiti of altern product or servic . for exampl , ani shampoo advertis will claim that it will make hair get shinier , glossier , and easi to handl in , probabl `` no time '' . is it true ? if we carri out a research to classifi hair product ( just to choos ani product ) into those which are effect and those which are not , we would probabl end up with a ration of 1 to 9 . for one effect shampoo , there are 9 which `` claim '' to be but they are not . as consum , advertis have made us less gullibl and more alert , as well as more care when we make decis on the basi of impress creat by advertis . by make a comparison , advertis are similar to the reflect on a rear-view mirror , reason whi a sticker read `` object in rear view mirror are closer than they appear '' . we need to widen the use of thi statement to mani other context . i person think that , although there are regul to control the advertis busi in term of use true/untru statement and claim result that they do n't actual deliv and sometim even caus other , there is a strong need for further more-detail regul regard the use of mislead techniqu which make consum make wrong decis . consum should be better protect becaus most advertis use question technoqu which manipul the truth and that is dishonesti . .
