i feel that the young peopl enjoy there life more than the older onc becaus the young peopl do n't have ani respons . for exampl compar with a girl to her mother . basic a girl onli ha a respons to studi and if she ha finish do it , she probabilli enjoy by freek out with friend to a good place orbi go to some friend hous . but her mother who ha mani respons like her daughter , and the other child she had so basic she is busi in her respons . she dont atleast do n't find time to enjoy . and if she is a work women she ha to move to her job in the morn and when she return to home she need to do some work like cook and clean the home . so final she is tire at the end of the day and she dont atleast have time to enjoy and she feel to take rest . but basic enjoy also depend on the peopl charact some peopl are there who realli enjoy there work they feel that they enjoy by do their work properli . and some peopl enjoy all the time by make fun . i feel age is not the matter to enjoy or respons are not the part which stop the peopl to enjoy . and the older peopl enjoy realli when they complet there respons in a proper way the feel proud and they do enjoy there job . but enjoy is the job what we have done in a proper way with out harm or hurt the other peopl , but the enjoy should be in such a way that the person besid you should also enjoy . the young peopl enjoy by freek out to parti and the older peopl enjoy by fulfil there responsibilit . so probabilli both the gener enjoy but in the way they enjoy is differ .
