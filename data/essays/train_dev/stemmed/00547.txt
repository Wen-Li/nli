the statement propos could be consider correct in some case but incorrect in other . the two possibl rappres two kind of idea , and the use of the first one , in opposit of use of the second one is differ case by case . i prefear to have a special knowledg in one specif subject . the motiv of my person choos is the strong possibl rappres by thi opportun . if you are the best in an argument you will be call everytim someon need help on it . an exampl is the use of comput in gener . in my univers group i am the best in use of comput and when some friend of mine have problem with comput , he ask me how he can to resolv hi problem and if he need to repair it , he ask my help too . they call me becaus they know i am abl in use comput and they call me onli in thi case . i am abl also to resolv math problem , but my friend never call me to resolv thi type of problem , becaus i have some friend of mine more abl than me to resolv thi kind of problem . i use thi exampl to demonstr that if a person want to decid of use the second sentenc he must be shure of to be veri strong in the argument he choos els is better choos the first sentenc . the first sentenc get opportun for whom is abl to organ himself . the knowledg of mani academ subject permit of use everykind of knowledg in all type of academ subject . is not easi do that and i think thi kind of possibl is for few person . in the end i can say that i use special myself in one specif subject , but i am not agre with second sentenc , but i think everyon have to choos the best opportun for himself .
