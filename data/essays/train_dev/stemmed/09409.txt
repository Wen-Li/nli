i disagre with the statement . in my opinion the best way to travel is alon by yourself . travel alon you can wander for mani place know the cultur of the place that you visit . also you can spend your time with nativ peopl who show you the ident of such societi . when i go abroad i tri to travel alon becaus you can know the cultur and the way of life of the peopl . if you travel with a tour guid you could probabl know about the histori of the place or other topic that you can read in a book . when you travel alon you can wander for sever place not onli to the common place such as landscap or museum . you can walk throughout the citi without a fix schedul visit the place that you want . i like to travel alon instead of travel in a group . if a travel alon i can spend a lot of time know nativ peopl . i can share their custom or their way of life and learn the nativ languag as well . when you travel in a group you should do anyth that the major want . if you travel in group you would spend more time with your group than nativ peopl . i have visit sever countri and i have tri to spend most of my time with nativ peopl . i believ that is not the best way to travel led by a tour guid or travel in a group . if you travel alon you can learn the cultur of such place like a nativ . you can know mani issu that you can not know if you travel like a tourist in a group . i like to travel alon becaus i can spend a lot of time with nativ peopl know their problem and thier way of life . therefor , i prefer to travel alon by myself than to travel in a group led by a tour guid .
