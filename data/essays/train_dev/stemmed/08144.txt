folow the statement that `` the best way to travel is witha tour guid '' , i strongli disagre with the idea . i think the idea of travel with a guid take all the charm and the adventur of the trip , also the guid are use to show onli the most common ting on a tour , so mani small and detail thing get out of context . addit , the idea of a tour guid repres a time and rushi tour . initi , the idea of a tour is to take adventur or to just enjoy the beauti of itself . the idea of have a person tell you what to do or to read take my idea of a tour in other direct . i think a trip is meant to be enjoy and as well to be share with peopl you like . therefor , a guid would not onli repres a person who you are not bind to but also someon who eventu will becom a obstacl in your tour . then in order to enjor the charm of a trip is better to do it by oneself . next , guid are train to take you to the place evreyon goe or are the most common place , so in order to see more new exit on a trip , you have to take your own baton . i rememb the time i went to some island in my countri , where the guid alway took us to place that everi one see on televis or the museum . howev , when i left without the guid , i meet more peopl and discov place that not even the guid know . final , i think the biggest problem with guid is the time . becaus they have to cover an schedul , you have to move to their pace and you can not admir what you want with your own time . i think it is better to enjoy one singl moment that visit hundr without even take a time to enjoy or relax . i strongli believ that a person should n't be attach to time in a trip becaus it take away the real mean of a tour , relax . to conclud , i think the best way to make a tour is to do it by themselv . the big bussin of tour guid have destroy the beauti of the tour in mani way and final make it unples on some occas .
