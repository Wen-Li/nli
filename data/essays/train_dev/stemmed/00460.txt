some peopl may think know the fact is more import than know the idea and concept . some peopl may think in differ way . what i suggest is that let student to understand idea and concept it is more import for student onli to learn the fact . refer to the subject i had studi in high school , some of them i can not rememb it clearli , some of them i still have the class pictur in my mind . the differ between these subuject is the subject i still have pictur in my mind is what i had interest in . when peopl learn someth have a interest in it is more effect than have a good teacher in the class . it is not becaus teacher is not import but becaus if someon have the interest in someth thi will help thi person learn better . to understand the idea could help the student to understand the subject more . like learn the languag if someon have that languag background alreadi , it will help that person learn more effect . know someth 's work the idea like the background that person have . know the concept like a person ha some experi befor him to studi someth . everybodi know have experi befor then to start someth could help that person to realli underst the subject alot than the first time . it is as same as someon had studi a subject befor , thi personwil ha more chanc to earn a better mark . therefor , know the concept can not be ingor . it is the basic step to get upper level . in my opinion , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than onli for them to know the fact . usual for student fact are bore , like the meat other person had eaten befor , student can not learn much about it . howev , idea and concept like the fresh meat it is health and student will got a much interest in it .
