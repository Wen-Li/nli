the world is becom a small villag becaus of the technolog . everi year a new discoveri and a new invent is found . long ago the car were one of these invent which made our live much easier and made us abl to go where ever we wish to go in no time or in less time than the time we need to transfer from a place to anoth in the past . of cours in twenti year the technolog will grow rapidli even faster than we can imagin and that mean more way of transport that may cancel the car or make it a second way of transport i realli think that in twenti year there will be fewer car for sever reason . first of all we are all face a great problem with the crowd so poepl are tri to find a better way to go where ever that want to go by use anoth way of transport like the subway for exampl which mean that peopl are tri not to use that car as much as they use to in the past to escap from the crowd so the car will be fewer second of all i 'm sure that there will be more invent that may be better than the car and faster and so peopl will reli on the new invent instead of the car as a way of transport so the car will be fewer . third of all we all know that the car are actual polluti the natur and ha got mani bad effect on the environ and on us therefor the scientist are tri to find way to solv thi problem which mean that they will find a better way for transpot which will be faster , safer and that will not pollut the weather . for these three reason i strongli think that car will be fewer in the futur and new invent will be invent to save the world from the crowd which is everi where and to save the world from the pollut .
