i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . becaus i believ that in the busi world , the sale men alway want to make money in the market , they have to make the product look more attract than they realli are . there are my reason as bellow . first , in the competit real world , the busi man are alway tring to make as much money as they could . in thi manner , they have to convinc customr to buy their product . how can they achiev their goal ? they will tri to over describ the function of the product as it realli doe . the product look more attract in the advertis to persuad the custom to buy the product even they realli not need it . for exampl , i alway buy some stuff that i realli do not need . whi i still buy them ? becaus of the attract advertis made me believ that the product are more effici than i can imagin . second , the busi man have to make their spend and incom get balanc . they spend a lot of money on advertis , such like on the tv show , newspap , magazin , and even on the radio station . if they do not over describ how the product is greater than the other , the custom would not purchas it . in addit , the sale man have to spend money to hire the design who creat the advertis . for these two reason , the sale man have to make more and more money to compens the money they spent on the advertis . to sum up , i believ that the product seem much better in the most advertis than they realli are . we usual found out what the real product is after we bought it and use it . it wast custom ' money to tri it if the sale man could trueli describ the poduct on advertis .
