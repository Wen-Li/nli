peopl have differ opinion on whether in twenti year there will be fewer car in use that there are today . peopl who oppos thi statement argu that in the futur we will also have so mani car due to our conveni . they think that use car are the most conveni way to go anoth place . howev , i disagre with thi statement for two reason . first of all , in the futur , we will have other method to go anoth place . anoth reason is that in twenti year , we will go abroad more often . let me explain the reason in detail . to begin with , in twenti year we will have more develop machin instead of car . when my grand-grandfath wa a child , he can not imagin car which is privail nowaday . he watch car onli in movi . thi wa becaus in the past , wagon or hors were the onli transport . howev , nowaday we have a lot of transport such as bu , subway and airplan . it mean that our technolog ha rapidli develop . therefor , in the futur , we will have more technolog transport . next , in the futur we can go abroad more frenquent . it mean that we feel no need to use car . we will usual take airplan instead of car . thi is becaus use car can not go foreign countri . when i wa young , i just travel in my countri . howev , now thing were total differ . recent , mani school plan their vacat for student go abroad . in addit , if they travel anoth countri , they have to take airplan , not car . thi mean that in the futur , we will use airplan for go abroad more often than use car . in conclus , i support the idea which is that in next gener there will be fewer car in use that there are today for the reason that i mention abov . first , we are suppos to have other transport instead of car . second , in the futur , we will go abroad more often . therefor we use airplan frenquent . it bring about decreas of use car .
