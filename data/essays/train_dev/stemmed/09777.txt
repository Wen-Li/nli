in the last fifti year the number of car in use is increas all over the world , expeci in europ and in the north of america . in thees countri almost everybodi ( between eighteen and sixti year old ) have hi own car and the problem concern with thi situat are becom veri high . the increas of traffic and pollut are two of the more neg result of the excess use of car and nowday there are a lot of purpos to resolv thees problem . mani major , for exampl , suggest to close the a part of their citi to the car and thi will be good also in order to preserv the beauti of the citi centr ( especi if there are histor and artist monument , like in italian citi ) . but thi will creat the problem of move from a place to anoth ( peopl have to go to work or to school ) so it will be necessari to improov the public transport . in my own experi , i 've seen that , depit of all thees purpos , anyth ha been done . it 's realli difficult to renouc to our habit , expeci if a chang mean to live a littl harder than befor . i 'm not veri optimist abuot the futur and i think that the use of car will increas .
