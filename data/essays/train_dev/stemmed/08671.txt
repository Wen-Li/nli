i complet disagre , mainli for three reason . first is that althought youth typic impli health and will to do thing in life . the truth as i see it is that the act of enjoy life is someth that is defin as well as happen in our mind within ourselv and is not someth complet depend on how mani year doe one have . as an exampl of thi there are the lot of young peopl that live in deep depress , sometim clynic sometim not , that clearli do not enjoy life . it is clear that the exampl given in the paragraph abov can be revert . but that bring me precis to my second point . for me is not accur nor complet correct to make gener about a so subject thing as peopl enjoy life more than other peopl . how do we compar the enjoy of one group versu the enjoy of other ? and what is the mean of enjoy life ? all of thi make me more suspici about the given statement . now , my third object is foreshadow in the last paragraph . what do we mean by the phrase `` enjoy life '' ? it is obviou that althought there may be a certain consensu between some peopl about the mean of that phrase , enjoy life doe not mean the same for everyon . less problabl it is that it will mean the same thing for older and younger peopl . so it may be possibl that older and younger peopl enjoy the life the same but within their own definit of what is enjoy life .
