i absolut disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are two point that explain my disagr . the first point are the high cost of a guid trip and the second , more import point are the freedom and the flexibl that one doe not have on such a trip . the first reason of my desagr are the cost . the cost are alway an import part in the plan of my trip . if you chose to travel in a group led by a tour guid , the prize will certainli be higher than if you do the same travel by your own . in a guid group , sever peopl need to get paid for organis and make a trip , for exampl the peopl from the offic , the bu driver and the tourist guid himself . by go on my own , i save all these cost and can spend the money on someth els . the second reason whi i disagre with the statement are the freedom and the flexibl . in a guid group of travel , one ha natur no freedom to do what he or she want to do . the guid tell the peopl when to stay somewher and when to go , when to eat and when to go to the restroom . when i travel , i want to make my own decis . i want to have the possibl to eat when i am hungri , to stay at a place as long as i want or to leav it whenev i like to . connect to thi freedom is flexibl . on a guid trip , everyth is book and schedul and there is no chanc to chang plan dure the trip . howev , i prefer to be flexibl . if i like a place , i want to have the possibl to stay there for longer then i plan . if i travel without guid , i can chang my plan whenev i want to and i am open for knew thing . to sum up , i desagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid becaus the cost are normal to high and becaus it would mean a lack of freedom and flexibl for me if i join a guid group .
