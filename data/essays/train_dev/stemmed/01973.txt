i firmli agre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . in my countri , it is the biggest problem that young peopl do not want to volunt their commun . they just give their time to studi or get a good job . my countri ha a programm that give some point to teenag who help their commun . at first , it wa success becaus everi young adult attend thi programm . howev , after 1990 , educ programm wa chang so student did not want to join commun activ at all . so it chang a duti of student . soon , it chang the hatest programm to young adult . they attend commun ' programm just for get a point , not in seriou . accord to thi situat , i can feel that nowaday ' young peopl do not want to help their villag . also , all commun in my countri are help by adult . if young peopl who live in my town want to join the town club to help their commun , they will depress becaus club presid will not admit them . my communitiy ha strang custom that club member 's age have to over than 30-year-old . it is unfair to young peopl but adult still keep thi custom . it make teenag to do not have attent to their commun . in addit , there are sever research support an import reason that young peopl did not attent to their commun . accoridng the famou scientist team in my countri assert that nowaday ' young peopl are shi and not out-goint than 30 year ago , so they do not show their opinion to other . becaus of young peopl 's person , commun are help by onli adult . although there are countri that total differ from my countri . howev , countri which are locat in eastern world have similar of thi trend . therefor , i claim that young peopl do not give enough time to help their societi .
