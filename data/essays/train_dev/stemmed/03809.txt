i think it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . first of all , i think there is almost no profess onli deal with one academ subject . for exampl , if you studi english literatur , you also need histor , cultur and linguist knowledg to be success in understand your own subject . or if you plan to becom a physicist , you need extent knowledg in biolog , chemistri and especi mathemat . furthermor , to be special in onli one subject caus remark difficulti in privat as well as public life . your relationship will be limit to peopl of your own specif subject and you are not abl to connect or commun with other peopl becaus you can not understand them and vice versa . if you talk to a biologist who doe not know anyth about ani other topic , you will not be abl to talk to him becaus there is noth that connect you . the most import argument for favor a broad knowledg rather than a veri specif one is veri person . for me it is veri import to gain a broad gener knowledg becaus i think peopl with limit specif knowledg also have a limit emot abil . i am sure that peopl who read a lot of differ kind of text can much easier relat to the problem of other peopl than peopl who tend to read text exclus deal with one subject . peopl with knowledg of mani subject can understand situat although they will never have to face them , wherea peopl with restrict knowledg will not be abl to deal with those situat becaus they are beyond their limit horizon . in conclus i may say that a broad knowledg of mani subject make more sens than to special in one specif subject . peopl belong to the first group have advantag in mani differ situat , such as academ , profession , interact as well as emot one , as state abov .
