i am 25 year old , so my person experi onli cover half of the statement , the part regard young peopl ; howev i can look at my rel or at other elder peopl to infer someth about how do thay enjoy life . in a first appoxim , i think that each one enjoy hi \ her life in a differ way , so it is not easi to gener thi evalu distinguish between younger and older peopl . howev , i have to point out that a necessari ( even not suffici ) condit for a person to enjoy hi \ her life is to have a good health ; and it is statist true that older peopl have more chanc to have a bad health apart from thi first consider , there are some other matter of fact about how younger and older conduct their life . in fact , a veri import consider ha to be done about work . younger peopl have to work harder than the older that often are on retir , so the younger have less time to spend for their own enjoy ( and , depend on the retir system , they can also have less money ! ) . nonetheless , young peopl have more opportun to have fun becaus most of entertein better fit to them ( such as disco , some kind of sport activ , some kind of concert or travel , etc . ) . the neg aspect connect with thi wider rang of opportun is that sometim young peopl suffer of a kind of `` anxieti '' of have fun and do lot of thing , which end to make them alway unhappi with what they are do . in fact , it is true that mayb older peopl have a differ way of approach to life that allow them to get the best from everi situat and to enjoy more of simpl thing . thi differ `` way of appreci '' thing perhap deriv from their matur , their whole experi and make their life more relax and sometim more seren . in conclus , i think that it is not possibl to complet agre or disagre with the statement becaus it depend on individu attitud and extern condit how a person can enjoy hi \ her life dure differ period . onc more i see that life is more complic and peopl are more differ one to anoth than it can be describ in a short phrase .
