i think that it 's not possibl to state which is , between a broader knoledg and a more special knowledg , the most use and the most correct at all . howev , as a student in busi administr i tend to believ that a wider prospect on the knowlegd issu may definit help . first of all let ' s consid the work environ : nowaday peopl tend to chang more and more often their job , follow the labour market that demand flexibl and adapt skill . a broader prospect allow peopl to be faster in such an import chang as a new job is , prevent them to suffer from frustrat and from the sens of inadequaci toward their new employ . thi argument is by the way support by the research of a famou italian professor , gianmario verona , senior lectur at bocconi school of manag , as he claim that innov compani tend to employ peopl who show `` t '' skill : the vertic part of the `` t '' repres the knowlegd of a specif subject , but the horizont part remind to the need for broad skill , that the employe is suppos to spend to understand the compani strategi as a whole . moreov , even in more simpl context a wide knowledg is use ; for exampl let 's consid interperson relationship , of ani kind . a broader knowledg posit affect the abil to join activ ani discuss and result in a more interact attitud of the person .
