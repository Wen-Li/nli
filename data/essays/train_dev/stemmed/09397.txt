i believ that in the next twenti year there will be declin in the number of car use today . there are a few reason whi i think so firstli with the immens growth in the popul and scarciti of space avail to live and commut would decreas the number of car . thi is becaus travel on the public transport would be much more conveni than stand in the long traffic jam . second reason would be come up of highli safe and conveni public transport system . the govern is work on such issu and by the end of twenti year would have excel transport system like public buse , train , tram and metro which can take the person to hi destin in much less time than the individu car . e.g in capit of india i.e. delhi , with the come up of metro a lot of time is save by the peopl work and commut through car . third reason i believ is spiral price of ga and petrol becaus of huge demand . thi high cost of drive car would discourag their use in come year and will lead to fewer car in use than there are today . the non-renew sourc of energi use to drive car are get finish up slowli and slowli and fifti year from now would be a time when we would have no fuel left . so switch to public transport will also solv the problem and slow the process of deplet of these resourc . also with the increas in inflat in indian economi , the common man is look for altern mean to cut down the cost . so if a much viabl and conveni solut is avail then he would sure switch over to the use of cheap and better mode of transport . all these reason combin would make the common man to willingli come out of hi luxuri of car and use cheap and time - effect mean of transport like buse , train etc .
