young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . base on my person experi i would have to agre with thi statement . eventhough i am not that old , i am old enough to agre with the statement mention in the former paragraph . for instanc , when i wa younger i use to worri less about everyth . as peopl get older , they get more respons . they get to know more peopl , in most case they get their own famili when they get merri , and with famili usual come a lot of respos and worry . the younger the person is , the more the person enjoy life . for exampl , let 's talk about a babi . a babi doe not have to worri almost about anyth , he or she just have to worri about meal ang get chang ; other than that a babi is just eat and sleep . a babi doe not even have the matur to know is someth is wrong on hi surround . now , let talk about a 6 to 10 year old person . peopl on thi age , in most case onli have to worri about homework . teenag , will have to worri about homework and mayb look good for the opposit sex . a colleg student would have to worri not onli about homework , but about get good grade in order to graduat . as soon as a person graduat from colleg he or she will have to get a job . after that , must start think about get stablish by get merri , buy a car , buy a hous , etc . all of the previou exampl are most like what a thypic person will experi troughout their live under `` normal '' circumst . all of these lead me to the conclus that the younger a person is , the more the person will enjoy life , and i think thi is basic becaus the younger a person is , the least a person worri .
