in my opinion succes peopl have alway succed when they have taken the risk . behind everi success man or compani their is huge amount of risk involv . some peopl even believ that thier is no fun without the risk . for exampl if gandhi wouldnt have taken the risk of hi life and continu hi work of that of a lawyer in south africa , india wouldnt have been an independ countri today . so for everi succes mission to take place a risk ha to be involv . all the lead buis compani of the world take a major risk when they invest into a new project . the new project may or may not do well and the compani might run into loss . but most of the success peopl are readi to take thi risk and most of them are sucees in their plan . over the year the risk factor ha been taken into consider by all lead men and they take the risk into account even befor they take up a buiss . but it annoy to know that these peopl who are mostli success when they have taken the risk or taken a chanc have been success otherwis today we wouldnt be connect to the entir world through the internet if the risk wa not taken . we wouldnt be do so much with the comput if bill gate wouldnt have taken the risk and invest so much in onli develop comput and it softtwar . peopl who are success in share market are prone to huge risk and loss but all the lead men in share compani take risk and are success also . all the world leader are also subject to risk of their life but the dont step back from their post . the are subject to risk of their life from terrorist and opposit also but thi doesnt stop them and they are all world class sucees leader . in conclus i would like to say that mostli peopl have been success when they have taken the risk and they continu to do that rather than do what they alreadi know how to do well .
