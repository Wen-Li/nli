travel is onli fun when i have the freedom to do whatev i want . so i disagre with a statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . travel in a group with a tour guid pose problem like follow a schedul and follow suit . first and foremost , i travel to visit and experi place first hand to visual beauti in my own way . a tour guid will not onli forc me to view the site through hi eye but also hinder my experi and impos other unnecessari constaint like time and schedul requir . the tour guid will be bark order and give all sort of inform that i will hear from one ear and forget it from the other . i would like to take my own time when watch the breathtak niagara fall or the mind-blow egyptian spinx . group travel will forc me to do the same activ other are do and so , will not allow me some time on my own . i would be veri disturb with my loss of command over myself . i would like to be my own boss and do thing my own way . just becaus 10 peopl want to visit the eiffel tower for the second time doe n't mean that i would wast my oppurtun to appreci the romant art at the louvr . i am just one of those peopl who love work and do stuff outsid a group . in conclus , a travel group with a tour guid is a bad choic accord to me . i would lose my independ of thought and my control of choic . i would rather voyag in peac and seren without all the fuss of a group .
