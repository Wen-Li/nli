the quetion of advertis is for me veri import , becaus my children seem to be veri influenc about it . i thing it is true that most advertis make some product better than they are realli . i will take the exampl of the food industri . everi day we could show on the tv or the newspap advertisememt that prove the qualiti of the food product . they took as support wellknown peopl like footbal player our basketbal player , in order to prouv that the product are veri wealthi , so the peopl who are veri influenc could take thi messag at the first level and imagin , if they have the same food , that they will be abl to improv their own performamc and fill better in their life . as the result we all know that there is a big problem in our sociti and especiali in the u.s.a and in europ with obes . becaus of the messag bring through the advertissememt a big part of the popul are chang the tradit way of use food and buy everi day industri food the a satur of fat . but that is the most remarqu in thi situat and the danger of the advertisememt , it is that the same compagni that develop the product will a lot of fat are actual develop a new rang a product in order to reduc the number of calori in the aliment . again the advertis is use to promot the new product , and in thi case they wil use the same support like sportif to bring an over messag . the problem we are focus is that advertis have onli a posit messag and they forget to show the neg point of the product , so a major of consum event they known thi bad side they are more influenc by the posit side a the messag bring by the advertis . in conclus we must all be abl to understand that the job of advertsememt is to show onli the bettr side of the product .
