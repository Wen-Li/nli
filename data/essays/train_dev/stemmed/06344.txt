some peopl might say that knowledg of mani academ subject is better , rather than to special in one specif subject . i believ that one should sure posess knowledg about variou subject but it better to special in one specif subject for mani reason . firstli , student are taught mani academ subject in the colleg but when they pass out and look for a job , they are ask to prove skill in one specif field . for exampl an mba student can choos special cours while he is studi like market , financ , intern busi and inform technolog . thi help the student to choos the field he is go to work in the futur . a softwar develop compani would alway prefer to hire a student who had taken up inform technolog as special cours dure colleg as it expect that he would understand the work better which he is expect to perfom dure hi job . secondli , it help student to take up cours in which they are good at . for exampl a student might not do well in most subject in colleg but they would be good in one . so they should be given an oppurtunity/liberti to decid the field they are most interest in studi and make a career . few student are weak in mathemat but it doe n't matter to them if they are good in polit scienc and they want to make a career in polit or administ servic . i have even come accross few parent who give their children the liberti to choos they career goal or a specif field of educ , no matter if they are n't do well in most of the academ subject . in conclus , i would like to express disagr for a person to possess broad knowledg of mani academ subject . after all if a person is `` jack of all trade , master of none '' he would not be abl to work in thi competit world which exist today .
