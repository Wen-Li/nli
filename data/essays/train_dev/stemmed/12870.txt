in my point of view the statement is correct . there are simpl reason , whi i support thi statement . i would like to explain that thi is understand by describ the situat out of differ perspect . when you sell a product , for exampl your old car , you want to make profit out of it . so you clean it up to get the best pictur of if and you think of all the featur and advantag thi car own . when you sell it on the internet or in the newspap you mention onli these good side . the reason is simpl : you just want to get the maximum amount of money you cat get for it . most time seller do not even tell the buyer that the car had an accid until he particularli ask . if you now compar thi behavi with the averag advertis there is almost no differ . both you and everyon els who advertis just want to earn money . anoth exampl is my experi in my job . we offer comput servic for enterpris custom . when we make an offer , we tell what we alreadi did , make examl of alreadi finish project and tell them how good our specialist are . sometim i am happi to be at our side of the discuss , becaus i know the realiti . you can not realli say that we are lie , but we are use the right word to describ it nice . it again perform like an averag advertis you can see on tv or on the internet , they do it the same way . so from the seller point of view it is of cours understand . bee the consum you have to be awar of all of these strategi of sell a product . i person alway tri to minim the advert to their provabl fact , so that i can compar differ product with each other object .
