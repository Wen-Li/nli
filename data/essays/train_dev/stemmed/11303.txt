it true that young peopl have the abilti to take part in differ kind of activ , especi some excit one . but at the same time some old peopl can not enjoy them . howev , it is a littl bit hast to say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . face with the work stress of morden time , young peopl seem to have much more pressur than older peopl do . young peopl have to get up earli and go to work in an rush hour . and if there is traffic jam , which is common in big citi , young peopl will suffer more from it , both physic and mental . moreov , young peopl have to breed their children and also take care of their old parent , and therefor they will have less time enjoy the natur , have outsid sport , and even breath the fresh air in the countri . howev , old peopl have more leisur time as compar to young peopl , and therefor they have more access to enjoy the life . becaus old peopl do not have to endur the work pressur , they have variou kind of activ . for exampl , they can plant tree , rais their belov flower as well as take care of their grandchildren . also , they can travel as far as they can becaus there is no time limitationfor them . they need not to go to work on time , and they do not have mountin work to do . enjoy the natur not onli do good to their physic health , but they are even good for their mental health . i think the onli differ between young peopl and old peopl is that there is a splendid futur wait for the young , while there is a glorio futur behind the old . no matter young and old , they have the same right and respons to enjoy their live .
