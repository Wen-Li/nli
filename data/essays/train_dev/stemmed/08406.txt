in my opinion in th come year there will fewr car left in th countri side as it is today . there are mani reason , it is reali unsaf to walk on the road . the polut level is increas , it diffcult to live in metropoliton citi . firstli , as the popul of the countri is increas so ther is much less space is requir to built up the road , which caus the peopl to send lot of time on the stop for green signal . as the time import key for each and everi one peopl use to travel shortest distanc on bicycl . secondli , the fossil feul are depleat , which is onli the fuel for the car . in the come year when it will be finish that bring hault of the car . as the car are gener to much nois and air pollut , the will harder there rule in the futur which will decreas the number of vehicl in the futur . in my opinion awar must be brought in the peopl mind to make less use of car as tey are threat to the societi . thirdli , the public transport is much convin and cheap for the peopl to travel . the metro are the best exampl to trvel within the citi . in the come year , the govern will prefer to spend on research which give benifit to the whole societi not to the specif class of peopl . in conclus , i want to say that it might be possibl that the public tranport take the place of car . it may be possibl that in the come futur be may trvel the longr distanc through the aeroplan . as the chanc of accid are increac the peopl may prefer public transport than the privat car . or scienti found air as the safer way to travel peopl may have anoth mean of transport .
