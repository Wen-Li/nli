in recent year , some peopl argu that there will be fewer car in use in near futur sinc the innov in transport technolog . howev , the argument seem me far from realiti . although , there are some studi in thi direct , i do n't think that car which have an import place in our life can be replac by easili in twenti year . the statist and the project of govern justifi my belief . first of all , our past experi challeng to the argument . if we look at the statist to understand how the tendenc of the number of the car in use is , we see clearli that there is a perman increas in car usag . in other word , the statist of past data doe not support the predict in argument . it can easili be seen that all the statist begin from the invent of the car to today demostr that the usag of car ha dramat increas . when peopl have better econom condit , they desir to buy car . inceas in popul in all over the world also serv thi tendenc . secondli , nowaday mani develop countri continu to built new road . for instanc , in my countri - turkey - there are region where road are not even suitabl for car and the govern is too eager to expand the total kilomet of high way to make car usag easier . in thi purpos they expens a signific part of the budget to the transport project . thi effort to increas high way and to make them secur made also the peopl more eager to use car . if we talk about a far futur when there is no need to use car becaus of the adapt of helichopt or a fututr where world ha connect with metro then we can expect the car to disappear . but , today they are crucial for our comfort and i ca n't see a vehicl that can replac car usag .
