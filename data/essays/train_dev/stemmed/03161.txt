i believ that it is not necessari that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know to do well . for me , success is an absolut term . it can not be defin by some standard like have money or a high posit in job . success is what you feel it is . for some peopl success may be to lead a peac life with famili and friend while share whatev you have . so in that term a person may be success by just do whatev he know to do well . on the other hand , those who tri new thing and take risk may not be success . take risk ha both pro and con . one may achiev a lot and at the same time there is a possibl that he may lose everyth he ha , while a person who doe whatev he know well is sure to keep do that part and be content . in take risk and tri new thing , until you succeed you have the fear of lose . you put not onli your happi and well be at stake , but also of those who are depend on you for their happi . a person tri to do new thing ha to devot a lot of time research the option , find the best opportun or creat one and then work on it . if he devot the same time in do what he alreadi know , he can spare some time for pleasur and fun . there are no statist to prove that conserv ( who do not take risk ) are less success as compar to aggres ( who take risk ) . risk avers and risk toler attitud are also reflect of a cultur or background . again , there are no report that show that peopl who took risk and tri new thing were the onli one to succeed . e.g. mother teresa is a success person . she did social work which she new well and kept do it till the end of her life . similarli there are exampl of peopl who gambl with the view of take risk and tri to be success , but lose everyth . in conclus , i would say that if for me success is to be happi and satisfi in life and i am happi and satisfi while do whatev i know to do well , then i am a success person .
