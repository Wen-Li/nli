the topic whether success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know how to do well is a controversi topic . i would agre with the statement . the main reason to support the statement is that tri new thing and take risk somtin give innov idea and better insight to solv a problem at hand . for exampl einstien , a famou scientist , continu tri new thing and figur out innov method to reach a conclus . as a result he ha given the world new theori and explan which the world wa unawar of . einstien is one of the world 's greatest scientist ever known . secondli , do what we alreadi know how to do well is just blindli ignor the chang factor surround us . for exampl , my father knew how to make a spear veri well . i learnt the art of spear make from my father . but with all the tecnolog advanc and innov metho around i can not say that the method known to me is the best method . today spear can be preapar with machin which are faster and more accur . so in order to do thing well we need to have a clear understand of the chang enviorn condit . third , if peopl donot tri new thing and donot take more risk then the world economi would not grow and come to a halt . for exampl , bill gate , the founder of microsoft , took a risk of ventur into the comput industri when critic predict that he would fail miser . he continu to work hard and wa abl to succeed in the end . microsoft gener huge employ and creat product which help eas certain task significantli . microsoft help the world economi to grow at a faster pace by introduc technolog advanc and gener employ . bill gate today is one of the richest person in the world . had he not taken the risk of start a new compani he would not have been success . in conclus peopl who tri new thing take calcul risk succeed . peopl who onli do what they alreadi know may becom success but not to the same extent achiev by peopl who take risk .
