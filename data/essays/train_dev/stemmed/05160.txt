i agre with the statement of success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . in thi societi , i think that if you do not tri news thing , you would be just a worker but not the boss , becaus the boss need to have the ambit , confid , and interest to be success . first , ambit is the main point to let the peopl tri new thing . if you have n't the ambit , you would not tri with new thing and just onli do what you alreadi know how to do well , becaus you have no ambit to accept the fault that you make or you have no ambit to accept you are not success . ambit is a thought in your mind that give conmfid to you and do the thing . if you alway escap to face to tri new thing , you would not get sucess ani more . second , confid also realli import to let the peopl tri new thing . confid and ambit are veri similar , but ambit is intern , and confid is extern . for exampl , you need to attend in a competit of basketbal , and you never play basketbal befor , you have the amnbit to tri to play the basketbal , but you do not have the confid to attend in the competit becaus you have no confid to win thi competiton . confid not onli creat by yourself , also you have confid or not is becaus of your close friend or famili , if they are support you , you would have confid to tri the new thing . third , your interest of what you want to know also realli import . for exampl , i need to appli in an univers , and i need to choos the subject , and i am good in art , i want to be a art design , which mean draw is my interest , if i get in the univers , i need to learn the new thing and skilld oif art , but thi is my interest , although it is diffcult to learn , but i still would face it . at last , have ambit , confidenceand interest are help me to be the success peopl tri new thing and take riskd rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . if i am a person that dont tri ani new thing and just odo someth that i am alway do good , i would think the thing bore and no success feel on the thing .
