i disagre with the statement `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . car are the most import mean of transport in today world where peopl prefer to travel more than other mean of transport . they play an veri import role in onc life . in twenti year there will be more car in use than there are today becaus in the modern world peopl are veri bussi with there work and they have to travel to a veri far place from where they resid to do there work so they have to travel fast to manag there time . so they need a vehicl in which they can go on veri fast so car fullfil the need . in case of other transport like the public transport where they have to wait for the public vehicl to come so they are a wast a lot of time . so most peopl do not prefer . and mani other peopl have a passion toward car and they like to drive car . so peopl buy car becaus of there passion . becaus of thi reason some famili will have more than two to three car . car is a prestig issu so thi is the reason the averag middl class famili is also buy a car . and accord to the recent survey peopl prefer to buy the car than to ani other mean of transport . and becaus of thi there is a larg increas in the sale of the car in the recent year mani car manufactur com up for thi reason . and when we compar the sale of the car say from 1930 's there is a consider rise in the sale of the car say at an avereag it is 60 % then the same is go to continu in the futur . so by thi we can say that we will be use more car than today . becaus of the abov mention reason i strongli disagre that there will be fewer car in twenti year from today .
