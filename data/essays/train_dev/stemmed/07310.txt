i do n't think that young peopl must be enjoy life more than older peopl do . becasu the point of view for a enjoy life wa differ in the differ peopl 's opinion . the young peopl thought that they enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus they find out that the place where they '' enjoy their life '' or '' have fun '' such like the disco bar , video game room , cinema etc. they seldom get the older peopl 's bodi , and they have spend more money on the food , drink , choth than the older peopl . so that 's whi the young man think the older man did not know how to `` enjoy their life '' . but it is not the truth . the older peopl have their own method to enjoy their own life . such as fish , play chess , all sort of not so excit and more fitabl action for the older one . and not onli the envori is the whole of enjoy life , to finish a new job , to rais their boy and girl , these all impli the enjoy life of the older peopl .
