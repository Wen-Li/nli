peopl travel to all over the world for variou reason . some do it becaus they want a chang in their live , wherea other do it beacaus they want to explor the world and want to know about that place , the peopl and their cultur . henc , i feel that if the reason is to explor the world or the place , the best thing is to do in a group led by a tour guid . a tour guid is a person who is profession qualifi to help and show peopl the place they are travel to , so it would be realli easi if you are with a tour guid . also , travel in a group ha it own charm . you are not onli enjoinyg a new place but also you are share your experi and your joy with other too . although , i do agre if we are travel in group we dont possess the amount of freedom we would enjoy when we are alon but be in group with a tour guid is benefici in mani other way . firstli , sinc he is an expert you will get to explor and see all import place which you might miss if you are travel alon . for exampl you might just miss amonu and you later regret that you might have consult a tour guid . also , by chanc if you face ani kind of problem you have so mani peopl help you out . for exampl , you might have a problem with your health in a place which is new to you . it might be great caus of concern , wherea if you are travel in a group you have so mani peopl to count on . also , there are peopl in thi world who do not have famili or friend these kind of group are realli benefici for them . it ha been seen that after spend day togeth you realli beacam friend even after you finish off with your trip . when peopl travel in group they spend all extra time sing , enjo , danc with each other . even the time you spend on travel becom so excit . to summaris i would say that travel in group led by a tour guid do take away some part of your freedom but it provid you with a real defin of enjoy and excit which you can never enjoy all alon .
