travel top the list of mani peopl 's choic to spend their leisur time for . but whether to follow a group led by a tour guid remain a controversi question for the travel at their plan stage of the tour . in my opinion , the best way to travel ha littl to do with follow a larg group . peopl tend to reli on a group and stick to it for secur or consensu or whatev they need , but when it come to travel , thing might fall on the opposit side . the assert of uniti mean the denial of freedom , it is especi ture when , with the guid of a tour guid , one can not indulg himself in the freedom of choos what travel site to visit or what time to start and there is a greater chanc that the true mean of travel , relax be my defenit , might be rape by argument and complaint . some peopl would contridict my point by say that a tour guid offer valuabl and well-inform suggest that would make a better trip . but is n't there enough news of tourist be cheat or made use of for the sake of tour guid ' benefit ? by say thi , i am not say that tourist are more skill at escap trick when travel by themselv , nor am i judg the moral standard of all tour guid , it 's just that is n't it even sadder to be fool when certain invest and trust and alreadi been place on the tour guid ? in addit , travel fullfil differ purpos for differ peopl . some want to escap the hustl and bustl of the citi , some wish to explor the unknown world , some aspir to adventur through excit place , and none of these seem attain by follow the lead of a tour guid whose job is to keep everyon in sight and control . good or bad , there is no absolut truth , howev , we alway have the right to chase what we want when travel .
