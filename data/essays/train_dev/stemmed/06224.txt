let me introduc first . i am from japan and have grown up there . i total agre with that yong peopl recent do not give enough time to help their commun . the some reason whi young peopl doe not are that in japanes societi , there are more interest , such as play video game and interupt like busi for studi . or the young peopl tend to not have ani interest to other . most of elderli peopl said `` a long time ago of young peopl have suffici time for help their commun . '' howev , time is alway chang , therefor , youth doe not want to help or not like their commun at all . even if their parent may be not care of those commun , so they might not to push their son or daughter go to commun . on the other hand , becaus japanes are studi so harder than play , and some of youth ha to focu on studi instead of help the commun , so they do not have time to go commun . not onli japanes studi so hard , but also doe asian studi veri hard if we compar between asia and north america . american may have enough time to help their commun becaus i saw young american by use my eye . also , i heard from my friend who are american that japanes are studi hard than american . it mean that japanes do not have time to help their commun . in japan , there are one of the worst boom for young peopl . we call the boom : `` hikikomori phenominon . '' young japanes ( young adult too ! ) tend to stay at their hous , especiroom , and spend time there in a whole day . it mean that they do not have ani interest outsid of the world . they never work for job , go to school , and never go out . in conclus , the reason whi in recent year young peopl do not have time to spend are chang period , busi for studi , and bad phenominon .
