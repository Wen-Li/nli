i think young peopl do not have to take more time for the commun . so i disagre with thi . there are 2 reason whi i disagre . the first one is the increas number of the old peopl . and the second one is work hard for the commun without no money is not a good idea . first , there are too mani old peopl in thi world . that mean there is not enough young peopl to help in the commun , especi in japan . almost 25 percent of the popul in japan is the old peopl . so adult say the young peopl must help the commun more often , but that will be too mani job for the young peopl . there will not be enough young peopl to do the job . so i do not think make the young peopl work more for the commun is not the best idea . second , work for the commun without no money is not good for the young peopl . there are mani young peopl who do not have a job and have a hard time to live without their money . so work without the payment from the countri or from some compani , it will not be a good time for the young peopl . becaus mani young peopl want some job for their life . so if old peopl need some help from the young peopl for the commun , they should give them some payment . thu , becaus of the increas of the old peopl and no money to the young peopl for the work in the commun , i think young peopl do not have to help for the commun more often .
