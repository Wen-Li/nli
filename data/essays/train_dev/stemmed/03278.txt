i disagre with the steatement becaus , in my opinion , it is better have a lot of knowledg about one specif subject , that to know onli a littl of mani academ topic . on the one hand , even though a lot of person can think that have inform about a varieti of subject could make a professor or a student to have a better backwround in hi or her profession format , on the other hand , i consid it is neg not to have a deep knowledg of one main area . is alway better to understand perfectli one thing than to have a small idea of mani thing . therebi , to have a larg knowledg in one singl academ subject have practic applic becaus , it will be easier for that person to trasmit well consolid inform to other . moreov , some specif point of the academ life , accord to my opinion , can onli be achiev with a huge knowledg of one topic . for instanc , to make a research in one area , it will be necesari to count with a lot of inform in that subject . howev , to have an idea of sever topic will be useless to develop deep enough the investig accuratelli . furthermor , to understand perfectli one singl subgect could have potenti a larg econom benefit , for in some circunst , difer compani and industri need person with specif knowledg about one area to solv a punctual problem . in conclus , i believ that to focu oneself in stude deepli a singl subject instead of stude a larg number of academ area will bring alway more possit result .
