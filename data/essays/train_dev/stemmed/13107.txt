i agre with the statement becaus be success ha to do more with attitud rather with aptitud . from my former experi as a student and as a worker i would like to support my point of view . through studi intern relat at a top mexican univers i wa abl to understand the global context in which we live , nevertheless arli in my studi i realiz that to enhganc my criterion regard inter deal i would have to delv into the area of sociolog . in depth person resarch on thi subjet ha not onli refin my capac to understand but also my capac to negoti and go beyond the evid special when deal with differ cultur and perspect . among my favorit author is dr , kevin skandia who in hi work `` the clash of civil '' he strongli bear , in one of hi chapter , on the subjetc of leadership and how to be success . he state that in order to becom a leader and a pioneer you have to get out of the convent , you and i have to go beyond the `` establish '' to break the way thing are done so as to creat a best way to carri on thing . obvious peopl have to take risk and have to be awar of failur , so success peopl will go after their goal know in advanc that they probabl will fail , know that thi is the best way to succeed . my work as a special purchas for wal mart , one of the largest retail worldwid , ha face me with enorm challeng that have demand full efect to work well under pressur and competit , thi experinc ha help me to realiz that innov and imagin are two import tool to suc anywher you are , and again in order to be success we have to go beyond and to tri new way to do out duti . sinc it is compani polici to upgrad the expertis of employe we are consist enrol in confer and meet , mani intern in natur , that have given me mani an oportun to exchang idea and share decis that help us in our everyday job . while exchang idea or have convers from peopl around the world our convers often drift to more casual topic like the everyday decis we have to take in our live , and we remark ourselv the import to be sure of yourself and sure about the thing you are to carri on in order to be success . at the end , i have alway thought that onli few peopl have the courag to do someth els in order to break their `` satatu quo '' and those kind of person are the one who chang and suc in what they are after , so i do think that success peopl tri new thing and take risk .
