i think that young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl . there is lot of reason for thi which are genral base on advantag of be young . let me explain these reason one by one . first of all young peopl not as experienc as old one . becaus they are lack of experi , everyth appear someth new to them and they enjoy dicov these new thing . for exampl for a young peopl to go to a new countri can be so much enjoy becaus he is do someth new . a new experi which may creat unfamilliar feel . but on the other hand it is not that much attract for an old man who had thi kind of experi sever time . secondli young peopl have less respons which give them more fredom . a young peopl gener onli have hi or her respons . so he can make hi program without depend to other . he do n't need to take care of a babi or shedul hi holiday acord to child 's school like old peopl . fredom is also one of the key word that make life more enjoy . an other reason is energi of young peopl . the energi of young peopl also an advantag which make them enjoy life more than older . when peopl are young they have energi to do everyth . at it is not onli an individu advantag . as all young pepol have thi energi they can creat more posit atmospher than older peopl can . so they can also benefit from thi advantag by use synergi of group . they can make parti till late hour , danc and laugh all togeth . they are capabl of thi activ with their long last energi . as a conclus it is obviou that young peopl have so much advantag to enjoy the life more than old peopl but there is no need to feel jeliou about it . in fact sooner or later young peop will get older . as onc older peopl were young .
