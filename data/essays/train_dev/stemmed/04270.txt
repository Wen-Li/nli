it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agre with the follow statement . student are young and gener do not enought experi for their life . they do not respons for their life and they are gener veri busi on their life . that whi , there are mani reason for my support idea . firstli , they are young and they have not done enought experi for their life . i am a faculti at the dokuz eylul univers in izmir , in turkey for seven year . i have studi a lot of student . in my experinc , they understand and believ idea and concept becaus they are so young for life and they have not done anyth . secondli , almost all student are veri busi . they learn a lot of thing . they have studi on their life such as homework , listen , read , speak and write . howev they have not had ani experinc such as earn life , earn money , do help anybodi etc . actual i do n't know anoth countri but at least , in turkey is thi . our curriculum teach gener good math , geographi , histori , biolog or anyth but it doe n't teach life knowledg , thi is big mistak and turki educ system and it curriculum ha to be chang . final , they don ' have enought responsibl . in my view , thi is educ system 's problem . for instanc , in turkey almost all student go to secondari school and high school . they studi and they do homework . neverthless , usul they do n't do ani home made . in my opinium , if we suc for new gener , we have to learn life 's fact and we have to give more respons . we have to chang our tradit educ system . they have learn life , world , and world 's problem such as war , peac , environ , conflict and etc . becaus , tomorrow life for them .
