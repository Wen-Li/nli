although there are some peopl claim import of understand idea and concept instead of learn fact , i disagre with thi idea becaus of three reason . first , idea and concept are two intang featur that you can not observ or prove with a scientif method . howev , fact are real and ha been in the world befor us . moreov , you can prove them with a scientif method . understand fact make you understand your environ , which may lead you to understand your and other featur live . second , learn fact is more import than understand idea and concept sinc you can creat your own idea or concept after leran fact . when you learn realiti of life and thing that ha surround you , you would simpli start to think about them and inferr variou mean as much as you can . without base your idea on a fact most probabl your idea would not be proven and may not becom valuabl . third , peopl can see import of learn fact instead of understand idea and concept becaus by learn onli idea and concept one may tend to copi those idea like he or she ha own , which is call plager . without know the realiti and fact that are behind of an idea one can argu or defend an idea which is not her/hi . to sum up , it is more import to learn fact than understand idea and fact . god may be think and than creat the world , but peopl ha seen the world and than start to think about it .
