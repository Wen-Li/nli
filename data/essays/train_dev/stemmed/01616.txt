i think each age ha it plasur time and memori . dure the childhood , teen year , young peopl & old dure childhood you have the chanc to do anyth and no one will say whi ? they will say he is tri to learn , let him tri it so he will know what is it like drink a hot cup of tea he will cray becous he did not know it hot , what is hot ? so next time he will avoid it and when he cray hi mom and dad will run to him and huge him . he will have all the interist . he will buy toy , game and tudybear . he will sleep with hi mother and father . teen and yong peopl usulli have the most good time they enjoy the most becos they will start to under stand everyth , tri everyth if they have the corig ( brave heart ) for the bunji jump , scopa dive , have alot of frine , join a collag , drive the car , lot and lot of enterist thing which old peopl can do it but not like young peopl . old peopl spicelli when they retier they like to go in a croze or in a trip around the world , but the acttiv that they will had are not the same of the young . young peopl have cornucopia of fun , experien , friend . the butiy be old is to see your son or dughetr have a bubi , to see hi smill , to see your old wife/husben besid you smile to you grape your hand . i think young peopl have a wild life but when they becom old they have lot of love . the most import is to know how to live each period correctli . enjoy each second becos ya each second you will lose are aint gonna come back . good bless everi one
