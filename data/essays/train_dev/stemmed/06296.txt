were there be more car in the futur compar to the number of car use today ? in today 's world , car were use everywher for the effici of transport for peopl . they were the necess of peopl in thi centuri , and they serv as an import tool use today . in my opinion , i disagre that number of car would decreas in twenti year . in contrast , i believ that the number of car would increas in the near futur . first , as what i 've mention previous , car were an import usag for the peopl today . they made peopl easier to travel around their countri , and they encourag vacat outsid their citi . as peopl notic the import of car everyday , they would as well encourag them to buy a car for the sake of their own . as popul increas , more teenag would dream of have a car . as more and more peopl join thi world , more car would be bought by consum . with the growth of technolog , consum would have to buy more car in order to maintain themselv in the world of modern technolog . second , as more and more peopl in thi world earn more money , they would have the desir to buy more car rather than one . car were made veri attract these year , and more peopl were attract to the beauti and the eloqu of the newli design car . with the amount of fortun they have , they would be easili convinc to buy anoth car to fulfil their desir . own two or three car in the garag , peopl would be abl to rais their social standard , and cope with the advanc of modern technolog . last but not least , famili that consist of more than six member would have the intent of buy more car . one car in thi kind of famili wa definit not enough . as the famili grew , they would want to chang their car into bigger one that could fit the entir famili . furthermor , the famili would have to buy extra car to meet differ reason . for exampl , one car could be use to drive children to school , while the other bigger car for famili vacat . moreov , car were the onli way that famili could travel togeth at a lower price . drive a car would onli cost you fuel price , but other transport such as long distanc buse and airplan would caus you more . although mani peopl would forfeit old car and buy new one to balanc the number , the number of car would simpli increas as more famili came to exist in thi world . car would grew their import in thi societi , and peopl would begin to recogn their valu . with the help of these car , peopl could enjoy themselv more in an advanc societi , and more time would be save .
