the main point of car is the more and more a problem in our day , it impli social and econom statement , that are contest by ecolog fact . even though car pollut , i tend to disagre with the statment given by the subject : '' in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' i will give three main reason whi i think there will be more car in twenti year from now . first of all in twenti year , the earth 's popul , will tend to be almost nine billion of peopl , wich is a overpopul of cours , so i think the more peopl there are the more car there are . to continu , peopl usual prefer to take a car than to walk , now we can say that some of them will take public facil , but after all , a bu , is onli a big car ... wherea other facil , are not realli devellop in all contri , and peopl usual prefer go in a privat car rather than in a common facil . last but not least , the more reaserch are done to find a clean car , a car wich does'nr pollut at all , by use elctric and even solar sistem . as long as we have clean car , and a veri larg number of person , few reason will last in contrast the supperior of car . so , we can say after thi explain , that there wo n't be fewer car in twenti year from now , but instead , more car , and even more effici car .
