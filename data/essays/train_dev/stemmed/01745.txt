i think that in our complex societi is sure better to be special . i learn it from my own experi . at univers i studi commun . when i applic i thought i could realli learn a lot about the specif mecan of it . but i wa quit disappoint . the main cours where quit confus quit differ one from the other . i have had a veri spread educ , becaus i studi a bit of histori a bit of economi , a bit of sociolog . but at the end i understood that there wa n't anyth that i realli could say i knew . i could face lot of differ situat and solv differ kind of problem . and it could be veri use for everi day situat or for a job without particular ambit . but we live in a veri competit world and it 's never enought to be prepar to the simplest . the process of develop we live , we can appreci it or less , requir a great special . someon who know veri well is own specif sector will have more opportun to devolop it , to find new solut and to have good opportun . a person could also start from a not specif knowledg , that coul be the base for someth els . i think that should be better start at the colleg with a special , but even after it , there is alway time to tri to understand the littl field where someon should be brilliant and follow it . a way to devolop thi kind of specialis could be with a master of scienc or with a phd . knowledg is more spread in our gener , and it 's veri good that more pepl have the opportun of a high level educ . but the drawback is that to be special someon should studi more than the other . and so he should go on with hi own studi . but the most import think at thi step is to choos a master that can realli make the differ . it 's better to studi someth so specif that just few peopl on the world know , than someth that is common knowledg for everyon .
