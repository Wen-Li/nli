a person can enhanc hi academ knowledg in two way . these are have a broad knowledg of mani subject and special in one specif subject . both of these way have their own advantag and disadvantag . howev , i think that have gener inform about differ topic ha more advantag compar to special in one specif subject . in one hand , know gener thing about mani subject may increas a student 's overal percept of topic around . have a gener percept of differ subject is also a way taken by ancient greek scientist . if we examin their life and research , we find out that there is no scientist which just special and work for a particular subject . with have broad knowledg about differ topic , they have found the main element of our civil . but in our world , peopl sometim need special partner in order to accomplish a part of the project that wa design to be built simultan by differ peopl who know their subject veri well . on the other hand , special in one particular area may also increas a person 's academ knowledg . special peopl are less prone to error in their particular area than peopl who have gener inform about that particular area . howev special have a neg effect on invent new thing . when somebodi is special in one particular area , it is sometim hard to find innov thing due to a lack of gener knowledg about differ subject . the process of invent most of the time requir knowledg about differ disciplin . the area of scienc like biochemistri and electromechan are great exampl of these . in conclus , i think have broad knowledg about differ subject is better than special in one specif subject . it increas the abil to invent and help to see the big pictur more neatli where special produc ident peopl .
