dure the last centuri , the number of car in use ha been grow fasterand faster everyday in the develop and rich countri . the easi access to the petroleum , it low price and the develop of the econom power of the peopl are the princip reason of thi enorm expans . today differ problem make peopl think that there could be fewer car in use in twenti year . the most import is the lack of petroleum . we 've been drill petroleum for mani year without consid that it 's not an infinit ressourc . these last year the scientist have reveal that petroleum sould be miss soon . the direct consequ is the increas of the price that we 've seen these last year . it4 clear that we need to find anoth sourc of energi to replac the petroleum the gaz seem to be the best one for the moment , but even if we can alreadi buy some car use gaz it seem that peopl are not readi for that . they keep buy some car use petroleum . electr car are not realli popular as they 're not powerful . the other import point that could make the number of car in use decreas in the next year is the environment problem . thi is one of the biggest problem for the differ govern around the world . environ is one of the most current subject on tv sinc a littl bit less than ten year . it 's been prove that the high number of car in the big citi like london , pari or madrid is one of the reason whi the pollut is so elev . some peopl think that the govern could limit the number of car that a famili could buy in the econom develop countri , as they alreadi tri to limit the use of the car in the main citi dure the summer period . what i think personn is that , despit the develop of the differ public transport ( like the tramway in pari ) , the peopl here are not readi for thi . i think that they 'll tri to adapt themself to the use of new energi but wo n't buy less car . i4v seen a veri interest report about the recent discov of the biggest gaz reserv in the world in siberia . it wa say that thi onli one could give enough energi to the entir europ for the next twenti year . i realli that it can work as the gaz doe n't make as much pollut as the petroleum doe . and i believ that dure these twenti year , we 'll find anoth type of ressourc . so my opinion is that there wo n't be fewer car in use in twenti year . much
