i complet disagre with the statement given and i dont even find ani sort of idea like that . i dont understand if there is declin of car with in the next twenti year , then what the peopl are go to use after twenti year ? bu , train , bike or plane ? all of them have disadvantag compar to car . compar to all the vehic avail today car are the most effici vehic to meet the requir of all the peopl . if peopl are go to stop to use the car , then how are go to travel ? either by buse , train and even plane . all these can not be effici use by the peopl . even if peopl have decid to travel by other mean of public transport then also they should have a own vehicl to got a station , airport or bu stop . if the peopl should go by buse or other they should get readi veri earli , go to nearbi stop , wait for the bu , get down at the destin and then go to the offic by other mean or by walk . is thi process better or get into a car at home and get down in front of the offic is better ? definit the second one . now a day peopl are look for vehicl which give them a lot of advantag and car are one of them . everi one should have a own vehicl for their daili thing to go on without problem and car is best of them . like other vehicl ( like bike ) there is no need to expos to sun and it is a comfort way of travel . as it is not much expens to buy a car , everi one could efford to buy a car . in time of emerg we cant wait for a outsid vehicl to come and car mean a lot at that time . so it is the best way to travel at ani time to ani place comfart . the onli disadvantag of use the car is probabl of accid . we sholud be veri care while drive and have to keep the whole attent on that . but if we go by public transport there is no need to worri and can sit in a relax state till the destin come . but inspit of thi disadvantag car serv as the more effici way to find the need of the peopl .
