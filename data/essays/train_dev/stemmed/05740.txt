i disagre with the statement becaus i think that peopl can risk also when they are not sure in their experi . in my opinion it depens , princip , for thre person behaviour of the person . if i wa a brave man my instinct could involv me to risk , for exampl , in activ where i can have an elev damag ( like econom busi , privat live ) . if i wa an afraid man my instinct could be involv me to put a brake in my activ and in all of aspect of my life . person i wa an istinct man and usual i take decis without think the neg aspect but onli the posit . an import exampl in my life wa the decis of live with my girlfriend . it wa a decis that i took look onli the posit aspect . .. i took my baggag and luggag and i fli with her in an other countri . after some day the situat chang . .. the risk that i had n't consid wa veri veri high . mayb the logic solut can not be an other but in my mind i know how to do .
