i do not think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for two main reason . first , if we look at the actual trend , more and more car are in use . i think that in twenti year a lot of peopl that can not afford to buy a car today will be abl to do so . underdevelop countri are a case in point . they have been exclud from the car market for a veri long time becaus they were no potenti buyer . but now , mani countri go from rag to rich and are abl to buy car . china or india , for exampl , will be major potenti buyer in twenti year . tata , an indian car brand , is on the rise with incred growth rate . the same goe for poor peopl in develop countri . car are get cheaper , and i believ that thi trend will continu . today it is possibl to have a new famili car at $ 5000 . logan renault is a good exampl . and what about in twenti year ? mayb the start price of a car will be under $ 1000 . then much more peopl , such as student , will be abl to buy car . but it is true that , at the same time , rune car is becom veri expens . thi bring me to my second point . on the face of it , the price of oil is rocket which make car expens to use . but on closer inspect , car use less and less oil . i hope than in twenti year few car will still work on oil . car will use other form of energi such as veget oil and whi not water . technolog in thi field goe veri fast and mani chang can occur within twenti year . all in all , i think car compani are still on a thrive market and therefor , there is littl chanc that in twenti year thre will be fewer car in use than there are today .
