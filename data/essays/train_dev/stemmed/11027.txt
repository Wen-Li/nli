i am agre with the statement that say that for student is more import to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . infact , i am a student and for me is essenci for learn well fact , first at all tri to understand the idea and the concept that there are besid the fact that i must learn . if a person doe not understand the whi of the fact i think that is not useful learn about it . in my experi , i alway tri to understand the reason that there is besid an event . becous i think that if i understand the basic concept it will be more simpl learn fact and not forget it . i studi criminolog and for my work is basic understand whi is happen a certain event , what is the principl caus that caus a certain type of event . for exampl , for me is not import learn the fact becous i must understand the reason that ther is besid a certain type of behaviour and not onli the result of it . for my type of studi is not import learn the fact but the reason . but i think that is not useful onli for my type of studi but for all type of faculti . for exampl , in the scientif faculti is also veri import it . it will be veri import understand the reason whi happen a certain natur event for exampl and not learn the event alon . in conclus , i think that if a person want understand veri well fact and not learn it becous of the school or becous a person say that he must learn it , he must question himself the basic idea and the concept that is link on that event . also if , for exampl , the event that he must learn is not a good event , and he must tri to do in a differ way .
