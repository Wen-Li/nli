i do think that most advertis make the product seem much better than they realli are . in my opinion , advertis have reach such an import and omnipres place in our everydaylif that they should never lie about a product . all is studi to make it attract , brillant , colour , noth is left as a coincid but i reckon it is overpow . it occur mani sever time that the product wa truli disappoint compar to the advertis . of cours , it depend on what is the matter but veri often i came to tri new product that were not as `` fabul '' as they were suppos to be . i spent some money on variou thing , from cd to a dvd player , beauti product for my sister or veri divers thing , which happen to be smaller than it wa said to be , less effici or to break veri easili . my brother , who is keen on new technolog also tell me how unfaith an advert can be . the qualiti is below what he expect or the use of the mp3 player , for exampl , is not as variet as it wa written on the box . apart from the high technolog , i would tend to say that advertis doe not lie so much about food product . is it becaus it is part of everyday life or more frequent to buy it ? we can buy a televis onc within a coupl of year , be upset by the product consid we have been interest in it through it advert in prioriti , it is differ from the food advertis , or the item we regularli need to buy . actual , if it doe not satisfi us , consequ we will buy anoth brand . obvious it is import to say that it doe not happen all the time , with everyth , but well , i think that advertis should not ` pretend ' so much thrill qualiti over a product . howev i understand it is part of the commerci system , the advert ha to focu on the pro of the concern thing and the greatest it will appear , the higher the sell will be .
