in my opinion , histori show that peopl that take risk and tri new thing are more success that those that prefer to reli on their exist knowledg . there are sever reason and exampl that support my point of view . first , in our global world , knowledg and technolog innov are rapidli increas . ten year ago , nobodi use the internet . today it is almost imposs to be success without know how to write an email and how to surf in the internet . therefor , it is necessari to be open to new invent and chang in societi in order to make progress . moreov , invent have normal been made becaus peopl start to tri new thing and to take risk . a musician that onli play the song he alreadi manag quit well is n't veri like to invent a new song or to improv hi interpret . onli by tri out altern interpret , even though it may sound odd in the first place , new idea may come to the musician 's mind . consequ , hi interpret of the song can be improv . therefor , by take the risk of leav behind old pattern of think , previous unknown concept can be found out . in addit , peopl that take the risk of start a busi with a new concept may have more success than those that sell establish product . although franchis , for exampl , give the shopown more secur , the possibilti of make huge surplus is lower . enterli new and creativ concept , howev , can help you to becom realli success . in conclus , take risk and tri new thing contribut to make peopl success . due to global , societi chang rapidli , so that you are requir to broaden your horizon in order to succeed . furthermor , the possibl of make a new discori and to run a success busi are higher . thu , i prefer to do new thing and to take risk .
