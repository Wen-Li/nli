imag what the world today would be without a light bulb , the phone or the wheel . mayb some of these thing were invent onli by accid , but they were also develop becaus their inventor want to tri someth new or uncommon . therefor , i agre that success peopl take risk and in the follow section i want to give some reason for thi opinion . my first point is that without peopl that are will to take risk everyth would stand still . without peopl tri someth new there would be no invent or progress and human would probabl still be on the level of the stone age . if everyon continu tro do what he alreadi know than it would be imposs to move forward . i also think that it is imposs for human to remain on the same level all the time as the human brain is prone to learn and develop . like children want to touch the hot oven just to see how it feel and learn , hurt , that it can be veri hot , peopl also want to tri if a squar stone can roll better than a circular stone . although the need for progress is an import factor , there is also the point that peopl becam success or made a lot of money just becaus they took a chanc where other part of societi stood back and watch in order not to be laugh at . thu , it is an import featur of success peopl that they tri new thing no matter what societi might think of them . becaus if they final take the step and develop someth new and unknown everyon in societi want it and tri to copi it . therefor , peopl who like to take risk and make the first step are mainli the one to profit from it the most . in conclus it can be said that peopl who take risk are more success becaus the do not care what other think about them or their idea and they are will to embrac progress . as i want to be succes in my own life i hope that i will be abl to take some risk becaus i am awar that it take some power of will to do that .
