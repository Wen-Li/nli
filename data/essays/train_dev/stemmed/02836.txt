i think that theoret concept and idea are veri import to prepar a student and to help him to built hi own method of studi . for exampl studi latin , with all those coniug or math give you a tool to develop your mind schemat . in my opinion thi is a good train , but it doe n't make a professionist . i believ that when a student reach a certain level of theoret prepar he need fact : he need to experi in first person what the issu he ha studi is all about . learn from practic experi is much easier and involv than studi a subject on a book . for exampl ; if i had the opportun to go to unit state and studi english , i would improv my languag skill much better than i could do stay at home and read an english edit of oscar wild ! moreov is veri import to consid the kind of subject the student is learn : mani subject need more practic train ( for exampl biolog ) and so other ( as philosophi ) are better understood with concept . think about those peopl who did n't have the opportun to get an educ ; all they learnt wa basic taken from real fact : i can say that the skill they have , for exampl in formul a convers , pherap doe n't follow a logic pattern but if they can apport fact to substain such convers it is not hard to understand what they are talk about . so i just partial agre with the statement and i think that the best choic would be to give to the student both the practic and theoret train to ensur him a complet educ .
