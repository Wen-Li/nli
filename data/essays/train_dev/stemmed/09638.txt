market is an activ that ha grown fast and steadi for the last few decad . some argu that it is exclus a lucr , almost an inmor activ . other regard it as creativ and valuabl as art . probabl the fact that ha been critis more convincingli is the fact that advertis tend to overst the qualiti of a product in order to sell it . peopl who make such kind of statement , as the one present abov , are convinc that market is the exclus art of embellish realiti and lie about it , sinc it present a product that is not quit what is promis to the consum . and of cours almost everyon ha suffer a huge dissappoint when buy for exampl a tooth past that doe not whiten the teeth in five second , as it wa state in the packag , or when notic that a packag of regular batteri last the same or more than the one the bunni said would last forev . i believ , everi proffes is suscept to human vice . ly is therefor not exclus of advertris , nor is it characterist of them . i think there are , of cours , advertis who will be will to sell ani product regardless of it is someth benign for societi or not , or if it is actual the product they are promis to consum . nonetheless , these event occur in almost everi proffess , account that do not pay their costum tax , driver that drive unsaf , real estat who sell damag or overpr properti . so , the fact that some peopl will want to take advantag of other peopl is present wherev ther is interact between human be . the onli thing we can do about it , is to reli on ethic ground and hope that eveveryon will perform the job they are expect to in the most honest manner .
