i do not agre with the statement , that in twenti year fewer car are in use than there are today . my opinion can be support by the follow fact . first of all the use of car at high number is restrict to the so call `` first '' world mean mostli europ and the america . in mani area around the world where we do have a high number of peopl live , like africa , india or like in china the use of car is limit to a small amount of the poulat onli . we alreadi can see here first sign point in that direct look at the grow infrastructur in china and india deal alreadi now the furtur expans in the number of car . when these countri do further follow the path of modern we will have in twenti year a much higher number of peopl be abl to purchas and drive a car . and even in the `` first '' world we do observ a trend to a further individu be seen for exampl that peopl move out of citi more in rural area . and in addit to huge countri like usa or brasil where peopl have travel rather long distanc to go shop or to go to a hospit , have a car is even more import . so we have here on the one hand a real need for a car for cover distanc and on the other hand the person wish to be independ and individu by have an own car . base on the fact desctrib abov we will have global an increas of the number of car due to the modern of major part of the world and due to the individu of other part of the world . and both reason do requir car either for just transport or for fullfil person think .
