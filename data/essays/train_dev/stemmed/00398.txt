the car is alway been , sinc the time of it creation , an import mean of transport . while in the past , it wa a reserv mean , which wa prerog of the richest part of the popul , nowaday it is use by almost the 85 % of the world popul the question is : but will it remain a success mean among twenti year or will be replac ? or even more , will it disappear ? i think that all depend by the progress of techonolog in fact the improv of the man 's style condit could allow a new born also in mechan field in fact , the discov of new electron element could bore to a new transport mean and so render the car useless , but from the other hand thi research ca n't never occur if there are n't fund and so money in my opinion , between twenti year , the car in use will be more than nowaday and not fewer , but they will have almostli , new confort and qualiti than the recent one . for exampl they could have more sophist circuit that allow to the driver to orient whatev is hi destin or they would be less pollut than one , perhap with a non pollut system which convert the carbon dioxid into oxygen prevent all the diseas that characher the urban citizen but , on the other hand , if there will be more car , it would creat an overcrowd in the street : all the peopl who have the car in fact use it almost the daytim and with the crowd of the streets. , the man ' / women 's attitud could chang give origin to some unpleas event in conclus , i think that , if in the futur , there will be an increas of the car , which in my opinion will occur , i hope the peopl learn to use it in a properli way .
