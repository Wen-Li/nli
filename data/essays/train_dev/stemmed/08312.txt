in my opinion , travel is a process for peopl to broaden their view fo world , to learn and share with other ' cultur and to adjust their mind and bodi into a harmon way . and thi whole process for travel is neither necessarili in group nor led by the tour guid . first of all , with the fast-pac improv of inform technolog , one can go on the internet and search for ani detail inform for ani area . there is not so mani need for a guid to tell you what the histori and riddl of the scene are , instead we can easili find those inform we want on the internet . secondli , the guid group are more like to have a schedul on when and what to travel . thi is obvious against the natur of the travel , we need more time to talk to peopl and share the wisdom of life , which seem a tough and even imposs task for the tour guid , sinc to some extent , they had to follow the simpl principl , time is money . if we travel by ourself , we can arrang our time freeli , if there is a point of intersest that attract you a lot , we can reschedul it to go back one day later or even more . thirdli , we can know where our money spend when travel by ourself , there is no way that you know the same thing when you give the money to the tour guid . it sometim ruin my mood of travel by suspect that the guid may keep some of our money to hi own pocket . also , some guid may pull you to some restaur or local shop that are not attract to us at all , which in return the restaur and shop give bonu back to the guid . to me myself , i will feel cheat under such circumst . in summari , i am against the statement in the question .
