today , the major mean for transport is automobil . especi in europ and america , a famili may own up to 4 car for a household of four peopl . when ad togeth , it make a whole lot of car out there . but the main reason behind thi is that own a car is the most conveni way to get around , and sinc it is privat properti , you can use it anytim you want . i believ that the number of car may decreas in twenti year ' time for some reason . the first reason is more like sci-fi . as we are introduc to a new technolog everyday , it is plausibl enough to dream of a differ mean of transport as conveni and privat as a car , such as privat helicopt . i have to admit twenti year may not be long enough for scientist to invent small enough helicopt that would fit the roof of suburban hous . but as i said , it is plausibl , at least to me . the more solid reason whi i believ that there will be fewer car in near futur concern ecolog , demograph and environment issu . it is alreadi obviou that the world is becom over-popul , especi at citi center . at such place , the traffic is jam more than anywher els . danger gase that car produc not onli pollut the air , they also affect the cours of climat , chang . they also harm the health of peopl . it could be argu that we can get rid of the pollut by use fuel other than ga , but the problem of traffic would still remain , henc it would not be a complet solut . concern scientist and engin are alreadi think about way to lessen the number of car . one good way to do that is to establish better mean of public transport : wide enough to reach anywher a person may want to go at all hour of the day . such a solut would avoid traffic jam and caus less air pollut . with a good public transport , especi if it cost cheaper than ga , peopl would be encourag to use it instead of car . henc , the number of car would decreas in near futur . i believ thi chang will take place in near futur and we will hope see less car on the road .
