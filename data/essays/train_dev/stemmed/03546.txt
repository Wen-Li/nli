most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the idea of the advertis is that the peopl realli want to obtain a specif product even if they have not taken , so in my opinion the creation of an advertis is a busi work , is a market job and what the factori want to do is to offer a product that seem great becaus if the peopl see someth that it look good and special is possibl that they are go to get it and tri it . in my opinion there are some advantag and some disadvantag of thi advertis . first of all some of the advantag are that the advertis reflect what is the product look like , it a good clue to find peopl to buy the product , it a good comun between the saler and the client , is a way to promot a new product , and actual a new way to buy thing becaus peopl are veri busi and do not have enough time to go shop is buy thing that they look in newspap , magazin public , and tv market thi one becom veri famou dure the last year becaus most of the peopl watch tv so is a medium to have an idea about the product and it ha an advantag you just make a phone call and you can receiv your product back in your home inmedi . but some disadvantag are that may be the product seem much better than they realli are , they seem biger than they realli are , they tast better than they realli are . so it up to everyon if we get or not a specif product . in my case i think i am agre with the posit that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are becaus today the market is the public of a product
