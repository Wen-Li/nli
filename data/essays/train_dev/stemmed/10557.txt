in my opinion the assert that young peopl should give more time to help their commun is right but i also want to point the reason out whi there are fewer teenag or even young adult make less contribut to their commun nowaday . the claim that young peopl should take care for their commun is certainli right but there are so mani reason these day that make it much more difficult . peopl have their own problem nowaday . especi young peopl alway face the threatin of unemploy . the labour market today is veri difficult so when student finish school they are frighten of get unemploy what make it difficult for them to addit care for the interest of other peopl . furthermor nowaday the connect to your commun is not as big as it wa fifti year ago . my grandmoth went to the chirch everi sunday and she knew nearli everybodi in her commun . everyth wa more person . today mani peopl do not even know their neighbour so there is a lack of interest in help other peopl and mani peopl just care about their own . some peopl may also think that chariti doe not get appreci in an appropri way . i must total agre with that opinion becaus i just help in the church do some work in the garden and there wa not even anybodi who told me thank you for it . thi are all reason to exemplifi whi i would disagre with a claim of more help from young peopl in their commun . even though i think that especi elder peopl and the govern should make an effort to help get young peopl envolv in their commun again . if children , teenag and young adult would identifi with their commun , get a feedback of their contribut and see that they can chang thing and in thi way can make a contribut to the commun i think they would certainli think differ about chariti work or even just help an older woman cross the street or carri her heavi bag .
