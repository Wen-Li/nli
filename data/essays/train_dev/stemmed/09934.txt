i believ that is veri difficult to understand idea and concept and it is simpler and faster to learn fact . in my opinion , you can understand a fact without know idea and concept about it but you ca n't understand idea if there are not fact and practic exampl that support the idea ! it is difficult to understand idea becaus they are made by other peopl with concept and way of think differ from your . and also , peopl have differ idea on differ argument , so is not possibl to explain or to describ someth in one way or in one idea , everyon can have variou and differ idea . idea can often be manipul by peopl who want their idea to be domin . a fact , to the contrari , ca n't be chang , it is the same for everybodi and hi evid prove that it can not be chang . a fact can also be funni , scari , interest . .. it can give an emot impress which is easier to rememb then an idea . if student learn fact , they can make connect between those fact and idea and concept that they alreadi have . on my way of think , for exampl , learn fact is veri import while one is studi histori : when children learn histori about nazism and holocaust , they ca n't understand the mean of thi word if they do n't know what happen , so , they ca n't understand if they do n't know the fact ! ti could happen also in other subject like biolog : concept and idea are mad onli after a fact ha been observ ! onli after know fact it 's possibl to figur out the mean of the concept . idea have to be support by fact ! the first step and the more effici way to learn is to know and learn fact .
