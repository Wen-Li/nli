although young peopl tend to have more energi to do someth than older peopl do , i disagre with the idea that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . there are two reason for thi : money and experi . to bigin with , the old peopl usual have more money than young peopl have . thi mean older have more opption to do someth than younger . for instanc , when we want to travel somewher , the panphlet of travel for senior tend to be costli than those for famili or young peopl . thi is becous , the older have tendenc to eat better dish or ride on more comfort vheicl . howev , in gener , young peopl focu on the cost . we can also thi tendenc in panphlet of travel . thi show that the older can more flexibl how to spend their money and how to select their plan . next , older peopl have more expereinc than younger peopl which are base on the long life time . therefor , older peopl have less possibl to make wrong dicis . for exampl , when we ca n't decid which way to choos about someth , we are often consult by older . thi is becaus , if we decid wrong way , sometim we reciev inconveni . thi mean that older poepl can avoid such inconveni by their own judgement . for these reason , i take issu with the idea that young peopl lead more enjoy life than old peopl . each group of peopl can enjoy their life as their own way .
