i agre with thi statement . if they do not get the main idea and just know some fact about it , it would n't be a good thing for the student . for me , at the same time , i wa think if i agre or disagre with the statement . becaus , i am in high school freshman year right now . i take ancient histori for social studi . first of all , when i just start read the text book and tri to understand the main idea about histori , i cant get everyth in my mind . mayb it is just me but first i alway have to get some interest fact to make myself want to learn about histori . right now , i am lear about the crusad . i did n't have ani idea what crusad were . so i start read the text book and tri to get a main idea . but it never made myself want to read farther . i decid to go onlin and look up for some fact about the crusad . i think it wa someth like there wa thi girl who lost her mother when she wa small . all she knew about her mother wa that she live in a differ countri . she knew that the crusad travel around and spread christian . although she thought it wa go to be hard to find he mother . but she thought it is better than do noth . therefor , she decid to spread the christian with them . i got that fact onlin and i am not sure if it a true fact but it still made me want to know how the crusad travel and their where . by get fact , i got the main idea at the end . but if i get the main idea at first , i think it would of been easier to studi later on . so in my opinion , understand idea and lear fact are both realli import . but idea are more import for student first .
