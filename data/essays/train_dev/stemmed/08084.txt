in light of the latest develop that the whole world wit on regular and daili base , thi issu is consid of a particular impot and it 's pretti vital to refer to . let me first explain explicitli my total reject and oppos point of view regard thi statement , as it seem so reticul to me though , i have my reason for have a full faith that the world would see an outrag and sharp rise in the number of car , not mere in the next twenti year but till the technolog introduc an altern mean of transport , my belief is base on the ground that as long as there is an consider increas in the popul , and as long as we see an expans in the job that depend entir on the car and other differ vehicl , the product of such car wo n't ceas and eventu thi will lead to street pregnant with car so to speak . the car were and will continu to be a veri sensit and indespens element in our live , so who could imagin himself even for one day without that mean of transport which mean give ride to peopl to their place of work , give ride to the kid to their day care , can we imagin a hospit whithout the vehicl that transfer the critic case to it in the sprinkl of the eye ! as well as to the above-ment reason , there is anoth key issu that i must bring up , the car is consid the way of live and the sourc of livelihood for the overwhelm major of the peopl ; such as the cap driver , truck driver and even the drive licens instructor , so accept the idea of drop off the number of car in the next few year will lead us to the thought of end up with million of peopl out of work . in conclus , i need to stress on the import of the car in our live on the larg scale , regardless of the disadvantag it could have .
