success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . as far as i am concern , i 'm agre with thi statement for three main reason : firstli , i think that a person is success becaus he or she take risk . in fact in the busi world if you do someth you would obtain a good result to be a success person . so you can obtain a good result onli if you take one or some risk . for exampl in a compani you are an import manag and your work is alway perfect . but you want to take a promot and so you take a risk : you chang your type of work and so your result becom differ . if your leader appreci your new work you will take a promot but if your work is n't good you wo n't take a promot . secondli , risk are beauti becaus a static work is not as nice as a veri activ work with a lot of risk and chang . in fact i think that you will becom a success person onli if you do a veri activ work . for exampl bill gate is a veri success person but he is success onli becaus year ago he took a big risk : in fact he creat a comput compani and he spent a lot of money in thi work . so he took a risk and now he is a veri success and rich person . final i think that the succesf peopl are peopl who manag our world while the other peopl wait and see . in fact our world is so beauti becaus some success peopl have creat a lot of thing for our life . for exampl some success peopl have creat car and airplan to make our life more confort . in conclus my opinion is that tri new thing and take risk are veri import becaus if you do thi you will becom a veri success person . otherwis you are a normal , static person .
