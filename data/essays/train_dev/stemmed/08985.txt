i dont agre to the topic given to me that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . thi is becaus , enjoy is a vagu term and there is no uniqu way of measur enjoy . the defin of enjoy chang from person to person . i ca n't take a firm stand and state that young peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl do . let take my own exampl . as a young guy , i love play sport , freak out with my friend , go on an adventur trip , listen to music etc . i enjoy myself when i involv in these activ . thi is enjoy for me . let take the exampl of my grandfath . he is not in a posit to do all that i can do , but that doe n't mean that he doe not enjoy life or enjoy less than i do . he enjoy the seren of the place he live in , he enjoy play with us and also enjoy spend qualiti time with our famili . thi is the mean of enjoy for him . what i realli ca n't do is to measur hi degre of enjoy and compar it with mine . the defin of enjoy might also chang when i take an exampl of an other old man or an other young guy . let consid an other old man who is fulli fit and is in a posit to indulg in all the activ that i realli enjoy . though , the old man might not perform to the same level as i can but there is a possibl that he might enjoy do the same . even in thi case , measur hi degre of enjoy and compar it with mine is not possibl . let take the exampl of an other young guy who defin enjoy as attain success in hi desir field of studi . he might enjoy each and everi step that is involv in make him a success person . the same activ can be done by an old man but he might defin enjoy in a differ way . he might enjoy onli by read the same and not have ani sort of concern toward the result of such a studi . i conclud my essay by say that the term enjoy is veri vagu and it difficult for me to take a firm stand on who enjoy more until and unless i am provid with a method or a formula that measur the degre of enjoy for each and everi individu .
