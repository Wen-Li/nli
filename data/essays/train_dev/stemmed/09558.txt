my person experi lead me to state that know the fact is more import than understand idea and concept , mainli becaus i think one should tri to be as indepen as possibl in life , thi includ the way one 's own idea are form after be explain from a third parti in order to be understood . i think what i am look for is probabl an imposs concept : object inform , or ani fact one would like to make research on that are not pre-process or in ani way filter . fact , although affact by who they are repres and report by , are far more object than idea and concept that may be commun by other peopl , simpli becaus if one is given the idea or concept alreadi , he or she will not be given the right to a more person judgment . i think thi topic particularli affect me , sinc i have progress becom awar of how much more knowledg of fact i need in order to understand the present matter of the societi i live in . thi includ the understand of polit in my countri in the first place and intern in the second place , obvious follow by histori . recent i final mang to find some time out of my schedul for read more about the histoy of the last centuri in itali , while the next step will be the peopl 's histori , a book on the american histori , probabl follow by some reasearch on anoth main topic of our recent time : war on terror and their polit as well as histor background . i am convinc that onli fact can make me have the whole pictur and that onli a vast eagl view on them , as a multiple-sourc investig can offer , will eventu lead closer to a better , more solid object idea , concept or belief to stick with when choos in life .
