i disagre with the idea that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are sever reason to explain my point . first of all , i believ that it is necessari for student to learn fact first , which will help them to grasp knowledg and make them get a sens of feel of what they 've known about the world around them and help them to perceiv their own idea . ontolog and epistomolog are the basic element for human be to understand the world and the realiti . it is especi import for student to learn fact . secondli , i think it is equal import for student to understand idea and concept and learn fact . as idea and concept are come from the fact that leart , they are correl with each other . student can not fulli grasp the idea or concept if they lack basic knowledg of fact , on the contrari , fact are meaningless if idea and concept could not be understood . for instanc , the idea that hungri cat will more porbabl catch move object like bird and mise than the one that are full could be fulli understood onli if student got an idea that cat prefer mise and bird as their food , which is the common sens . thirdli , understand fact will better enabl student to grasp idea and concept and help them to put the idea and concept into practic . take anoth exampl to illustr thi view , the fact that peopl will fail down easili on an ici road will help student better konw the idea that it should be care to walk on an ici road , and the experi that eros will decreas the possibl of fail down and splite salt water will increas the melt time of ice will make peopl carri these concept out in realiti so that the road will be much safer to walk on . in short , it is in a rush to say that understand idea and concept is more import for student than for them to learn fact . from the analysi abov , we may conclud that understand idea and concept and learn fact are interact with each other and hold the idea of they are equal import will help us better understand the realiti and the world around us .
