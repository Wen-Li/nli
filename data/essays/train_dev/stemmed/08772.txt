i respect disagre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i see that mani of my young friend are engag in someth that is ultim aim to help their commun . for exampl , some of them do social work , includ help homeless , elderli peopl and disabl . they want to feel social use and help the other ultim make them feel closer to the commun they live in . they are so enthusiast about their social work that they tri to make as much time as possibl to dedic to it . i have done and continu to do social work myself . howev , time is never enough , particularli if one consid that social work is gener unpaid . my friend and i do social work in our spare time . in fact all of us have differ main job , which are import to pay the bill ( but work to pay the bill is not alway just enough ) . some other friend of mine are engag in local polit . they believ that they can chang their societi in a way that is more suitabl to their valu and realiti . they have therefor decid to play an activ role in shape local polit . thi is not an easi task , at least where i come from . exist polit belong to a differ gener and gener view younger peopl as too unexperienc for polit . on the contrari , i see young peopl 's polit commit as just anoth way to help their commun . and is n't it true that polit should be the express of democraci and particip of all citizen ( includ young peopl ) to our societi ? on the basi of these exampl , taken out of my person experi , i believ that young peopl more and more tri to find time to help their commun , becaus they want to chang the realiti they live in . howev , my experi may well be differ from other realiti and other part of the world , where the particip of young peopl in their commun is limit . i feel that help their commun can be veri reward for young peopl who make time for that . at least thi is what i have seen in my own experi .
