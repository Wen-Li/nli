i agre with the idea that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . first , i think the idea and consept make the fact . just a fact as it is ha no mean . for exampl , as for stude histori , `` someth war '' is not import . whi they began war , what did the war bring them , is import to studi . second , if student understand ieda and consept , they can possibl make better fact from same idea and concept . let 's assum that the student studi about idea and concept of the car , some student maight think about other type of viecl . it may grow the imagin of the student . third , if student did n't understand idea and concept , they could use fact in the wrong way . it is sometim danger . when i work in sushi restaur as a sushi chef , i train a young ladi . she did n't know whi we use the rubber globe for clean . she touch the deterg by bear hand . then her hand b thi is whi i think understand idea and concept are more import for student .
