some peopl think that it is better to learn about lot of subject instead of special in one specif subject . i prefer the second postur , studi one specif subject . i think like thi becaus i would like to be the best person in the world to deal whith my futur job . if everyon thoght as me , there would n't exist competit to get job post . i prefer to do my best in the subject i like , rather than perform not so well in mani academ subject . thi decis should be well thought by everyon . if we want to have a perfect world we should dedic veri hard to the subject we like . in my opinion , when someboadi finish hi or her career and ha the doubt of have a master on that subject or studi anoth thing to broaden hi or her knoledg , the decis should be the first one mention . have a broad knowledg ha it advantag to . for instanc , if some one need help , you would be abl to give him a piec of advic , but thi piec of advic wo n't be the same one given by a specialist in the subject . to sum up , i think in the world should exist peopl with both type of knowledg , so as to complement themselv in a good way . but , i think that there is more need of specialist than of peopl with a broad knowledg . thi doe not mean that specialist will know onli about hi subject . then , when he finish hi master , he can incorpor know of other type of subject in a differ way . in conclut , i think i would prefer special in onli one specif subject so as to be a great profession in my job .
