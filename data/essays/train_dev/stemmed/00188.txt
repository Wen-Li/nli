the live of youngster have chang a lot throughout the year . some peopl agre that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun nowaday . in my opinion , young peopl do not help their communuti as much as they use to , becaus they think that they have better thing to do like the use of technolog and studi . technolog ha driften apart children from their commun . the smallest commun is a famili and some young peopl do not even help their famili anymor . for exampl ; their is a huge differ between my mother and i . she alway tell me stori about how she use to help her mother with the hous work and chore sinc she had noth els better to do . i do not get involv in these kind of event that much aroung the hous becaus of the technolog that surround me . i am so busi watch tv , or play video game , or talk on the phone that i do not realiz some of the thing that goe on around the hous . technolog is one of the reason children today do not help their commun that much anymor . studi ha been an import fact on whi kid can not help their commun as much as they use to as well . the amount of work and the subject taught in school have chang so much late that kid sometim have to studi all day long . for exampl ; my school give out a lot of homework for one night and it take me quit a number hour to finish it , and by the time i am done it is time to go to bed , but my mother tell me that in her time they didi not have that mani homework so when they finish they had the time to help around in the hous or in their neighborhood . kid do not understand that sometim help peopl or help a commun is the best thing you can do in your life . as a result , young peopl have to move away from the technolog that ha been drift them apart from their commun , and they have to be taught to studi with a program so it will not take that much . help peopl is much more import than watch tv or studi .
