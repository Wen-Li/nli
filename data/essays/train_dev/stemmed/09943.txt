i think it is more import for student to learn fact than it is for them to understand idea and concept . student need basic knowledg first . furthermor , student will use knoweldg more often rather than onli idea or concept . final , it will be easier to understand idea and concept when the student have enough knowledg and fact . first of all , student should be logic first . student are on the proccess of be matur and complet . human will not becom matur or knowledgebl if they do not learn fact . in my opinion , a person get suffici fact an second , student will use knowledg more often rather than use idea or concept . for exampl , there are lot of assign which the student are requir to do . the most of assign are about research and analyz someth . even if a student who is lack of fact know mani idea and concept , he will not get high mark . it is a veri obviou fact . not onli in the school , but also in the futur when he get a job and work in the compani without fact and knowledg , he will get into troubl . final , when they have suffici knowledg and fact , they can understand idea and concept easili . for instanc , a student tri to understand a concept of democraci . if he ha knowledg about democraci , it will be much easier to learn what is democraci . therefor , that learn fact is much more import for student rather than understand idea and concept . it is due to the fact that student need knowledg first , that know fact will be much more useful rather than understand idea . also , when they have enough fact and knowledg , it is easi to understand concept and idea . i do not mean that idea and concept are uncondit wrong . howev , fact will be more useful when the student complet their project or when they work in the societi in the futur .
