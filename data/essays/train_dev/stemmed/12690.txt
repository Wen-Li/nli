i support the notion that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i would like to support thi with the follow observ from my person experi . with the advent of technolog , a greater number of mean are avail for young peopl to enjoy life . when i wa kid the aveneu for enjoy were limit in india . now kid at young age have differ option such as video game which i never had an access to . thi translat to the older peopl too , who would have no access to these gadget . even if they have access they have to develop the aptitud and zeal to learn how to oper these devic . in the era of consumer more and more product are offer for the young gener becaus they control the spend . compani that tailor their offer to the old peopl are between far and few . i feel thi also ha to do with the age . as peopl grow they becom more matur , their interest chang and they also tend be more appreci of the need of the famili member . as a result they curb their activ and go into their own shell . last but not the least , with the onset of the old age peopl start suffer with variou ailment that take off their most time . they have to restrict or avoid outdoor fun activ which they would have done in their younger year . have said that young peopl enjoy life more , i would not like to state that old peopl do not enjoy life at all . but as discuss abov the mean chang as the time pass and they start limit their activ .
