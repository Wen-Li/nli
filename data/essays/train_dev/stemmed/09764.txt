the question wheter or not there will be fewer car on the road in the futur ha been discuss by mani articl . i do not think that in 20 year there will be fewer car in use than today . the reason whi i think the number of car wo n't declin is base in the function a car ha and the benefit of a car that human apprecci about own one . it ha to do with the attitud most human seem to have , concern car . mani peopl love their car and have almost an emot relationship with it . they think of it as prestig and statu symbol and use it for express themselv and make a statement of who they reali are . other poepl like the most about car that they give them the opportun to be flexibl . a car give the freedom to visit a place whenev the driver want to and also give the freedom to leav a place when wish . peopl reach freedom through car . freedom is one of the most import valu of western societi . it is someth that we do not want to give away . when we think about reason whi there could be a declin in car on the street in the futur , we often think about the often mention oil-scarc or the depend of western countri on oil-produc eastern countri . i am awar of the fact that those thing are import and difficult to solv . but what make me sure that the number of car wont be reduc is the faith in new innov . i believ that one day we reali need to find someth new , there will be a new invent . one exampl for thi can be seen in the case of the vw lupo , which is a car model that onli use up five liter of fill on 100 kilomet . thi model wa releas shortli after oil price rose up high . some articl say that vw had the car readi and wa just wait for the right opportun to bring it on the market . i could imagin that car manufactur also have the right idea of how to make drive possibl in a true clean way , without pollution-caus engin and without use regular fill . furthermor , i think that onc such car are invent and accept by a bigger part of popul , they will be produc on assembl line and in high ammount . thi would make them avail for mani peopl . conclud , i think that the number of car wo n't be reduc becaus peopl dont want to give away their car , which give new innov the room to creat a new car that can be driven without neg effect .
