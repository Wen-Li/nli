have you ever bought someth dfferent from the fli ? how do you feel when thi happen to you ? as a matter of fact , i do agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . becaus of the develop of technolog , businessmen like to use technic way to make their commerci look attract to custom . whi i agre with the statement is due to the follow reason . first of all , in my opinion , businessmen realiz if they want everyon to buy their product , they ought to have a good advertis becaus human can be attract by nice pictur . for exampl , i like to eat instant noodl and one day there wa a new flavor come up and when i saw the commerci on tv , the noddl look like veri delici . howev , after i bought one pack of that instant noodl , i tri it and i found it did not tast like the one i saw on tv . i wa upset about that . thu , make a good advertis is a way that businessmen like to use to attract peopl . secondli , in term of busin , advertis are consid as the best way to sell product . for exampl , my friend is run a carpet compani and befor he open thi compani , he wa ask me for set up a websit for hi compani . ultim , i did a great job on the task that he assign me . when he saw the websit , he told me it wa incred . moreov , becaus of thi websit , he got mani custom . howev , in hindsight , the pictur that i put on the websit look much better than they realli are in that i use a veri good camera . therefor , advertis are the way that businessmen use to sell product . in conclus , most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are becaus custom are attract easili by those beauti pictur . furthermor , good advertis are also use by businessmen . in the end i would like to summar my argument by emphas that do not buy those product if you do not trust the advertis .
