at first glanc , we may think that speacilaz in one subject is good for us as we can concentr all our time and energi on just one subject . but have thi kind of strategi might prevent us from to complet our necessari improv . firstli , all kind of scienc have complex structur that no specif subject can be thought to be complet independ from other academ subject . have no knowledg about other academ subject is someth that will alway limit us dure our studi . for instanc , a comput scientist like me may never need inform about scienc like physic or chemistri dure univers studi . but if on one day , i need to creat a softwar for a compani that produc chemic product , i will need asist from other peopl for everyth that is relat to chemistri . from the project i have made for the industri , i realiz that have some knowledg about everi topic realli help . in fact , a comput engin can not be seen as a real engin , if he doe not even have basic concept of gener engin principl . he will alway will be incomplet and in need of help from other peopl . in addit , as far as i learn from the softwar industri , have broad knowledg of mani subject is someth that seper you from other peopl in the same area and make you chosen instead of other . if we realli want to be good in our job , thi can not be succeed by just concentr on one subject . anoth fact is that there are so mani interest academ subject in the scienc . we may be happi if we can have spend some time on some other subject and improv ourselv . it is not a good thing to limit ourselv to just one subject all the time as there might be lot of topic that might be interest for us . in conclus , i agre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . as we have time and resourc to get knowledg about mani academ subject dure our univers studi , we should tri to get familiar with the highest number of academ subject and we should not limit ourselv to just one top .
