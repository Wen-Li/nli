everi onc in a while , we take a vacat and go travel to differ countri . we want to see and experi other cultur other than our own dure these travel . there are two differ way to do thi , either through the leadership of a tour guid or to explor by yourself . i believ that travel by yourself without a tour guid is the best way to travel . first of all , the beauti of explor is the fact that you do not know what you will find . if you have a tour guid to tell you all the fun secret and place , then where is all the fun in that ? and often , the tour guid and the group will express their own opinion upon the place and object that you come across . which isnt all that good becaus it limit our insight on the cultur we choos to explor . secondli , the best way the fulli experi a cultur , is to roam the street yourself and find out what interest object you see or what happen on the street . if you let yourself roam the street and becom part of the societi , you will be abl to discov and learn mani thing that you will not be abl to learn if you are walk with a tour guid . in addit to that , learn through experi is a lot better and more satisfi than someon tell you about it . when you get a vacat to travel , you want to get away from all the stress and author at work . if you do not travel with a tour guid , you will be abl to acheiv that goal more effect , becaus if you travel with a tour guid , you will still feel that someon is in charg of your life . the next time you travel , i highli suggest that you do not hire a tour guid . a tour guid realli limit your travel experi to mere sightse . travel alon and experi the cultur while becom one with it is in my opinion , the best way to travel .
