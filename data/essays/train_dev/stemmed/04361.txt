we all pass by difficult moment in our live that will help us gain experi . i agre with the qout that say 's `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' , for mani differ reason . a person who tri 's new thing in hi life , will gain experi and knowledg . take risk and learn new thing will develop a person emot and physic . it is a good thing for a person to be adventur , and go through differ kind 's of situat 's , becaus it help him learn new thing and lesson in life . by learn these new lesson 's , and by be more experienc , a person will suddenli see himself optimist , and happi . hi reason for live will increas , becaus he will love life more , and would like to do new stuff that will entertain , and teach him . i think that a risk taker is a veri confid person , that know 's what he want 's in life , and he is lucki to have thi characterist . it is a posit action that each person must choos to sucsse in live , unlik the peolp that onli do what they know . these peopl that are not risk taker 's will eventu find themselv not capabl of do anyth in life . they will regret not be riski , and not do and tri everyth new in life , and will hope and wish for time to go back , and do whatev they did not do . the differ between these two kind of peopl is that one is readi and will to learn new thing and lesson 's in live , while the other is be self-reli , scare , and lazi , and he will not sucsse in live as much as the confid , risk taker . in conclus , take risk will never affect a person in a neg way . it will help a person to have a great self-esteam , will make hi confid grow , and will make him success in ani situat he is go to face in life .
