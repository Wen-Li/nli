in twenti yer we will live in a differ world in which we will have completli avoid pollut by wast less natur resourc as possibl . in my opinion , we have alreadi experi success the method to reach thi aim consum everyday less oil and use more bicycl and pubblic transport . as a matter of fact the cost of the bu ticket is go down becaus peopl is start again to consid thi way of transport as a valid altern to hi own car and as an easiest possibl to save money ( nowaday , the cost of oil is grow too much and , on averag , onli 2 person per 5 are avail to spend a lot of money for it ) and to avoid to be stuck in the traffic of the citi center . but refus to drive car and choos to go to work by foot or to reach univers by bicycl is also a good motiv to keep in haelth and to do an everyday-lif gym without spend ani money which can help us to mantain younger and good-look as long as possibl in order to teach our children or grand children to respect natur and to improv our physic attitud simpli by use an altern transport to car . in fact , car ( as we are use to think of them ) are doom to be fewer becaus we will improv the prototyp for differ way to give locomot to them . recent studi have assert that is possibl to make car work by involv hydrogen inst of oil and it could pollut and cost ever less than a tradit car . so , i am sure that car in twenti year will disappear and we will be abl to support the miss of altern transport better becaus technolog is work to give us the best of itself in order to improv the qualiti of our life .
