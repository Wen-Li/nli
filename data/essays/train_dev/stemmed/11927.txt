with the televis and the other mass media in the last 50 's year we had seen a develop of the advertis . the advertis is use to improv the market of a good , but in a fair market the advertis can not be fals , the adrevrtis ha to show the good in a realist way . it is troue tought that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , but the point is that the product is the same but there is under , uncov , a commun game that can chang the percept of the peapl , sametim is a music , sametim the combin of the color , other time the situat that is rappres . so , the point is not the qualiti of the product , but how you feel when you have that product . i think that custom have to know that advertis sametim chang the real import of a product , that there is a psicolog game under the advertis . is import understand how the inform is real and what is fair in the market and if is fair that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the most import exampl i think is the cigarett advertis , thi can show us how a bad good , nociv for our healti , is trasmet like a good product . i think that everybadi should think befor buy someth .
