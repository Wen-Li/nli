over the year , peopl have develop two veri import theori about a student 's develop . some will say that it is more import for a student to understand idea and concept and other will say that it is more import for them to learn fact . person , i believ that both theori are import , but the understand of idea and concept is the real key to a student 's success . i say thi becaus if a student just learn fact , that is all that they are learn , simpl fact . on the other hand , if a student learn to understand concept and idea , he or she is get the tool to face all type of situat in school , univers , job , and life itself . a clear exampl of what i mention abov are two friend that i grew up with , but graduat from differ school . one of them graduat from a school where their princip object wa to teach the student how to think , analyz and understand concept and idea besid just teach them fact and the other one came from a school where the main teach techniqu wa to make student memor all type of inform . when the time to go to the univers came , both student graduat from school with excel grade but the differ among them start to show on the way . the one that wa use to learn and memor fact start to experi seriou difficulti if thing did n't work out exactli as they were suppos to , while the one train to understand concept and idea found out how to work hi way through the chang and experienc much better result . over the year , the student who wa just taught fact saw the result that the other one wa obatain and final comprehend that he need to chang . onc he did , thing start work out much better for him . i am sure that the exampl i mention abov happen all the time all over the world . person , i wa lucki enough to be taught to understand concept and idea rather than just plain fact and i can assur that it ha help me a lot throughout my life becaus it ha given me the tool to comprehend , understand and analyz thing from differ point of view , from differ perspect and to look for solut when appar ther are n't ani , which you wo n't be abl to do if you just learn fact .
