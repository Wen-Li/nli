thi is a difficult and veri interest import statement . in order to answer the question we have to consid the advantag and disadvantag of car and we have to diucuss the attitud of the peopl in view of car , traffic , air pollut . .. on the on hand i do not agre with the statement . everyon ha a car , the peopl live longer than today and so there will be more driving-peopl . anoth reason is that a car is noth special - fifti year ago a car wa someth unbelievebl - it wa a wonder and onli a few peopl were abl to have a car . onli a few peopl were abl to buti a car or had the driver licenc . at the moment most peopl have the driver licens and it is easi to have a car without much money . there are mani possibil to get a car without earn much money , for exempl by pate step by step or by rent a car - and i think thi fact will be increas in the next year and will be much stronger than today . but on the other hand i agre with thi statement , and i hope it will be correct - thi would be veri veri import for us , our bodi our healthi our natur and our planet !!! fistli i think that the peopl are more sensibl with our natur . we all know that there are mani problem caus by us . the problem increas day by day and and the peopl are more heaten with ithem than twenti year ago , and i think in twenti year they will care more than today . they will not take the car unneccessari , such as drive from one shop to the other , they will walk more . anoth exempl is to drive allon - they will meet their job friend anb drive togeth , thi will be cheaper . secondli the commun help to reduc car . in is veri difficult to find a park place in the citi - so it would be much better to drive by bu . final the govern help to reduc the car with the veri veri high tax for have a car , for drive a car and for the ga . to sum up i can say there are mani reason for reduc the amount of car . and person i beliv that all peopl are interestet in our natur and healthi , so that the number of car will gradual discreas .
