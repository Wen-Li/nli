i actual think that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . let 's start with two simpl exampl . set up a new restor for instanc . the setter take a huge risk : he spend hi money , ask for loan . all of thi could lead him to sell hi hous , hi car to give the money back to the bank . but if he do not , mayb will he stay waiter for the rest of hi life . my second exampl is a person who want to marri hi girlfriend . that could seem to him like a terrif chang in hi routin . but if he do not , he can never know what a father life look like . i personnali think that tri new thing lead us to a better situat . by tri new thing you could invent or creat someth great . in a financi point of view , creat new thing is directli bound to the creation of new market , new custom and so on . furthermor , invent give the inventor a better satisfact than if he is alway do what he know . a other possibl consequ is to find out a new way to do the thing what you need to do . in thi case you could be more effici , or make the other feel better . for exampl a manag who set up a new method for hi worker to creat shoe , could reduc the nois that they have to face , and improv the factori 's product . anyway , if the new method doe not show good result , he alway can cancel it . on the other hand , i think that do what you alreadi know is fine if you agre with your situat ; e.g. you could refus a promot to manag if you prefer spend great time with your famili rather than have more respons in your workplac . i mainli agre with thi statement , but i think there could be some except , though .
