how do we recogn and differenti success peopl from other peopl ? what is the secret that bring someon from bottom to top ? is it a lightli touch given by one 's guardian angel , or a geniu one is born with or mere just luck ? i think that success peopl are defin by their creat or discov of someth that other have not . it is their abil to forse thing and have the courag and ambit to realiz them . it is not onli that they do take risk what lead them to success , but it also the commit and the sacrific they make along the way to success . for exampl thi year 's oscar winner for best director martin scorses , ha comit hi life to a career of direct movi . for mani year he made film that other did not dare to make . for mani year he wa nomin for the oscar but remain empti hand . but he did not yield and he continu to make movi with the same enthusiasm and resolut , alway tri someth differ and new , wich final brought him the award . he is an exampl of lifelong success . some peopl might be corag , some veri lucki . but i believ that what make a person differ and gift than the other peopl is hi or her resolut and the undi belief in what one 's do .
