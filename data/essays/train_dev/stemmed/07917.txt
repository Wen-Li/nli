someon ha rightli said : `` life is an ice cream , eat it befor it melt !! '' the topic that whether young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl is realli a veri interest one , make someon to think real deep about it . ` enjoy ' is one factor in life which is not relat to age . i think one enjoy life with heart . but , age factor do have an effect on the type and level of enjoy one can have and no doubt young peopl are at an advantag at thi . firsti , the zest & zeal with which a teenag or an adult will enjoy do an activ , an older person will n't be abl to do the same thing with the same energi level . he will get easili fatigu & loos hi interset soon . for instanc , on my birthday parti , we youngest hade much fun danc & play game . but , on the other hand , my grandpar could n't enjoy that much . they were realli tire and went off to sleep soon . secondli , the younger gener is more adventeri & like to discov and explor new idea , thing & place . wherea , age peopl think that they have seen a lot of thing in life and now they want to enjoy rest of their life peac . last but not the least , young mind are more tension free as they do not have ani pressur of respons and liabil . the child in them alway look for an opportun to enjoy like go for a picnic , restaur or a movi . wherea , the pressur of respons shoulder upon the older peopl limit the child within them from do all these thing . to conclud , i would like to say that both youger & older peopl enjoy their live in their own differnt way . while , fun , excitemnet , parti , danc & music mean the way to live life for youngest ; peac , calm , cherish old memori , mean enjoy to the old peopl !!
