i agre with the statement that it is better for a person to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than to special in one specif subject . special can be a good thing in life , it help a person to be good at what he doe and be effeci in hi work . howev , sometim if a person choos to take mani academ subject , it get interest . let say for exampl , a person take biolog , histori and phsycolog . all thi knowledg is a great advantag ! it lead the person to be more knowledg , more awar of lot of thing and also give a sens of fun . your mind expand and get differ and interest inform each day from differ topic . knowledg is a bunch of fact that you accquir from experi and everyday routin . knowledg on one thing make life bore especi for a person who is alway curiou and want to learn new thing . knowledg is unlimit , you have access to it anytim and anywher . i could choos to know everyth about one certain topic but that limit my knowledg to that one topic . but how about know inform about differ topic ? thi make you even more social with differ type of peopl . a doctor who know histori get peopl astonish . they begin to understand the fact that he is good at what he doe but also ha interest for mani other thing . in high school , i 've alway chosen differ elect like music , french and also comput lesson . i want to know more about each or even be good at them like in my major subject . it made me feel wise and abl to talk to peopl about alot of subject . i could argu and talk in differ area with differ type of peopl , it give a good impress and also make my life interest to learn new stuff and fact everyday . that explain whi actor now are persu career in sing or be leader of chariti act or organ . they want to tri more . it 's better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . to learn differ fact everyday give color to the mind . life is short as they say , so make use of it .
