better use of public transport and differ travel habit , lead to fewer car : sure , thi is the way mani ecologist dream of the ideal futur . but is it truli realist ? not mani argument avail today support thi vision . quit the opposit , in fact , seem to be take place . first , urban plan tend to induc an increas use of car . the tast for individu home , with garden , away from the citi 's pollut , encourag urban sprawl . the result of thi is that ani travel need a car . shop , mall , museum , are simpli too far away from the suburb for peopl to simpli walk there . some might argu that the oncom limit in avail oil ressourc , as well as the grow concern about global warm , might chang peopl 's behavior . howev , one could challeng thi view by notic the current improv in engin ' technolog . they tend to make car cleaner and less pollut . thi could make the moral dilemna to use the car or not an irrelev one . car will chang , not how often peopl use them . anoth import factor lie in the need of develop countri . china , india and brazil nowaday , and other countri tomorrow , have a grow middl class and urban popul . these peopl can afford to buy a car , even two . they might also start have countri hous , and car are often necessari to travel there . lastli , i believ travel by car correspond to a deep trend in our modern individualist societi . peopl , when confront with a choic , would rather travel alon or with their famili than with random stranger in a close space . thi show that time and money are not the onli factor when peopl have to choos between differ way to travel . how good you feel , how freeli you can behav when in a car , could outweigh seemingli more relev argument . the tendenc in the industri to custom each car for the individu custom is an illustr of the import of thi `` feel-good '' factor . all in all , i think these argument tend to go against the statement that the number of car in use will decreas . car and the use of car will evolv - but their number are not like to go down .
