ye , i agre with the sentenc becaus the most of advertis are fals and they induc peopl to buy them when their qualiti is veri low . the produc should think less to the sale than to the wealth of the peopl that will buy the product for exampl , if the product is food . the advertis ought to be more strictli to the realiti to show to the watcher the real characterist of the each product . in thi way a citizen can choos the best . in my opinion , all the product will make their think better and all the word said in an adverstis space will be perceiv and listen better . by the way i consid the advertis space a lost of time and i do n't listen them becaus , accord to me , they are all make to seem what they are n't . unfortun , in my life , i have bought a lot of product that seem much better than they realli were , but after one purchas i did n't bought them anoth time . instead , if the advertis were real and describ exactli what they show , peopl would believ in them yet . so , in conclus , all of us have to tri to show the truth of everi thing becaus it is the best way to make the other trust us .
