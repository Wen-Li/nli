everi statement ha two side one is neg and other is posit . but i will take a balanc stand for the abov statement . in twenti year there will be few car in use , if technolog advanc as rapidli as one can think . on the other side , there will be more car in use than today . firstli , if govern tri to emphas onli on the profit make task then there will be veri few car in futur . the peopl who are alreadi in power tri to overcom the middl class and low class peopl . they will tri to be at the highest level . on the other side of the coin , if gover make some polici that rich peopl can own limit facil . then other middl and low class peopl come into limelight . so they can start think of facilit . secondli , if govern concernd just with economi , then we can say that there will be fewer car in the futur . to maintain the system , govern need financi support also . if everi one tri to buy a car , then there must be lowest economi level . it can caus the problem of valueless resourc . thirdli , as the technolog advanc , rich peopl tri to get the latest facilit . but middl class peopl remain with their old car . thi advanc can be in face of less expens thing . so that other peopl can also purchas the same latest technolog car . in sum , i conclud that the number of car will be fewer if currenc valu will be higher . thi number can be increas if currenc valu will be less . so currenc level is depend upon the econom state of the countri . if the govern is well concern about the the growth and develop of the entir countri then there will be higher number of car in the furur .
