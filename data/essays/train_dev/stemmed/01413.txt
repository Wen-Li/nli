i believ that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do to do . becaus of two reason . first of all , succss peopl usual think about new thing and keep tri to be success . they may do not like to do same thing to the other . i think that they have a parson . howev , if they want to do new thing , they have to spend a lot of time and money . in addit , they do not know that will be succeed or not . i think they may contribut a societi or they want to get a good job . at second , they tri new thing for some porpsos . for exampl , if they want to be more rich , they tri to find more better job . becaus if they have personar , they may invent someth instead of money . in my opinion , i usual tri new thing eventhough i had to take risk . for exampl , i came in u. to studi nurs in a univers . when i came to u. befor , my parent did not permit me to go the univers . in parent opinion that i do not need to go to and univers and get a job in u. , becaus i alreadi have a nurs licens injapan . finari . i pasuad to my parent , and came here . howev , if i go to an univers , i have to spend a lot of time and money . but i believ that it is the best choic for me to studi inu. . so , if i have mani risk now , if ican contribut a societi , i think that is valuabl for me . in conclut , i think that peopl requir knowledg and skill . they will not succeed without it and also they will have a risk . but if they satisfi about that , i think they should do that befor think toomuch . becaus it will good opportunit . therefor , i think that peopl should tri to new thing .
