i agre with the statement that advertis make product seem much better . it is becaus of my thought , survey , poll , and experi first , famous person usal make most advertis . it appeal to peopl enoughli . most person want to be like actor , singer , and actress . mayb the product that is advertis by superstar is more attract to the peopl . scondli , the survey , conduct by cho-sun daili , one of the best paper in korea , show that three of fourth of overal candid of survey feel advertis product more quailifi . also the poll , conduct by same compani , show that peopl think that advertis product is more safe . thirdli , when i wa a high school student , my friend bought a product that is not advertis . it wa expens tape player . it wa disord in next day . my friend want to get gerente servic . he doe not get it . so he have to buy again and he buy advertis product , soni , becaus of servic . lastli , when i wa young , i had two toy . i do not had discremin between two toy . howev , i wa perfectli chang in my mind after advertis of superman , my hero in the past . although the toy is much cheeper than anoth , i alway take superman 's toy becaus i had proud of myself . in the conclus , given sever reason , i think that most advertis make the product seem much better than they realli . it seem that advertis make us atract to the product . ..
