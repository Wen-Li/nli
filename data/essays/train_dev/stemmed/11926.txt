i agre to the statement but i do n't think that thi idea it 's good . the success peopl do n't tri new thing and do n't take risk becaus they do n't want to do a wrong impress to the other peopl . in fact the success of a person in mani time is due to the other peopl idea and to the other peopl impress , and a person that just have the success do n't want to destroy it . in accord to that a success person do n't take a choic that is not sure , and do n't make an action that can to poor hi posit . that is not bad in all . in fact in modern time is veri difficult to have success and is not easi to take a decis that can chang all that you do in your life . but on the other way if you do n't take a risk you can not to growth your success , that becaus when you tri a new thing you take same risk but on the other hand if the new thing it 's good your success can becam bigger than befor . at the start of a life a person have n't success yet , onli dure the life your action make your success . the success peopl in the past ha take risk that to have success . in gener i think that onli take a risk you can do someth in your life , and if you tri new thing you can find a new matter that you can do veri well , and thi give at your success a power to larg it . it 's true that tri new thing is not simpl but i think that a person can to search the best everytim and everywher to enlarg hi success . we do n't have mani good thing if same brave peopl do n't tri to do that and do n't take the risk for their action .
