view differ greatli when it come to the discuss whether to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject or to special in one specif subject . on the one hand , some assert that have a wide rang of knowledg is better . while other think that it is better to special in one subject . howev , i think it is better to have a broad rang of knowledg . take engin for exampl , they are veri knowledg when it come to comput relat problem . but they are so isol in their comput field that when it come to other subject they have no clue . my friend john is the perfect exampl for such discuss . he is an excel student in the engin field . he can answer ani question you might have regard comput . howev , when we are talk about other subject , such as , art histori , he can not join our convers at all . anoth problem with focus on just one singl subject is that you will not know what els is out there . you might be interest in world histori , but becaus you are special in one subject . you have to spend all your time studi that subject and have no time to studi world histori . one of these day , when you look back . that might be the one thing that you regret the most . nevertheless , special in one subject have it advantag . you will have a veri clear and deep understand of that subject . but when we compar the advantag and disadvantag of special in one specif subject or not , the most obviou select is to have a broad knowledg of variou of academ subject . with the point note in the discuss , i agre with the statement . i think it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject .
