life could be enjoy in differ way take in consider not onli the age of the person , but also hi interest , physic capac and purchas power . it is clear that young and older peopl usual do differ kind of activ , but to set a valu and compar the grade of joy of each of them is not seriou . a young person could be enjoy life as much as an older peson doe , do differ thing and know that if they chang role , they will be not enjoy at all . young peopl usual believ that they enjoy life as much as anyon els . they are in their plenti physic condit , they are will to take risk or they usual do not have respons such as a famili to maintain or busi to run . nevertheless , they still have not enough experi and money to spend . for exampl , a young person could have the time to spend one month in itali on vacat , meet a lot of women and have a lot of fun but he would live with a limit budget , perhap work to eat and parti . in the contrari , older peopl is commonli look as person who do not enjoy life at all . but those comment are wrong . older peopl have experienc differ situat , have visit mani place , have marri and usual have save money . henc , older peopl usual know exactli what they like and go for it . for exampl , an older person could travel to itali on vacat , but just for one week to venic , with hi love wife to enjoy good food and wine and do sightse . the point is that we can not say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . a more seriou way of think is to compar the grade of joy that the same person had in hi youth with the one he ha in hi older year . in that way we could have a more accur answer , although i believ that life is enjoy at ani age , alway .
