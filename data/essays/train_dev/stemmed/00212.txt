some peopl say that learn fact without the understand are more import becas these day is inform social . howev , i disagre about it . there are a reason : if we do not understand idea , we can not use them . sometim , we are requir mani inform from modern societi when we want to do someth like write a report an so on . absolutli , we can use it without understand idea and concept but we can not use that those are natual . in thi case , i think that it is same we do n't know it . for exampl , my classmat , haemi kim , is a student in the columbia univers alp . she want to write about a globl warm when she took an essay test . even though she ha known it , she ha not understood thi topic . while she wa write an essay , she could not write anyth . so , she fail the test and then she had to prepar anoth exam . if she figur out thi subject , she could pass the exam . that is a point , if we do n't underst somet , we do n't know it . as a result , when we learn somethig , we have to understand what is the mean becaus when we need to use the inform , we can be more comfort than we do n't understand it .
