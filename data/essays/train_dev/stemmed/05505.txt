the issu is a controverti one . on one hand the issu state that there are young peopl who contribut to their commun . on the other hand , the issu claim that young peopl are not help their commun at all . howev in my final analysi , i would support that young peopl are give enough time to help their commun . the first instanc in support of my view are the non-residenti indian . they are young peopl who work outsid india . inspit of there busi schedul , they come back to the home countri and conduct lot of session . they also help financi institut in india by provid them financi aid . they activ particip in the event and promot done by the govern of india . my second exampl are the young politian those are come up in variou countri . peopl like toni blair of unit kingdon is a fascin exampl of a young person help hi commun and countri . polit ha now becom one of the mean by which young peopl are contribut . anoth exampl would be peopl like michael johnson from basketbal and mark waugh from cricket . these sport person have taken time out for child welfar . they have also setup variou sport academi , to help nourish young talent in their respect field . these peopl alway make it a point to visit their respect academi . final , the musician like yanni have conduct charit show . mani other young musician also conduct charit show to gener reveneu . singer like michael jakson is known for conduct such charit show . thi money is use for the develop for their commun . in conclus , i feel that young peopl of thi era are activ particip for the caus to help their commun grow . the abov exampl are just a few to quot .
