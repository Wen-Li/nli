iam in complet agreement with thi statement . nowaday , young peopl are not devot suffici time to help their commun . there are sever reason whi i believ so and i shall put forth some of them . i shall also tri to cite some reason whi i believ such a behavior is preval today . there are sever exampl that illustr the declin devot to the commun . earlier in india , there use to be a lot of institut that use to help out the poor peopl . a primari exampl is the servic institut run by mother teresa . but such instanc are on a rapid declin these day . in our school , we were requir to complet 20 compulsori hour of commun servic , where we had to teach illiter peopl , young or old . to me , thi present us with an excel opportun of put our knowledg to good use , do someth that would benefit our commun and our countri . but a lot of student use to bunk these class and use some unfair mean to put in the attend . as a result , thi requir of commun servic wa remov after we pass out , which clearli illustr the feel the young peopl have toward their commun . it is true that a number of institut are come up in india that aim to help out the elder member of the societi . thi might be consid to be a posit develop . but when we look close , we notic an alarm fact . whi are these institut need . the reason is that young peopl do not stay around to help and support their parent . the parent , when they get old , need some help , and sinc their own sons/daught are not around to help , they seek refug in such institut . thi demonstr the level of selfish that prevail amongst the youth of our countri . to me , my commun also compris of my famili member , rel and neighbor . peopl have even stop care for their parent these day . lot of student graduat and go abroad and then forget their parent . they do n't come back , do n't enquir about their health and do n't send money that their parent may requir . selfish attitud ha becom preval in the indian societi these day , where you do n't care for anyon els but for yourself . the parent , who have sacrif so much in bring you up , are not given the respect and attent they deserv in old age . littl can one expect the youth to go around help the commun they belong to . if we look close , we might be abl to find the reason whi young peopl are neglect their commun these day . the world ha becom extrem competet and as a result , peopl need to work a lot harder than those of say 50 year back . the competet ha becom veri stiff and as a result , a lot of time ha to be devot for person thing like studi for variou exam , work overtim at work place , etc . so , the increas competet might be one of the major factor whi young peopl do n't devot enough time for their commun these day . increas job opportun abroad might also be a reason for thi kind of behavior . the kind of money that is offer in some job abroad is extrem tempt . young peopl flee from their countri , never to return . they becom intox wth the new way of life and forget all their oblig toward their parent , friend , rel and their other communitit . thu , in my opinion it is true that the young peopl of today are not devot enough time , if ani , in help out their commun .
