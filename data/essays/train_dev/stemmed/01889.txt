i do agre with the statement that young peopl do not spare enough time help commun . today young gener is the `` busi gener '' , the gener which doe not think 24 hour in a day is suffici . but the truth is not that there is a shortag of time but that there is absolut lack of time manag . peopl just dont plan their time which lead to a disorganis schedul and the end result is that they dont get their prioriti right . as a result they tend to focu more on meet `` their '' need and are not bother about give someth back to the commun we come from . the phrase `` commun servic '' is rare heard these day . well , who then is to blame for such a sorri state ? all of us . commun servic start at home . help the elderli at home or plant tree in the neighbourhood also constitut commun servic . the school , the children studi in , the colleg teen go to , the offic peopl work in are all equal respons . it is in these place that the seed of commun servic should first be plant . the consious to help the societi we come from should gradual dawn in . commuiti servic can take mani form . for exampl , the school children could be made to collect old cloth and food item and donat it to an orphang . a compani could take the initi in mantain a park or a coloni clean . student in colleg should start group or join an exist group and teach the underprivileg children in the adjac local . fund could be rais by way of organis cultur programm or entertain show and the money collect be distribut to chariti . and if there is ani time when commun servic matter most , it is in time of sever strife , esp natur disast such a flood , hurrican , earthquak , etc . after all what happen to a person today may happen to us tomorrow . we should , therefor give what we expect to reciev . and a veri import step in thi direct would be to start manag the time at our dispos judici and devot some time
