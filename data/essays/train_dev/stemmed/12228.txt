the day when one could be genericli call and a scientist or an inventor who knew it all are long gone . like leonardo da vinci wa a painter a mechan a biologist among mani other thing . in our modern time there is so much knowledg that one lifetim of constant memor will not suffic to acquir it all . technolog and scienc advanc as peopl contribut to it , and to be abl to contribut to it one must have master what ha been previous done . today academ subject are veri deep and extens . in addit , consid that there are a lot of subject , a superfici broad approach will not lead to signific contribut . although it is mandatori to have a borad understand of thing to be abl to relat one work with other area and find use for it . fail to have awar of other subject can be consid as ignor , but thi kind of attitud and lack of interest ha no place in academ . broader knowledg will get you in to mani plesant converst and you may be abl to orchestr a bunch of specialist from differ field to collabor , howev it is not enough for individu contribut . i person pass a phase where i wa hungri for inform and tri to learn everyth but then i discov that eveybodi in the world know at least one thing better than me . for exampl i wa repair my own automobil and makin my own surfboard when i discov that someon els can do a better job than me and it will cost them less time . it will also cost me less money if i spend it work on what i know . the same appli for academci . now i believ that you should do one thing that you know and do it it right .
