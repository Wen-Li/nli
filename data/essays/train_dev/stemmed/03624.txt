i do n't agre that human be will have a fewer car in use than we have them today . there are two reason that i think so . one of the reason is that more and more our popur are increas in it 's number becaus of the explos of the popul all over the world . thi is to say , our popuraton is 6.0 billion right now , and it will increas up to 6.5 in twenti year or more than less . therefor the car usag paesantag will increas in it 's number . other reason is that our social attitud toward young peopl have chang . compar the past with now , the latter is much more lever to young peopl . as long as 50 year ago , in mani countri , the car are driven by men , not woman but nowaday a lot of women drive a car becaus of the social chang from conserv to lever . the age that peopl are abl to get the driver licenc is differ countri to countri , and in certain countri , young peopl who are 16 year old are abl to get the driver licenc with the social chang , some of our countri might have such a law . with the reason , i do n't agre that , buteven though we have more car in our futur , the fuel will total chang , from oil to electr or someth like that .
