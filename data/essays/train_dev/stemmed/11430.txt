there are differ way to develop an activ or to approach to a problem . some peopl prefer to tri new thing and take risk . on the contrari , a more conserv group of peopl prefer onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . but there may be succes case in both gropu . then , what is the best attitud ? when peopl stick to their own tradit method they are abl to solv basic , element problem , but do not have the psycholog or intelectu resourc to imagin a new possibl , a challeng solut or a new discoveri . they fear fail , and feel more secur do exactli what they have alway done for a long time . these peopl do not innov but maintain tradit and keep everyth in it place and rel under control . on the other hand when we tri new thing and idea we touch differ dimens of the problem . we are not prejud by common opinion and statement and sometim we can see or forese complet differ aspect of the situat . peopl who belong to thi group are eager to take risk and do not fear failur , danger or do special effort in order to reach their goal . in thi case , peopl have to be energet , veri enthusiast about their idea and good team leader . person , i think that in order to suc you should tri someth new each time . it is veri reward when you discov someth that mayb wa so close that nobodi could see . even though you may find that mani peopl turn against you becaus they think your idea are ridicul or stupid , you have to insist and keep on work becaus at last , thing will go well and someth veri good will happen . so , next time you have to solv a problem , i recommend tri someth complet new for a chang .
