i do not realli agre with thi statement say that in twenti year the number of car would have decreas . that doe not mean that i object to the goal of reduc the number of car in the world ; of cours , thi is a necessari evolut and industri and rich countri are current tri to follow thi path . for instanc , in pari , the mayor tri for year to prevent peopl from take their car by make the circul veri difficult and by encourag the creation of new bu line . he also promot bike , have creat new road that can onli be use by them . i consid all these action as posit action : it show that peopl are eventu awar of the urgenc of a chang in our attitud toward pollut . we are respons for the world we are leav to the next gener and we can no longer live as we do now ( use so mani resourc ) . but , what seem to contradict thi movement toward a decreas in car in use , is the situat in develop countri : we can studi the case of china . as a matter of fact , china is get more and more power and is now go through thi period of industri that western countri alreadi experienc a centuri ago . a part of the chines popul is get richer and richer and can now afford car . so when a countri of more than one billion inhabit get access to car market , we can imagin that in the year to come , the number of car is not realli go to dwindl . but what can we say ? can we deni them the right to get a car ? to consum after year of be depriv and see how it wa in western countri ? after all , we did the same befor , as we were not concern about the environment issu . .. in conclus , i would say that it is a realli difficult question to forse whether there will be fewer car in use in twenti year . but it is a tendenc that we have to further , especi in poorer countri , by explain how necessari it is and mayb help them financi to build public infrastructur that could replac the use of car .
