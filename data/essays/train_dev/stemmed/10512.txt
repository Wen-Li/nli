some peopl believ that it is more import for student to learn fact . i though believ that it is more import for student to understand idea and conscept for sever reason . the main reason for my view is simpli that , understand idea and concept concequ learn fact . what i mean by that when student understand idea deepli and coherentili they could possibl find out the fact behind these idea . becaus behind most of the idea , fact . the second reason for my view is that the more student undersatnd concept and idea , the more will be abl to obsorv , studi and analyis fact . understand alwya more effict then lear . becaus when you learn we just take the idea or concept as it written for us . howev , when we understand ani idea veri clearli , we would increas our abil to anlayis and studi the fact that is realat somhow to that idea . the last reason for my view is that wehn the student understand the idea and the concept rether than just lean fact , they perhps would not forget them in the long-term . moreov , they could devolp their knowledg around those idea and concept that they understood befor . in counclus , i total agre with encourg the all the school institu around the global to focu on improv the understand skill in the student . also , tri to help them to find their on way of thinkn amd analysinig the idea and the concept rether than just teach them in gener fact which probabl they are go to forget in the end of the simist .
