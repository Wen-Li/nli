i think first that both the younger and older peopl both enjoy their live but i think that older peopl enjoy thier life more . i am convinc with that for sever reason . one import reason is that in order to enjoy your life you should feel secur and relax . i think older peopl feel more secur becaus they have alreadi featur their live . anoth reason of whi old peopl enjoy their live more is their financi statu as gener the old peopl are richer than younger one which help them go on trip or perform a lot of activ . i think that the older peopl will not have as much commit as the younger peopl have as in young age the person is alway in stress look toward build a successful futur , thi of cours take a lot of hi time as he ha to studi mani cours and prepar himself for enter the profession life . after that the young peopl becom busi with thier new job they tri to progress in their carreer and make money . they after that becom concern with build their own famili by marriag and have babi . they remain alway like thi live in stress tri to accomplish mani task and reach mani goal until they reach to a rel comfort life . at thi time onli the begin think about enjoy their live and spend a good time perform activ . take myself as an exampl i think i am not enjoy my life uptil the moment becaus i am alway struggl to have a good life i wish for myself and my small famili . i have alway to studi addit cours , i spend my money in thi cours but i think thi is mandatori to earn a degre as well as to increas my experi so that i get better job with higher salari . but if i look to my parent i find that they enjoy their live now , they go regularli to trip , they attend live perform and they enjoy practic their hobbi as draw and read . but of cours i think that if i had a lot of money and a good job while i am young thi will be the best option as i can enjoy travel , play soccer match and practic some riski activ as climb mountain and dive . but i believ that man ca n't get all what he want at the same time , so i am build my futur now and i wish i can enjoy my life at a later period .
