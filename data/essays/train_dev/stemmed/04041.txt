i agre with the statement , that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the reason in do so is rather obviou . by take an exampl my point of view might be understand . for instanc let us look at an mp3 player . there are mani mp3 player on the market . whi should i take a product from compani a if i can have one from compani b. so the market ha to face thi problem by creat someth that may convinc the custom to buy the product . that is whi advertis may want to convinc the custom that there is a certain incent that onli thi product ha . mayb an mp3 player ha the function of a calendar , that no other mp3 player seem to have . so the market and the construct depart may be focuss on the calendar , but neglect the core function : play music . it may happen that i am fascin by the calendar and buy the mp3 player , but may be frustrat becaus the rest is not what i imagin . a second argument whi product may seem better than they realli are , can be that a custom can choos from a varieti of thing to spend the hard earn money . should he buy the mp3 player or the dvd player , that mayb not transport , but can also play mp3 . by make the product `` larger than life '' a custom may favor the mp3 player over the dvd player . final in thi world of consumpt everybodi want to have someth special . so the advertis agenc creat a certain sens of individu with there advertis . as i mention befor : there are mani differ mp3 player . whi should a custom choos a certain one ? becaus the advertis doe not onli creat a sens of extra-valu but also of individu . the ipod for exampl cost more than other mp3 player without a certain incent , that nobodi els ha . still it ha enorm sale figur becaus peopl think they get a special product that wa made just for them . to put it in a nutshel : the question that everi market agenc ha to deal with is : whi should a custom buy our product ? they can achiev thi goal by make the product seem much better than they realli are .
