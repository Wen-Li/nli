i strongli agre with the statement that say that young peopl nowaday do not give enought time to help their commun becaus our modern societi is veri corrupt , and one of these neg aspect is certainli social selfish . whit thi word i want to say that in our modern societi everi person tend to think onli at hi own life whitout spend time for the commun or think to the other peopl . thi sens of selfish wa absent from societi onli a few decad ago , but whit the past of the time it is becam a veri common aspect of human behavior . whit the past of the time in fact peopl have becam more isolet and worri about their own life that they have forgotten that around them there is a societi , and that to mantein a gener polit and social balanc everi person ha to solv a particular role in thi societi . wit the past of the time in fact everi person ha tri to overcom the other to becam a self made man satisfi of hi or her leader behavior . the most neg aspect is not that thi idea is veri spread in the societi in wich we live , but the way in which thi teori is spead : everi famili in fact tend to teach to their son that the most import thing in a person 's life is becom someon import and reach . i beliv that thi neg teach have corrupt our societi and there is no possibl to return back ; we live in a world damag and character by valu completli differ from the real valu of the past , in whic friendship and sens of help the commun were the key idea . in conclus i would like to underlin that it is true that in our societi is not present the sens of commun help by the young peopl , but at the same time it is not correct to accus young peopl to be the initi of thi fact becaus it is onli a conseq of a proce start mani decad ago . i serious belief that if we do not begin to rebal the valu of our societi we will live in a veri corrupt world in which the most difficult thing it will be simli to live in !
