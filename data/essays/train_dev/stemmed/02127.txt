the predict about futur should be well calcul and well design befor be made . from my perspect the predict about the number of car in twenti year is just not right and need to be review in order to make a better project of the futur . the first point that thi statement miscalcul is the issu of emerg technolog . as time goe by new technolog come out . thi make peopl buy new car in order to keep up with the technolog . as an opposit to my point the issu of petrolium might be consid . as an answer to that i guess we shold be look at the traffic more care where we see emerg hybrid car which consum electr and ga at the same time . these car keep the environ clean and attract the environ concern peopl to buy car . these hybrid car are be manifactur onli one or two compani but other are tri to catch up with better idea in order to keep the number of sale up . second point that i want to mention is that number of car sale . if we examin them we can obvious see that they are increas everi singl day . a proper statist would show us that it will be that way in the follow year . especi when we look back twenti year back from our time there is a consider amount of increas in the number of car in use and it look like it is go to be the same way at least in thirti more year . in the third point i want to be more psycholog about the issu by say that peopl of the 21st centuri like to be mobil more than the peopl of the past becaus of the fewer border between countri . as the world get more global peopl tend to move more in order to see diffrent place and understand diffrent idea . one of the mean of get to new place is by car . the opposit of thi idea is the use of public transport on the other hand peopl like to be more privat so they will be prefer car . anoth psycholog drive is the joy of drive car , i do not think drive a car is a fag which pass away after some time as a conclus the number of car in use will be increas until at least thirti or forti year . new altern are be work on but we should consid the implement of car to our live and compar it to the new technolog . that way we can understand the inappropri part of the subject .
