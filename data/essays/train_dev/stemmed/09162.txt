when you buy a product yo do it for mani reason , mayb becaus it is neccesari for you , mayb becaus you like it or mayb becaus someon or someth say to you that such product is excel but , is it realli true ? well , i think that thi can happen with advertis . it is fantast how persuas advertis can be . they show the best of the product but obviusli , they do n't describ , if there are , the bad part of them . but like all in thi world it will depend on each situat . on one hand for exampl , there are realli good product that can fill all your expect and they are just what you are look for . so , with product like these , i wait that advertis tell me all the propierti of the product and that they give me the true reason to buy it . but on the other hand , you can feel veri dissapoint if you aqcuir a product that is not the same as you believ . and thi could be worst when you do that becaus in the advertis the product realli seem much better . nevertheless , you can reclaim to chang the product but thi could not alway be possibl . in my case for exampl , i had bought hundr of think in order to put on slime , but i realic now that the onli think that work is less food and more exercis . if i have to sum up i will give you an advic : do n't believ so much on advertis . not alway they reflect the true about a product . you have to be sure yourself befor aqcuir somethik .
