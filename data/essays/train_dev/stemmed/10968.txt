i complet agre with the statamenet that say that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . most of the advertis describ their product as they are the best in the market , without ani consider to ani side or bad effect in it use for ani human or ani specif group such as children or eldest . at the same hand , most of the advertis consid the financi margin as the most proiriti rather than other import factor that might affect the whole human health , such as ingrid use for specif product that might caus cancer , allirgey , and diabet . in my own expereinc , i use to have redbul ( an energi drink ) as my daili drink to empow and keep my self awak for as long as possibl due to my long work hour shift . two year later i read an articl by chanc follow with an internet research show that all thi type of drink are a slower killer more than an energet drink ! it ha a ( stroptroin ) more than ani thing els , and the research show that more than one cup a day might caus to a heart attack and to a few case of addict to it . but what make thi red bull is the most famou energi drink , is the advertis and campaign all over the world show it one side effect ( enegri ) hide all other neg side effect that might caus our live especi our youth ! it is not a problem to have these product in hour hand , but the disast is that we need the proper awar that tell us what exactli it is about . we need to read and keep educ ourselv with these kind of product , and to tri as much as posibl to select what is more suitabl to our use and health .
