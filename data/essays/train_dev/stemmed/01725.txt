i do not think it a good idea to take a group trip led by a tour guid . i have to admit that there are some advantag of thi stye of travel . there are no troublesom decis make , no worri about nasti troubl , and most importantli , it is cheap . actual , i use to make use of thi when i wa an univers student . but now i realiz that a group trip is simpli bore and is not worth pay even littl money . i will give two reason for my opinion . firstli , you can not fulli enjoy your travel , unless you explor the town by your self . the good part of take a trip lie in the point that you might come across strang and new thing and peopl in a new environ . you can find out an unknow part of yourself and some new perspect on life itself . if you take a group trip , howev , you can not appreci thi point , sinc you are alway bound up by the tight schedul . secondli , you could easili end up buy load of unattract good at the extraordinari high price , if you join a group tour . as is well know , the reason whi a group tour is cheap is that it ha a strong connect with local shop . when i went to chine in a group tour , i wa so annoy by shop assist desper sell expens good with their fluent japanes . it definit ruin the great part of my pleasur in the trip . for these reason , i hate take a group trip led by a busi and materialist tour guid . even if i had the chanc to visit a primit island where there are nobodi who can help me , i would not chose a guid tour .
