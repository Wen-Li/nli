undertand idea in my view , it is import for student to undertand idea and concept than it for them to learn fact . also i think it is much easyier than learn fact and more accept . for exampl , if he ha a biolog class and the teacher is tri to explain the lesson , the student will understand hardli if the tf the teacher is explain as a fact , but if the teacher explain it as an idea or a concept it will be easi like a peic of cake . second , you have noth to do with fact becaus in thi centuri no one want to lesson fact most of them prefar to know the someth as an idea . i think also they will memoris it and rememb it quickli more than fact . anoth exampl , if you want to go to a campu and some of your friend ake you a question about a lesson , attitud , anyth els you will not be abl to answer him a good answer unless if you know it as an idea or a concept . i think also that the doctor studi that understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact and the doctor approv that by make experi on the poapl so he made group who undertand fact and anoth on final , i would like to advic all of poepl to undertand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus it is easyier and more comfort to all of us .
