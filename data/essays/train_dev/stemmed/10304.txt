i absolutli agre with the statement , that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact for sever reason : first , our everyday action are not base on fact we learn by heart but on idea we understood . an easi exampl is the action cross the street , i look to the right and to the left to ensur that there is no car on the street , becaus i understand that it is danger to walk through a street with drive car on it sinc they would drive over me . if i onli had learn it by heart i would have cross a street with drive car on it and so i would n't be here do the toefl . second , you can onli solv a problem if you understand the problem . you will never come to a appropri solut of a problem just learn some fact . an exampl herefor is a mathemat task : although you might have learn all relev fact for a test you will face problem when the task deriv from the standard task you have practic in your math lesson . third , the recenc factor of idea you understood onc is much higher than thi of learn fact . i still know how to calcul the volum of a cube but i do n't know all capit citi anymor . the reason for thi phenomen is easi : i learn calcul the volum through logical think and not through simpli learn fact . all togeth for me it is proven that idea you understood one will help you your whole live in differ situat , let it be in lessur time or in busi , but fact you learn by heart , will be forgotten as soon as the test ha been written .
