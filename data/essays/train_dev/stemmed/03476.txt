i think that the main idea of thi statement is success peopl tri a new adventur also get some risk , and they alreadi know how to do well . i think thi idea is import , becaus if peopl tri to success , they should tri a new thing such as a new job or a new opportun what they never tri it . that could be veri hard at first time , but when the time goe , we could find out our success through the new opportun . commonli , peopl want to do work which is veri easi or veri common thing , they do n't want to look like speicial and they afraid about the risk after they do that work . howev , thi is the differ than common peopl , and success peopl in our life . almost all of succes peopl creat someth new . i think that onli a few peopl achiev success from old idea . success peopl think differ way from other peopl about what kind of new thing will make them success . also , they make an effort with their work . here is the exampl of thoma edison 's success stori . thoma edison wa not realli smart boy when he wa young . howev , he had realli creativ think with everyth and tri to do experi if it is possibl or not . as he said , 99 % wa hi failur , onli 1 % wa hi success . he did not afraid with the risk , keep concentr a new experi . i think that hi creativ think and make an effort wa the success point for him . everi peopl want to success in their life , they want to earn money a lot , and get a author in their own life . but , if they want to success in their life , they should think differ way from other peopl , find someth speical which is not realli common thing and should be awar of some risk that they will have , but if they success with a new adventur , they can be a hero , success person in thi world .
