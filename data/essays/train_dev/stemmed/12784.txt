i agre to the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . eventhough it is also import to learn fact , it is more valueabl to get the idea or concept of everyth for sever reason . first of all , it is easi to know fact everytim after you get older . in contrast , it is harder to understand the concept of some fundament thing . idea and concept should be obtain in your young age to contract the right way of think . for exampl there is quit a lot of low that constrain peopl 's behavior such as that peopl can not kill the other peopl . it is quit easi to know the fact , but the most import thing a person should know is whi there are such low and understand correctli the concept of them . secondli , the import thing for peopl is to appli the idea to the other situat . even if you learn fact , it is worhless unless you understand the concept behind the fact . for an instanc , you learn a new formula in math class . the formula is a `` fact '' in thi case . you can solv a simpl question use it , howev , it is hard to solv difficult or complic question for you if you do n't understand the basic idea of the formula . in the real world , peopl will meet sever difficult problem . to solv them , peopl need to appli what they learn into the complet differ situat . the fact will not help them at that time . therefor i recommend student to understand the idea or the concept than to acknowledg onli the fact .
