the product i disappoint at the most wa my kichen knife . i bought it through the tv shop channel when someon show that the knife could cut the cut boad . off cous , i found it wa not ture after i got it . therefor , i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i think there are two reason : the produc tri to explain their product seem attract , and the world the produc explain are vertual . the first reason whi i think the product seem nicer than real one is that thi is the puroduc 's purpou . as they want to sell their product as much as they can , they tri to make show perfect think about the biggest effort by advertis . for exampl , they hire the advertis compani which ha artist , copi planner , and strategi proffesiona . as aresult , they make perfect advertis which atrract the consum . the second reason for my opinion is that the advertis show virtual world . to make the custom think the product is so nice the produc explain the beauti world which is the peopl want . unless the produc show real worl , nobodi wouldl not be motiv to buy anyth . to take an exampl , in the tv commerci of a aprticular cleaner , the famou actress act smart and pretti wife use the product . becaus the watcher may think they want to be a beauti wife like her , or they think they are same to her , or the man think they want to marri with her , they tend to use the cleaner . we know thi is not real world , but we want to be by use the product . in conclus , i think most advertis must seem better than they realli are . although it make freaquantli confus me , we can think thi is an advertis when we buy some product .
