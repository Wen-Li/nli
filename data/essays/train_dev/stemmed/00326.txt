while some peopl may think that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , i think special in one specif subject is better , becaus when you special in one specif subject , you could have more opportun to be a real expert on that subject . first of all , i 'm one of the believ of the famou quot : `` time is money . '' it could be advis to use time effici dure our life becaus time is valuabl . as far as i 'm concern , we should use time special in one specif subject . in that way , we can have great knowledg about that subject , and that mean we could have the chanc to be an expert about that subject . i do n't blame the peopl who ha mani variabl interest , but it is import to see the differ between have mani interest and special in one specif subject . for exampl , one of my friend ha a great interest in music and i see him everi year tri to learn how to play a differ instrument . in my opinion , it is clear that there is a bare chanc for him to becom a good , profession musician . secondli , have broad knowledg of mani academ subject keep me away from the feel of satisfact . in other word , thi kind of knowledg is not substanti for me . when we consid success peopl in the world , we can obvious see that a big percentag of them chose the way to special in one specif subject . as a result , they becom peopl who they are today . final , take all the factor into consider , we may safe reach the conclus that the advantag of special in one specif subject outweigh those of have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus when we special in one specif subject , we have the opportun to be an expert on that subject and we can be satisfi and success .
