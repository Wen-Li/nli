the issu of advertis is topic . i mean that current you are alwai in relat with some kind of advertis like in tv or in newspap or on the internet and it is dificult not to take it in count and after not to compar the qualiti of the product with what you though it will be . from mi point of view , i agre with that statement for sever reason . first , one of mi reason is one of mi experi . one day i bought a chimic liquid in order to clean mi kitchen and i wa realli desapoint of the result moreov the price wa expens for the result i had in comparison with what they show on tv . second , if i wa a bussi man i think mi goal woud be to get the more profit that i can . thu , i will buy poor materi and then manufactur it , sell it , and use advertis to show whi mi product is better than an other one . so i will just emphas all the qualiti . from mi opinion , it is a common way to make busi , and advertis is busi . third , i am convinc that some advertis lie about their product just for it exist some associ to defend custom right against . if you do not appreci the servic or the product you bought you can go in their type of associ and charg in court the compani of the product . i remenb a person that charg in court a compani for lie on the product and he won . to summar my opinion not everi advertis make product seem better but a lot had done and do now .
