some peopl think that it more import for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . i think that someth true . i think know the main idea about someth is veri import . it is useless know the fact without know the idea or the concept . have the knowledg of someth is differ . understand the main point of thing and get the concept of them will get you to a point where they will be usabl when you need them . have the idea of someth make that inform useful and give it a valu . becaus it mean that someth which ha been learn , but not just taken in memori becaus of your teacher say you have to . get the concept of someth will be better becaus if the teacher ask you someth about it and if you have onli improv the result or the fact of it , it is quiat imposs for you to answer the question . for exampl if you know the fact that the light will be on when you push the button , that ok . but if the teacher ask you whi , it 's useless know the fact . if you would have improv the main idea of light than it wont be a problem for you . never the less , have the knowledg of someth will show you the fact eather way . it is veri import for you to understand the concept or the idea of someth . if you understand it , that mean you can also understand the fact and the solut of it . for exampl , if you know how the light work that mean the you can also permit the fact . if you take a shower with a hair drier which is alreadi on , it like for you to burn . it all about know the main idea and get the concept of it . in conclus , understand idea and concep is far better than learn fact becaus know the main idea is veri import and have the idea of someth will show you the fact anyway . at school , the teacher should tri to make clear the idea but not onli the fact to student .
