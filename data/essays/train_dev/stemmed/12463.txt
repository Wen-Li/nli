i disagre with the statement . i believ that youngster nowaday spend enough time ( and more ) to help their commun . let us defin what a commun is . for most peopl , a commun is a group where the member interact , are interdepend , and where they live in harmoni . the young peopl of the world realis that they are part and parcel of thi commun and that the develop of themselv is depend on the develop of the commun and vice versa . the younger gener is more awar of commun welfar , help peopl in need , the environ , and it develop . one area which the youngster have identifi is chariti work . not onli do they visit chariti organis and donat to them , they also organis free medic camp for poor children , correct surgeri for peopl who cant afford it , and in gener spread the word . campaign where peopl can donat or pledg their futur contribut are organis by these youngster . they are concious alloc time for commun welfar activit . proactiv think about how much more improv is possibl is the trend . also , peopl nowaday , especi youngster , are more awar of the danger to the environ from deforest , the ozon layer deplet , etc . these concept have been imbib in them from a veri small age , becaus of which they are veri awar of the situat . henc , they make sure they dont caus more damag than they can help . some of them have pledg to not use plastic after they have understood the harm natur of it . anoth aspect of ` commun ' could be the work environ . have a pleasant work environ is everi employe 's dream . thi can be aciev onli by the cooper of all the peopl involv . realis thi , the youngster make sure they have a nice place to work . it is veri easi to mould young mind and they will be more than will to help the commun and in turn help themselv . thi way , they realis , they are give back to the commun that they got from .
