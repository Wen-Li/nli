the question of whether young peopl spend enough time to help their commun is a difficult one and need to be discuss . to answer thi question , i want to compar some argument which do not support the statement to some argument which do support it . after thi , i will reach the decis that i agre with the statement . peopl , especi younger one , have to handl grow time restrict in differ place and situat . young peopl need time to play when they are childreen , they have specif problem while becom adult and there is more and more pressur on younger peopl to finish their educ as earli as possibl . as one might argu , thi lead to the fact that younger peopl do spend enough time on help their commun . or it lead to the opinion that young peopl wast time while do a year of commun servic like it is made in germani . but thi view onli focus on econom point and doe not take into account that the commun we live in doe not onli consist of work and money , but of help , friendship , respect , and other valu we do not want to miss . as our relationship get more and more economis it is veri import to rememb that not everybodi is `` good '' enough to get money and that some peopl need help . becaus everybodi could face problem which one can not solv alon , younger peopl should be teach how import it is to help other and , therebi , help the commun they live in . elderli peopl , for exampl , often need help in mani differ way . sinc some elderli peopl can not afford to pay for somebodi help them , younger peopl should do commun servic to get a feel for the kind of problem elderli peopl face . younger peopl will sooner or later face the same problem as they grow older and at one point need help for their own . thi is call the `` gener contract '' in germani : younger peopl help elderli . to summaris , i agre with the statement becaus everzbodi could need help .
