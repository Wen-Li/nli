i agre and disagre with the statement `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . '' i think whether or not thi statement is true depend on age group and on cultur and societi . in japan where student compet with each other for enter good high school and colleg , they need to spend so much time on studi for high school and colleg entranc exam and they do not have time to enjoy thier life . howev onc they anter colleg they can spend their time on whatev they like to do . they earn money by work part time and spend the money to travel around the world or to do some sport or to have parti . after student graduat from their collesg and start work , they again lose time to enjoy their life . corpor worker in japan are expect to work veri hard and for mani hour a day by their compani . marrig and have children reduc their free time further and add financi burden on them . mani corpor worker long for their retir time to come and they tri to save littl money they have in order to enjoy life after the retir . in japan , snior citizen who are over 60 and retir from their work are concid to be richest group of peopl . they have money from save they did dure all those year of work for their compani and also from pension fund . they have a lot of free time . henc , they have enough time and money to enjoy their life at last . the situat in japan i describ may be differ in other countri . in poor countri , young peopl can not afford to go to colleg and ther are expect to work at their earli age . the govern or poor countri can not provid pension to their senior citizen , so old peopl there can not enjoy their life as old peopl in rich countiri like japan can afford to . to enjoy our life , we need some free time and money . but it is veri difficult to have enough money and enough free time at the same time in toda
