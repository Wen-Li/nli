i agre with the statement that it 's better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . when we look around us , we can easili see that peopl we defin as `` success '' are gener the one who have and eclect knowledg on subject . as a high school senior who is in the process of aplli to colleg , i 've realiz the import of be a well-round person even . colleg do n't just want kid who have great sat verbal score ; you have to get a high score on the math section of the test as well . if you want to guarante your spot in the admiss , you better be readi to take a shot on the sat subject test . the peopl who earn the most money , accord to some survey , are bio-med enginn . have you ever thought whi ? they not special on medic subject but also are expert on engin . or even doctor . it 's not enough for them to special on biolog , or anatomi ; they have to learn a wide rang of subject of they want to becom success in their profess . also if you have a wider knowledg on thing , you can have more option to choos from in your life . the human brain never fail to amaz me . i 've experienc that as you put more knowledg into your brain , it just start want to absorb more and more knowledg . it never get enough . even if one believ that special in one specif subject is better , they should start by tri to gain a broad knowled on thing , becaus it will make it easier for their brain to understand . everyth happen in thi world is relat to anoth somehow . it is hard to special in physic , for exampl , if you do n't have much of a knowledg in mathemat ; which make me start to think that it is `` necessari '' to have a broad knowledg of mani subject `` even if '' you want to special in one subject .
