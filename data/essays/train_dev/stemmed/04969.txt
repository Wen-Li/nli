i dont agre with `` jack of all trait and master of none '' i person feel it better to expertis in a singl feild rather than tri to have a broad knowledg in mani academ subject sinc , it will lead us no where . firstli , it would be a difficult task for the student to throw light on everi subject they learn as a part of their academ curriculum . instead of thi , student can concentart on a singl subject and tri to learn more of it . thi will help the student to learn a subject with more interest and also give a chanc for the student to choos the subject they wish to expertis . but in the case if the student tri to have a broad knowledg of all subject one day he will be confus about himself . therefor , it more advis to master in a particular area of the student interest . to have a clear illustr of thi let us consid a real time exampl . if we consid two student , among which one ha a broad knowledg in all the academ and the other is a specialist in hardwar engin . if these two appli for a particular job say , for the post of a hardwar engin than the former student will have a few chanc for accquir the job sinc he ha no profound knowledg in that particular area but , he just ha an overview of it . and therefor the other student will be consid for the job . not onli in the case of employ but also in real life , the one who ha deep knowledg of hi specif subject could surviv ani where in thi competit market . and by expertis more in a singl feild he will get a veri good insight about hi subject and he will be capabl of fetch good reward and fame in hi area of studi . therefor it is alway advis to master in a particular feild .
