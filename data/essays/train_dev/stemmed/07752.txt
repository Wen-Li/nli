i must say i agre with the statement . there are some advantag i could point out for tri new thing and take risk , which are : - peopl who tri new thing differenti themselv from the rest and get recognit for that from their peer and eventu from opinion leader or other peopl that might help them with their purpos . - take risk is the same than do thing not on the easi way . becaus of that , it should becom both a reward and educ experi . it may help overcom fear , it can help to learn more about ourselv and our limit and it should leav the door open for not be afraid of tri new thing in the futur . - it make you discov your strenght and weak and how far you can push yourself into differ situat , as oppos to keep do the activ that you know you perform well which will not let you discov hidden talent that you may have . everytim i watch the news or read the newspap and see a busi success stori , i tend to think that that 's someth i could have done . then i realiz that it all ha to do with the gut peopl have to start do someth befor the rest . take risk is a key to success . altough i have summar some possit appreci of take risk there are consider that should be taken into account befor tri new thing : do someth new or differ may caus a neg effect or even reject from the rest of the peopl . therefor , if you are think of do someth nobodi els ha ever done befor , you need to think first of how societi will react to that new thing and if it can affect or hurt anybodi in anyway . take risk may drive someon into frustrat if what he/sh had in mind wa not success . not all your goal will be achiev by take risk , there need to be more than goodwil put into a project such as studi , research , commit and effort . i think the combin of hard work , commit and take risk lead to succesful peopl . know yourself , your strenght and what you alreadi know you can do well help , but you need to give a step further to succeed .
