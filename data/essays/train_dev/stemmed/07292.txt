ye i do agre with the statement first reason is that the idea are sourc for new invent . if we face a problem , then we will make our mind activ and start to find out varieti of solut for the problem by do thi we will get lot of idea and they will be more use for us for the solut . the concept give us the clear vision of the problem that is the way in which it should be solv and even we can add new concept for it with our new idea . the idea not onli give us the solut but also a perfect mean to the problem . everi problem ha a concept which is natur made by us but when new concept are ad to the problem , then the problem can be made more easi to solv . for exampl if we want to solv a mathemat problem which consist of twenti step to get a perfect answer . then we will start solv it by differ method that we get by our own idea , here the fact will have onli one solut to the problem but when we use differ kind of concept and make differ idea we can get the solutiohn within ten step . the student have the abil to think more fast and accur as their vision will be alway concentr on develop new idea and concept rather than the fact . mainli the young student will get more idea and varieti of concept . as the fact will be alway the same and there will be no chang or alter can be made in them . the idea will eventu increas the strenght and person of a student . for exampl the scientist 's will have lot of idea and concept but not fact becaus they will invent the thing by their imagin . these imagin are retrev from new idea but not from the fact . the most import thing for a scientist is the concept in which he invent the thing . if he goe with the fact then he can not invent new thing as the fact will give same old invent . henc the student ha to give more and more import to there new idea and concept . final fact are alway fact but the idea and concept will give more enthusiasm to work on and find new concept . henc i strongli recommend to give more import to idea and concept rather than the fact .
