it ha been said that , ` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ' . it could be true sinc the fuel that we use now to run car are run out , but howev i disagre with the statement and i will present briefli whi i disagre that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first reason is that popul is grow rapidli , and peopl are live longer nowaday . more peopl mean more car , peopl want convini in their life more than anyth els , peopl growth are grow sinc we have revolution industri and medic care , medic care we have increas our estim live . as i mention more peopl are be born and live longer they 're go to be will to use more car . second reason , and the problem i 've mention about fuel , the fuel we now use is ` gasolin ' and i know that it 's limit and some scientist said that it 'll run out quicker than we think , but that is just like say that we wo n't be find the replac , we 've revolution in mani way and we 've been make new technolog to make our live better , just coupl hundr year ago gasolin wa a junk but now it 's a most import thing in our live , just like we 've found gasolin we 're go to find someth els just as import and capabl as gasolin did . in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today and it could be true sinc the fuel that we use now to run car are run out , but i total disagre with thi statement becaus our human be have developt more and more and we 're go to develop our live even faster sinc popluat is grow , and soon we 'll find a perfect replac for the fuel we use to run car .
