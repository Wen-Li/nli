by virtu of thi text , i would like to express my opinion regard the given subject . as a student in research , i consid thi question mind-boggl to say the least . for year now , peopl have been debat on the subject in an attempt to decid whether student should learn fundament or pragmat knowledg . moreov , institut are also ponder the issu ; wonder what is the true essenc of learn and mandat of scholar institut . consid my experi as a student for almost 16 year now , i truli believ that the learn of concept and fact are tantamount in import . as for mani thing in life , homeostasi between element is alway the essenti resolut in case of doubt . somehow , both are crucial to the attain of a solid educ and mental represent of knowledg . on one hand , learn fact serv as an empirc visualis of our realm ; on the other , concept and idea help us to conceptu the invis such as the atom or the creation of distant galaxi . it is my profound impress that one can not appreci the rich of realiti and a deep phenomenolog experi without both perspect . to illustrast my point , i could use the analog of a student wish to comprehend psycholog . it is in my opinion pretti simpl to know as a fact that self-esteem is an import key indregi in child develop . but in itself , self-esteem doesn < t exist as tangibl matter , onli it mere conceptualis guid us in know one particular phenomenon . therefor , when we look at it we can observ a fantast process happen befor our eye . our conceptualis help us identifi new phenomenon which in return , help us to establish new fact . thu , when we consid educ as a way for student to be compet and autonom we inescap have to promot the acquisit of both through the learn of fact and concept .
