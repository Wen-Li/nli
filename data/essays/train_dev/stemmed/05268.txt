we are live where ha the plenti of advertis . we see ani kind of ad everyday , even if we would n't want to . and most of them make themselv look better . it heppen all the time . i sometim believ the advertis and i bought sever item . whenev i trust them , they brought me down . i saw advertis heater which wa advertis on tv . i thought that look so good . and i bought it . but that wa not my expect . that wa not smae color . ture , the shape wa not same at all . the advertis told me that wa not break at all but i use third time it wa borken . i wa realli angri at that time . other product wre mostli alik . after that i saw an ad of hair dryer . the ad , it made my hair be like to silk and wa not hurt my hair at all . but that did n't make a senc . how did the hair dryer make your hair be silk ? i could n't believ the ad at all . i thought that peopl who made the ad did n't have ani consciou . when i went shop , i show a sign on the window . it said the sale ` buy one get one free for all item . ' and i chose two of hand rotion . when i tri to check out , the saler said . the product i chose did n't includ the slae product . i wa bunch of advertis attract peopl to buy them . but most of them that is not a true . so , peopl should check between ad and real product and make sure it is ok . and we must not buy a product which ha a differ between ad and product .
