can we state that success is directli connect to innov , that the more you are take risk , the better your chanc of success will be ? thi may seem a pretti obviou statement at first . i am go to invent a new product and i will becom rich ! but thi statement may be more complic than it appear . let start with the `` obviou '' part . of cours , by introduc a new product on a market , i increas my chanc to attract custom and develop a success busi . our world is constantli evolv and new product , new technolog for exampl , are veri much on demand . i can also , by tri differ idea or method , improv the way i am do my busi and becom more effici . new idea can improv the qualiti of my product , their cost effici , their imag . compani all around the world know that veri well and urg their employe to think `` outsid the box '' . univers will also motiv their student to becom more creativ and find new way of think . it seem that everyon agre that creativ and innov are veri import to becom success . but i ca n't help rememb that van gogh never sold one paint dure hi entir life . he wa one of the most creativ and innov painter of hi time . he dedic hi life to hi art and paint the way he want even if he wa heavili critic . whi wa n't he success ? i ca n't also help notic that everi time i go to the cinema to see one of the `` big success of the year '' , i am disappoint . it seem that to be success , a film ha to follow a set of standard rule : a charismat hero , a sexi counterpart , lot of action and simplist dialog . obvious , creativ doe n't pay in the movi busi and you have to stick to what you do well , henc rocki v and all the sequel of success film that are shot everi year . i certainli do think that creativ is a major asset and i encourag everybodi around me to take risk in their life but i am not convinc that it lead to success . at least , not to success as we understand it , that is commerci success . but , it certainli lead to person improv , to a sens of satisfact and achiev that the repetit of an activ can , at one point , no longer bring .
