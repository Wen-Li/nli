life is not a one subject thing . as i learn dure my high school , we need to have a broad knowledg , to see thing as a whole . in life everyth is a consequ , interrealt between differ area of knowledg . you shouldnt limit yourself to one area . i studi in an interdisciplinari program , which ha as main object to see knowledg as a whole by make conect between differ subject have as main axe histori . i found it so much more interest thi way . you can understand whi thing happen , per exampl the relat between music , art and war in the second half of the xx centuri . if you see each of thi area alon , you will have an incomplet version , becaus you are take the situat out of their context . also if you focal your stuid in onli one area . you are limit your vision of the world . becaus there is no point in know everyth about one topic . you will be miss so mani thing . in my case , i like more than one subject . i dont want to choos onli one . whi are we forc to special in one subject , if at the end we will need more than one . that whi i decid to follow a univers carreer in which i can choos ani class that i like , regardless the area . anoth exampl of whi we should know about sever knowledg branch , is when we interact with peopl , per exampl in a dinner . a person who onli know about one topic will be bore . but if everyon know a littl about differ area , they can have an interest convers in which everyon can interact and discuss . touch differ topic avoid monotomi . i believ you need all type of knowledg per exampl math , that is one of the subject that is usual dislik . if you go to the supermarket you need to know to make sum , to at least be abl to make the number . you will face huge difficulti in life if you dont know at least someth from everi subject . i believ everyon should be abl to have a convers in more than one topic . i believ that onli the differ will help you broad your mind . and make connect help to understand life better so you will never get bore .
