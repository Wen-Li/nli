idea and fact are two side of the same coin . while idea bring about new experiment , new technolog , new behaviourr , new way to do thing ; thier success bring about fact . i person beleiv it is import for student to understand idea and concept as well as learn fact . fact usual give the basi of an idea . they know that thi is what the charatersitc are ; they can formul an idea with the exist fact . focus on onli one facotr , i.e an idea or fact would mean invitng more error or have thing done the monotn way . for exampl : new techonolog have been invent in the recent past becuas of new idea be gener ; howev , the exist fact about the present technolog ha help them develop news one . knowledg of fact help student realis the limit and the strength of a certain subject . concept on the other hand are the basi of understand ani subject . if a student ha not understood hi concept well , he would be unabl to understand the fatc and not bult up on idea . concept is the backbon of both idera and fact . for exampl if a student ubderstand newton law of graviti , he would understand that everi thing around is attract by earth . onc he understand the concept , he can understand the fact about graviti and then built on new diea to built a parchut or an aircraft . idea , concept6 and fact belong to a visciou circl where one thing is realt to the other and can not surviv without the other . now , if student are expos onli to concept and told to built on idea then they might be build the same thing which is alreadi exisit , or they might repeat the same mistak made by thier forefath . similarli , if student are onli base thier knowledg on fact they might not be in a posit to invent new thing and stick to the same old way of life . henc look at all these matter , i conclud that idea , fact and concept are equal impor to student .
