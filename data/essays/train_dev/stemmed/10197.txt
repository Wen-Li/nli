succes peopl can be difer depend of the enviro or the cultur aplianc . the way that peopl do thing or use the knowledg to do it can be a common factor in succes pepl . in my opinion success peopl start to suc in the enviro that they know well . for exampl , a comput expert will start hi achiv work on hi field , comput . but that do n't , mean that he will be success just in hi mayor . one person can suc in mani aspect , like hi or she person live , spiritu live , etc . do n't exist one rule that say to suc you need do just the thing that you know how to do , but also do n't exist a rule that say you need tray other field . in my person opinion the kay to suc is just be free of take the risk of live . normali start with some field that you can work with but think that mayb some day other horizont will be open in other way a unknown way . for exampl , a repres sale in one shoe store acchiv hi goal as a sle man increas the number in fifti percent . but the owner that poss one car dealer shop offert to him other job , with better condit and benefit . the guy start as a shoe sale man but hi way to sale shoe gave the idea to the owner of the shop to put him in a new job mannag of one car dealer shop . clearli shoe are no the same of car . on the other hand , sale is not the same that mannag , but the qualiti is the imperor factor . in that way the qualiti found for the owner of the shoe store and the car dealer shop is not relat to shoe or car is relat to the person , the actitud , and the capac of use hi pre - knowledg to learn someth new . the key of suc is just a combin of desir and knowledg . use as a spark the knowledg tha we poss and be readi to ani chang with the capac to adappt own and learn new challeng i sthe key to suc . is like success peopl get the achiv of their goal .
