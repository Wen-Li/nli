in order to compar the live of young peopl and older one , it seem necessay to start off with a brief descript of that averag young and the averag older person . young peopl enjoy themselv in activ such as meet friend , go out , do sport or listen to music . on one hand , these activ are fun and help a young person to relax after an exhaust day at school or work . but on the other hand all these activ can not be enjoy without a certain amount of money . becaus of that , young peopl can easili get into a rush of work real hard , mayb even have a job while studi at a high school or univers , and spend the money in the even and on their weekend . they keep switch directli from the statu of make money into spend it and forget to just settl down for a moment and simpli sit down and read a book or someth like that . sometim young peopl even start work almost nonstop so that they can just stop most of their work and have fun later in life , which is the worst of all case . older peopl are usual the opposit . most of the retir peopl enjoy a slow day without get in rush or be stress . they have no fear of stick to everyday habit , which provid a basi for a settl and enjoy life . they do n't feel like they miss out on thing when they go to bed earli everi onc in a while which is a problem a lot of young peopl share . if peopl tri to compar these two differ type of enjoy life , a basic problem show up immedi . if someon put a older person into a young person posit , he or she would think it unbeliev stress . on the other hand , the young person would probabl call the older person life enitr bore . the onli differ is that most of the young peopl enjoy their live at a way higher risk of becom stress and get in a rush with thing . so after all , a young person doe n't enjoy life more than an older person doe , both enjoy life just in total differ way . still one should not forget the fact that we are discuss stereotyp here ; there might still be a lot of peopl at all age that do n't enjoy their live .
