some peopl think that nowaday young peopl do not help their commun as much as they should . i think thi statement may be true for some peopl , but not for mani other young peopl who actual make a great effort to help the commun where they live in . it is true that modern societi is becom more and more individualist , and thi mean that more and more peopl onli care about themselv , disregard the live and potenti problem of other peopl live in their commun . thi phenomenon is special affect young peopl , as they are grow in a societi in which the most import valu are realt with the person achiev . the post a person occupi , the salari he or she reciev , the commod of hi or her hous , the car , the cloth , and other materi thing that a person may own are nowaday far more import than the ethic of a person and hi or her behaviour toward other human be and the place he or she inhabit . howev , it is not fair to afirm that all young peopl act in that way . there are mani young peopl that realli help their commun in mani differ way . some of them appli for take part as volunt in program design to help peopl with differ kind of problem that rang from disabl peopl , inmigr , children who suffer from cancer , old peopl who live alon , and so on . some of them even travel to remot area in asia , africa and south america to enrol in intern aid organ that deal with veri seriou problem affect million of peopl in those contin , such as natur disast , war and epidemi among other . sum up , becaus ot today 's societi , there are some young peopl who are forget to take care about the other and their commun , but there are mani other young peopl who dedic an import part of their live to help peopl that are in a difficult situat . in my opinion , everybodi should follow their exampl .
