both young and older peopl can enjoy life but i think younger one will enjoy it more . young peopl have fresh energi to use and they can do whatev they want . they can do some activ for adrenalin . for exampl bunge jump , to jump to sea from high rock , danc until morn etc . older peopl can do these easyli . their energi will not be enough for these . also they will have a famili to look after . and they need to pay the bill . so they can not use the money how they like to . but younger peopl need money just to have fun . they do not need to pay bill or they do not need to look after a famili . they need money to go travel , drink beer , have fun with girl , go to disco etc . let think an old man age 70 and a young boy age 20 . there will be an import thing that the old man can not do in that age . thi is sex . i think sex is the most enjoy part of our life . onli thi opinion can make me to support that young peopl will enjoy life than older peopl do . older peopl alway think about to work , to eat , to sleep and mayb to travel in their mind . they use most percentag of their mind to do these . and onli a littl part to have fun . young peopl alway think about where to go thi night , which girl i must date with , which film i can watch today or to do a parti at the weekend or not . all in all younger peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . becaus they have high level of energi , or no famili to look after . they can do what they want . they can do when they want .
