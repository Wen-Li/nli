there have alway been vari opinon on the import of learn fact or in contrast the understand of idea while studi . in my opinion the way a student should handl hi stdudi depend first veri much on the relev field of studi . for exampl studi histori requir the knowledg of certain histor data . these are fact tha have to be learn , they can not be deriv frim the understand of a concept . so there is an import for the student to learn them . on the other hand studi econom , the are a lot of model and idea the student have to understand in order to be sucess . those can no be learn . . but can the student of histori gain success in hi studi onli by learn fact ? no he can not . he also ha to understand for exampl the strutur of ancient societi . and can the student of economi be a good econimist just by understand mani of the econim model and idea ? again no . there is also the need to combin thi understand with certain fact or formular that simpli have yo be learn . anoth import fact is also the type of person one student is . some peopl can keep fact they have read in their mind easili , but it hard for them to understand concept behind . other have diffculti in rememb fact , but are like to draw right conclus from concept they have understood onc . so it can not be said that simpli learn fact , or understand idea is the key to sucess studi . the solut should be a sensibl mixtur of the two extrem . depend on what the aim of studi is and also depend on what one 's prefer and talent are .
