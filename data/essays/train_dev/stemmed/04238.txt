in order to understand someth globali , we should learn fact as well as understand idea and concept . howev , sometim understand is better than learn , or in some case it is the contrari . it is import for student to understand idea and concept , becaus thi will help them to memoris the fact and understand other isuu relat to the subject they are studi . for exampl , when a student fulli understand a mathemat theori , he or she will be abl to resolv mani relat mathemat problem easier . for some student , it is much easier to understand idea than to learn fact by heart . other , on the other hand , prefer to memoris fact rather than tri to understand concept . in my opinion , there is no gener rule state what is more import for student . it depend on the class the student are take , wether it is more import to understand concept or to learn fact . in histori class for exampl , learn about event and fact is more import than understand them , it is even imposs to understand some issu in histori . wherea in a comput , physic or a biolog class for exampl , student are ask mainli to understand theori and concept , they should be abl to analys data and give solut and result make use of what they understood . so , there are some class that requier more learn than understand , and other class that requier more understand than learn .
