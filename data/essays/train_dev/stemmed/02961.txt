i think that there is not a gener answer to the statement , becaus it depend on the cours and on fact and concept object of them . sure , it is veri import for student to learn idea and concept , but it doe not mean that everytim they are more import than fact . there are some cours , for exampl histori , in which the fact are the main import part of the program : therefor , if we , accord to the statement , will not give the correct import to the fact , histori will be more bore and less import . for exampl , it is import to know idea spread in the america in the eighteen centuri befor the war of indipend , but i think that it is more import to know fact which caus the war of indipend . howev , in other cours , especi in scienc and math , the idea and concept are consid the most import thing to learn and to teach ; sinc , although it would be interest to know the life and the differ way to discov thing tri by isaac newton , the core inform about him are the idea and the discov . moreov , i think that idea , concept and fact are argument which increas the cultur of a person , and indipend on the school purpos , it is nice to know someth which is suitabl . unfortun , student prefer to studi onli to achiev good grade , without give import on the real mean of the argument , for such reason it could happen that will be more import what will be for avail for thei aim . in conclus , i think that it is import to understand when it is more import a fact and when it is more import an idea or concept , so i disagre with the statement , sinc i think that it is not right to appli such concept to all cours .
