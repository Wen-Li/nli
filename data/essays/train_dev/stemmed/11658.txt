with the technolog develop so fast today , we have to say that the scienc and technolgi have have chang our world a lot . and transportaion also ha improv a lot compar to what it is year ago . now air plane , underground , ship are wide use in transportaion . but if one say that in tewnti year there will be fewer car than there are today . i strongli disagre with the view . first of all , car are realli convini for peopl to travel , especi when the trip is short . it can drive from one place to anoth quickli . for exampl , in the citi we are live in , we have to work , studi or see friend everyday . if one ha a car , it can save him a lot of time everyday . no need to stand in a line for the bu and be hurri to catch a underground in order not to be late . car provid peopl with a good way to avoid the problem mention abov . for thi reason , more and more peopl will buy car on their own . seconli , it is necessari for a famili to own a car . a case to prove the point is a exampl of mine . we have a car of our own . so when we want to go out for a trip , we can drive there ourselv . it liber my parent from arrang a ticket or find the way we should follow . sometim we can not go to a place becaus there is no transprtat to there in the past . so with the demand of the famili , there will be more car on the road in the futur . more and more famili would like to have car at that time . lastli , we can find out that it is more and more busi on the way now that befor . mayb in the futur there mayb other kind of car to subsitut the car we are use now . for the car are comfort and convini , no other transport can replac them . and it will also be cheaper in futur , so have a car is the first choic of mani peopl , just like the bike today in china . from all abov , we can get to the conclut that car are take a import part in peopl 's everyday life . noth els can substitut it in mani aspect . so to the oppsit of the point that mention in the theme , i think there will more peopl choos car as their first transpot when they are out and certainli there will be more car in twenti year .
