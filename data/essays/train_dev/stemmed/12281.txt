`` it is the idea that creat one 's interest in learn thing conceptu and thi eventu lead him know the fact relat to the idea '' as far as my opinion is concern i agre with the statement `` it is import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact '' becaus unless i get an idea i will not know how to start with . onc i get an idea i will tri learn , learn need the conceptu base for the skill build . as soon as i start learn and i acquir concept i will tri geti back to the histori of that particular idea will will get me across the fact relat to it . on the contrari if i learn fact thi will not help me to be more creativ . for exampl , as a doctor if i have an idea of recearch in neuron and glial cell in brain i will first studi the whole stuff relat to the neuron , the glial cell and the thing relat to these two thing . after understand the concept of the research and have a clear idea i can get along with the research . dure the research i will come across the fact regard the neuron and the glial cell . on the other hand if i start with the fact my knowledg will be limit to an extent and i will not tri learn more about it as i will be convinc by the the tag it ha got that is `` fact '' . onc i know it is fact i will not tri learn about it . thu i feel it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . thi will make them more innov and provid them with a wide scope of learn the subject . when one understand the idea and concept definetli he will come across the fact relat to the subject . to conclud `` idea and concept includ fact , but not the vice versa ''
