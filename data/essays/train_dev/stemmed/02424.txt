peopl born , live , and die . thi is the typic cycl of human life . in thi cycl the peopl choos the way of their live individu . some peopl prefer an enjoy life , such as entertain , travel do thing they enjoy , while the other prefer work for their futur . but it should't be understood that peopl who are work do n't enjoy the life . from thi phenomenia the topic come to the question of how can peopl enjoy life and who can enjoy life more . in the answer of thi question gener it is encount the statement of young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . thi statement make a categor of peopl by their age . but i do n't agre with thi statement . it is right that young peopl have more physic abil to the older peopl . but it should n't be understood that onli the physic abil are enough to enjoy life . young peopl ha more physic abil , but their decis abil are n't grown up enough to make alway the right decis on the situat they encount . for thi reason they can fail while they are tri to enjoy . it is also gener thought that older peopl are work and do n't have enough time to make differ thing which would be enjoy . but it should also be consid that work on the job which is your ideal would be the most enjoy activ for you . work , improv or invent new devic , gener new idea , deal with your own interest also can make your life enjoy . final , my last opinion on thi statement is that the life would be enjoy if you are on the way of your prefer . if you are do the thing in your dream , and on the place where you want to be the lifg would be enjoy for you . so , from that time the age doe n't affect your consider about the life .
