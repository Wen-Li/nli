in my opinion , understand idea and concept are more import than just learn fact . just learn fact could bring few problem to student . first , if student just learn about the fact of ani topic , they might forget them veri easili , some student might not forget , becaus not everi bodi ha same style . howev , if they do n't understatnd idea or concept , they will forget when they do n't studi fact for a while and tri to studi again . it is whi understand idea is import , if they understand idea and concept , they wo n't forget them easili . second , it is veri hard to learn fact without understand idea or concept . especi , for young student like elementray to middl school , they need to understand idea befor they learn fact , becaus most of thing they learn in school for exampl are the stuff that they never heard about . therefor , if they just learn fact and not understand idea and concept , they will get hard time in later like high school or colleg , even they still rememb the fact . third , they can not discuss about the thing that they learn , if they onli know about the fact , becaus they would n't know what they should discuss about , for exampl , student learn about the fact of soda , they ca n't discuss what are the pro of soda and what are the con of soda . they onli know that what is the soda . to get better knolwedg , those are the whi they should understand idea and concept of the topic they learn . howev , i would like to say the fact are veri import too to know thing , becaus student could know specificali about the thing they learn with fact . therefor , my opinion is understand idea and concept are more import and the first thing to get befor learn the fact .
