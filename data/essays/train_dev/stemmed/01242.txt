i believ that market and advertis have start to play an interest role in our live . the number of product avail in the market today is increas veri fast , and therefor manufactur are race with each other to make their brand name and product known to peopl . the question is whi doe a possibl custom rememb one product , on the other hand forget the other ? the answer to thi question is trivial , somehow the possibl custom is convinc that ( thi can also be on the subconsci level ) one of the product is better than the other , and therefor rememb onli the better one . thi give advertis all around the world motiv to show the product better than they are , becaus they need to show that that particular product is the best . the first proof of thi can be found in advertis that present a set that is not or can not be real . thi could be a beach so amaz that it can onli be a paint , or a photograph modifi use softwar . i think that the set is the key to make peopl believ that what you are offer is someth better than they have , becaus it is be display in an environ that is better than your . anoth exampl of thi might be the peopl in the advertis , most of the women in it are veri beauti and most of the men in it are veri handsom . what an advertis is tri to achiev by use nearli flawless charact is to convinc us that we can be like them , all we need to do is to buy that new cellular phone . the worst case is of cours when an advertis claim that a product can do someth that it can not in the averag . most of the advertis onli give inform about the best case , an extrem exampl could be that how a tooth past made somon 's teeth as white as pearl from the ocean , in a clinic experi . dure the time interv , thi inform is be transmit to our brain , a fast subtitl written in a tini font size indic that in thi experi some kind of chemic wa also use to amplifi the effect of the mention tooth past . thi situat will continu to becom a bigger problem as long as new product are introduc to the global and local market everyday , becaus thi will increas the motiv for advertis to do so .
