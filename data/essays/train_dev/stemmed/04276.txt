young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . mayb . it 's also true that nowaday commun that need to be help are lot more than in the past . i think the main question is too big for be resum in these two line . young peopl , right now , is more dedic in avoid it own big problem such drug , aid , racism and so on . describ the help a person can give to hi commun begin from the littl . i can talk about my person impress and action . in the citi i live , milano , the help attitud in gener is so low , and peopl basic go on their own busi . they do n't understand that give help to someon may cost time , energi and can go over the rule . person , i 'm train kid live in the suburb do graffiti , an art that know how to creat without loos the feel of the street . sometim what we do could seem wrong to someon els , but i know i 'm take with me those kid and keep them away from realli wrong habit they could begin to have . what me and few friend do is not help by no church , organ or organ group : is someth we do becaus we feel we can do someth with those skill god gave us . is an action that goe littl , dedic , move in the shadow : we just know that those kid will have someth right , colour and creativ to do in their street instead of begin someth wrong . besid that , everi day is plenti of littl but not less import occas to help peopl : give your seat to someon more need , bring your old cloth to the local church , help someon cross the street . littl by littl . sometim a smile can last for day , even if it 's a glimps . carlo .
