i agre the opinion . it 's becaus i have realli experienc such case . i love a model of the fashion magagin . besid , if she wear someth cloth , it encourag me to buy the same one , onli by see the shot . howev , actual when i visit the shop of the cloth , it doe n't suit me at all . some of my friend said to me that they have experienc such as me . therefor , like thi , it is common for advertis to seem much better than they realli are . we can say in other occas . like my experi , peopl is easili made to want product that popular and famou peopl for exampl , artist , model , actor or actoress , use . compani use thi method . therefor , today , we can see advertis in mani case . these are commerci in televis or radio , on newspap or magagin and final even in train or buse . take an exampl on onlin shop on tv . the buyer show us his/her pleasur after use the product on the screen . or , the clerk or famou actor appear on the screen , then they insist that the product be good . then , peopl that saw the tv program make their mind into buy the product . until we touch the product directli , we do n't know whether the comment on the screen is true or not . besid , the clerk emphas that the product is cheap , or with some present onli now . it is the way of show good by the clerk . so , the more effectivelli they introduc the product , the more peopl want to buy it . therefor , i agre with the statement .
