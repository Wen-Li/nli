i disagre with that say that after twenti year there will be fewer of car than today , which can be answer at onc without even think of reason and someon would say : how we are go to move ? . and after think in the sentenc , then all the thing and sircumst around us doesnt agre with thi sentenc . first , until now the most effect and cheapest way to move from a special place to one anoth is to use my own car , in which i will be the owner of my self , and i can go from ani place to anoth in conveient and cheap way . and if we think in a differ way , like buss or train , then i preffer use my own car to move rather than to use train or bu , especi in short movement , and becaus of beauti thing that are exist in car those day , in which you can feel you are at home . the second reason , is that the number of peapl use car those day is increas , and the need of car is incres , for exampl ; befor 10 year there wa onli one car in my hous , but now after we grow up , we need our own car for me , a car for my mother , anoth for my sister . and that is clear for not onli my famili , for a lot of famili . although , the demand of do thing quickli ask us for more car . the final reason , as the oil exist , then we will have car to move , especi , car age now is 100 year , and the technolog of prodction car is now 100 year , so what can come in car place and do what car do with the same qualiti , the same luxuri , the same performan with less problem . although , is it possibl to find peapl to deal with ani new technolog within 20 year ? in a conclus , i can say that it impos to abanden car if there is not anyth better to take car place , especi we didnt hear ani reaserch come with anythin new to take car place . also , i think that the use of car is incres , and will continu inceas .
