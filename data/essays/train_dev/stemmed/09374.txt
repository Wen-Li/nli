there are some reason to believ that yuong peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do but , person , i think that nowaday it is n't so . in my opinion yuong peopl want to enjoy their life but they want a lot of thing and resoult is that they do n't fell happi never . on the other hand old peopl , actual not veri older , have a good experi to enjoy their life whit a lot of thing . i believ thi becaus they have a lot of possibl , such as more free time than yuong peopl and more money . i think that in thi societi money is veri import for everyth becaus thi help yuo to enjoy yuor life . for exampl yuo can go on holiday where yuo want . instead young peopl ca n't becaus they need an allow of parent and they must go to scholl . so they ca n't go on holiday where they want . also thi topic depend on the bheviour of peopl becaus there are a lot of differ charact . in my experi i 'm sure that my life is more interest today than when i wa veri yuong . i feel thi becaus i have a life experi that help me to grow up better . when i wa teenag i had problem that now i fell stupid . for thi reason i could n't enjoy my life in the past , but now it is all differ . i enjoy my life whit my friend , for exampl to go dinner toghet or to go danc . i prefer simpl situat becaus to enjoy my life i don-t need a lot but onli my friend . uin conclus , i think that it is import for the life that everybodi fell well and consequ yuo can enyoj your life everi day better .
