a studend must be continuosli feed with learn and theori princip , then of cours there is good time also for practic hi studi but first theori must come . sinc the definit of student is come fro the verb '' to studi '' i think it wo n't be a great deal to make them learn the practic befor they know how to appli the practic itself , it could result a mere misus and no more . theori must be the basi first , especi for student that are suppos not have ani experi in real life yet , an engin must to know how to design and project a bridg befor buid it otherwis mani peopl will be in danger . for sure what it make the differ today is not '' to do '' but '' how to do '' and you will learn how onli by studi differ project and compar them with other peopl who gain such a good prepar like you . i not say that learn fact are not import in student career infact onc they will understand the idea then they will start to appli those concept but sinc the begin of student career they realli need to assimil more idea that they can even support , as much as possibl i mean . these issu of cours could vari depend on which faculti the student appli for . obvious , math or phsicolog faculti teach more about idea than fact while in engin or econom the student will studi more practic case but the main idea remain the same and is that student are made first to learn theori in order to appli it succes in a more profit way .
