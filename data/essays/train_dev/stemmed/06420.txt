i can say that i agre with the statement abov . to my mind , it is much more import to understand idea and concept that to learn fact . i think that a true learn experi come from a complet understand of some key point . fact are someth that can support the key concept that you have in mind , and help you memor them , but can not be the princip element of a learn experi . i would n't call ` learn ' what is instead a simpl memor of fact . i will take histori as an exampl . histori is usual treat as a subject that requir student to memor a lot of fact . thi is not complet correct . of cours , you will need to rememb some key date to organ the inform you have collect from class and from your text book , but thi will not help you understand the import of a particular event or of a specif histor period . you will need to understand the main idea that are behind that event or that period . otherwis , you will not have learnt anyth , you will just have done some memor exercis . of cours , you can not studi a subject without need to memor ani fact . i will take one more exampl . a student of medicin will need to studi anatomi , which is also consid as a tough subject becaus there are a lot of name to memor . nobodi can be a good doctor without a solid knowledg of the part of the human bodi and of their name . therefor fact are also import . nevertheless , if there is n't ani concept that connect those fact , you will not have ani knowledg . fact alon have no mean if there is no support idea or concept behid them . thi is the reason whi student of medicin will learn anatomi in an organis way , : the part of the bodi are classifi in differ categori , and thi will help student understand how the human bodi work . final , there is anoth import factor to consid : the human brain can not retain a lot of inform for a long period of time . if you simpli learn name or a seri of fact without ani connect , without ani concept behind them , you will soon forget what you have been tri to learn .
