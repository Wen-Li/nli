most advertisemetn make product for mani reason . they want to sell their product to earn their money and mani peopl have the experi that when you bought someth home and realiz that are not use just like what it appear in a advertis . in my opinion , i agre that most advertis make product seem much better thatn they realli are . the purpos of dvertis is to make their product to be bought . they want to sell their product . therefor , they need to urg custom to buy . they will use everyth to urg you to buy their product . althought it look not good to eat , advertis will use the pictur or sound to let it look like delici . then , advertis use peopl 's desir to sell their product . for exampl , a advertis which a hot model hold a diet drink will make mani women to buy , becaus they want to be a hot model . but , in fact , you ca n't just drink the diet beverag and becom the hot model . advertis use that idea to sell their product althought the diet drink are not realli work like that way . final , advertis onli show the merit of product . advertis want to sell their product , so they exploit the fallaci of a product . they onli show the good site of their product . for exampl , we can see a lot of televs food advertis on the televis . they onli tell you how delici they are , but they have never told you that how you realli tast . they make you see the good part of product , and you go to buy it , then their goal is achiev . becaus mani reason which they sell their product make the real product are not as the same as they look like in dvertis . they can be base on the purpos to sell , the use of your desir , and show the good part to persuad you to buy their product . therefor , i believ that most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are .
