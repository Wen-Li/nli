i agre to the statement that ' the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid ' . the best reason to put forth is of the knowledg the guid ha becaus he ha been to the place earlier and know a lot mani thing about the place . if i were to plan a trip with my friend the first thing to do would be to hire a guid . mani reason can be put forth for choos a guid to help us through the trip , primari reason be hi knowledg of local place . if i were to book a hotel i would n't know the price and also to get to place , hire a transport could be a big problem . the guid come in handi for he know the most econom place to stay in and also these day we see guid get into contract with local driver to help travel have the option have their own transport to see the variou place of visit . i have recent come across a travel arrang compani that ha their own dedic staff as a guid for help the travel have a memor experi . the guid be local to the place have a good knowledg of the local place of visit and would help us get a good feel of the local cultur by show us the place that show the true local cultur . even there are place of eat where we can see the real tast of the place . these can be onli be visit if have a person guid us to these place . often a guid is like a local friend help us in stay at the best hotel at an economl price , eat the best food , visit the best place . i would like to end the topic by state that the guid is the best person who can make our visit excit and help us out in plan the trip with onli a littl monetari cost .
