i agre and disagre with the follow statement '' young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . nowaday , everyth is differ . if we compar today to two hundr year ago , we will see a lot of differ such as differ cultur , peopl and place . howev , children never chang . they alway have the feel that they should never work and alway play . accord to my experi , i agre more with the follow statement than i disagre . young peopl ( teenag or children ) do not have the spirit for work or help on anyth . they are mostli attract to the comput game , movi , soccer , basketbal and other thing . therefor , it is not their fault that they do not do some thing . howev , it is their responsibl to do at least some of the thing they have to do . there are also other teenag or children who are by far differ from the peopl who alway play comput game or watch tv programm . these kind of peopl ( teenag or children ) might be as young as other children but might be much more matur than the other . these kind of young peopl usual give enough time to help their commun . howev , young peopl not give enough time to help their commun might result from the parent . the parent have a big role and effect on the life of the children . if the parent alway do what the child want , then you would not expect that child to give enough time to help his/her commun . if you get the child whatev he/sh want , then he/sh will want more and more and you will buy more which will be a veri bad influenc on the child . for exampl , i have few extrem rich friend . these peopl alway get what they want . howev , they are the one who usual fail dure school . so i think the parent might also effect the children .
