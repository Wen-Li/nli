i disagre with `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . '' tour guid usual offer you a tight schedul which you were in a hurri all the time , and therefor you could not enjoy much for your travel . tour guid usual plan your schedul tightli from the earli morn to the midnight . you could seldom enjoy yourself as you were too busi move form one attract to the other attract . i think most peopl have experienc it befor . while you want to stay a bit longer in one attract , the tour guid would tell you went back to the shuttl bu and you could just stay at that attract for a maximum of 30 minut . you were not abl to understand deepli about the real life of that countri or the attract becaus you would not have enough time to explor it by yourself . you need to be prepar for a long and bore explain befor you could visit the attract . you also need to wake up earli in the morn for the full schedul for the whole day and you would be abl to go back to your hotel in midnight . the schedul offer by the tour guid wa not alway fit to your own habit . mayb you did n't like roller coaster but they would bring you to the most famou theme park in that countri . and you would be stay in the theme park without play anyth except look at your groupmat play happili for the whole afternoon . led by a tour guid would also disabl you to plan your own schedul . you might not be abl to visit the place that you want to becaus that place wa not in the schedul offer by the tour guid . you would have less fun dure your trip . travel in a group wa not a good thing . peopl need to stay with a group of stranger for the entir trip and argument would usual appear when they have differ view on differ thing . also , travel in a group led by a tour guid is also costli , as you need pay fee for the servic provid by the tour guid . you have to pay for a trip that you were not enjoy so much . to conclud , i disagre with `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
