there are sever opinion about knowledg of academ subject . some believ in that peopl should learn mani of the academ topic and some think that it is useless to know mani of them . accord to my opinion , peopl should have broad knowledg about mani academ topic for solv problem , have more inform and have option in front of us . the first reason is peopl can not know what would they meet in the futur . knowledg help for solut to the problem . for exampl after graduat of a depart , which teach mani academ topic , person could be recruit and in busi life that person may meet with lot of problem . as said lectur are prepar for busi than they would be the answer to the problem in busi life . so these mani lectur , that person got in the past , would be differ solut to the problem becaus everi knowledg would have differ point of view . secondli special on just one specif subject give us less knowledg . thi mean that we would have a great knowledg about one topic and it may be seem as not bad . in my opinion thi is not true becaus usual there are lot of inform about ani subject and i can not believ that a person may learn everyth on that subject . although that person may learn most of the inform , he/sh can not learn all of them . in contrast have knowledg about mani topic is more believ becaus a person can mani small thing from lot of subject . these exampl are from daili life but they are all same with the academ subject . lastli broad knowledg mean option in the life . after special , we would have onli one chanc which limit peopl and if we want to be free and independ of anyth we should not be special . for instanc if we learn lot from academ subject , we can easili decid what we will do in the futur after see all the option lie in front of us . if we take these thing abov into consider , i can say that be specif on one topic is not as good enough as have wide inform about academ topic . to learn more , we should just studi on more topic .
