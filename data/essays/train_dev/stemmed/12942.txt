i agre with the view that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . of cours , i understand that some peopl think it is more desir to concentrar on one specif subject . in my opinion , howev , obtain broad knowledg is better for the follow two reason . first reason support my idea is about practic aspect . these day our societi ha larg number of social problem to solv . i believ that we have to get broader and more knowledg which is requir to appropri deal with the problem . in order to strrugl with the tangl social problem , we must have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . for exampl , contemporari societi ha environment problem global . when we make effort to find a solut to thi kind of problem , for instanc , global warm , we have to util the knowedg , find and theori not onli in the area of natur scienc but also social scienc . in sum up , we have to studi biolog , ecolog , natur histori , law , econom , polit , and so on . think thi way , we find that it is much more import to studi varieti of disciplin broadli to solv the actual social problem . second of all , i think that we cannnot learn one specif subject well without broad knowledg of mani subject . person , more often than not , i can get somet about one subject when i studi anoth subject . for exampl , when i learn mathmat , i understood plato philosoph theori . in thi way , we often get profound knowledg about a certain subject while stude anoth subject . that is whi , i think it is help for get special knowledg for these reason , i think it is better to know wide rang of academ subject .
