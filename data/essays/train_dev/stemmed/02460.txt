the environment concern we know nowaday such as the melt of the ice cap or the thick of the ozon layer make us wish that there would be less pollut in the futur . thi result could be reach thank to a breakdown in the use of car , which pollut a lot becaus of exhaust gase . howev , i do not think that in twenti year the use of car will be less import becaus car bring us a comfort that no other way to travel can equal . first of all , car are veri comfort . thank to them , we can go quit fast wherev we like . nowaday , in everi countri in the world there are concret road which enabl us to travel by car . thi is a common point of all earth citizen . moreov , it is a privat place . it belong to you as your flat or hous doe . consequ , you can adapt it to your tast and make it look like as you want . for instanc , we can often see car paint with funni colour or with a lot of stick on the window . you can also decid whether to clean it or not , whether to allow pet to get in , whether to listen to music loudli or not . on the contrari it is imposs to act thi way in public transport like buse . you have to bear peopl 's attitud even if you disagre with it . final , i reckon that onli environment concern can prevent peopl from use there car which would have been replac by eco-friendli buse for exampl . howev develop countri can not afford and implement such progress . so , inhabit of develop countri wo n't agre to give up with the car comfort while peopl in develop countri still take advantag of it . so , to conclud briefli , i think car will prevail for quit a long time : twenti year is a too short period to make peopl understand they have to stop use their car .
