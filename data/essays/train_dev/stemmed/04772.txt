is it more import for student to understand idea and concept than it for them to learn fact ? thi question offenli ask by parent that have dificulti with the academ level of thier children . in my opinion it better for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . an idea or a concept may sometim be the result that becom a fact . so if we understand the idea we could conclud the fact but if we memroiz a fact we can not conclud it idea sinc we dont no have the main base which is the idea . if we take for exampl ineshtin , when he discov the nuclear a wide path of both good and bad invent were discov . the teacher in the school explain for student idea and concept then let them memor fact becous sometim a whole lesson can talk about one idea that result mani fact . if you want to understand and memor the lesson 's fact you must know the main idea that the lesson is talkin about . solv a math problem is the best exampl for thi idea . supos u need to prove the fact that thi equat is defin or not , you will began solv use the conept and evntual end up with fact that it defin or not . although a fact seam to most of us easier to memor than understand a concept or an idea . but if we onli memriz a fact it will have no mean or no logic explan for it in our mind , so as a result , we forget it quickli . but if we knew the idea or the concept tne memor will take no time and the fact will live in our memori for ever . final , know and idea and a concept is much better than memor a fact and if the fact wa describ as a locat , i guess that the idea will be the bridg that will lead you to that locat .
