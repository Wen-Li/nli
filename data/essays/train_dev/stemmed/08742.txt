in my opinion older peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl do . i can count two reason for thi . firstli , a younger person doe not care about time . he think that everyth in hi life will continu as befor . but when he start to get older , especi after thirti ; he understand that the thing are gradual chang . for instanc a young man spend most of hi time play sport , go to club , watch film etc . after ten year the habit start to chang . you start to make a program in which you can use your time effici . instead of play sport most of the time you just play 1 hour a day . or instead of watch tv all night ; you seper thi time into more part and do mani thing in order to make it more enjoy . moreov , perceiv enjoy of life differ from person to person . from my point of view ad some valu to human is the promin aim of my life . for instanc when i use to be a freshman student , i alway care about pass the exam . i rare to think about find new thing and contribut to scienc world . i thought that after graduat i would have much time to do research . but now i see that if i use my time effici and prepar myself to my goal it would have been better . so as time pass peopl realiz that enjoy life is connect strictli to what you want to do in your life and whether you achiv your goal or not . when you get older you will be target to your dream close . in conclus ; when peopl get older ; they understand the mean of life and tri to enjoy it more . it come with matur .
