i complet agre with the fact that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . to support my stand there are three valid point . firstli , with the advanc technolog newer and faster mode of transport are come up like metro , bullet train , intra citi express which make it veri convini for peopl to travel from one place to anoth and actual consum less amount of time as compar to car which gener take more time becaus of the traffic jam and all . peopl rather commut to far off place in metro and train and have alreadi start use their car as mode of transporat to nearest station if they have such an option . secondli , with the arriv of internet and video telecommun most of the offic find it convini for it staff to work from their home , eg. softwar firm , busi offic and corpor relat with trade of share etc . with thi trend on , it will take veri few year when most of the peopl will be work from their home . thi will automat reduc the usag of car as most of the peopl use their car to go to their respect offic . final the most import factor which will determin the reduct in the usag of the car is the scarciti of the fuel . in today world the consumpt of fuel is grow exponenti and it seem there are no mean to replenish it , even though variou effort are be made world wide . with limit amount of fuel suppli the world wont be abl to sustain the demand of the market and final , to come up with the solut so as to reduc the fuel consumpt , peopl will be motiv not to use car and other such vehicl . thi will automat determin less usag of car in the futur year . it might be hard to digest but the way thing are turn out to be it seem we will soon stop the usag of one of the most import invent of human histori . and it can be veri well assum that thi time durat will be not more than twenti yera .
