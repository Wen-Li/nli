in my opinion , i think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour gide becaus of sever reason . first , some peopl feel more comfort with the group becaus they not alon . second , mani peopl like to lede by a tour guid to show them the place and explain it to them , also the guid usual use the laungug that the peopl use it in the countri that they travel to , so that the travel do not have a laungug problem dure their trip . final , some peopl like to be organ and follow a schual that they not respons of it . peopl will feel comforat when they travel with a group of other peopl that probabl their first time to see these place too . i beliv it will be more intertan , and make anew frind . although , it will be mani program dure the trip that will make it better than lonli trip . mani peopl like to lede by a tour guid to show them the place , as well to explain it . the tour guid alway known the histori of the place the the tour will visit it , so that , the tour get more inform about the place that they visit , and learn anew stuff about that place . cultur , food , cloth , and tradit are the most import issu for the travel , the tour guid who usual from that place , he is the best one who can explain all these stuff for the group . howev , the guid usual know the langug that use in that place , as well the langug of the group , so the travel do not have ani problem that the may face from that issu . final , mani peopl are organ and they care too much about the time , so that the like to be a part of a group to organ everyth for them . inaddit , travel is veri good thing to learn more about how the other peopl live .
