young peopl enjoy life as older peopl do in my opinion , old peopl enjoy their life as the young peopl . in some case , old peopl will more enjoy their life than young peopl . becaus they truli know that so preciou is time that they can not affort to wast it . some peopl will think that so old is the elder person , they can not do anyth . but i don not agre with them . the elder peopl can also have a colour life . besid , they can do anyth they like to do . for instanc , they can go to danc with their partner in the old peopl assosi , go to sing is also a good idea for them . by go out , they can make more friend and be happier . sometim , elder peopl can go to the children 's hous to have a visit or walk in the park . as a teenag , we should take care of the elder peopl , which is our responsebl . of cours , young peopl also have their paradis . there is no deni that the most import thing is that studi . as a studet , noth is more import than to receiv the educ . it is our responsebl to studi well . furthermor , the teenag can also have some thing you like to do after school . such as do some sport , go shop , do some read , or listen to the music . addict to the comput game is not a good thing , or spend the time in drink beer is also not good at the childern 's grow . in a word , we must valu our time and life , both the young peopl and the old peopl .
