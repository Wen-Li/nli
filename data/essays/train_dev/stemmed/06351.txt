given a choic to choos between a self organ tour and a tour where are tour guid leed a group of peopl , i would choos the first one . i would like to have my tour focu on my interest rather than the gener interest of peopl and so have a tour guid will prevent me from do it to some extent . tour guid may make thing easier but reduc the fun of explor on your own . in a tour variou peopl would want to spend vari amount of time on differ part of the tour . i prefer spend more time in more part of the tour , less in some and even skip a part that is cover under the tour led by a guid . in a guid tour i am restrict to follow the schedul and plan decid by the tour guid . sinc now there is plenti of inform avail at differ sourc ( e.g. televis , internet , magazin ) , i can use that to plan my tour base on my own prefer . other than that , i prefer to explor place to a much more extent than a special tour guid would keep it restrict to appeal the major . i would rather learn about the place i am suppos to visit and wo n't restrict myself on the main tourist attract . i would rather be a part of each and everi minor thing that is around that place . in the trip i plan , i prefer to visit lesser place but spend more time on each place . i think that in guid tour , it is more like glimps of what all is there to explor . some peopl may have lack of inform or time to plan tour properli and tour guid make their job easier . but just for the sake of take out the effort from plan and manag my trip , i would not give away the main interest that i look for in a trip , as i have alreadi discuss abov . consid all the factor , i person do n't think that to travel in a group led by tour guid is the best way to travel .
