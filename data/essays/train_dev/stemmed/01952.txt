i total agre with thi statement . i 'm realli convinc that have a widespread knowledg of mani differ subject is better than special on just one of them becaus of sever reason . first of all , sinc i 'm not sure of where i 'm go to be or what i 'm go to do in the near futur i 'd rather prefer to have mani choic in front of me , mani path to run instead of focus on just one way that mayb could even be the wrong one . act like thi i will get readi and prepar to take ani valuabl opportun arous along my person scholast journey . in addit to thi , i think that special on onli one topic would be more bore and annoy than approach differ type of subject . in spite of open and studi everi day the same book and the same lectur i believ that daili shift from one subject to anoth could make your life more appeal , still keep the chanc to drop the cours which do n't match your initi expect . final the most import reason , my person thirst of knowledg . sinc i wa a child i use to read ani kind of book , to watch ani type of program and to observ everyth that could strike my attent so i would realli love have at my dispos a broad experi and knowledg in order to say my opinion in each context . i want to be a person readi to explain my belief wherev i am , whatev i `` m talk about without feel uncomfort or inappropri . hope to be like thi . ..
