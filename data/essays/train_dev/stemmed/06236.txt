accord to statement , which say that `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i disagre with thi statement becaus car is the basic mean of travel , no matter how mani wheel they are , there can be two . three , four wheel car . the car are the basic mean of transport , travel , for certian emerg and to mani more thing and i think so in the come year we can say that their can be more sophist car , becaus the scienc and technolog ha been improv day-by-day . befor drive a car one should know the signal and precaut so that their can be no harm to the person . we can get mani develop car like there can be mani thing like reduc the size of the car and give more spaciou car and comfort for the passeng to seat . may be in the come year we can get car that are automat like we do not need to have `` key '' to it can be start by and simpl button . in the come year , the compani can make the car which are more conveneint for park and the type of colour and the differ in the qualiti . now-a-day , becaus of increas in the car we can see mani traffic jam and which caus to differ type of pollut like sound , smoke . these caus can be veri hazardi to the human be and even can kill a man . so scienc may find way to make these solv . in the come year we can see that the compani can chang the fuel use by the car and the technolog can discov mani use ga which ha mani advantag and can save the uncontrol level of pollut to a decreas level . so i think that car can improv better way and can make the life of the human in a good way
