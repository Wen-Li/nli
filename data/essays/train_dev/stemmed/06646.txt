as my boss use to say me at the begin of my career : < do not be afraid about the speriment of new thing , do more than other do : no one ha never been punish for do more > . accord to thi phrase , i think that peopl who tri to do new think normal have more chanc to be success dure their own life than someon who silmpi do his/her usual job . what make a man success is the plus-valu that he can give to the societi . a lot of men could do thing well , but onli men who do thing better than other could reach an higer level in social life . take risk is part of a success person . someon who do not tri to take risk could be seen as a coward by the societi . for exempl , in cartoon , a superhero is someon who normal take risk to do someth more danger than other normal peopl do . in the same way , thi attitud , could be postpon in differ realist situat . in a busi environ , for instanc , a success manag is in gener someon who is abl to `` manag '' riskful situat ( like , for exampl , take strateg decios that could huge impact compani 's busi ) . i think that take a `` safe '' risk is someth that everyon should do in order to make peopl more confid and more appreci by societi . thi will certainli creat more success peopl .
