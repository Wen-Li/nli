i think that is more import to understand idea and concept than learn fact , becaus when you just know fact , you do not use your brain . you onli use your knowledg and not your comprehens of the thing . i think that it is more import to understand idea and concept becaus you can resolv a lot of thing with just your understand of a problem for exampl . if a person explain to you how someth work , but you are not abl to understand , you will not be abl to make it work . i think that sometim we give too much import to how a person know a lot of thing ( fact ) . becaus when we ariv in real life , i mean in the street , it is more import to be abl to count for exampl , and that is not to learn fact , it is to understand how we do it . i will do a exampl . in math , when the teacher teach you how to do someth , you can not just learn the answer , you have to understand how you can arriv at thi answer . i alway said that the intellig , it is not just to know a lot of thing but also to know to think and to understand how we can do the thing . when we look at the person who reach the top of the societi , it is the person who learn fact but the most import , the person who understand the idea and the concept of more thing that they can . i think that when we go at school , it is to arriv in real life like at a job and to accomplish great thing , so if we want to do great thing , you have to be the most balanc person that you can . and my think is that it is more import to understand idea and concept more thant learn fact .
