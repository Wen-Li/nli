the understand of idea and concept togeth with the abil to reproduc them correctli is the best way to learn someth new . but the more import part from the learn in gener is definetli the understand , becaus onli if a student understand the idea or concept , he/sh will be abl to use it success . to explain my point , i will tri to give an exampl , where we can see that just learn fact doe n't help in real life . let 's assum that a busi student , who alway had good result in colleg , start work in a big compani and ha to work on a veri difficult case . thi task includ a number of problem , which seem familiar to him , but he can not use the result he had learn from univers , becaus they do n't fit in thi case and he never realli understood the concept . he ha never done it befor and ha to solv thi problem by himself , becaus otherwis the senior manag will recogn that he ha n't got a clue about the topic . now , he will recogn that the stuff he had learn without understand it , doe n't help him at work . which might lead to a lot of problem for him . i think that we can obvious see on that exampl that learn fact ca n't be more import than understand the idea . and even if someon can probabl pass colleg or univers without realiz thi statement , he will do , when he start to work . and do we onli learn for good result in school ? i do n't think so , and that is by the way what all the teacher in my school tell me as well . we have to understand what is behind the fact , so that we can use the concept . and for that , i would like to mention that a student have to learn the fact , which is also import . onli when these both factor of learn come togeth , we will be abl to learn for life and use what we have learn success .
