in my opionion thi statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject is wrong . i think it is better to have a special knowledg , becaus we live in a time where knowledg get more and more special . in school you can see thi argument good , becaus zou first learn the basic of a method and then it get more and more special . for exampl you first learn plu and minu in math and later on it get more and more complex . mayb it is good to have a broad konwledg later in life , becaus than you can expand on more field , for exampl in your job . but as you can see there is more unemploy than befor , becaus compani need less poepl to work on the machin . at thi point it is good to have a specal knowledg , becaus you are differ form all the other , who are look for a job . so specif knowledg let you stand out and help you to get a better job . thi is an argument for thi , but it ha it 's disadvantag , too . if the job you specifi on is alreadi given to somebodi with the same field of knowledg , it could bring up problem , becaus you field of studi is veri popular and there are not much job you could choos from . thi is one argument for the broad knowledg . but broad knowledg doe n't let you stand out form the mass . thi is whi you have to balanc your knowledg between broad and specif knowledg . but there are way to studi someth special and get a good job or a varieti to choos from . thi is made by just look up statist and look up which job need person . anoth way to solv that problem is to look up if you job is need in a differ state or countri and appli for thi on if you got the money . but the best solut is to balanc the specif and the broad knowledg , but in mzi opinion it is still better to have a special knowledg befor you have a broad knowledg .
