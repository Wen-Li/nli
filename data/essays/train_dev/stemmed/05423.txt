the way to travel that someon can choos is highli relat with her/hi personn . there is basic two way to travel : the first one would be to travel in a group lead by a guid and the itinerari is known befor the departur , and decid in an certain amount of time . the second way would be to travel on our own , and the itinerari will be mostli direct by the peopl we meet and place we outlin befor the departur . in thi essay , i will discuss in the first paragraph the advantag that a travel in a group ha , and in the second paragraph , the disadvantag that it impli . when travel in a group , we are more lucki to meet peopl who share the same way to think . it can be a way for peopl who have issu in commun to meet peopl and open themselv . it 's also probabl for peopl who doe n't want to travel alon , and enjoy have time with peopl they do n't know . on the point of view of the travel itself , travel with a guid ha the advantag to learn thing about the countri visit that would be propbabl harder to know if travel alon . tour guid travel are also made to see the most of thing and landscap , to experi local tradit in a few amount of time . howev , thi kind of travel give not place for the adventur and for unexpect experi . by travel by ourself , we have the right of decis on where we want to go and when . we can decid to stay longer in a place that we enjoy . it 's also more probabl to meet local peopl and directli experi the cultur , in contrari to the travel tour , in which cultur are translat and explain by the tour guid , in our own languag . the fact to be in direct relat with the local use languag is , for my part , of import in travel . to conclud , for my part , i disagre on the fact that travel in a tour travel is the best way to travel . howev , i do n't think there is a best way to travel in gener , but everybodi ha it own best way to travel . for me , the adventur and liberti in decis are import to travel .
