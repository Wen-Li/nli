i agre with the statement . first , nowaday there are mani car in use , you can see everywher , we use them instead of by foot , becaus it 's easi and fast . but the air pollut problem is becam a strong problem . most car-gas be taken into the air , and we breath dirti ga into our bodi . when twenti yea past , i think our air will be destroy badli . so the govement must be reduc the car product and the car will be fewer use than there are today . second , peopl today use car instead of by foot becaus they are comfotb , but they have n't realiz that step by foot is a bodi exercis for our health . we can stronthen our bodi and do more exercis everytim . third , use fewer car can reduc our traffic jam . today big citi are all have terribl traffic , espec in rush time , and more traffic jam happen , whenth car becam fewer the problem will be slove . and we are more safti when we out . becam the popul grew more and more , thi method must be a good one . abov these three reason , i think in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , and our life will be more comfotb and safti .
