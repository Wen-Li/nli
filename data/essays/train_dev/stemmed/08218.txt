nowaday , in korea , i think mani young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . instead , they spend their time on their own task . i 'd like to give you some of exampl of young peopl in korea . the first exampl is that mani young peopl say that they are help their commun . they claim that they go to orphang or public place such as post offic or polic station in order to help their commun . actual , they are not go to the place in order to contribut to societi . they volunt in fake in order to get score or fulfil the time requir to go to high school or colleg . if the requir time of volunt is fulfil , they do not volunt ani more . the second exampl is that , in korea , when a social matter occur , mani young peopl protest against it and they continu protest until it wa improv . howev , nowaday , most young peopl are ignor of the social matter . they onli pay attent to their own . becaus of that , there are mani social problem unsolv throughout the countri . though the some young peopl are realli spend time on help commun , most of the young peopl do not help their commun . they onli do their task . they do not give much attent to their societi . i think the main reason for thi is that the ` individu ' which wa spread to young peopl from european countri or america . we , korean , should follow our tradit , which put a lot of emphasi on help commun . if we behav like thi , our countri can not develp well . if we want to make a better countri , we , young peopl should spend some time help to the communit . these kind of activ may not be hard . we can pick some trash scatter in the street or we can help disabl peopl in the road . we can give some of our money to poor peopl or we can visit hospit or peopl in need onc in a week . these might be not tough . instead of spend time on ourselv , we can help commun with those kind of acit . through our effort , we can make a better world . help commun !
