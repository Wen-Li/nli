the statement is about success peopl ane their attitud in take risk . i agre whit thi statement , i think is true that peopl who have alreadi reach a succes place in societi doe n't take risk if they 're not sure of their success . whi they act like thi ? mayb they do n't want to look silli at the eye of peopl that are look at them . if a man is kown as a geniu in math for exampl , whi should he tri to write a sentiment poetri or sing in a broadway music ? he 's quit sure that thi is go to be a disast . i think that that 's the princip reason whi success peopl do n't even tri do someth that is far away from their special or that is not realli someth that they alreadi know . peopl usual do n't want to tri anyth new if they 're happi with i thik that i 'll do the same thing if i were in them . i actual think that everbodi would do that . it 's natur . i think that onli peopl that have noth to lose would take the risk in do someth new . if you 're a well-known person and you fail in do someth you may gonna lose your face , and nobodi want to lose hi face . but i have to say someth els . i believ that the world realli need peopl , even few person , who are readi to take risk , also big risk , becaus if nobodi take risk noth can chang and everi big discov that accur in the last centuri ha been gener by someon who took a realli big risk . and at the end , if you take a risk and you success in that , you sure will becom a success person with all the merit , and mayb also the award , you merit . all the success are pai back .
