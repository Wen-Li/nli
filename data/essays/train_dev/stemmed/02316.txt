i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well , becaus i believ that the peopl who have strong wish to be success , are more like to be success . my father is a busi man who work for the japanes compani . when i wa young , my father 's job wa to trade oil , and the compani ask him to go to ny with famili to work there . when i arriv ny with my mother and father , i wa surpris becaus the other busi man who work there were at least 10 year older than my father . i ask my mother whi , and she told me that my father is one of a rare case . he alway suggest new thing and tri new thing that the compani ha never done , so he is work with older peopl who is work much longer than my father . when i heard of it , i thought it is good to challeng new thing rather than onli do what i alreadi know . there is anoth strong exampl which i have seen in televis about a week ago . i wa watch the japanes tv programm which is about success peopl in japan . on that day , they were show about one singer who is veri popular in japan now . in the programm , he said that he wa actual a busi man when he wa twenti year old , and suddenli he quit hi job to be a singer . he lose hi job and had a veri hard time until the famou music produc found him , but he said it wa a priceless time which wa crucial to hi life , becaus he still rememb those time and he even wrote a song about that time . due to those reason , i strongli beliv that peopl who tri new thing and take risk will be success . even though they have difficult time befor be succeed , you will learn thing from that time for sure , and your success will be even more valuabl .
