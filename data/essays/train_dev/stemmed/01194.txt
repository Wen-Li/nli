it is like that to special in one specif subject is benefici for peopl who have decid to develop their carreer in a certain area , but i think that , in gener , to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is more help in our live . first of all , to obtain a great number of academ encourag us to have mani option or choic with regard to our intellectu activ as well as our career . if one ha knowledg of onli one fierld , he or she can not revis the direct of life . for exampl , my old friend had a promin knowledg about iron industri and he decid to get into a certain larg iron compani . fortun he join the largest compani in japan , but the iron industri face a seriou recess later , which requir him to take advantag of anoth skill or knowledg which he did not have . i think peopl ought to be as versitil as possibl , and ramifi their live accord to condirion and phenominon . secondli , to develop a divers sequenc of knowledg help us find what we would have never found . when i work for a life insur conpani , i wa studi the neibor industri such as the properti / casual insur , mutual fund , and invest bank . then , the idea that it is possibl to make a innov product by mix the featur of each industri had occur to me . and eventu , i becam one of the member of our project in which we establish a financi hold compani under which there are now sever financi institut . in addit , i am in charg of product develop , especi high-brid product which consist of both life insur and mutual fund . in conllus , for the reason point out abov , i definit think that to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to special in one specif subject .
