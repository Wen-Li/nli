the question be ask is whether it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or to rather special in one specif subject . in my eye thi question bring up a veri import issu in time of increas interdisciplinari work . mani compani want their emloye to work tran - or interdisciplinari and i person think for thi it is necessari to special in one specif subject . first of all , concern the fact that human knowledg increas so fast nowaday i think it is almost imposs to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject such as leibnitz did for exampl . of cours , a person can still have a good gener educ and can be interest in mani thing , but when it come to know a lot about academ issu there is a limit . second i feel that onli peopl who spezial in a certain field will be abl to find a good job in our societi . especi in scienc it is necessari to have expert who know almost everyth about their subject . becaus onli those peopl will be abl to get so deep into the topic that they will eventu find new solut to problem . and for get so deep into the subject i am sure that it is crucial to focu and to special in one specif topic . natur it is import to work togeth with peopl of differ academ field , as it is want by interdisciplinar strategi , but that doe not mean that everyon ha to everyth . in my eye the best solut for current problem will be found when mani expert will come togeth on one tabl and exchang idea . so , in conclus i feel that nowaday it is just not possibl to have such a wide rang of knowledg and as a matter of fact i think that it is not necessari if peopl of differ subject start work togeth .
