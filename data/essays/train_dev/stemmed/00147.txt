i disagre with thi statement becaus without learn the fact it can get you nowher . ofcours , some peopl think that without fact it wo n't take too long to find out , but what if they did n't know if they were right . to put it thi way , say that you want to learn someth in biolog in plant , anim , fish , reptil , insect and mammel . to know how to learn thing the way they were taught in the book , you can read through the main fact and detail that wa given to you . if you want to know someth or investig you need the fact about each topic that you were given in your biolog book . if you know it and got the idea then that would be no problem . also , anoth way of get fact is by find out what happen , exampl who kill someon or who is the one respons for commit a crime . to find out , you need to ask yourselv : `` how did he or she die and who kill them ? '' the question will be answer if you gave in everi inform you have gather when you want to prepar if thi person did or did not kill these peopl . either if thi person is guilti or not guilti . life is not easi on how it sound when it is import for student understand idea and concept but a faculti is the way that show what can be featur and how can you explain it . given through what the topic is about , to me , i think it 's a good way to have fact better than to ignor them . it help me learn alot when they were given to me and prepar to answer that i choos thi becaus it is best to find out more than hesit to answer it .
