i global agre with the quotat abov even if i think that some precis should be add up to complet it and make it more realist . first , the purpos of studi is to gain a ration mind so that you can appli it to resolv and analys variou issu . therefor , it is compulsori to be abl to quickli understand concept and idea so that you can discuss them and give an opinion without necessari have ani relat knowledg . in addit , fact are often the aftermath or the physic consequ of idea or concept . in other word , fact convey idea and concept , that is whi they are inevit of a superior valu . for exampl , the castro revolut in cuba is a fact while the marxism ideolog is the logic behind it . second , a reason that can explain whi fact are sometim seen as import or even more import than idea is that fact are extrem effici to convey an idea . peopl are gener more recept twhe they can link an idea to relev fact and great speaker often use fact and exampl to support their say . therefor , one could wrongli think that the messag is more interest when convey through fact wherea it is the combin of idea and fact that make it so appeal . to conclud , there is no doubt about the superior of idea and concept over fact . howev for a student to be success in life , he or she need to be abl to link idea to fact and point out the exist interact between them . i therefor think that the sentenc should have been written like thi : '' it is import for student to understand idea an concept first and then look for exampl of the aftermath of these idea throughout the histori '' .
