ye , it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than specialisz in one specif subject becaus of variou reason . if a person ha knowledg about a particular subject , it is good . but if he want to refrain himself from foray from other subject he should make sure that he is veri thorough with that subject . becaus final he should find a job on that basi onli and more ver all the academ topic are interconnect so , it imper to have knowledgein variou field . the abov option would be good onli if he find a job . he should alway keep in mind the differ possibl in hi carreer . he should ask himself `` what if i dont get a job in hi desir field of studi ? '' for exampl i am a mechan engin student . as everi one know there is a scarciti of job for mechan engin . if i continu with the same field would be left unemploy . here i need to have an altern option . i have my altern option as comput scienc . i start learn some comput subject . now even if i donot get a job in my field of studi , i may have a chanc of get it in field of comput . thi would not leav me unemploy . i person feel that be employ is better than be unemploy . thi criteria not oni work for two field of same backround , it also work for a technic background and an art background . for exampl , an electr engin who doesnot have a job and whose hobbi is sing , can surviv by give some stage show . which would also be consid as an employ . moreov , broader knowleg would not leav you speechless when you are in a group . becaus when agroup is discuss a topic and if you are silent , you may feel embarass with that . but if you are familiar with the topic you can also give your opinion on the topic . thi is possibl onli if you donat confin yourself to a particular field i conclud that have a broad knowledg is better than to special in one subject .
