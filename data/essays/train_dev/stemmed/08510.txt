did the young gener realli forget their due to their commun ? are we realli that selfcent ? i tend to say that we are definit not and that it is the imag that is reflect by a minor of peopl who do n't care about other . first of all , i 'd like to say that - work in a hospit myself - i have seen mani young peopl take care of the older gener . in fact , and thi is what stroke me most , when i start work there , a great major of the staff is made of pleopl under thirti year of age . they all seem to give the best they can in ani situat . thi is whi i ca n't stab them in the back , pretend that we are n't help our commun anymor . secondli , i basic think - as i wrote at the begin - that thi imag is ha been creat by some peopl , who , in fact , do n't care about their commun . but is it realli onli their fault ? no it 's not . the way pleopl act , stronli depend on the educ they got from their parent and on the environ , the condit in which they have grown to the person they are today . on balanc , i refus to think , that all young peopl are that selfcent as the question let us thin . while some may not help , other still do . we do n't have the right to put all egg in the same basket .
