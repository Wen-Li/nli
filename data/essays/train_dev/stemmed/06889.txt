ye , i agre with the statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' i agre with thi becaus my friend is veri success person . he is from electon backround but take the risk of experi the new thing , for exampl one day he had a problem with hi bike . it wa unabl to start . so i told him to take the bike to the mechan but he didnt do so , instead he say it good chanc for me to experi some thing which is new to me . and he start repair hi bike , it took more then 5 hour and wa unabl to start , so i said him again to take it to mechan . but he went on like that with hi work . and i wa veri much surpris to see that the bike start , and even hi patienc and the motiv toward hi work . and he wa delight with joy as hi risk wa fruit . so becaus of thi reason i support the statement . there are some peopl who actual want to experi or take risk but some dont want to do so they will be worri and they will not take the risk . just they do the thing which ever they know better . and more over it depend upon the understand of the peopl . therefor from the abov mention exampl i support the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know how to do well .
