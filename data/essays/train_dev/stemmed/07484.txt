i believ learn idea and concept is far more reward for student than onli learn a bunch of meaningless fact . special as the student start to progress in hi knowledg , idea and concept should becom more and more relev than fact alon . even though the normal process to reach a concept or idea requir us to learn fact befor understand them , it is clearli of higher import to understand the concept as whole . in fact , understand the concept is the onli way to appli all the fact we learn . for instanc , in my work experi i have notic how two differ person aproach problem . the first one tri to memor the solut and doe not care about the underl reason of the problem . the second one reaserch the fact for the superior task of understand the problem as a whole . clearli the second one alway come with new and suport idea on how to resolv the situat , howev , the first one is alway talk about specif inform that doe not help the solut at all . anoth exampl of the higher import understand idea have over learn fact is the follow . when there is a complet understand of the concept you can appli the same concept to a similar situat regardless of the differ fact you may encount . additt , the sum of idea and concept can even form a more complet and complex reason for a wide varieti of situat . on the contrari , the sum of fact would not lead us to the same aplic regard difer situat . the fact that idea and concept are of higher valu is the onli fact student should have on their mind as they progress in their knowledg . i definatli believ it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
