i 've live all my life in a scholar system that gave student a broad knowledg of mani academ subject onli in elementari and medium school . then , when student are 13 year old , they have to choos a quit specif area that interest them . so i can believ that thi is the best way of learn , and so thi system , ho give peopl a perfect mix of gener knoledg , and specif knoledg is veri use for futur life and work . in fact , in thi set of scholar system , all student have a basic knowledg of everi subject , and then they can choos the most interest subject to special themselv . when student finish the basic cours , they have to make a first step for their career : choos their superior school . superior school are differ in their main area of interest . thi area make student free to choos the subject that they prefer , howev go on depeen the basic subject studi in the past school . thi area are veri use for univers , becaus if you think you will be an architect , you choos a school that have as most import subject design , and math . so with the superior school , and then with univers , knoledg could be specializ in one specif subject . i think that thi is the right way to learn , becaus for have a good career , you need to be veri prepar in your own subject , but it is also quit import to show that you have also a gener cultur of other subject . in conclus i think that it 's veri import to have a gener knowledg about mani subject , that compos the gener cultur of a person . but i think also that is veri import to have a specif knowledg on the subject need by futur work . thi is becaus a deep knowledg is useful for succed in a good career and to demonstr be abl to do your own work .
