i disagre the statement that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guid . recent even one tour packag is becom a product of commerci societi for fun . i want to defin that travel is experienc new space . unfortun , current peopl are attract in luxuri or expens tour packag . there is a reason whi i do not agre that statement . the reason is that if you travel alon or with your friend without a tour guid , you would experi someth excit or new definitli . for exampl when i wa in high school , i and three friend of mine went to travel without money or ani avail item . we had to deal with most difficult situat . we caught fish in the river to make our dinner and gather wood for fire . we felt that it wa veri terribil and hard but now the onli thing i can rememb about travel in my life is that no money travel . after the travel , i can have more posit attitud and strong capac . it is a valuabl gift that the travel give to me . so i recommand that if you want to experi someth excit and interest , you must leav now alon or with your friend . do not worri about money or hardship . the travel would give you more valuabl thing than money or comfort from luxuri tour . in conclus , i disagre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . if you tri to experi new , leav now . the onli thing luxuriuo travel can give you is reduc your money . take a risk and you will achiv someth .
