i total agre with the follow statement . first of all , if you are someon who take risk , you are someon who like challeng , who are not affraid to experi . from my point of new , it 's a main qualiti if you have project and want to be success in them . for exampl , if you have a new concept for a busi project , you take the risk your project wo n't work , but you also can be realli amaz if it work : come up with a new concept for project that work mean that you succeed in do someth new . in other word , besid the fact your project work , you have a person success feel . also , peopl who come up with busi idea ( for exampl some kind of restaur such as the first fast food , the first bar where you can read while drink a coffe . .. ) took the risk to give all of them and end with noth . but they tri , they believ in a new project and they final succeed so much that they becam rich and also could , in the case of restaur do franchis and extend what becam a chain restaur all over the world . howev , some peopl prefer to keep do what they alreadi know to do , they do n't feel take risk tri someth new that may not work . thi kind of peopl prefer the secur , and i total understand thi feel but from my point of view , if you keep do what you know , you can end lake of confid and be afraid of chang your life : keep the same job and not tri to have a higher posit , go to the same place not to risk to be desappoint by anoth place ( i 'm talk for exampl about a restaur or your holiday destin ) . in conclus , even if i understand the feel of be secur , i do n't think thi kind of peopl can be success . so , from my point of view , the more you take risk , the more chanc you have to succeed in your life
