thi is a controverti topic about whether the number of car will reduc in twenti year . as far as i am concern , there will be fewer car . my reason are list as follow . first , we should take a glanc at the opposit opinion . some peopl will deem that with the rapid econom growth ( especi in china ) , peopl will continu to buy their own car becaus it is a conveni to their live , they do not need to wait a long time and get into a crowd bu , which is commonli seen in china . howev , these peopl seem to ignor sever essenti aspect that would lead to the reduc of the number of car . the import reason is that peopl 's awar of protect the environ is gradual increas . we all recogn the fact thatour environ is face seriou problem caus by human pollut , like global warm and water pollut , air pollut . and the govern as well as the increas number of peopl are take effort to protect the environ . they can give up use of plastic bag , so they can also give up buy their own car . the equal import reason is that the oil price skyrockt in the last year and the price are go to increas in the futur . it is just too expens to afford a car to the major of peopl becaus they have to use a lot of money to support their famili , to pay for the educ fee of their children , and to pay for the medic servic . they will choos to use public transport due to the higher and higher oil price . moreov , the govern is take great effort to build public transport . they use a larg number of money on develop more rail road , more buse to everi corner of the contri . and also metro have been built to eas the heavi traffic in more and more big citi . take into account of all the aspect mention abov , i am firmli convinc with the opinion that the number of car will reduc in twenti year .
