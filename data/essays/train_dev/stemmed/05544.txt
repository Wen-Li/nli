i clearli disagre with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour . i will explain you whi around three main point . first of all , in my opinion , i trulli think that trip prepar is a complet part of the travel experi . if you follow a group led by a tour guid , you will not be abl to discov the countri or citi you will visit in advanc . read , the lone planet , spend hour on googl watch for some advis on the best place to go is a great time . secondli , in a group led by a tour guid , you have to follow . for me , it mean that you are not free to do what you want , when you want . the worst thing is that they are tell you when you have free time ! in a trip , i go through a lot of differ mood . sometim i like move quickli from one place to an other , but sometim , and it happen quit often , it is real pleasur to relax , take time , and enjoy the moment . from my point of view it 's essenti to follow our rythm . last but not least , the departur and return flight are most of the time schedul in the middl of the night and in unknown airport . we all know that tour guid want to reduc cost and get a better rentabl . that is the reason whi , they prefer to chose big airplan charter with small seat to put more peopl in it . in addit they use small airport which are clearli cheaper . the travel becom painful , and it affect your trip appreci . that is whi , i disagre with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are mani other way to have a better time in a trip than thi one .
