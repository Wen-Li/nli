it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . becaus if have knowledg in all the subject we have lot of sope in the futur . we can go for ani job . if we are good in onli one subject we can not do thing in our life . it is better for the futur to have the knoeledg in all the subject . for exampl if we have bussi manag we cant do chemistri . so it better for us to have knowleg in all the subject . if u go for the job also we have to be good in all the subject . onli one specif subject can not help us in the futur becaus in certain area we should have to think what is good and what is bad . one subject give lot of confus in certain area . but if you have broad knowledg you can do better in your life . kowledg is like a god . becaus how much you studi it will benifit you . so it is better for us to have knowledg in all the subject rather in one . so in my opion it better to have broad knoeledg in comparit to one subject . if we want to do someth in our life so we have to learn everi subject . without do it we are the falilur . so we have to give the import to all the subject . without dont know the subject we can not do ani thing . we cant progreess in ani field . so it better us to studi all the subject so it may help us in the futur . therefor in all i have to say that it better to have knowledg of all the subject than to special in one specif subject . one knowled cant do ani thing . but broad knowledg of mani subject may help you done thing in your life . most of the richest man on the earth are educ in all the subject . so it better to eduact in all the subject .
