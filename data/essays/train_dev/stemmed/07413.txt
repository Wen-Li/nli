i total agre with the idea that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know to do well . most import thing in a life is improv and challeng and it help the person to success in the futur . eventhough it need high risk to do new thing , you realli shoud tri it . to improv your skill , carre , and knowledg , you have to challeng . the most person who success are the person who do not fear fail . the person who fear failng can not challeng new thing . i wa that kind of person when i came to america . i did not tri or challeng new thing . i did not speak english at all becaus i wa afread to fail and someon may laugh about my poor english . after few month , i realiz i wa wrong . in fact , although i live in america , my english were not improv at all . i start tri adopt new cultur and i recogn that how wnder english is . i am sure that tri new thing are tough and it need more power , but it will affect the person 's life . i believ that tring new thing is worth that take high risk . think about food compani . if the food compani stop to tri invent new food , peopl whould get bore about same food and the compani would bankrupt . we have to keep tring everi day in our life . that is the way how famou compani success have success . if you realli want to success , do not afraid fail , and think about onli improv yourself . the short cut to improv yourself is , of cours , challeng new thing .
