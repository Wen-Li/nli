do young peopl nowaday do n't spent enough time in help their commun ? i strongli agre with the speaker in few point . first of all , the youth nowaday simpli do not have to help their commun becaus of they lack the interest of their commun . becaus of the aris of the individu they now focu on their own self-interest and happi . we now see alot of young peopl just enjoy their life or prpare for their futur carreer . they do n't have time to look after their commun or those who are sick and poor . mani of them just simpli enjoy go to parti and get drunk and give their time in make girl-or-boy friend . second , the young nowaday do n't have time to help and particip in help their commun even though they are interest in help other . they are unfortuantley caught up in their school 's studi or assign in order to surviv in our over competiv societi . they get up earli in the morn for school and they might attend after school activ or academ insitut that will help their cours . mani young student work in a part-tim job to financ their tuition and board . lastli , even though some student do spend some time in help their commun , it is not a long term particip but becom more of an one time event without enthusiasim or passion . becaus of the econom growth and increas the notion of quailiti of life , they do n't feel the real need to help other who are disadvatag . they were hardli never in a situat when they hungri without food and with no place to sleep . thi might be a reason for them to actual not to have some sympathi toward help other which might make them less activ . in sum , becaus of the reason state abov i strongli think that the youth nowaday lack time , interest and effort in a long-term activ in help their communu .
