`` take risk and gainig success is a combin which connot be split , becaus one thing is the reason for the other one '' . thi wa nearli the first setenc i heard by my professor of econom . now , approxim 18 month after i heard thi statement , i am discuss the advantag and disadvantag of peopl who take risk and the effect thi ha on their success . i reckon that , as it can be observ in the global economi , busi just seem to work by take risk . therefor peopl like manag , who are involv in deciding-process , are respons for their decis . in some case they can be wrong , but in other , they are right and for be right they ear honour , apart from the money they get , which make them success even in anoth direct . if there were no peopl take these risk , our whole economi would not be so develop as it is , becaus without vision of peopl and their risk to put them into action , mani of us would not have a job for instanc . addit , i think that it is routin that make peopl sick of the life they live . peopl who alway do the same thing for year are often unsatisfi with their life . i would truli recommend those peopl to live their dream and to go for their goal , becaus everybodi ha vision and target , which are worth to be fought for . howev , in my opinion , everi chang is connect with a certain risk . consequ everyon should balanc if a new beginnig would lead to a better state of satisfact . it appear to me that success peopl nearli all share one common charact trait : their self-confid . self-confid is absolut a most for be success becaus there are alway hard situat and some peopl who do not make life easier for someon , who is progress of chang someth . final it want to support my argument by cite my own philosophi of life : `` by take risk , connect with a bit of luck , peopl can built a bridg from all the stone they get thrown on their track to success and satisfact .
