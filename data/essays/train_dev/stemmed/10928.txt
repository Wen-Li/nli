idea and fact are realli differ thing . idea explain someth that can be done or couldnt . becaus it is an onli idea . but fact is differ . fact must be done in real life . i think it is iport to learn fact than idea . becaus fact are real but idea are not . you can learn somuch idea about someth but you ca n't appli these idea in real life . it is not import if you do n't appli idea in real life . but if you know fact you can appli immedi when you hear idea . but if you know onli idea you cant do anyth in real life . for exampl an electron engin can know how televis work . but he/sh know onli idea that how it work . i think thi not import . in real life peopl dont pay attent idea . peopl pay attet fact . becaus fact are real and applic . peopl want to see someth . peopl dont want hear onli idea . if they see fact then peopl pay attent idea . and say `` ooo it is a good idea , congratul '' . it is wast of time to learn idea . if you learn fact you also learn idea background of thi fact . if we learn onli idea we must spend time to learn fact about thi idea . but we learn fact directli we also learn the idea . so we dont lose time . fact is gener . so when you learn fact about someth , you also learn idea about thi .
