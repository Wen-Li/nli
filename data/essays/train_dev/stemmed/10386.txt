the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' is veri true in my opininion . first , if thi sentenc is taken and place in a polit context , mani exampl appear that illustr the truth of the sentenc . for exampl , the late presid sadat of egypt introduc a new econom program to the countri call `` infitah '' in arab and which mean `` to be open '' in english . thi program wa new to the countri becaus it involv open trade with ani countri in the world , unlik the old system which wa a socialist or a close trade system . that system had mani critic at the time it wa adopt but sadat took the risk and implement the program which turn to be a great econom success for the countri . second , the statement is true when look at it from a busi point of view . for exampl , bill gate , the owner of microsoft , tri a lot of new thing and invent a lot of softwar that turn out to be veri success although there were great risk for it failur at the beginin . moreov , the word `` innov '' is use by mani busi nowaday to illustr thier belief in new thing and anyth new must have great risk at first . major compani have entir depart direct for research and develop , also call `` r & d , '' and they spend huge amount of money to fund these depart . therefor , the busi enviro believ that new thing lead the way for profit and thu success . in conclus , i total agre with the statement becaus it could be appli in ani context and found to be true . be innov in ani aspect , whether in polit , econom , or busi , will deffinetli lead to success but with great risk involv .
