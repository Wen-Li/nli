i disagre with the statement becaus i do n't think two peopl 's experi of joy of life can be compar , be they young or be they old . but i would like to consid thi intrigu question by look at the develop of my person enjoy of life . from my own experi of now 32 year in thi life , i believ that the qualiti of life 's experi chang over time even for a singl person . consequ , i enjoy life veri differ today than 25 year ago , i.e. some thing i found pleasur in as a child are today meaningless or bore , such as hour on the playground , or even repuls , of which i will not give exampl . instead , there are mani new thing i discov , such as read book , travel , profession achiev , make love or medit , which i would not have enjoy much as a kid . besid enjoy differ activ , the feel of happi or joy itself ha evolv . i recal happi as a kid as more immedi , combin with less awar of such a state of emot , while happi today is often someth i regist while enjoy it . the intens of either kind of happi can be overwhelm , while each feel correspond to the degre of matur i have reach . there are some thing i fear will get lost will grow old , such as curios , spontan , mental agil and physic fit , which i consid import driver of joy in life . howev , there are some capabl or asset that i will onli have fulli develop or built when older , such as patienc , more refin sens ( includ humour ) , but also famili and a strong social network or person relationship . especi friend and famili are sourc of joy i expect to compens for the loss of those other spring of bliss which will probabl loos import over time . i do n't think young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl or vice versa , i think both have to work hard to make most out of it and find the right way to get the most out of the chang condit under which we go through life . if success , life can be enjoabl all along .
