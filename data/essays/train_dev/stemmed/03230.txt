peopl do not alway reach success by tri new thing and take risk , even though sometim it is necessari . if someon ha the formula for success , whether he/sh found it or is given by the environ , he/sh should not chang it unless want or push to do so . carlo ancelotti , coach of ac milan , an italian soccer team that ha won sever tournament and award under hi guid , declar on the day befor the final of the champion leagu `` a team that win never chang ( set up ) . '' the next day , use the same player as the previou game , ac milan won the champion leagu , the most prestigi tournament in soccer . just like carlo ancelotti suggest , someth success should often remain uncorrupt to succeed again . not everyon , though , alreadi ha thi oppurtin in his/her life . thi is the case when a person should shold tri new thing and take risk . for instanc , consid a larg and profit factori , the son of the boss will not have troubl in order to reach work success ( consid thi is the kind of success he is look for ) as hi eritag includ a busi alreadi start and well run , but one of the worker in the factori ha great manual skill , but in the factori he doe not gain much profit and doe not fulli use the resourc he ha . if he never took a risk and never tri anyth new , he would alway work in the same factori and hardli reach success . instead , if he decid to start hi own activ , take the risk that such a choic bring , he would have a much larger chanc to succeed . nevertheless , look at the societi in a bigger scale , risk might be necessari to succeed and develop . in fact there is one import factor to consid : competit . the push forc for mani peopl is often other candid , who tri to reach success by do someth innov . unfortn , there are time where the success of one is the unsuccess of other . thi cycl infact is infinit . the posit aspect of thi situat is that the societi will alway offer newer and more innov thing . therefor success is not alway found by do someth new and take risk , bet there are time where the situat requir it .
