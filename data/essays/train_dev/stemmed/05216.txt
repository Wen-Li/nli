i disagre to the statement that young peopl enjoy their life more , as the older peopl were also young at some point of their life and henc they have gone through what a younger gener is go through , but time play an import role in the enjoy of life and also what an individu ha the imag of enjoy of life in hi mind . firstli , it is correct that young gener is enjoy the life more than the older at that time but as the time pass the young gener ha to enter the older gener and that same young gener now again take some pleasur in enjoy life in older age also thu if we calcul the enjoy by compar the older person to young one then we will find that older one ha enjoy more on the scale of time . secondli , everi person ha it own defin of enjoy in life , some might feel like their are enjoy life if the go for long drive or spend time in travel and explor the huge world , while some might feel that they are enjoy thier life by just chill around their love one and spend time in chat , email play game etc. now thi type of enjyoment are not defin for some particular age ani one can get thi enjoy at anytim of thier life . thu the older and younger genrat can enjoy to the same type of enjoy . thirdli , everi person ha hi own set of think of enjoy and as the young gener is unawar of enjoy he is go to get in hi futur life , he is more excit and readi to enjoy the life at everi part of hi life , which wa the same feel that an old gener ha gone through . moreov now all the enjoy that a young genrat doe are aslo tri and enjoy by the older peopl , thu they have present life of enjoy in old age and also had the enjoy dure thier young age , but the current younger genrat ca n't go back in time and enjoy the moment that the older gener ha experienc , but will have some differ experi of enjoy of life for their come younger gener . also , even if the young gener is young and can do mani thing that older ca n't but there are some thing that younger genrat doe not have is the experi of the enjoy which had been to the older gener , for young gener the enjoy ha just begin but for the older one it is come to it end and thu they have far more enjoy than the current younger gener . thu altogeth the younger gener also enjoy the life but the enjoy that he ha experienc ha also been experiec by the older genrat and the defin of enjoy chang from person to person .
