in the 1960 , taylor made it apparit . taylor like fordism were new organiz stuctur for enterpris , where each employe wa special in one task . the consequens of thi new type of organ led to the increas of the turnov of compani . but can we state that special in knowledg is better than broad knowledg of mani subject ? special in one specif subject can be realli an advantag , in my opinion , when the subject is a rare one . moreov , i believ that for a veri specif and detail subject , someon who is interest to make it hi profess , should special hi self as much as he can . i explain thi posit by the fact that for rare subject where few peopl have the knowledg and onli few peopl can work on it , special will be the main advantag in front of competitor in the same domain . the special can present , in contradictori with the previou paragraph , some disadvantag . inde , by special ourselv , we can adapt to a new job with more difficulti . flexibl and the abil to adapt is one the main criteria for manag . furthermor , in manag , be special in an industri , a type of job , a depart or a task make us too difficult to chang job and can be a constraint for our evolut in the compani . we need to special ourselv , but not too much otherwis we becom rigid . in conclus , i believ that we need to have a balanc between special and broad knowledg of mani academ subject . we have to find the correct balanc between the two in order to be flexibl and adapt , in order to be abl to respons to ani problem that appear but also specialiaz in one topic to have the best knowledg in front of competitor .
