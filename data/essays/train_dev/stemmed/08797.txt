i agre the statement that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' becaus gener peopl want to visit differ place to relax themselv and want to know more about differ place . if they wont keep tour guid they take much time to know about the place . at the same time if a person goe alon to visit the place , he doesnt get interest to watch the palc and he cant express hi idea , thought about the palc what he see . if it is the case , that he travel along the group and with tour guid , make the peopl tour success and happi becaus the tour guid can explain about the place briefli and interestingli provid a well knowledg tour guid . if the person travel along the group he can have a advantag to express hi view and get other view about thr place they see . gener tour are includ with long time night and day journey . at thi time tour guid can where to stop the vehicl for emerg and where should not . at the same time if anyth happen to anyon , other can help out in solv the problem they face . by travel in a group along with tour guid they can help out each other and they can make thier most success . dure journey , they face mani problem like food , shelter for chang cloth etc . if the peopl go tour along group they can help out in provid shelter , food and other small and big problem . if suddenli vehicl break down and if it take few hour to repair then they can have nice time with thier mate . simpli they pass the time happili and unforgett . anyway that all depend on the individu but go along with group make the individu to see the thing happili and great scope to have good knowledg on place what they see . if we take an exampl of industri tour of engin student like tata motor in india etc . there i defin prefer to go along with group becaus they have to recollect their subject when they see the industri . at the same time your professor act as tour guid . no one can recollect the inform at that moment what they studi but if you go with a group they can share their own knowleg with other such that they can see the thing more interstingli and gain more knowledg . similarli if a offic staff want to improv thier industri , there it is need to visit higher industri and should make point what should improv in their industri . thi is possibl onli when he goe along with teammat and guid . he can point out veri good thing if he discuss the thing with hi mate . at the same he need not to spend much time to know the unknown thing as guid is provid for them . thu i can strongli agre that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guid .
