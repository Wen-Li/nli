i think that is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact , becaus onc they have clear in their mind the concepst about some articl , call scienc , mat , phycolog , ani thing tha they are learn , it is posibl to follow up with the learn procecess . i completli agre , when i have idea of what my professror is talk about , when i comprhend the base of ani discout , is the point to open the door to the understatndin and after , i can memor and learn the fact . mani time student , includ myself , are seet in a class , where the professor is show the fact , but seem like professor and student most forget that how can you have an exampl or talk about a fact with out understand the mean idea . i am in a nurs class for exampl , if i do not understand the idea or concept about the heart mechan , how the heart work , how the blood it is pump , thens i will never underst the fact tha a patient is have a heart attack due to high blood pressur . it is realli import for ani student , of ani profet , for ani area of life , to understand firt the idea , the concept , it is the idea that show up first in our brain , that make us think , is those thougth that motiv us to find the fact , i think the fact should follow a good understand of the idea , final if a student is in a class with out undestend idea , is better to ask question , express themself about how they fell , and have some help with book , web , or talk with the tacher , it is better understand than learn fact , onc i understand , the rest is easi .
