the question ask about tecqnolog . in my opinion academ subjectsi better to have borad knowledhg than special in one specif subject . there are severl reason show at the bottom , whi i disagre . first , the world is develop realli fast . a centri ago peopl think specif subject is more import than acadam subject . also number of peopl still think specif subjuct is more import than academ subject . i would say that is wrong . if you have job like writer , music job , artist or singer that migt better to have broad knowledg of may specif subject . but the world is develop realli fast peopl need to follow the tecqnolog . there are how to learn mani academ subject . school in one of good case . most of high school in korean which i wa from , learn more mathemath , physic , chemistri , biolog or comput . i believ the school is better to learn knowledg than other . second , i will give a differ exampl about korea korea ha good it tecqnolog . so most of peopl work in comput part or scienc part . there are severl exampl about academ knowledg . the compani need employe also the employe have to have enough knoledg . in case i have a comput compani . i need a 5 peopl need to work in my factori which make cpu . most of peopl know what is cpu some are not . peopl call cup is the brain in comput which mean it is the most import part in comput . so i need to make the most import part , need to find peopl learn about ' how to make cpu ' . befor learn that subject they need a lot of inform about compter , that have to learn in high school but it might be a basic thing . go to far , unibers or colloag . good unibers or colloag need high grade . most of cours in high school are academ subject . world is develop peopl need to follow that other way we can not develop more and more . what i am say now is the learn . in the learn i am say ` academ subjects'
