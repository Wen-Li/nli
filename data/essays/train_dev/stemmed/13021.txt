my opinion about the have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better tahn the special i one specif subject is that broad knowledg is much better for our studi than the one specif subject , which reason includ that broad knowledg could open our horizen about the whole studi and we could have wider rangesfor us to choos our major through studi broad knowledg . in morden time , mani job need variou knowleg becaus the matter requir complet abil and broad knowledg which content mani academ suject , such as math , physic and chemsitri could provid a broader knowledg for us which one specif subject could not . for exampl , if we are a lawyer , we not onli use the knowledg about the law , we still need the knowledg about the ecnormi and humann . we would benif from broader knowlwdg in our work . it provid us more inform when we should solv a problem . furthermor , we would choos our major from what we learn in the school and studi broad subject widern the rang for us to choos . what i meet now is that which major i should choos . though i have alreadi studi some subject , i still do not figur out which major suit me best . thi is an import aspect becaus i should use the knowleg about my major after graduat and i would earn money by work thi field . if i choos the wrong major becaus of lack interest and unabbl to studi , i could not rasi myself in the futur . broad knowledg make me confort to choss the one i like best and studi my major well . to sum up , though one specif subject is a skill for cerntain peopl to use like paint , i still draw the conclut that broad knowledg is better than one specif subject . time to sleep , bye .
