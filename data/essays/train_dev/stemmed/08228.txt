ye , i do agre with the topic that young peopl enjoy life more than the older peopl . thi topic is veri interest one becaus mani peopl maynot agre with my view . life is not as it wa some year ago , it ha becom veri fast pace . due to thi even the stress level have increas , so it is difficult for the older one to surviv . the older peopl are not abl to compet with their younger rival . thi mean they are not abl to enjoy their work or the sucess it bring . so it would be fair to say the young are abl to enjoy life more . sometim back i read in a novel that alexand could pursu hi plan vigour onli due to hi youth . from histori , we do know that the great emperor trajan lament that he could do nomor conquest due hi old age . so thi show that in order to do most of the thing in life we need youth . so to even enjoy life and it 's pleasur we need youth . we have read in numer stori that men have been search for the elixir of youth to stay young forev . even mani of the modern day research are go on to slow the age process and it 's effect , billion of dollar are be spent on it . to do mani adventur in life also we need youth . youth is a divin gift which must not be wast becaus you ca n't get it back . so we must finish import thing in life when we have youth els we are too late . so thi is my person opinion . i am not say that oldag is a curs or anyth rather that youth is a bless , so we have to use to the maximum i.e , enjoy life when we have the youth so we wo n't regret in our oldag .
