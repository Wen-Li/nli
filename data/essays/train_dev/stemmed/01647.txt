i am disagre with thi statement . if you learn with statement it will be more simpl to learn and archiev in the mind . you can learn for what you need that for , see what is the import to learn , situat , will not be onli idea , concept and theori . it will be more fun for student . when a math teacher give the class the student dont know for what they have to learn that thay alway say is `` for what i need to learn that i dont go to be a cpa '' . but if they teach the kid the fact for what the need to learn that , the import to need that to be someon in the world . they onli learn the concept take the exam get an a and then what . they go out to difficult world without know for what they are go to use the concept . that is one of the big problem of the us nation , what i 'm go to studi now ? . million of student graduat everi year without know what they are go to studi . brilliant student work in foodcourt , whi ? becaus they know to much they graduat with 4.00 point but they dont know where to go know . that orient doe n't exist , that whi i think that the best way to a student can learn is by fact , so he can know befor he goe out from school in what he is good for .
