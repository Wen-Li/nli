regard to the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than the older one , i hold the view thi is true . regard to my opinion young peopl today have a lot more possibl to creat their life . first they have the opportun to go long to school and afterward studi whatev they want to . older peopl never had thi great opportun , nor the money for such a comfort life . second is the creation of the wide rang of spare time activ . there are so mani new possibl what one can do in leisur time , which have not exist in the time when the older peopl were young , and what they now can not do ani longer becaus of health problem . the varieti goe from sport , cultur , travel to visit friend in a foreign countri . from thi i want to move to the next point : foreign studi . younger peopl do n't even have the great oppotun to studi , but also the chanc to do thi in a foreign countri of their choic . thi is an import extraordinari experi , which ha a great impact on the later life . live in a countri for a period of time is someth els than bee on vacat . the young have the opportun to learn realli from other cultur an so probabl develop a differ view about mani thing in earli year of their life . older one can do thi after year of work and ca n't take the chanc in that way . but one ha also take into account the carreer chanc offer to the young peopl . with the money from the parent it is possibl to live in a big citi whre mani great compani are . so they have a greater chanc to move from home to anoth citi and live independ . to conclud , one can say there are variou thing what make the life for young peopl easier and more comfort than in the past and even in the futur for the older peopl of our societi .
