nowaday , one must consid about the develop of transit method in 20 year . will car be such import than today or will they lose their signific and replac by other kind of movement ? will it be possibl to use a car in twenti year , at all ? when you take a closer look to that question , you will realiz that the human popul on earth is grow rapidli and thu the demand for car will increas , too . furthermorem , product cost on car will decreas becaus of the grow global , so price for car decreas and more and more peopl can afford them . moreov , anoth import fact is that our knowlwdg on new technolog is grow veri rapidli , as well . mayb a total new kind of a car will be invent and everyon want to buy one . when i take a look on the street of my hometown i do not see ani car older than a few year . thu , the quantiti of car will not decreas . but there are also argument which support the statement abov . oil is more and more get shorter . in a few year there will be much shortag on oil so ga will get more and more expens . the poor peopl on earth will not be abl to spend their whole money on ga so the quantiti of car in use on earth could decreas . furthermor if there are no invent which make it possibl to reduc air pollut caus by car there will be probabl some restrict relat to car product to slow down chang in our climat . all in all , my opinion is that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use becaus oil will definitli get short . there are no sign that the car build industri will make such a new invent which chang our live - relat to car - signific .
