almost everyon , from a seventeen year old teenag to an old man of 60 , ha the experi of tri new thing and take risk . it seem to me , after 18 year of experi , that peopl who are success are tend to challeng the tradit idea and to take risk to obtain the success . and i 'm go to approach my idea in the follow three way . first of all , new thing bring a entir differ area to the businessmen which nobodi ever enter befor and therefor draw a lot of attent attent from peopl . the founder of walmart , sam walton , is a good exampl of open a new busi area and made millon of money from it . sam walton creat a lot of new way to make hi shop differ . for exampl , he made the consum be abl to choos all the thing they need first and pay for them togeth at the end of shop . it is so conveni for constom that peopl like walton 's way of seel thing and rush to hi shop to shop . consequ , new idea will give the businessman a new chanc to exhibit it product in a differ and attract way . equal import , new thing can give peopl a drive . sinc the idea never appear befor , the person will be excit about it . thi kind of emot would motiv the boss as well as the staff . compar to the old way of accomplish a goal , take a risk is more fun and amus . in consequ , peopl may get more profit from do a differ way becaus they energet and interest . lastli , busi peopl will be more and more difficult to get profit if they keep on do it the same way . sinc the old way is prove to be effect , more and more peopl will tri to use the same way and as a result , they are not go to get a good profit . in contrast , challeng the old way of deal with busi will provid the person more chanc to be profit . accordingli , peopl who want to get an success should tri to oper the busi in a new way . there are sever other reason relev to the problem under discuss while , unfortun , i do n't have enough time to explor them in detail . neverthless , the abov three point should in a larg sens calrifi my idea that success peopl tend to tri new idea and challeng the old way .
