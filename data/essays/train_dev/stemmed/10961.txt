i disagre with thi becaus the thought doe not exactli consid the situat of young peopl nowaday in the modern commun . and realli doe not have support for it arguement . it will be accept if propos that thi is a gener situat for all peopl but not for onli young peopl . in the day we live life is get harder for all , live is seem to be get harder . peopl have certain need to surviv like food , hous and such like thing . moreov if the person is the onli worker in the famili and have kid she or he ha more respons . despit thi most of them realli tri to work harder to help their commun awar of that if thair commun doe not exist thi will also be the end of them and their children . as in my situat although peopl need to work to earn money for them and their famili to live they spend all their energi to dig all the ground to live . but in such a bad condit too , they tri to help other in the commun . i have mani friend that can run to help anybodi that they do not even know befor . a short time ago one my friend saw somebodi shot in the middl of the street , after the voic and overcom the shock he ha he run to help the man who wa shot . after hi attempt everybodi in the street came there to help . in such a danger situat too you can find more peopl than you aspect . they creat group and team to particip in social work to help improv commun . we have one of thi team . and in thi group i have met mani peopl full of desir to chang to condit not onli for them in a selfish way but also for their commun and for the human be too spend a realli much time for onli those kind of thing . thi sentenc ha absolut judg doe not mean sens to me . as have such experi i can not accept thi thought .
