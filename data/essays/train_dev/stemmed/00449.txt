in my opinion , both can be posit . the situat determin if continu do thing you know is the better way or if tri new way leed to more success . if you for exampl run a busi like a bar , which ha a lot of confid custom who are absolut satisfi with the atmospher , the furnitur , the menu and the servic , you would not realli thing about chang anyth . chang thi alreadi well work bar would alway mean you risk lose costum who may dislik the chang , and it will also cost you a lot of money . but if you run a bar where custom keep complain about thing , you may veri well consid chang someth and becom more success do so . on the other hand , i think that even when you run a busi which alreadi seem to be perfect , it is never a bad thing to dare someth new , becaus the world is chang so whi should you refus chang ? as a bar owner , i would rather prefer to lose some bore , old custom to serv open-mind new custom insta , just becaus it is more excit . it is clear that decid someth new is alway riski , but that is what an excit life is a about . in addit to that tri new thing mean that you make a lot of new experi . be experienc will never be a bad thing when it come to be success . you probabl have dealt with a lot of problem in your life if you have had a lot of differ experi , so you know better how to handl them then somebodzi unexperienc would . thi is whi i would prefer tri new thing in order to gain a lot of experi .
