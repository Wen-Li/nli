i do n't agre that 's true . young peopl are just tri to enjoy their live . they can not enjoy their live easili . they olni enjoy a littl in their freetim . there are a few reason whi they do n't enjoy good enough . first , they have a lot to do . they have to studi more and more . they have to go school for their futur . if they do n't studi , they ca n't get the garranti for the futur . a lot of new knowlodg come up to the world everyday . if they want to win the compitit , they have to studi more and more . that 's the way to surviv . second , they do not have enough money to enjoy . in gener when they want to do someth fun , they need money . if they travel their countri , they need money . whatev they want to do , they need money , except the part-tim job they want . the last reason is the ton of item to enjoy . now they have a lot of thing to have fun . some young poepl get confus among them . they do not even know what and how to enjoy . the flood of thing to enjoy can make them hesit what to choos . if so , can older peopl enjoy their live well ? my answer is `` ye '' there are some reason to say that . first , older peopl have enough time to enjoy . if they retir from their job , they can do . they do not spend their pretti much time to prepar fot the futur . they can just onli enjoy their live . second , they have money . when they retir , they get some money from their compani , or they can reciev money even from revers mortagag . in conclus , older peopl can enjoy their live more comforbl and easili than young peopl .
