i completley disagre with the statment present in thi section . to poss ani form of knowleg is an advantag for ani individu . howev , state that it is better to have broad knowledg in mani subject as oppos to special in one subject is a complet error . there are mani reason which serv to justifi thi claim . one , reason which serv as a contradict to the claim present in thi write section is if everyon had a `` broad knowledg in mani subject '' there would be no one to special in specif subject and thi would hinder ani advanc in subject that are not studi specif . the statement that have knowledg in one specif subject as be less benefici then have knowledg in mani subject greatli contradict the way our world oper today . if in today 's world we did n't have peopl who master and speciff look into subject where would we be in term of advanc . for exampl , when look at an individu who specialilz in comput , if they had just had knowledg in mani academ subject then how can we see ani potenti for improv . when an individu special in a field or subject they contribut to the advanc and discoveri , which in the long-run will benifet our societi as a whole . anoth exampl which may be includ to illustr the contradict of the statement present in thi section is if everyon `` onli had a broad knowledg of mani subject '' then where would we be in the medecin field . with an increas in diseas and virus in today 's world it is necessari to special in specif subject , that way we can improv the societi we live in . to have a broad knowledg in mani subject , and no specif knowledg in some subject would be a disast to mankind . thi is becaus you would have to pictur a world with no technolog , no medicen advanc and a world void of what our societi need to prosper and becom a better place .
