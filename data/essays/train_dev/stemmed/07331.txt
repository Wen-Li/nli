although mani peopl think that there is noth to worri while there is a guid . he would be respons for all the need they want . i person disagre with the assert that to go with a tour guid is the best way to travel . first of all , travel with a group could wast much time wait for other person . and it is veri unconveni to go trevel with a lot of peopl , especi they are all stranger to me . there will be sever rule that you should follow . it is not romanc and happi at all . second , the tour guid often want to have a abound impress that all the peopl in the group . the plcae are arrang too much ; in the end , there alway no enough time to spend on each place the group been . i could not rememb or exper the environ where i onli spend five minut to stay with . i need more time and enjoy the differ between where i live . last but not least , i have heard more than one time that peopl have the same impress about the same countri they have been . it is becaus the guid alway take peopl to the same place . for exampl , it is the same that the pictur of my friend and my parent which they took at frenc , onli the face are differ . howev , i want someth more than all the peopl 's experi . to see the real thing happen in the foreign coutri is more attract than the photo on the post card . in conclus , it is not interest at all if i can not decid where i want to go . the most interest part of travel is to studi the countri and decid where to go , and it would be better if there are some thing unexpect happen . go with a group is defin mot one of my choic .
