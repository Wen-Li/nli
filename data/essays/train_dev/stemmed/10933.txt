in my opinion , be an specialist in specif subject is much more import than have a broad knowledg . that 's becaus modern societi want specialist . at the previou time , such as 19 centuri , slight and broad inform about all rang of academ subject would make out effici solut and perspect view of the problem . but the world ha chang . we can get that kind of knowledg in internet , veri easili . it 's not wealth anymor . so , have a normal knowledg about all over the academ subject can not make you a need person . when you were teenag , school ( or teacher ) teach you all kind of subject such as english , mathmat , biolog , art , etc . but when you get in to univers , you have to choos your major and studi deepli in that part . whi the educ programm is chang gener thing to specif thing ? univers make a leader not a just normal citizen . when you roll as a leader , you need a special knowledg about your major . the societi goe to divers , they need an specialist on sever part to solv complex problem . so the import of specialist is emphras . if you want to be a need person , you have to studi your own subject , and be specialist . that way will make you wealth peopl .
