in my opinion it 's better to have a knowledg of mani academ subject . becaus , when you are a student , you ca n't reali know what kind of job you will do dure all your life . so , i think it 's import to learn differ topic . it could permit you to have more chanc in the market job . inde , now it 's becom reali difficult to find a good job , so you have to be good on your major but you need also a gener cultur . for exampl , i have work in a bank dure a month , and the director told me the gener cultur wa veri import in particular when you are in the top of the societi . beceaus if you do n't have a gener cultur , the person with who you will conver will take you for someon who is just interest on hi own , for someon who is not interest by what it 's happen over the world . my second argu is the fact in our societi , we do n't do dure all our life the same job . so if you want to be abl to find an other job without ani relat with the first , and if you just have learn one topic dure all you studi , it will be hard to find thi other job . you can tell me some peopl know sinc they are littl what tyey want to do , but now , you have to take in acount all other peopl . inde , today , mani peopl move around the world and consequ their are more competit between appliant . to conclu , i think it 's import , now to be awar on the world , and to be it , you have to know mani differ inform . .. you had learn by take differ subject dure your studi .
