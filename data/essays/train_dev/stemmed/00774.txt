i agre with thi statement . young peopl can do what ever they want . the old peol cant judj them becus they are young . they can go to club , date weman , danci with everyon , and the youn peopl cant finguer the life in thi age . i think when they coumplet 25 year old mybe he can finguer how it the life hard and how can handdl with it . the old peopl take everi thing responsbl and they cannt joke in everi thing as young peopl . the old peopl love quit place and stay alon sometim . they just talk about the past and what did they do in them life . but the young peopl can joke in everi thing and they can talk with you about what ever you want . but if the young peopl dont know what you aer talk about they will not join in the counverst . the old peopl they talk about everi thing and they think they knew everi thing in the life . the young peopl travel to enjoy in their life and they want to know about the other counter . the old peopl feel lazi and hate travel or go ani where . if you ask ani old person about what wa the best age you enjoy your time ? . i think almost of them will answer when they were young and when they did everi thing in their life . the young peopl know that when they come old they cant do what they are do in them age now .
