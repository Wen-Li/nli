i will be honest , i never thought about such a topic if there will be fewer car in use in some year . i can not total agre with thi statement becaus therefor the other possibl are too bad that so mani peopl will not use their car anymor . more or less , the onli thing here in germani is the `` deutsch bahn '' and a lot of peopl are not so happi with thi compani becaus you never can be sure if your train arriv or not . in comparison to thi , there are a few compani where you can come to work when you like to come and not everyon is abl to chang the hous for the job . as well , i can not total disagre with thi statement becaus there are step which will offer you better possibl to get from point a to point b but thi have to be cheap in addit , the new trend from peopl is to live for the natur and futur . furthermor , it stop the pollut if there are less car in use and you do not have to spent so much money in oil , ga and secur . not everybodi will be abl to pay for a car in a few year . becaus of never think about thi topic , i wa a littl bit confus but i think there will be less car in a few year . if f.i. the deutsch bahn get it und will be more punctual and have special offer that mean that it is cheaper than have a car , then it is possibl that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year . in germani there are more and more offer to get to anoth place f.i. there is a page in the internet where you put in the date , time and place when you want to go anywher and there are peopl who catch you and take you with them to your place for not pay a lot of money .
