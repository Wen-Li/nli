in my opinion there are two type of student ; one is learn by search the issu deepli and the other give up search when they understood the idea and concept but it doe not mean that to learn fact 's not import for student than understand idea and concept . tri to understand the fact behind the particular issu help student to get a wider view about that issu . thi kind of behaviour also help student to learn question the reason of event which are effect whole live of them . but on the other hand to give up follow the fact can not help us respond the problem . by thi way accept the result becom easier than solv the problem . i can easili assert that understand of fact is as import as import understand the idea becaus by question the event understand also becom more easier . i mean that onli understand the concept can not improv knowledg by itself also the import of learn fact is great . so i can easili say that mani time a student should want to learn the intuit lie behind the concept . it is like a sens of wonder and it is like a mean for develop or improv in life . educ system also ha a great affect to make student notic the import of learn fact or reason dure their educ period . becaus the strategi that they are taught in the school age will also effect the way of think dure their live . so an educ system should teach student to search a concept or an idea befor accept the it directli . on the other hand it doe not mean that understand is not as import as learn fact . it 's like a chain and should follow each other . i mean that after understand the concept or idea the other import process should be appli which is learn the intuit behind particular issu . consequ i am not agre with the follow statement that understand idea and concept are more import than learn fact for student . process of learn fact is also veri import for student . such a kind of learn strategi can lead to success in mani area in their live of student .
