car can be directli link to energi and pollut . which mean that by use car , we improv the air pollut . but it onli concern the action of the consum , as far as the produc are concern , it is more obviou . thi industri activ is point out by everi environment associ even if huge firm such as gener motor are concern . thi pressur is part of the fight for the decreas of the use of car and of pollut in gener . pollut , it effect on earth , peopl who fight against the develop of car activ and the new mean of substit which are creat to replac the mean of travel are they not way to make car disappear . the natur resourc which are use to make a car drive is petrol . the recent financi event underlin the fact that thi product is harder to get and more expens abov all . it is necessari to find other carbur for exampl natur oil . but it is forbidden in a lot of industrialis countri and the need would veri import , it is not sure that everi car could be provid with thi element . instead of find other resourc to suppli the car chain , it may be interest to find other way of travel . moreov these way alreadi exist . bu , subway , even plane are mean of travel which can be use in a lot of area . some govern tend to develop these collect way of transport . in franc especi in pari , for exampl , they are some day when peopl are not allow to use their car in town . accord to me thi kind of action have sever impact . it reduc pollut in town , but it also make the popul awar that there is no need for a car in day to day life . for all these reason i think that car will not complet disappear in twenti year , but there will be differ mean of travel and certainli more ecolog way of use car .
