i complet agre with thi statement . i think it is veri import for a human to make , to teri new thing in their life . sometim it may be veri riski , but we do n't have anoth life , so will not lose anyth with tri . make chang is alway good for us . thi chang can be a veri big one or a small one . it is same in all field of our life . let 's say that i am attend a research program . and i have an idea that may effect thi research but i am not sure about it . if there is no anoth chanc , i will to that thing , regard the risk that a becam face to . i may be success or not . but if i at least tri i will not loos anyth . we have to encourag ourself to tri new thing . it is our life . no matter what other peopl say , for exampl some peopl look us like a crazi person , but i thing it is worth to tri . if we do n't tri new thing we will stay where we are all of our life time . doe it realli enjoy ? no , i do n't think so . i actual think taht do the same thing everyday take peopl 's all happi . i think that the person who doe n't afraid of take risk is the successful person wheter he/sh succeed or not . take risk make the most import chang in a person 's life . it 's like stay or go , do or not . even if we make a bad decis with take a risk , if you are still aliv after that , than noth is over . you can start again where you left , but not take the same risk . we can not just take a risk to prove our encourag . we take risk when we beleiv that it might effect our life posit . so , take risk and make new chang in our life is good , but in my opinion we have to think twice befor make a decis
