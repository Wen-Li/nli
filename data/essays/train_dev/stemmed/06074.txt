travel inde play an import part in peopl live . by travel , one can enjoy the peac natur or to experi the life of peopl in differ countri . some peopl would like to travel along or with friend while other perfer to have a tour . as far my concern , i think to have the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , for it ha mani advantag compar with no guid . first , if you are go to a place which ha some protenti danger dure the visit , you will definitatli need some help . for instanc , mountain claimb , it can be veri danger when you walk on a unknown high mountain and without a peopl who fimilar with thi area . a guid can certain garante a safe and happi trip . also , a guid can provid you more detail about the place you visit which map ca n't tell you . i wa onc vist a small town in sichuan , china . after walk pass all locat on map , the guid told us there is an beauti lake at the end of the road . when we finnal arriv there , everi peopl includ me were shock by the unbeliev beauti view there . i 'm sure that i 'll regret if we did n't ask for a guid at the trip . finnal , if you are go to visit a new countri and want to experi the local cultur by yourself , a tour guid in that place is inevitiblli need . by hi or her introduct , you can easili talk and even live with local peopl . addmitidli , travel with no guid can give you more free choic . but from that ha been discuss abov we can safe come to the conclut that to have a tour guid when you travel can provid a better tirp . becaus it is safe and can give you more happi .
