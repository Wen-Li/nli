i believ that best way to travel is to travel alon . most importantli , thi give us an opportun to explor the place on our own pace . we do n't have to rush to keep up with the travel schedul provid by the tour guid especi when we want to do someth els or want to be at a place where other are not interest and therefor not cover in the travel plan . in thi situat , travel alon mani turn out to be more product and fun fill leav more time to spend at the place which captiv our interest . in addit , we do n't have to compromis our prefer over the major becaus the main aim of the group travel is to satisfi the major rather than take care of individu which some peopl are expect to compromis . for an exampl , if the group decid to go to an art museum , while my interest lie somewher els say a tech museum at the other corner of the citi . there is no way both could fit into the schedul thu result in compromis on my part which is not accept to me . the peopl who prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guid can argu that guid can offer us valuabl detail about the place . but there are other way to get the same inform such as internet which provid almost everi detail one might expect to know about a place such as sightse locat , restaur , import festiv that might coincid with your travel date and so on . thu , it virtual ellimin the import of tour guid . moreov , travel alon also offer an uniqu opportun to mingl with the nativ which almost imposs if we travel in a group . i describ thi as uniqu becaus spend time with the nativ is the best way to learn about their cultur , custom , eat habit and other import characterist not visibl otherwis . they can also give us valuabl inform about the monument found in the area such as background histori , the reason behind their construct , etc . though , there are a few advantag of a group travel , i prefer to travel alon as it offer the flexibl which is of foremost import to me .
