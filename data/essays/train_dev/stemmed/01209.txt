must peopl tri new thing and take rik in order to get success ? in my opinion the answer to thi question in a world that is chang all day is `` ye '' , for the next reason . first , thi is a learn world . i mean , a lot of knownleg and inform is produc everyday , so the peopl who want to sucess they have to be avial learn new thing everi day . some reacher are found that the peopl must chanc thier major aor carrer unleast one time in thier life . second , in busi are a lot of stori where the peopl that do n't take a risk and chanc , lost a lot of money . besid , the peopl who innov ha success . exampl of that are the transistor in the electron busi and the digit watch , that bring to japan to the first world after the second world war . other contri with more avantag than japon did not want to take the risk . japan did it and now it is the one of the most import econom in the world . also , it is easi to find a lot of person stori of succ around new tecnolog and internet . yahoo , googl and you tube base their success in a strang idea , work with out direct pay . so they offer a lot of servic like mail , search inform and host web page and video without a reciv ani pay for that . they peopl who creat the web portal take the risk and everybadi know the stori they made a lo of millon of dollar . in the other hand , for each one of the peopl that take risk and becom a success peopl a lot of peopl fail . so take a risk it is n't a warranti to success . but what i can say is that everi success peopl had take a risk and tri new thing .
