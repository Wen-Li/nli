coca cola 's new product , cocacola zero , announc some month ago with huge advertis , provoqu a great echo all over the world . a sweet nutrit without sugar , that wa the strategi to sell a popular product in even greater amount . but in my opinion , the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are is true in mani case . advertis argu that the qualiti of the product they want to sell is better than that of all other produc , but it is avail at the same or even a lower price . the consequ i draw out of thi strategi are firstli , the product cost were reduc or , secondli , the qualiti of the product is not as good as the advertis want to tell us . regard sugar free product , for exampl , it is clear that an artifici substanc ha to replac the sugar by keep the tast . then the product may be sugar free , but ad with mani artifici ingredi which are not mention or written on a place hard to be seen by the custom . as a second exampl , i will mention shortli the consequ of advertis deni the real qualiti of the product by regard cosmet product . especi young peopl who have problem with their skin are attract by advertis which promis to help them with a product wich cost less than other but ha better impact on the skin . in the meantim , the ingredi of thi product do not help or have even neg effect the custom do not get to know by read the instruct . so young peopl trie one product after anoth just follow the fals promis of some advertis . in the end , advertis alway play with their direct or indirect influenc on the custom . and unless the custom doe not reflect thi influenc critic , the produc will not chang their habitud in make the product seem much better than they are .
