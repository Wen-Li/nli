man is a social anim . from the time be mankind had appeard on thi earth , the real man is contious tri to achiev maximum of knowledg in order to attain the ultim peak of success and power . for thi mani way had been organis by us and one of the most import way to do thi work is to attain excel in scienc , research , art and technolog . th topic of discuss here is that whether it is better to have broad konwledg of mani acadm subject or to special in one specif subject . in my point of view , i can though say that it is good to have onli one subject to keep in concern than to deal with mani area of acadm studi . first of all , to live in societi where educ peopl recid it is import for each one of us to have the minimum requir knowledg of all the subject which could be of essenti use for our futur . for thi i would like to take an exampl which about a child who want to becom a pilot and ha alway studi physic scienc amd math and no other thing . but now , how can he commun with other , to feel other and to show hi feel toward other , to mix and organis thing relat to the world of other subject . so thi is cumpulsori for all of us to attain a minimum amount of knowledg about all the thing so that our life move on smoothli . but , i would lay more stress on the fact that one should be more specif about the subject or the area of studi when one is go though hi higher studi . the main reason behind thi is that , now in thi acceler world we ca n't excel in an area or field unless we are veri specif in that work . the other main here is that if we are specif we can show our complet effort in a particular field and can serv the societi in best way we can and thi is th omli thing requir for excel in all the field . as a conclus the best way to move is to be specif togeth have requir intrest in all other are also .
