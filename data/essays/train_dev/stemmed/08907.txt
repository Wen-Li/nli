first of all , i total agre with the statement becaus in advertis they make the product look shini and in it perfect condit and the result we see on it are not real becaus it wa shown to us by actor not real consum . base on my experi , i tri mani anti-dandruff shampoo that i 've seen on televis advertis and they did n't work out . i follow the instruct on the bottl but i think it ha someth to do with the product it self . i tri anoth product i didn 's see befor on televis and it work out veri well with me . i think what turn out to be good with you doe n't have to be with everyon els . for exampl , in car we see these power car that can go through ani difficulti from climb mountain to drive it in mud and on deep snow on the road or off the road while actual not all car are capabl of do such thing . they show us car go veri fast and you think that it is safe to drive in such speed while it 's not . the most danger advertis i see as apar are the kid 's advertis special when they show some chocol and candi and the kid in the advertis is eat as mani as he can without brush and hi teeth are perfect while in real life that is not true . but consid the peopl behind these advertis , we find that they are compani tri to make money out of their product so they have to make their product look the best way possibl to convinc the viewer to go and buy it . make advertis is an industri now and the compani ha the right make their product look perfect but i think the viewer also have the right to know whether thi advertis is real and the product is like what they see befor they buy it .
