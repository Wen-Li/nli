i strongli think that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . there are three major reason for thi . first , just imagin if you were an economist , and you have veri special knowledg about economi . just ask yourself waht consist the econom . in fact , the subject `` econom '' consist of mani other academicsubject like world histori , mathmat , psycolog , and so on . it could be said to anoth subject s too . no academ subject can exist itself alon . so , if you studi hard , it natur lead to the fact that you hae broad knowledg of mani academ subject . second , when you have convers with other peopl , which kind of peopl do you think is more fun to be with ? the person who talk about just one topic again and again , or the person who ha variou knowledg about variou subject . i think the answer is simpl . it could be said that the person who ha broad knowledg of mani academ subject ha better abil of commun with other , and the abil of communicaiton is realli import point to live thi world . to be succes in ani field of societi , it an essenci element . third , to have variou knowledg can improv the qualiti of your life . when you travel itali , and you are familiar to the histori of ancient rome , you could spend more excitingtim . if you can calcur quickli and effici , it would be realli conveni in everyday life . thu , variou knowledg can be your tresur . in conclus , some peopl say that by special in one specif , we can get deeper knowledg . i think it true . howev , doe everyon need deep knowledg ? i dont think so .
