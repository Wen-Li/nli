i did not are with the deal that the best way to travel is in a group led by a guid . the reason whi i think so goe as fallow . although it is more safeti to jion a group to travel , especi in a strang foreign countri , it will limit one 's action . becaus in a group one have to obtain the group rule , an individu ca n't stay in the place that realli attract him , it will be less free for sightse . second , travel not along with group will get more impress experi becaus all the inform must be accquir by effort . and it make the experi more worthi . a guid may provid onli brief knowledg about the spot throught hi time limit intrduct . search the stori about the exot atmospher is more attr for me . third , in group travel we may get new friend in the period , and get new friend is interest but may influenc the qualiti of travllingbut becaus we might meet the peopl who ha bad habavior that make me unconfort . if i travel on myself i can choos the accompani whom i am alredi familar with . group travel is interest , hower learn to solv the cultrual gap problem by myseft is also interet .
