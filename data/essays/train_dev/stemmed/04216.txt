i do agre with the statement , that advertis make product seem much better than they trueli are . but do the produc of the product realli have anoth option ? these peopl want to sell their product as often and as effici as possibl , which of cours is understand becaus thi is what they do for live and also our modern centuri offer possibl to make a product look perfect , such as tv or the world-wide-web . so whi should n't they make their product look brilliant ? we all have experienc the follow situat in one or the other way onc in our life . imagin yourself come home from a strenou day at work and all you want to do is relax with some good food in front of the tv . you switch the tv on , and there is a commerci about teeth whiten toothpast and addit materi . the commerci show a beauti woman , which is now , after use the bleach materi onc , even more success in her carreer and privat life sinc she ha bleach her teeth . throughout the entir commerci she is smile and have a good time and so the person watch thi scenario natur want to indentifi with her and want to get the life she ha . after buy the entir bleach materi that is offer in the drugstor around the corner and go trough the ritual of test everyth , you will soon find out that it doe not work out quit as well as it did with the woman on tv . so you do it over and over again , and than after a while you notic that whenev you eat someth cold or extrem heaten your teeth start hurt . and there you have it . thi is not what they tell you in the commerci . white bleach teeth and hurt go togeth . everi dentist tell you that bleach and exagger bleach can and will harm your teeth . i think thi stori is perfect to show that a product at first sight might seem perfect to you . it concentr on wish and play with desir you natur have , for exampl , the wish to fit in a certain way of life , the desir of have a success carreer and find the love of your life . the product promis more than it can realli give to you , so of cours you are disappoint if you do not get , what it ha promis you befor . so my conclus is , look behind the advertis and do not believ everyth becaus the real word differ from human dream .
