i do believ that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year . as the care are go cheaper and cheaper , mani famili bought the car . thi directli caus the shortag of park space . our gover publish a new rule that increas the charg of park . also , the gover also rais the fee for the annual exam of the car . peopl are get more and more care about their money rather than their convini . my father is exactli an exampl . we drove our car anywher we were goin to , though it wa onli 2 km away from my home . but now , everyth chang . when he plan to drive the car , he will count whether it is worthwhil . of cours , thi is a effect way to reduc the use of car . now it is , and it will . secondli , peopl are go to concern the enviro . as so mani disast happen in recent year , we do realiz that car do make a big contribut to the worldwid pollut . more and more pollut gase are out , and we can not live healthili . it may caus diseas such as caugh , headach and so on . we can easili hear the peopl around us say that take care of the dust outsid , it will make you sick . not use care mean we are take care not onli the envirou but also we ourselv . thirdli , the gover and scienti are also devot to set up a convient public traffic system . my father pick me up from school everi day . though i could straightli get to the gate of my hous that subway or bu can not , i had to suffer the traffic jam everyday and stay in the car just listen to the `` beep '' . that 's convini , but absolutli not comfort ! also , the control of the popul in mani countri is also an import reason that support my opinion . the less peopl , the fewer car . thi is certainli right . all in all , we know what is the best for us . reduc the use of car make our life more comfort . so i believ that the number of the car will sure reduc in twenti year .
