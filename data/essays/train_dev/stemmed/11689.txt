i do not agre the opinion that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . it is true that young peopl have more physic capac than young peopl , but older peopl have more preciou experi than young peopl . so older peopl also enjoy their life . young peopl have a lot of energi , physic capac . so it is easi for them to travel foreign countri and abl to have valueabl experi . on the contrari , it is difficult for old peopl to do such a experi . but they are abl to think and find mani interest event around them . they may not be abl to have experienc foreign countri , but they are abl to have enough time to love cherryblossom in bloom in spring , and they also enjoy the rain drop in raini season . mani young peopl might not think such a thing , but i think it also can be a element for enjoy life . second abundunt physic capac doe not alway peopl happi . recent , there are seriou social problem like a murder , violat , and so on . these problem is deriv from innapropri use of physic capac , that is innapropro use us youth . older peopl also do such a thing , but the probabl to do such a foolish thing less happen . youth is veri use element to enjoy their life , but it is also becom an import element to be an old .
