i think that it is better to special in one specif subject . actual peopl are studi broad knowledg of mani academ subject . howev , if peopl studi mani thing in a same time , there can be mani problem after all in a futur . first , if peopl studi broad knowledg , they can not know about their subject in detail . sinc there are so much amount of knowledg that peopl have to studi , they can confus the content of the subject . for exampl , when they get some question from some student or the other peopl , they can make a mistak by teach someth wrong becaus of the confus about it . second , the mean of expert can disappear . if most peopl know wide knowledg of mani field , they are not an expert in a certain field . sinc they do not special in just one thing . so , i can imagin one situat that if someon ha a question about biolog , the person can have a problem becaus there is no biolog expert , he or she can not decid where he or she should go , and can not know who is the person that is special in a biolog . . third , the mean of major in univers or colleg can disappear . major is a subject that peopl choos to special in , by the way if peopl studi broad knowledg , it is easi to disappear the mean of major to student an even the other peopl . so , in the futur , if compani want to hire some employe , they can be in a panic or confus to search the person who is just good at their compani . therefor , i think that peopl should concentr on just one subject , so i want them to becom great peopl who affect to the specif field and make wonder output from their studi .
