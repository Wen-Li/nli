`` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' , i comletli beliv in thi statement becaus i think one can not be success by follow other peopl . to be success one ha to think out of the box , he ha to break the cycl of follow the same routin over and over again . in order to be success in life one ha to take risk . but first he need to defin thi term risk for himself . risk can be life end or it can be carrer end . for instans let say that there is a man work as a stunt co-odin in hollywood hi recoganit in the industri would onli be of just anoth stunt co - odin . so in order to be famou and success he ha to do someth that somebodi ha never seen or done befor , he ha to do someth spectacular which will gain him popular , now that includ risk in it becaus he ha to do someth that other peopl ha never tri to do . so perform that kind of stunt would mean risk hi life to death but still he ha to do it to that one bit extra , to be success . and the other kind of risk would be carrer end howev it would not have that life risk element but it can end carrer let say a bussinessman who is the owner of a pizza restraunt . let say till now he is just just anoth guy with just anoth pizza shop in the market . so to be famou and success he ha to do someth extra , he ha to take that risk so he introdus a new recipi for the pizza . ther will onli be 2 way out of it first the coustom will like the pizza or they will not like the pizza , if they like it he is famou or if they do n't hi carrer is end . so the conclus to thi part is that to be success you have to go that one extra bit , you have to think out of the box and you have to tri and do thing that other have not done .
