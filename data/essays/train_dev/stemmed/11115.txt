i agre with the opinion to special in one specif subject . and i will tell you about the reason whi i think so . at first , recent academ subject is develop rapidli , and unless you have a deep knowledg about the subject you learn , you ca n't understand anyth about that . befor twenti centuri , the field of academ wa not broad and not vast , so mani specialist could learn mani field , but now we ca n't . second , the person who is the expert in one specif subject will get a lot of award . for exampl , nobel prize will hand in the specialist of one region like medic , piec , chemistri , physic and so on . though thi is an extrem exampl , if one person would know ani sperfici knowledg of ani subject , the person wo n't get the nobel prize . at last , learn broad knowledg of mani academ subject is veri difficult . as the matter of fact , there is a `` liber art '' in the univers of the us , and univers student is tri to studi a lot of broad knowledg . but complet `` liber art '' is veri difficult in four year . sometim studi make some univers student exhaust . so studi onli one subject deepli is the good way for univers student . alhough i explain how bad studi broad knowledg is , there is one good point to studi `` liber art '' . if you know a lot of knowledg outsid your special , sometim you can get some idea for your special . becaus there are a lot of similar between the subject to subject , you can be easi to hit the idea if you are troubl to write a paper or someth els . in the conclus , if you have a much time to studi in your life , studi `` liber art '' at first and then studi your special will be the best way to complet your way of academ .
