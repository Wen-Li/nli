i firmli agre with the opinion that it is more import for student to learn how to understand idea and concept than just learn fact and data . it may be true that fact are basic for a success academ career , howev for all the rest of the human be it is just person enrich . it may also be true that learn raw data is a veri reward experi , but again i would suggest to focu thi desir on more stimul and challeng activ . first , fact are much easier to forget than idea . i am sure that no friend of mine from school will rememb all the name of the river in our countri , but they mayb can rememb whi the pc ha been so import in the develop of our cultur . therefor , it is much more use to learn someth that you will not forget than just have a hard time with nonsens tough data , which you have to read over and over becaus it doe n't have ani logic behind ! second , in our work we hardli use specif fact . but we certainli use idea , concept , argument and logic discuss . at least i do in my consult job . i have learn to structur my thought and put into practic improv lever simpli by understand and appli idea , not by rememb fact . third , fact can be look again and again in book whenev we want . nowaday , there is no problem in find inform . we can just connect to the internet , make a search and find it right there . when i do n't rememb a formula , i just do that . googl is my good friend when i have memori loss . mayb other peopl just have a neighbour that know it all or a teacher who is an expert in that field . i could go on say that what the world lack are good idea , revolutionari thought that can improv the societi we live in . thi last idea lead me to my final argument : fact are part of the past while idea are the raw materi of the futur . the formula of a circl ha been invent mani year ago , but how we will beat cancer is a pend subject and onli with good idea we will suce in thi matter . we should be engag in provid an outstand ideas-focus educ to the futur einstein . for instanc , dure my educ in high school in the usa i experienc a quit differ approach compar to the european one . we should foster thi type of educ . sum up , my opinion is that student should learn what will be use for them and for the societi as a whole . consequ , manag concept and with their interact reach conclus is much more product than memor load of book .
