i am agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . it is true that youth of today is not much concern about the well be of hi societi and is busi in pursu hi own individu interest but they are not wholli to be blame for thi becaus there are variou other factor which prevent them from contribut to their societi and commun . to start with take the exampl of cut throat competit all around the world in everi field due to technolog advanc , where everi individu , everi firm is strive hard to achiev maximum effici and henc maximum benefit out of limit avail resourc in their hand . right from the point child take admiss in the primari school , he ha to cater to the expect of hi parent , friend etc . then with popul increas and resourc decreas , their are limit vacanc in higher school , colleg and good univers for the student so there also they have to compet in entranc examin for the limit seat . then even onc in , there is not much relief sinc the academ curriculam is so hectic that one doe not have enough time to look after other peopl who need help . and we alsoo in thi situat we can not expect from someon to take out time from hi busi schedul and devot it to the commun . then come to the time one get job and start work in some busi or firm , there also the young man are expect to do hard work , if they want a better and secur futur . howev despit these point , i will not deni the careless attitud of the youth toward their commun . due to globalis and mix of cultur , young peopl are more attract toward the materialist pleasur and are not readi to understand the respons they have on their shoulder for the societi and commun , which ha given so much to him to make the person , he today is , and now it is hi oblig from the ethic consider , that he give some payback to the same commun .
