nowaday , more and more peopl say that the young peopl enjoy life more than the older peopl do . they think that mani young peopl buy the luxruy thing , spend more and more time and money on the internet and video game . the older peopl , howev , alway spend theri time to do the housework , or watch the tv at home . but doe it true that the young peopl enjoy life more than the older peopl do ? i think i can not agre with thi say . becaus everi peorid of one 's life ha it own featur . we can not onli say that the young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . firstli , older peopl alway think everyth in their way , so mayb they think the next gener alway not good as them . for exampl , the kid who were born in 1960 's and after were call the gener ca n't support . but they are the main part of the economi and poltic now . they are excel as their father and grandfath . so the viewpoint that the young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl is just a stereotyp . secondli , i think everi old peopl ha ever been young befor . so they must know that the young peopl is much more activ than older peopl . they know go to club or play basketbal when they are free . they can not stop move . but it is not to enjoy the life , it is the instinct of the young man . that not mean that the young man enjoy the life more the older peopl . thirdli , mani older peopl know how to enjoy the life more than the young peopl . becaus mani young peopl do n't have enough money to enjoy the life . they need to word . but the older peopl who ha earn enough money to use dure the holiday , or buy the expens car , etc . so the older peopl mayb know how to enjoy the life more than young peopl .
