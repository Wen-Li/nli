i think their are advantag and disadvantag of both - broad and special knowledg of an academ subject . i am studi `` european studi '' which is a realli broad field , student join academ cours of the histori , socialog , economi as well as polit depart . it includ a lot of devot to stay inform in all of the subject . therefor , i experi advantag and disadvantag of interdisciplinari studi everytim discuss with special student . it is e.g. true that `` interdisciplinari '' student have a broader view of the world and it variou develop , howev , when it come to theoret background , we can not compet no more with the `` specialist '' . economi and societi are both demand peopl who are abl and will to learn throughout their whole life in variou field . the `` new '' employe should be train in a lot of subject be abl on the one hand to find new solut to problem and connect due to hi multi-facet educ and on the other hand to adopt to new circumst quickli . i would therefor argu that it is more favour studi mani subject for enter `` real life '' busi . howev , one should alway be awar that one ha to concentr on one major in order to have a refer point of one 's academ and professin outlin . thi core subject should be the start point of one 's idea and itent give rise through the surround subject to innov idea . howev , if one want to enter an academ carreer it is favour to have a specif knowledg of onli a few subject in order to find and teach new insight necessari for the acedem develop of each subject . in conclus i argu for a break-up of the dichotomi of broad and specialiy teach . of cours , student should take a decis at the begin of their studi , but even if they chose to becom specialist they should get some broader educ to appli there skill in variou field . apart form thi i would advic student of a interdisciplinari cours to dicid for a kind of major to concentr their effort . both are need and their interact have fruit outcom .
