i agre with thi statement becous a succef person want alway to increas own experi do someth differ as what it usual do . moreov do differ thing could take certain risk , and a success person know that but it is n't worri becous he want onli to improv itself and it experi . moreov a success person is n't worri to be judg by the other becous it is veri determin . the are a lot of risk such as to fail , but i do n't think it 's import . obvious tri new thing is possibl when you are young and you have much energi and willpow , when you are older you do n't want to do and you are not abl to do such experi . for exempl a friend of mine is english and she came in itali when we wa 13 . she decid not to studi onli english as foreign languag at school but she studi also french . she wa n't good in french and even if she usual took bad mark she rappreent a life model for me . she allway advic me to tri with new thing and not to fear about them . i have follow her advic when i move from my small villag to milan . i would have had the opportun to work in my parent 's factori if i had stay there but i decid to studi design in milan and to be self-support . an experi like thi make oneself feel more matur and respons even if it 's a bad experi .
