`` the risk is my game '' said jame bond in a movi and i think bond is success . the import to improv myself is connect with tri new thing and take risk . i believ that success peopl are the one who tri new thing and do n't complain about wrong choic . instead of do alway the same thing , tri a new one is riski : you do n't know what is go to happend , where you are go to be . but thi make peopl smarter and more intellig . in a complet new situat , a person could improv himself and thi make a better peopl . i person prefer to choic new thing : for exampl at the restaur . it could be a stupid exampl , but it is fondament . at the restaur peopl is divid in two categori : the gambler and the `` abitue ' '' . the gambler alway tri new plate , new food and that excit them . the feel for a new flavor , new tast make the choic both unaspect and excit . of cours there is the problem : `` what if the tast is not so good ? '' . but onc you have choic a new plate , you have to own the risk . the `` abitue '' are the opposit of the gambler : when they go to restaur , they alreadi know what they are go to take . they do not experi new thing and so they will not improv themself : they are too closed-mind to understand the thrill of a possibl . the gambler have much more possibl to find the perfect plate for the perfect dinner . onli with the experi on new food , peopl could understand what they like and what they do n't like . i think thi exampl , becaus it is strictli connect with life . success peopl are success , becaus they have risk and mayb they tri so new mani thing that , now , they know what is the best for them .
