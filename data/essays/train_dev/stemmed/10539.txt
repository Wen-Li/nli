in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today actual , i do not agre with thi statement . the world is grow . the citi are expand . and the world popul is increas . peopl need transport to transport from one site to anoth insid the citi and even outsid . i agre that there are varieti of transport . for exampl , buse , metro , and airplan . but usual peopl like to drive . they like to have there own car and travel with there famili through the countri . some countri , there are no metro . and some countri have minim number of buse . in my countri , we do not have metro , small number of buse and we have onli one airplan compani . in my countri , we are not use to use bu or even taxi . we usual use our car . car can not be replac by other transport . some peopl will not feel comfort without use a car especi their car . other transport can help in decreas crowd but that doe not mean that they will replac the car . mostli . everyn bodi in the entir world would like to have a car even if he or she transport by other than car . i think reduct in number of car in use will be challeng . and i think it will take more than twenti year to decreas the usag of car in my countri in the entir world .
