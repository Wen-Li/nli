there exist an opinion that young peopl nowaday do not tend to spend enough time to help their commun . inde , i agre with thi statement . first of all , the notion of individu ha taken over in modern time and consequ among the young gener . young peopl place more valu on individu interest than they do on the interest of the commun they are in . as a result they tend to devot an appreci amount of time to their own work and privat live . thi in turn , as may easili be guess , doe not leav much time for them to do someth for their commun . moreov , the live of young peopl becam much more difficult than they were in the past . by the word ` difficult ' i mean that the condit that face the young gener are more cruel and competit . the world popul and henc the amount of young peopl increas year by year . therefor , in order to achiev someth in life , the repres of the young gener have to work much harder and concentr more on their own interest . in other word , they just do not have time to be engag in help their commun . i would like to bring my life as an exampl . i want to becom a success scientist in the futur . howev , nowaday there is an appreci amount of student who would like to pursu a scientif career - especi in my field ( genet ) . therefor , in order to ` outweigh my rival ' i have to work quit hard and have veri littl time to help my parent , rel or friend . furthermor , help someon els in gener and the commun in particular should involv a great sens of respons . howev , as far as i could observ the member of the current young gener usual lack that . in other word , they do not want to take respons for someon els and henc do not tend to help that ` someon els ' . in conclus , i would like to mention that in view of the reason and the exampl state abov , i certainli think that at our time young peopl do not spend a reason amount of time devot to help their commun .
