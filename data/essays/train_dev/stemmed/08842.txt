some peopl believ that the best way to travel is to go alon as they can spend time as they want . but i strongli believ that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . in thi discuss i shall present argument support my opinion . there are so mani advantag for a guid tour . first and the most import advantag is , a tour guid know the place better than us . so he/sh can take us directli to the popular place that should be visit in that citi . thi realli save a lot of time , which is an import thing to be consid in a short vacat and also we will not miss ani good place if we have a guid . wherea in the situat where there is no guid , we have to enquir about the place to visit and sometim we may even get lost in the process of find the rout which result in the wastag of time . second , as the tour guid know about that place , he will be abl to explain the histori of that place . for exampl , he can explain the reason or stori behind the construct of a monument or sculptur . sometim they also know about the nativ stori that were not written in the book . in a tour with out guid , we will sure miss all thi inform . final , travel in group also help in mani way like a guid tour . first of all , it is fun to travel with so mani peopl and it give us a chanc to make new friend . also , the other member in the group will help us when we have a sudden emerg like health problem . in contrast , if we travel alon nobodi will be there to take care of us in the new place where everybodi is unknown for us . to conclud , while there are argument that can be made on both side , i person believ that travel in a group with a guid is better compar to travel alon with out a guid .
