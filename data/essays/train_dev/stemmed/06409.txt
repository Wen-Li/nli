i disagre with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' , becaus i think that when you travel and you want to see new thing is better to have your own time and to manag your time acord to your prefer and your need . sometim when you are travel and you have to be whit a guid and with a group of peopl , you dont have enogh time to look at the thing you like , to anal the thing you see , or the time to enjoy the thing you like best . for exampl , for me is veri import not onli to see the monument and learn about the histori of a place , but to teast the food of the place i 'm visit , and to have time to talk with the peopl that live their . in conclut i believ that not everybodi ha the same interest when their are travel , and that mani time a good book can replac a guid , it is onli a matter of read about the pleac your vist . so i would recomend to buy a good book , look for inform in the internet , and then take all your time to do the thing you realli like , to enjoy your trip .
