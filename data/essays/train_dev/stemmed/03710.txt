as my opinion , learn fact is more import than understand concept . there are some reason . first , the fact can make peopl have deep impress . everyon will have a deep impress when he meet the difficulti . as you solv the problem , you will undersdtand more about the idea or concept you learn . solv the difficulti is also the energi for learn . you will be confid after you solv it . second , the idea we learn in school are concept . they are the conclus after exper or research . they are the base of knowledg . after school , you will have basic knowledg to face the fact you will happen in the futur . although idea are the parment element in your studi , you have to face ani difficulti in your career . third , face difficulti and solv them will make you more complet . you have lot of experi that you will have a high posit in the compani . the experi will promot you to have a higher level . when i graduat from school , i found a job in bicycl industri . at the begin , i face a lot of problem that i do n't know what to do . so , i tri to ask my cowork and found solut in the text book . after my co-work ' help , i final solv the problem . after that , i enjoy face problem no matter how tough that is . by thi kind of experi , i discov that i learn a lot and more matur . that made me more satisfi about my work . the compani also gave a promot and look forward to anoth improv .
