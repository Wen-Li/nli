as older peopl alway say : time are differ now and the past wa alway better . when you are a child , you are not afraid becaus everyth is new in thi world and your parent are there to support you . then , you grow up , you becom a teenag and you think life is to live it and enjoy it , then you are an adult and your respons increas , you have to forget about yourself and think about peopl around you , and when you are an old person you wish you had more time to do what you never did and alway want to do , you wish you could have made more mistak to learn from them but . .. time is gone . young peopl enjoy their live go to the club , danc , drink : thi is what they call `` have fun '' . older peopl go to the wineri , listen to the music that bring old memori , they enjoy themselv on their own way . i think both gener younger and older peopl live their live the best way they can , they enjoy do the activ they like and they consid are fun accord to their belief and their philosophi in life . the differ lie on the risk they take . when you are young you feel no fear , you think there is onli one life and you have to live it the fullest , you own your world . but , when you are older , you also know that onli one life wa given to you , but your pholosophi , your perspect is differ becaus you think sinc there is onli one life to live , you have to appreci it , take care of it and enjoy it love and respect yourself : risk are not the same in each stage of life . when you are young a risk can be skip school and that would be veri excit , when you are older skip class is not fun , it is be irrespons . i do not think there is a list of activ to defin whether or not someon enjoy life , i think it depend on each one and the way you were rais . the gift of life wa given to us and we can enjoy it the way we want as long as we do not affect other peopl 's belief and live .
