in my opinion it is better to special in a specif subject or area instead have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , although it can be argu that a gener educ is also necessari . most obvious the goal of all academ educ is to ultimatli give us specif knowledg and educ us in a particular area or subject . it is the reason whi we go to univers after secondari school . be a profession and know one subject thoroughli give us mani advantag on the job market by give us appeal to custom , client and futur employ . after complet my undergradu studi i plan to get a master 's degre in law and studi one specif area of the law . in today 's market , profession are get more and more special becaus there are so mani chang , and so mani topic and subject to studi . when a client is have a divorc they will not go to a surgeon or a a copor lawyer , they will go to a lawyer who special in matrimoni action , becaus he is more like to help him , after se so mani client in the same situat . further it is not time sensit to cover mani academ subject and know them all . some peopl have more than one degre and spend their life studi and go to one school after anoth . they know about econom , financ or bank but it is not possibl to know them all veri well . in addit it can cost a lot to studi so mani subject and at the end not be abl to compet with one person who spent less time in school but onli know one subject . final it is imposs to learn mani subject and know them all well . it is a sign of lack of stabil and indecis . some student spend their colleg year chang from one major to anoth and they can never decid which one to studi . so they end up spend year in school and get discourag by the time to graduat and quit school in sum special in one subject is the best choic for me , although i would also like to learn about other complementari disciplin like languag sport and art and be abl to exchang intelectu with other peopl .
