i disagre the idea that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today in japan , there are follow reason . first , the way of think is verif now , so car maker should produc mani kind of car to match the popl 's need . some popl use theircar onli when go shop , other use their car as a kind of hobbi . they like suport car , race car or off road car , etc . today , a tipic famili live in japan ha one car . but it is said that a tipic famili live in jpan will have two car in a few year . one of them will be for the father and the other will be for the mother . the price of car ha bacom veri cheap becaus of technolog develop , a tipic famili will be abl to buy two car in a few year . in addion , in japan , we can not have second car now becaus we do n't have enough park space in our home or we can not pay the expens park fee . but there day , the japanes real estat have becom cheaper than befor . if thi situc continu , we will be abl to have enough park space in our home or pay enough park fee in a few year . at last , in japan , the gover improv the railroad and highway by invest a lot of money these day . becaus the public transport system in japan ha been implov these thirti year , and then the goverma now think to improv the railroad and highway mainli . as a resault , the terribl trafic jam in japan will be resolv in a few year , so the number of japanes who want to buy and use their car will increas . so , i total disagre the ideat that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today in japan .
