young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do from my point of view , i beliv the young and old peopl enjoy they life the same . there is time for everyth and a moment . to understand peopl behaivior , we need to see , where are they come from , what are they like to do , social and person interest . for exampl ; i born in costa rica , small countri where young and old peopl enjoy soccer , and danc , and are no differ from other peopl or cultur around the world . younger peopl is more activ and careless , they no have mani respons , so they use all they free or spare time , do mani thing , such as : a ) - sport , b ) - travel , c ) - date , d ) - work part time , e ) - study. , hope that someth realli work out for them and have some fun at the time . mani like my self , take some adventur and leav the countri , tri to find new horizont and adventur . older peopl the still have fun , and they enjoy they life in they way , becus usulli older peolp have more respons , such a famili , child , full time work or carri , they have less time to do what they realli like , but that doesnt meant that they no enjoy they life . the mean of enjoy life is in everyon , we all enjoy our life in so mani differ way , and as long we beliv that is correct , is ok . be young or old is depent in each person , some peopl young are like old peopl , and some old peopl are like young peopl . enjoy life is a present from god , and we need to be graceful just for be aliv and see as much as we can of thi work . enjoy life is no matter to be young or old , enjoy life is live life .
