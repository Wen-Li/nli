i agre with the statement that is more import for student to understand idea than learn fact , but with some limit . i think that for young peopl is veri import to understand concept in a deep way becaus after the graduat they should use what they have learn . so is good that univers forc student to studi a lot and do conceptu exam . but mani of the peopl that attend univers are not young , and for them i think that the lesson have to be more interact and with fact . infact they need to match what they are stude with what they have learn from their experi . for a young student thi is not so import becaus we do not have work experi . i attend the second year of undergradu cours in bocconi , a univers of economi in milan . dure the cours often happend that the lesson is bore . the lesson usual take about 2 hour each and it 's difficult to keep the concentr dure all the time . it will be better if sometim the lesson contain fact becaus that help to hold the concentr and sometim help to understand concept . with thi type of lesson student can both learn concept and fact , start to understand how the thing they are stude are relat to the work . in my opinion good univers should prepar you with lot of concept but also with some real exampl to appli what you have learn . moreov you can chage your idea dure the life but befor you have to understand that idea . idea and concept are better than fact for student but a prepar onli with concept will not make you abl to join the world of work .
