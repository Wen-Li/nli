i do think that there will be few car in use in twenti year than there are today , becaus we do not have enough resourc as petrolem and our environ can not stand for the pollut for anoth twenti year . although car is conveni , it is not a good vehicl of transport becaus we have alreadi pay much price on it . the most signific reason i think that the use rate of car will reduc in twenti year is we will lack of the resourc pretti soon . sinc car ha been invent and the industri revolut , the natur resourc of petrolem becom need than ever . howev , it take time for petrolem to be matur but we ignor thi fact for a long period becaus we can not not live without it . nowaday , almost everi famili ha at least one car and the demand of the industri caus the petrolem reduc faster than it can grown . thi kind of natur resourc can hardli be fix and last forev onc it ha been use out . the car amount will decay becaus it is not easi to find a replac resourc to cover and our environ can not take the side effect that came along with the pollut . bscaus of the humenb , earth ha suffer for a long time becaus of the pollut . in brief , our main concern now is to reduc the amount of car . if we do not take it serious , the disast came with the industri activ will rullin everi creatur that live on the world . air pollut , water pollut and all these kind of issu should be protect immedi . i think the amount of car will be fewer in use in twenti year than there are today . the two major reason that make it occur is the lack of natur resourc and the pollut . we need to take action as soon as possibl not onli becaus we do not have energi to drive our car but becaus we do not want to drive the car . thi is a kind of action that protect the environ in a most effect way .
