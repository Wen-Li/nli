nowday , more and more student sucess their baccalaureat . howev , it appear that their knowledg are not veri good . therefor , some peopl think that we have to re-organ the educ system . so , is it more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ? first , the comprehens of someth begin in observ fact . for exampl , in chemistri , we can do an experi , observ it , and then we have to understand the reaction . so , i think that it is realli import to understand idea and concept . it is the first step of the knowledg . it is the minimum . next , if we forget thi idea and concept , it is not import to understand it ! but educ can not stop here . if we onli understand idea and concept , we do not have enough knowledg to understand other thing . to improv it knowledg , we have to learn fact . inde , learn fact equal get experi . in the schorlarship , learn fact must mixt with `` understand idea and concept '' . in one time , student onli learnt cours by heart and sometim they did not understand . thu , if student onli learn lesson , it is not enough . in my opinion , a good educ sytem is not onli a system where student just learn fact . they olso have to understand idea and concept : it is not more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . we can not done a differ between thi two system .
