i disagre that young enjoy life more than order peopl do . first of all , there are mani activ , fresh , live older peopl . they have mani hobbi , friend , famili , so they are enjoy their life . some older peopl look like so yong ! my grandfath is also one of these peopl . it seem to me he is enjoy hi life . second , there are mani yong peopl who do not enjoy their life . some yong peopl have no hobbi and they are not interest in anyth . for exampl , today , the number of neet is increas in japan . they do not want to work and stay home watch tv or eat snack and so on . they depend on their parent complet . so , i think that sometim older peopl enjoy life more young peopl . on the other hand , some peopl may say that older peopl can not move free becaus of diseas or injur . so , if they want to play sport , they can not . but yong peopl can play activ . i think thi is also true . but there are also mani young peopl who have diseas or injur . i think it is not true that these peopl do not enjoy life . i believ if there are some disabl , we can enjoy our life . i feel that to live better life , we should think anyth posit , and enjoy anyth ! not relat to how old you are , the person who tri to live better is the person who enjoy life .
