peopl can be successful in a lot of differ are . they can be successful in sport , or music or in their proffess . but do they have in common , that they are tri new thing and are take risk ? in my opinion , that is definit the case . peopl who are successsful know what it mean to be good at someth . to get thi feel in manz differ are they tri new thing , becaus it could be possibl that they succeed in thi area as well . for exampl a good basketbal . he love bee the one peopl cheer at . to get thi feel more often he begin do highjump or so . so that he could be successful more often . i think that anoth veri import point is the fear that they could suddenli fail , and thi fear is as higher as successful you are at the moment . fail in an area in which everbodi consid you to be good is much harder than fail in someth you are do the first time . if i am do a iq test and i wa successful , i fear to do it again . becaus i am worri about if i am as good as the last time . but do an other test would not mind becaus no one could compar my result . so i prever to take some risk and do someth new . the most import argument is that successful peopl are will to search for new aim and new competit in their live more than `` looser charackt '' . they are not worri about fail becaus they know they are good in someth . no , they search for new competit and new hurdl they could take successfullli . my friend for exampl is veri good at athlet . but he doe not want to stay here at home and do hi sport like it is right now . no , he want to go in a foreign countri to compet there and to meassur with other student . thi mean a completli new surround for him and the risk he could fail , or could be not as successful in athlet as he is here in germani . all in all i agre with thi statement , becaus i onli know successful peopl , who are not onli do thing they know they are good at , but who are tri new thing and take risk .
