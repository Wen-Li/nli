i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . car come along with peopl . so i think the best way how to approach that topic is to startt with the popul in 2026 . we will have to face dramat popul chang all over the world . while in europ and the unit state the popul densiti will decreas , asia and africa will grow to an , till now , unbeliev size . talk about africa and asia , we talk about a mainli poor part of the world . grow up in europ and have had the chanc to work in asia extens , i experienc first hand the fascin of car on poor peopl . have car get cheaper , and if you consid the latest product from china , it will not take long to have a big part of the chines chang from bicyl to car . india , that is follow right after china will be next , follow by african countri etc . to actual reduc the number of car , an environment awar ha to take part . thi alreadi start to happen in europ and the us and see the great increas of zip/car , car share and the effort citi undertak to provid a conveni and reliabl network for public transport , we are just enter the right way . a recent survey from bmw make clear that the number of car in the us and europ will pretti much stay the same , onli the environment perform of the car , like altern fuel vehicl etc. will get better . in asia and africa thi point is far down the road . first the desir for wealth , that mostli includ a car , need to be satisfi . after go through the whole process of think about the environment impact of car on the world of our children , thi may chang to a `` better citi , better life '' which is also the theme for the expo 2010 in shanghai . we onli can hope that asia surpris with the high speed to get on less car as it doe in the current high speed urban . you also need to question yourself where the old and worn out car from europ and the state go to . not all end up at a junkyard . i rememb that the old volvo of my father ha been sold by the car dealer to namibia becaus there are no regul and technic check requir by ani author . so in some way with our behaviour in the western world we contribut to the increas of car in the world . we onli can hope that the postfossil time will bring altern and more social way of travel and transport and that one day we have to go to a museum to explain the word `` car '' to our grandchildren .
