i complet agre with the statement `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' . advertis is all about project the brand imag of the product . the idea of adverst is to improv the sale of the product . thi necessarili mean attract custom to their product . the mean to attract lie in the imag they project . so , it come as no surpris if the advertis make their product look the best . when project the imag of the project , anyon would tend to speak about the posit point . how could they expect their product to be sold if they project the neg shade of the project ?? but the problem lie in the fact that the advertis tend to go overboard with the qualiti of their product . their step in make the product desir to the audienc are appreci , but not at the cost of the trust or belief peopl have in it . the main aim is to gain advantag over the competitor product . so , they tri to grasp the neg aspect associ with the competitor 's product and project an imag of their product . thi imag necessarili speak about what qualiti are there in the product that their competitor do n't provid . the head & shoulder advertis come as a refer in thi regard . it might not be as success in remov dandruff as it project itself to be . some advertis even tend to put the health of individu in jeopardi . one classic exampl i can give in thi regard is the soft drink . the recent coke controversi serv as a classic exampl to thi fact . recent , there wa some evid that coke ha some unreason amount of pesticid in it . when coke is project as a healthi and safe drink , evid to thi degre act as a blot on the reput . but i wonder if the product would sell off if true inform is advertis . imagin the sale of h & s if it say `` tri out for yourself '' rather than project their good imag . or if coke peopl say '' be care . thi drink might be harm to health '' . but one thing i can be sure . thi advertis world is for peopl to sel their brand and they would do it at the best way possibl .
