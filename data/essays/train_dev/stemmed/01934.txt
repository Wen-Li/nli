i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the most import part of learn is it applic . just the knowledg of fact wont take an indivisu to summit of success . it is when someon can throughli get hold of the idea and concept , he can creat , understand , and anal thing better . one can not limit idea and concept they can be extend to ani dimenss but on the other hand fact can be concid just a summar of the idea and concept . fact are import as they provid the basic fundament think but they are not the most import one . if a student just limit himself with the fact he stop think , think in a new dimenss . one stop reason himself and tri wheather there could be anoth theori which could support the idea , is a theori fulproof . all these question are not ask . the person cajol oneself to beliv it without question . the basi of human exist is to think and work on idea and concept . if the fact that earth is flat as initiali proposs wa reli on , then we would have never known the truth . but it is thi understand of idea and concept that the atom contain smaller element insid we have discov proton , nutron and even smaller than that . natur is too complex to understand and whatev is not natur can be wrong . fact about anyth can be print in textbook , narrat by teacher but understand of idea and concept depend upon one own percept , onc own logic reason and that is what real educ is about , to think to reason and then to act .
