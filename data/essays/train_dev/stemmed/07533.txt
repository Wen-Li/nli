peopl hold differ opinion of whether or not young peopl enjoy life more that older peopl do . one may claim that young peopl can enjoy life more sinc they have more energi . howev , i will argu that peopl can enjoy life equal , both the young and the elder . the first reason in support of my view is that peopl have equal right in term of enjoy life . nowaday , numer game and activ tend to becom suitabl to peopl at ani age . travel would be a perfect exampl to prove my argument . more and more travel agenc provid differ trip and vacat regard to the differ of age . elder peopl can join and group for senior , likewis , youngster can particip one design for their age . second of all , peopl enjoy life in the same level although they may do activ in differ way . the acit that young peopl like to do , such as video game or extrem sport , the senior may not enjoy do . instead , they may like prefer do other thing , like garden or cook . howev , there is no definit that tell peopl which game are more fascin or which activ are tediou . when it come to how to enjoy life , it more like to depend on differ peopl . last but not least , some peopl may argu that the peopl are more energit to do more activ . in my point of view , due to the amaz develop of modern medicin and health care , the elder are in better healthi condit which provid them to enjoy some highli activ sport as well . the man , who is in hi seventi , go to swim everyday in the morn . i believ some young peopl even can not keep thi everyday routin . the young may not have interest on it , or they even do n't have suffici time to do it as some older peopl . in conclus , i am highli convinc that both the young and the older enjoy life equal sinc they have the same right , although they may enjoy life by particip differ activ . besid , the contribut of the medic scienc on senior health also increas the opportuni to do more activ for them
