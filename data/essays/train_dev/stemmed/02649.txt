i tend to agre with the topic that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i believ that an understand of concept and idea are the stair to higher ground in all field of educ . thi hold true for subject rang from scienc , busi , medicin to fine art . if a student is abl to grasp the basic idea behind what is be taught then onli he can proceed further higher to learn and understand more about the subject . let take two exampl , first one would be from the field of scienc . everybodi know the fact that when white light pass through a prism it get divid into light of variou color . so is it import to teach a student whi the white light get divid into variou color or is it suffici enough for him to learn thi fact and learn the name of the color ? it is so import for him to understand the basic concept behind the phenomenon which is that differ color light have differ wave lenght and when pass through a thick glass they get reftract differ . if he know thi basic concept he can take thi further and understand the phenomenon of rainbow on hi own and never forget it . for my second exampl i would take take a student who is studi and work toward becom a musician . in order for him to becom accomplish in hi field of studi he should first learn the variou note , chord and other basic concept and idea in music . if the student is onli taught the name of the great and the symphoni that they creat , would that help him anyway in becom a musician himself ! ? therefor i would like to strongli state that though a student should be taught fact but there is no way that the student can do without an understand of concept or grasp of idea .
