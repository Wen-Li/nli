as the develop of transport , peopl travel more . the most common way of travel is like thi : go to a travel agenc , fli to a place with a group peopl , listen what the tour guid said and fli back . i do n't , howev , admir thi `` common way '' and never consid it the best way of travel . the biggest problem brought by have a tour guid is the absenc of freedom . you have to go to one place after anoth exactli as the fix plan . the schedul wa full of differ arrang and you could rare get the chanc of walk around alon in such circumst . for instanc , i onc went to hong kong on my own while a friend of mine went there with a group of peopl and a tour guid . as soon as she met me in hong kong , she start to complain about her trip . she said that she could n't go to the place she realli want , eat food she like , and even the shop she love . all she did wa take buse to differ place and walk around as a walk machin . she wa veri upset about her trip and did n't find ani pleasur in it . anoth nightmar brought by group tour is shop -- a group of tourist are often brought into a shop by the tour guid and forc to buy product . thi is quit true in some coutri accord to my own experi . sinc guid could get money from the shop , you may be badli treat by the tour guid if you did n't buy anyth . nobodi could have a nice trip in such case , is n't it ? for me , i prefer go to place myself , without a tour guid or other unknown peopl . when i travel to hong kong , i onli book my plane ticket and hotel , for a cheaper price , by travel agenc . my travel is like thi : i walk in the street of hong kong , went to those small local shop that a tour guid would never introduc to you , eat those realli `` hong kong '' food that you may never eaten in a big restaur , and talk with local peopl about their daili life . these are thing you could never have when attend a group and led by a guid . lead by a guid is an experi of `` view and listen '' , but not travel ; onli when you walk in a citi or a place of interest on your own , can you find it charm and fall in love with travel .
