ye i agre with the statement , it is more import to understand the idea concept of a particular thing . becaus it is more import for ani one to have an clear idea about that particular thing to work on it . i would explain with an exampl , when i am do my first semest of my under graduat i use to do my assign with out understand them and with out ani clear idea about the topic given . i use to submit my assign in thi way onli . when my examin is near , i dont have ani idea about the topic becaus i did n't work on them clearli . becaus , i thought just submit my assign in time would help me in the examin , but when i appear in the exam i could not do well becaus i dont have ani idea of the concept of the work . thi make my grade to be lower . when the next assign is given i use to work on it for a long time and tri to get a clear idea about the topic and made my assign . thi help me a lot in the final examin to succeed and got a better grade . thi is becaus understand the concept of that made me to do well in the examin . anoth exampl is that , when an experi is explain in an class room it is again ask to make the same one in laboratori . i use to neglet to concentr on the laboratori class . when i use to revis the topic cover after so mani day , i use to forget the particular thing expalin in the class room and i again should see the particular professor for the left over one . if i would have perform the paritcular thing in the laboratori i would get the clear idea and the concept of the topic and would have rememb the thing in that topic . so i conclud that it is import for student to understand the clear concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus understand the idea and the concept of the topic would do more than fact .
