advertisemnt have been known as the sole sourc for peopl to know about product ; therefor , mani peopl tend to believ all what they hear in media mean . mani advertis compani promot thier product perfectli and fiction than they realli are ; therefor , i agre with thi statement . my point of veiw is that those compani want to increas thier profit and to compet oth competetor . first , mani advertis compani make product much better than they realli are in order to increas their profit . greedi play a part in thi problem . as the peopl get moneri thi gualiti terrifingli increas along with it . they tri to use everi mean to increas thier profit at the end of the year . what those peopl do is exploit peopl need of a cheap product by decres the qualiti and the cost of thier product , and to crow all thi , they promot their product in media . as a result , peopl rush to the supermarket after hear the ad without think . last year , for exampl , i saw an ad about shampoo that make the hair nicer . i wa so surpris with it price and did not notic that it wa bad for the hair . as i use that shapoo , my hair start to fall down and had to rush to my doctor to help me in thi . in addtion to the increas of thier profit , some advertis compani make product much better than they realli are in order to compet other compani . in thi viciou world of busi , ani mean whether it is legil or not is valid . those compani ' aim is compet other even if that mean exploit peopl need . what they want is be the pioneer and first in everyth . as a result , they add mani untru inform about thier product in order to convinc the buyer to purchas from them and not from other compani . when you open a t.v. you will see what i mean . ad are all over the channel . thouthand od them about a particluar product that it is hard to choos from . those ad provid inform that do not make ani sens or are not persuas . i saw a an ad about a car , say that when you ride in it you will feel that you are fli . so i went to thatcar shop and tri it , thier seat were like a stone . then i knew that thier advertisemnet wa fake and untru . gain more profit and compet other compani are reason which allow mani compani to exploit peopl need for better and cheaper product . goverm should enforec or emphizi their role in thi byy strict those advertis and pass an regul that punish ani compani which tri to mislead peopl . for the abov reason , i agre that most advertis make product much better than they realli are .
