i disagre with thi statement . to my consider , learn fact is of greater import than simpli understand idea . i 'll illustr thi point in the follow three aspect . first , ` understand ' idea without learn fact doe n't mean peopl fulli understand these idea . onli through connect to fact , could the student know where these idea came from , and how they form . for exampl , in our childhood , we all learn from teacher that there are 9 planet surround the sun . but recent , scientist expel plato out of the solar system . and now , technic speak , there are onli 8 planet left . plato did n't chang . what chang is our criteria of planet . if student do n't understand the criteria , by simpli rememb the structur of solar syustem will not help to understand the essenc of solar system . second , student may find it hard to implement theori into practic in thi way . theori without practic outcom is of littl use for peopl in their daili life . by understand idea in the textbook , student could score high in the exam . but it could not benefit them when they graduat from school , and when they need to start to implement these idea into their work , becaus they did n't learn the fact that these idea are base on . thi kind of student wo n't be compet in modern societi . third , there 's alway some fact that could not be explain by simpli illustr idea . if a student is obssess with understand idea too much , he might not be curiou about numer fact that could not be explain by these idea . curios is what keep innov happen . fuel with it , a great amount of futur innov will take place . for exampl , ufo is still inexplain by current scientif theori . howev , a student may get interest in it by learn fact that thi phenomenon could not be explain by scientif idea . the next great astronaut after amstrong might probabl start here . in conclus , learn fact is import in truli understand scientif idea , implement theori , and keep curios to spark innov . thi is more import to student .
