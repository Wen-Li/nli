i disagre `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . the reason whi i disagre thi statement . becaus i think we should tri our best to do anyth . first , i think we should tri our best to do anyth . for examplan everi peopl will watch tv and do same thing on the tv . it mean peopl tri new thing and take risek rather , but they onli do what they alreadi knoe how to do well . thi is no good for us becaus we should learn a lot of knowlegd and histori . than we can commun with other peopl and understand what peopl talk about . the other point is about we should learn and find a lot of inform each day . if we donot understand someth we should find someon to help or we can go to librari to find some inform to help us . although if we alway tri someth we know and donot tri someth we donot underst . it will make us look like childer . the other point is about we should learn someth difer school than we will grown up . for exampla , environ , relationship , histori sush as those . i alway tri my best to anyth , if i donot how to donot someth i will ask someon who know that and let them help me . howev , i think peopl tri new thing is good but peopl alway should tri to learn someth theti donot know . that is best than onli learn they konw . i hope even one can do thi . if you can do thi thing you will tri you bert more that befor . i hope each one can do that .
