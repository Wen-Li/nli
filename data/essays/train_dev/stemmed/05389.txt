how do you make a travel ? quit a few peopl prefer travel in a group led by a tour guid . they believ that it it time save and more effienciet . as to me , i do n't think it is the best way to travel , to be frankli , i prefer to arrang a travel by myself . i do believ travel is a kind of way to enjoy life , to spend sweet time with the famili , the lover . it is such a time . you can make schedul yourself , the destin , accomod , departur time , everyth you like , as flexibl as you want , no need to catch fast pace arrang by the tour agent , do n't worri about to rush to next destin , everyth is so flexibl to under your control . i love that feel . anoth good benefit of travel alon is , i think , it is possibl for me to know more about the place , the local cultur , the peopl , the special custom , etc . becaus i do have more time and opportun to do mani thing i am interest . i can manag the time to stay , the place to go , so much funni thing . one more import benefit of travel alon is the econom aspect . i can manag the travel schedul by myself , choos the flight , the hotel at reasonalb price . everyth is under my budget control . in a word , i prefer travel alon .
