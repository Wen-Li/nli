the world is chang day by day and the chang is rapid . in thi competit world we face mani issu for which we must have lot of knowledg on everi aspect which we come across in our educ but it is not possibl to have lot of knowledg on everi subject . so , atleast we must have a broad knowledg on academ subject . i support to the idea to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject by give few exampl . there are mani advantag for my support to broad knowledg of mani academ subject . for exampl think , i am work on a project which is relat to deriv control . for thi project if i do special on one particular subject i ca n't do the whole project becaus i have to know commun theori , signal and system and some softwar program languag in addit to electr technolog . if i do special in onli one subject how can i do the whole project . furthermor , to studi onli one particlar subject it is veri difficult to get progress in that subject becaus it may lead to loss of interest and more over after complet half if i think i am not suitabl to that area my time and resourc are wast and if i continu without ani interest there will be no satisfact in job which i do relat to that subject . moreov , after my courc work i have to go for a job and the compani want me to work in differ area in differ time which make me difficult if i am special in one subject and i ca n't say my manag `` i ca n't work '' . in addit to that i myself will be have a great scope of choos my own area inaccord to the time if i have broad knowledg on differ subject . in total , i support to the statement that there must be a broad knowledg on all academ courc than get special in one specif subject .
