i agre with thi statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . becaus media have a strong effect on peopl , and how much the product becam a familiar to peopl it becam better . as we all know that advertis is an essenti step to make ani product to be success . it is also can be a mislead for peopl know noth about product in market . the advertis is use a simpl way to get simpl peopl are not awar if that product are good enough for them or no , and as a result of worldwid media now and the expant of it becom more easi to get peopl in trap of these adverties . as ani compani make good product or bad product all are seek for binifit of these product . but the differ that good comapin are affraid on thier respect , rather than other compani produc less qauliti item for market . if we take a soap product under consider , and if we asum that there are two compani are produc such a materi we call them x and y respectivli with good product and bad product . in the follow situat we will see how that media will make the bad product of y better than broduct of x. compani y choos a intern program that mani of peopl like to watch it and they like to keep watch it contin . they advirtis their product over and over for long time . which make peopl uncontionsli take on thi product and be familiar with it . so when peopl go to a market and want to buy a soap as our exampl . the custom will find two product one is for x and the other for y , and becaus the strong advirtis of product y the custom will choos the product y. even so product x is better than product y the custom choos product y . so in my opinion how much the advertis of a product were good and alot . how much better the product will be better than reall is . and here becom the role of custom in seek what realli better not what he saw in tv .
