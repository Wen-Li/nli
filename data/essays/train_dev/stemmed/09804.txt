ye . i agre that in the near futur the number of car that are in use will be lesser than that of today 's car count . the first reason for my agreement with the statement is that the world 's economi is grow at a faster rate and technolog innov are imman within the system . thi might result in an effici , cost-effect , superfast railway network which connenct an urban area like a labyrinth . the main emphasi is given to urban are in the previou statement becaus they are the one that have more number of car than the rural area usual do . the state-of-art technolog might drive the commun to use the railway as an altern to use car . thi might lead to less number of car in next twenti year . there is a gener concern over environment pollut especi on air pollut . the main contributor to thi air pollut is the smoke produc from the exhaust of the car engin . the awar toward thi pollut might reach all the citizen of the urban area and make them realiz the import to reduc the pollut . as a result they might seek alterant mean of transport apart from car . consequ thi awar might urg the citizen not to use car in the near futur . one of the major concern in the modern societi is the cost of the petroleum or ga . it is so high that peopl are hesit to use car even now . as the natur resourc of the earth are limit and the use of oil consumpt ha been veri high despit it cost , the situat in twenti year could be mark by lack of enough oil for transpor . obvioulsi thi would inhibit peopl from use the car if there are no other altern fuel for car . in twenti year an exot , effici and impress machin might be invent . as humanb , who alway want to tri out someth new , would feel prestigi if they were possess with that exot , impress machin . again thi might lead to decreas in number of car in twenti year .
