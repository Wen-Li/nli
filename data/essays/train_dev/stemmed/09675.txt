life come onli onc , henc one must enjoy each and everi moment in hi life , and live without that voic in the back of hi mind that say i didnt enjoy hi life one as much as i should have had . life is like a flower which ha to bloom and which want to enjoy in the sun . youth is the stage in life when one ha the time of hi life . at youth the young man is full of energi , at a tender age he spend most of hi time play with doll , draw or anyth which amus him . then in teenag , young peopl enjoy amongst their friend circl . not onli that these young peopl will tri to enjoy each and everi time of their life by do the most absurd thing which one cant even ever think of , like me when i wa young - me and my friend would occasion ring the bell of our neighbour and run away . everi one in hi life might have done someth or the other equal thrill in their live . if you look at it you will mostli believ that one enjoy day are onli dure the youth , but who said that old peopl can not enjoy ? their live arent over they still can have fun . take my grandpar for exampl . just becaus they are old doesnt mean that they can not have fun . my grandpar still enjoy by visit place which they couldnt at young age becaus of educ . although i know that due to these illustr it seem that young peopl have an edg over the young one with respect to enjoy and if i were question if `` young peopl enjoy life more that olden peopl do '' , then i would say that a difficuli question my friend , the older peopl had an equal enjoy when they themselv were young , similarli to the young one , i would say enjoy isnt over for you guy as yet , u have the rest of ur life to live ...
