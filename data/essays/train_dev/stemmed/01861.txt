a broad knowledg is veri import in human be becaus it permit to have a gener background off mani thing that involv our life . in my opinion a broad knowledg should be the first thing that we have to reach . after thi , we can special in the specif subjet that we prefer . i also think that we ca n't choos our way without know sever subject , becaus it is veri difficult to know what we like whitout tri it . thi is also the way that the school is organ . dure our first year of school we studi gener theme such as histori , literatur , mathemat etc. that give us a wide format . when we continu our studi we more and more special in a subject . in fact at univers there are a lot of specif subject and lack of gener one . i think that thi is well done becaus today the job are veri special and industri for exampl need special peopl to reach some import project . i can give an exampl of my univers : i studi engin and in i saw that a project alway involv a lot of aspect of studi , so it 's veri import anoth import point is that today 's work is often organ in team compos by variou special peopl . these team can sure do someth more becaus anyon give hi better qualiti . but we can forget that the gener thing learnt in first year of school form us like men outsid the job . a gener known is import in everyday life . in conclus i think that is veri import have a broad knowledg of mani acaden subject but thi have to be the start point for special in what we love . and first of all we alway have to rememb that we will never finish to learn !
