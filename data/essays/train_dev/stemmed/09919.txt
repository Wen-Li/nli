the issu at hand is , whether student today give enough time to help their commun . i believ that given the amount of other , mandatori activ that student are involv in , they are do the best we can to give back more than our fair due to the societi , by partak in sever unpaid volunt task and take small , yet meaning measur to eas the day to day live of the commun 's member . firstli , in term of educ , school is a form of give back to the societi , for it provid the knowledg we need in order to pursu effect ani commun servic we may wish . for exampl , if i wish to help renov the commun church 's wall , i will need a proper eduact basi with regard to acquir the requir fund , hire the right peopl , train the labor , etc . despit the tremend workload involv in today 's school , student are still taught the import of societ welfar . after school program help student take initi to improv their neigborhood . moreov , student today volunt for sever unpaid task . i person partak regularli in distribut the commun newspap , for more than the recognit i receiv from other , i find pleasur in help bring them the news they need to be awar of the commun event today . also , mani student work mani hour in local hospit , daycar center , etc. to give someth back to their commun . although the initi to do so may be to add plus-point to their resum , at the end , everi student feel satisfi and happi to have given back someth to their commun and ask his/her friend to volunt as well . lastli , commun servic doe not have to necessarili refer to drastic measur to renov the societi . mere ask a friend or a total stranger to quit smoke , help elderli citizen cross a street , help a lost child find hi way back home at night are day to day gener action that go unrecogn , and often do not count as ` give time ' to help the commun . in conclus , help the commun that help rais them is an aspect that young peopl recogn to be essenti valu . they give back to their commun in everi way they can , whether it be volunt at a hospit , help renov the church , or simpli , help an elderli woman cross the street .
