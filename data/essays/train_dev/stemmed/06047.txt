there are mani form to travel to somewher , mani peopl prefer to travel alon , other in a group , some of them without tour guid and other acompani or led by a tour guid . i think that the best way is travel in a group led by a tour guid for the follow reason : you know where are you go in order to have a secur , you increas your knowledg from the tour guid about other place , and you save time to do other activ . firt of all , it is import to know where you are go in order to have a secur . there are mani place to know in the world or just in your countri . the place look nice on the pictur howev each place ha it particular risk that we do not know loke the pictur . i rememb when i went to amazona river without tour guid , i had a bad experi in thi trip . secondli , if you travel to somewher it is a good idea to learn about thi place and improv your knowledg about other place . the best way to learn is hide a tour guid becaus they are train and they know veri well the place that you are visit . i rememb an experi in machu pichu . when i arriv to cuzco my group look for a tour guid . we realli enjoy in thi trip becaus the guid teach us everyth , he gave us all the histor of everi place . final , be led by a tour guid is a good idea to save time in your trip , becaus you are not worri about the map or you are not worri about the name of the differ place . howev in thi time you can enjoy more visit other place or write your histori or write email to your friend . definitelli , i recomend it is a good idea to enjoy more in your trip be led by a tour guid . in summari , there are more advantag have a tour guid like to support a job , to make other friend ( guid ) in other countri , but i consid that the most import reason are : secur , knwoledg , and time .
