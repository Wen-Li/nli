i disagre that it is more import for student to anderstand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . one of the most import fact that student should know is idea and concept are not more import that fact . becaus of tow reason . the first one is idea alway can chang by the time and place . the scienc alway chang a lot of idea about what we think in the past . for exampl peopl think in the past the earth is flat and the sun move around the earth , but with the time scienc discov that all of that is wrong . the second one is student can not egnor the fact , which other peopl conclod them in veri long time , use larg number of reaserch and experinc . howev there is a lot of idea chang our world by sciens the chang there life and humen distini by good idea , but that is not a reason to look to the idea as afact we should except all the time weather it right or wrong . some time peopl can get a lot of idea in the same time they will chang . all of these reason are so import that make student understand that idea and concept are not import than fact .
