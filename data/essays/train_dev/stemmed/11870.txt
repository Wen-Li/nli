for my part i disagre with the idea that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . thi goe back to a variti of reason . primarili car today are indispens to go to work for a lot of peopl . secondari car are more than that , their use is comfort . what also matter a lot is the lack of an altern . and there are no factor prospect , which could chanc the need of car dure the next twenti year . first of all car are neccessari for mani peopl to reach their place of work . both of my parent can onli get to work by car sinc the way are to individu and partli to wide to make use of public transport . if you consid big citi , you can not alway make use of public transport . especi in smaller citi , where public transport may onli exist in small or even doe not exist at all and take a bike is not possibl either , you realli need a car . furthermor i can not see ani reason , whi thi state of be should chang dure the next twenti year . there will be no doubt . have a car to get from one place to anoth is - with few except - the fast and therefor most comfort way . sinc peopl desir gain all amenti possibl thez supposedli will not give them up voluntarili . everyon , who one had the comfort of owe a car appreci it . so i can so no reason in the futur whz thi would chanc , either . lastli we lack an altern . there is no more convieni way to travel and there are so mani job in the car busi . in decreas in consum would help to kill manz thousand job . worldwid car produc industri hold so manz job . their fall apart would be fatal . furthermor the world inhabit a veri strong lobbi concern the oil busi , which will be interest in a further need and consumpt of their oil . here anoth job give area exist that manz peopl depend on . i can not see that the influenc politician might chanc that . still a lot of car are sold and , in my opinion will be sold . world popul doe decreas in the industri state slightli , but it will not have the effect , that less car will be in use in twenti year . consid the fact it may be a good thing , if there were fewer car for thi would help our environ get healthier again . even so the need and lack altern will not chanc the amount of car dure the next twenti year .
