i am agre with thi statement becaus the success peopl tri new thing and take risk than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . to support thi idea i will use some simpl exampl and other simpl reason . for exampl i think that everi professor of the most import univers in europ and unit state are good ( it is a reason assumpt for me !!! ) , clever and are abl to do well their job , but onli few of these can becom famou in the world win the nobel ! who win thi , win becaus hi studi or hi research is revolutionari and veri import . to be revolutionari you have to studi someth new and you have to take risk . anoth exampl is that mani person can play a music instrument , but onli veri few peopl becom famou and rememb in the histori of music , thank to their innov style of their music . from thi two simpl exampl it is easi to see that a lot of person are abl to do well someth , but the success person studi or creat someth innov and just for thi they take risk . mani time the research of succ doe not go well and you can lose time and other thing , but for me , take the risk , it is the price that you have to pay if you want to tri to have succ .
