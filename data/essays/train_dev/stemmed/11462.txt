i agre with the statement . the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . peopl travel in order to enjoy and take a break from our routin . some peopl travel for pleasur purpos but the main reason for travel is to see new place and meet new peopl . we can not meet new peopl unless we do not travel in group and as far as se new place is concern , we can not know the histori of the place without have sumon told it to us . a person who ha all the knowledg about the past present and the futur of a monument , citi or a countri . thi knowledg is best given to a travel by tour guid . travel alon doe not serv the purpos of travellin itself . we go to new place and want to explor them but we are unabl to becaus we are new to the place and do not know where to go and what to do . a tour guid leed us to the right place and the tell us thing we would never know if it wasnt told to us . speciali histor monument . there is a reason behind everi histor structur ever made and visit the structur and not know when , whi and by who wa it made is like see the pictur in a book and say we have read it . onli a tour guid ha the knowledg and the commun skill to make the peopl more familiar to a new place . we have heard about the say ` the more the merrier ' , thi is the right way to describ a trip taken in a group . when there are other travel with us we not onli get to know them and make new friend but they also add to the whole experi of travel by share their background , cultur and experi . the kind of excit it add to your trip is worth it . what do peopl get by tarevl alon ? not even half the experi of the peopl who travel in a group led by a tour guid . becaus they have n't met new peopl , made new friend , gather knowledg about the place they have visit . for a person like me who love to talk and make friend and learn from my experi of travel to new place with new peopl there can not be a better option for travel other than travel in a group led by a tour guid .
