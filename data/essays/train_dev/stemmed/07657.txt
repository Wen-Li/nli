base on my previou experi , i am total in agreement that it is more import for student to understand concept than learn fact . i have realiz when a person understand the concept and the reason behind of thi concept , it is easier to keep it in the memori for a long time . and to make thi happen , the student must be will to ask all the question need to clarifi the concept dure the class . in thi case , teacher are the main contributor to make student understand the idea . that mean , teacher should use the follow process to better explain a concept dure class : first , mention the background of the idea ; second , explain the idea what is about , includ exampl and consequ ( if ani ) ; and third , translat thi concept in a realist or insight situat where student will be relat with . have said thi , if the teacher follow thi flow , it will be veri easi for student to understand the concept and store it in their brain for a long time without memor . on the other hand , when student are learn fact , there is a high probabl to forget them veri easili in the short term . the common mistak that student usual do when they have an exam in the next day , they start memor everyth as it is the easiest way to get a good grade . wherea , teacher also do mistak . proffesor develop their test base on the theori expos dure class . thi test are normal veri hard data driven and that whi student alway memor fact as they alreadi know that the test will just ask for those fact rather than put in practic the concept learn . in conclus , there is an opportun area for both student and teacher to know how to learn and teach concept and idea , respect , in order to improv the educ system .
