some student learn onli fact , while other are abl to understand the idea and the concept that deriv from those fact . accord to me , that i am a student and so i 'm realli concern about thi , onli learn a fact without learn someth from it it 's unus , as student are n't memori machin but they have also emot and some fact can touch them . for exampl , if i have to follow a lesson , which speak about the progress movement , obvious i will learn all the fact that had deriv from thi movement and i will be interest in learn it , but onli thi will not satisfi me . in fact i think that it will be more use and more interest if i can go insid thi movement and understand which are the reason whi thi movement wa creat , what wa the background of that period , what wa the most import thing that push peopl who belong to thi movement to act in that way . .. otherwis , i do n't learn noth that can help me to improv myself , as i 've onli learn a seri of fact without have understood them . anoth reason is that , if student are taken insid the fact , they will be more involv and so they can appasion to it and will follow everi lesson pay more attent . for thi reason , i think that see film which speak about a particular event , is a thing which can help student to learn thi event , as film do n't describ onli a fact , but allow us to share the emot of everi charact who is involv in the event . in conclus , i think that onli learn a fact is a void learn as it doe n't help peopl to improv themselv , so i will ever tri , everytim that i will approach to learn someth , to understand idea and concept at the basi .
