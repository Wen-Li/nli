i realli do not agre with that statement . i have made a lot of travel with group and alon and i have strong reason to prefer hang by myself . first of all , whenev you go somewher with a group you have to move by the schedul that a tour guid or an agenc alreadi made for you . you are not free to get up at the time you want or visit other place than the expect one . so , by the end of the trip you will never know if you realli knew a new place or visit tourist sight . secondli , peopl in group do not usual show respect for each other . what is more , they are mainli form by an agenc than by particular interest . in thi way , you are forc to hang around with peopl you might not choos to be special a close friend . you have to wait , for exampl , to those who are alway late and you lose time you have alreadi paid on those wait , besid your convers never grow in deep . i think travel alon is much better . first of all , special if you are on your holiday , you do not have to share or discuss your desit with anybodi . it happen to me last year , when i wa on a group journey , that we were alway argu about what place to visit or even what to eat . on holiday , your are so tire of the whole year that argu with someon exhaust more than relax . thu , i like visit place that most of the tourist not , for exampl museum , old build and cultur centr . whi should i spend my time visit place i am not interest in or discuss my prefer with person i know will not share them ?
