i am agre wih the statem . i have three reason whi i 'm support the statement . first , it is natur make product seem much better than they realli are . advertis is economi . so , make product seem much better is nurtur . pleas imagin . for exampl , food . if the advertis in food do n't look like delici , most peopl will not buy becaus it seem tast bad . then , economi doe n't work . nobadi buy it , then , the product disappear . the reasn whi most peopl buy the product is influenc in advertis . at least , japan , most peopl are influenc by advertis . in fact , i 'm one of them . second , advertis is competit between mani compani . how they can make the peopl to buy it or how make their product look like good . it is true that the product which i bought wa bad . howev , it show that how the advertis have big influenc . final , you know that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . you shoud rememb thet . i think make prduct seem much better is bad thing . but , abov all , it is economi . so , we ca n't do anyth . all we have to do is rememb that most advertis make product much better than they realli are .
