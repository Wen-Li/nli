the best way to trevel is not in a group lead by a tour guid . becaus everi person need the oportun to explor new placessbi themself . with a tourist guid you will onli see what the guid show you in fact you can find a whole world and new experi by yoursel that a guid will not show you . it beatiful when you can explor and touch thing by yourself without the nessec of somebodi tell you everi littl thing you are watch or do . explor and discov new place it like a kid opennig a gift . it exit and an experi that you will never forget . a tourist guid will aluey guid you for famou and import place for the societi or for the world , that mean you can lost a lot of place that are out of the rout of the guid , you will be onli listen and look at the thing they told you to or the place they take you and you will be alway with a group it also can be good but it better to experi thing by yourself in my pinion you will never know the place you go until you interact with the peopl ore until you live real experi in that palc , i think that with a tour guid you olnli will see the surfac of the place and you will miss thing that may be hide , the experi by yourself can be more funni and extrem . in concluss i think that to realli visit a place or to realli know a place peopl should travel by themself , they will see palc that a guid willn not show them and they wuill live experi that are not for a group experi with themself , it possibl to get lost but it will be an adventur that nowbodi showld lost
