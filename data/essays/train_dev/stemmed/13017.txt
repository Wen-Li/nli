i agre that young pepol nowaday do not give their communit the requir time in order to help them in a suffici way , ther are mani reason that support my point of view , and i will discuss them here . first of all , young peopl nowaday tend to spend their time in unus activit without be care of the import of their behaviour , they want to spend their free time speak with their friend about unimport thing , such as a televis seri , consequ , they will not find enough time to help poor peopl or to improv agood idea in order to serv the local peopl in their commun , such as , clean the street and plant tree . second , young pepol prefer invest their time do their special work and requir , rather than particip in a common activ that will benifit the other . they see that their time is own for them onli . third , each one of them want to be the best , so he/sh tri not to help the other and not to enhanc ani thing around him like the educ in his/her commun . he/sh like to get the best chnce , oppurtin and to depriv the other from them . in conclus , i agre that young restrect their time on themselv and not to benifit their commun .
