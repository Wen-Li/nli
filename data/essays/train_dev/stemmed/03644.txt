i think that have a board knowledg of mani academ subject is not what our era necessit . in our time , it seem to be more import , and more await to be a real expert on one specif subject . thi thought of mine ha mani reason behind it . first of all , i do n't think that a broad knowledg on mani subject could be use , as long as with such a knowledg one can not be realli comfort with all of those subject , on which he claim to have a knowledg , and with know a littl from everyth , it is realli easi to get confus when you studi , or prepar a project . actual , that is whi teamwork is import in busi life . sinc a project can not be prepar by one person , it is distribut among a group accord to the special of member of that group . thu special is favour in industri . secondli , i do not think that such a broad knowledg is need in industri , though special in one field is necessari to have a succes career . sinc at our level of technolog everyth is hidden in detail , and thought that make differ are at minor scale , one should be abl to observ the subject , and problem that he is work on with all aspect . accord to my opinion , an understand that through , and detail is onli possibl with high level of specialis . thirdli , a broad acedem knowledg mean that person work on veri mani , and irrelev topic . ye , with such a work style you are work on a wide rang of subject , and you are continu chang your studi topic , and you know some of everyth , and you seem to be success with a lot of work field you have , but you lack one , and a veri import thing : experi . experinc is , mayb , the most want special of a person , that is to be in high level of hi career . it had becom to thi that , experi is the key to a succes busi life . and i do not think that a broad academ knowledg distract one 's focu , thu gain experi is harder with that kind of knowledg , than the case with a specialis field .
