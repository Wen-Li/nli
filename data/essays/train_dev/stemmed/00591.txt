i disagre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are sever reason and exampl which i would like to cite in support to my posit , which can be enlist as follow . the young peopl i.e the group of peopl between the age group of eighteen and twenty-f who are mostli graduat and under graduat will have lot of work to be done in the univers in term of assign , mid term exam , publish research paper , submit a thesi at a colleg or univers , etc and it would be unfair on the commun peopl to help them in the social work . all the young peopl who are studi at univers may not be rich enough to pay their semest fee and those will have to pay the fee by work at part time job such as cafetaria , assistantship , etc . and the most import to say is it is not the unwilling of the young peopl to help commun that is stop them to help communitybut it is the time and livelihood factor which influenc their attitud toward their commun . secondli , the commun in which the young peopl live is also an import factor . if it is a commun with divers religion with frequent quarrel between the religion of the commun then it is veri difficult to get togeth the youngster of the commun to work for a singl caus that is to work for a singl commun . an exampl of thi type of commun is ani citi in countri like india , iran , iraq , etc . thirdli , the help the commun need also is an import factor i.e the type of help the commun need from the youngster if the help is small there no need for all the young peopl to look after it and instead my best opinion wuould be to take the advis of some sever senior wiser men of that commun insta of catch hold of young peopl yo get help . to sum up , the assert that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun is wrong and in my opinion all the problem ( small ) must be look after by the commun head .
