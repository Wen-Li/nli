i agre with the statement that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . first , with the pressur increas , some student focu on their studi most of the time . for exampl , in our countri , we have to get up around 6 o'clock and go to school at 7 . and most of us will go to cram school after school . the time that we arriv home is around 10p.m.we also have a lot of work to do at home . so we do n't have enough time for sleep , needless to say help our commun . besid , most of young peopl now are more care about themselv . they work part-tim job veri hard to earn money to make themselv prettier or buy more thing they like . they even do n't care about their parent . what their commun becom is not a big deal . it is common to see that someon call help on the street but no one give a hand . also , most young peopl just know how to play comput game or watch tv . they do n't know how to clean their bedroom , pick up trash on the street or take care of other . if they have free time , they will plan to hang out with their friend instead of help their commun . howev , they do n't know that by helpn commun can make them learn more . commun are just like a small scocieti . help each other , especi in your neighborhood , can earn a lot of preciou experi that may use in the futur . there is no doubt that teenag do n't give enough time to help their commun . thi may becom a seriou problem that need more concern of our scocieti .
