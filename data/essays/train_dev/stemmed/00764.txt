i disagre with the statement provid . becaus car are the effici transport of a man.car are the easiest mean of transport for the man today . if the man want to lead a luxuri life he must have a car . in the modern day car ha becom the statu symbol for a man . i dont have ani sort that there will be fewer car in twenti year than today , as the popul of the world is grow , we cant say that the use of car will be less as compar now . if the usag of car is less then what the peopl are go to use ? when compar to all the vehicl that are avail now in the mark , the best transport that fit a famili is car , which is afford by a common man . if one ha to travel from one place to anoth , everytim he can not afford to go by aeroplan , train , when he is have the cheaper mean of transport . if a person ha a car of hi own , he doe n't have to reli on the public transport such as buse , train , truck , aeroplan etc . though there are other mean of transport one should have a own vehicl such as car . if he ha a car it is use to him at ani part of the day . the need and desir of a man suggest to have a car . a man ha to face problem if he doesnot have a car . if he ha to travel urgent without wast time he ha to prefer a car of a flight . the charg for the flight would be veri expens , so the man prefer to go by car . if he ha to go by mean of public transport , lot of time will be wast for him as he ha to go to the nearbi statin earli to book a ticket and he ha to wait for the bu to go . so i dont agre with the abov statement . henc car are not go to be fleet and they are the onli mean of transport which are go to be use by everi person . henc there will be more car than today , twenti year from now .
