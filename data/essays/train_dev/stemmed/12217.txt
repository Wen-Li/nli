the issu of that life is more appreci by the young peopl rather than old peopl is a controversi one . on the one hand when a person is old she appreci life in a better way . on the other hand certain young peopl consid that youth must discov lifer rather than studi . howev , in the final analysi i believ that an older peopl enjoy life more than certain young peopl do . one of the reason of my belief is that studi are too import to be sacrifi by an edonist behaviour . inde , everi person who made studi and who have had a knowledg enjoy life with benefict . more than a person who decid to leav studi for enjoy life . the abbl of speak differ languag is the greatest exampl . to my mind enjoy life would say bring to anoth peopl with anoth cultur and anoth languag . anoth way to justifi my point of view is that life experi allow to discov more subtil of life . for instanc love decept , familli death allow to take the time to discov and apprecait life . generali is not the case of young peopl . the life experi bring some knowledg or behaviour that it is imposs to learn without experi . it is probabl a empir pompou speech , but for me experi is veri import . last but not least , i am firmli convinc that the life is veri interest to discov but with money thi becom amazz . when i say that i think particulali to trip abrov in some part of the world . for exampl a trip in asia for an occident person allow to discov a new cultur and to enjoy life . howev thi trip is imposs without money . for all these reason i believ that the age and the experi are necessari to enjoy life . in fact , we can not pass our young year to studi and wait to discov the world and , by the occaion the life , but it is an hisytori of compromis .
