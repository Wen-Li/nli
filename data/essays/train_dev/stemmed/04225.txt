i strongli believ that in twenti year , there will not be fewer car in use than there are today . i will present an econom argument and current trend in automot develop to support my belief . i think what the statement is allud to is the fact that oil is becom ever more scarc . after all , we can not run our car without the right fuel . let 's consid thi situat from an econom perspect . the theori of suppli and demand will show that with an increas in price of oil , the demand for car will decreas , sinc the two are complimentari good . intuit , we know from our everi day experi that we tend to consum less of a good if the price goe up . howev , our depend on car is so great that despit rise price , our demand will continu to increas . for instanc , imagin a world where you have no access to car . travel would becom a nightmar . not onli that , our economi will suffer from the slow movement of good and the factor of produciton . due to such unforgiv circumst , firm , consum , politician and dictat alik would choos to pay the higher price rather than suffer the econom consequ . consid the world 's present econom develop , with the emerg economi of china and india , it is like that the demand for car would increas in the futur , sinc more peopl will have the incom to be abl to purchas car . secondli , there is no signific progress in develop suitabl altern to car . research in thi area ha been go on for a long time and remain to be activ . howev , current propos of har the power of atom fusion and hydrogen fuel are not like to be accept , due to the danger involv . instead , i think we are head in the direct of tri to improv the effici of car . for exampl , we are develop hybrid car , which run on a combin of electr and oil , which are about twice more effici than the convent car we drive today . my current knowledg of econom and common sens dictat that the number of car will actual increas in the next twenti year .
