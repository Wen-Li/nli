the lack of social commit among young ha been a common percept sinc alway . it is veri common to listen on media or simpli when old peopl are chat , that yougster don-t particip or that they are not interest on the commun problem . howev , i disagre complet with thi opinion , not onli becaus i think that it is onli a prejudic , but also becaus from my own experi i can state the oposit . on one hand , the base in with the opinion that yougnster don-t give enough time to help their commun lay is the comparison with the behaviour of older peopl nowaday and in the past , when they were young . in the first case , it seem to me that there is no data to support ani differ behaviour between the differ gener . in my opinion , what creat thi percept is the recal or past day , which never is accur . in the second case , i think that the great demonstr that happen dure the 60 and 70 relat with the war that took place and the stress between the eastern and western block help in a larg extent to magnifici the fals impress that youngster use to be more commit . on the other hand , i can say from my own experi that young peopl dedic time to help their commun . i collabor as a volunt in a local ong and there , the great major of the volunt are as young as me or even younger . but young peopl are also commit with their commun in mani other way that perhap are no so visibl as struggl in demonstr . i have friend who form part of polit parti and who are veri activ in ani action that is carri out into the commun . in conclus , young peopl is as commit with their commun as they use to be . the reason whi it is believ that their commit ha chang is that the way of particip help the commun are less visibl , as can be an ong .
