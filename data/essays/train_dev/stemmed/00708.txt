a lot of peopl are say that , in twenti year , car might start disappear slowli . but is thi predict relev ? our modern world is go to face , in a few decad , mani issu relat to oil and the fact that our civilis is nearli a hundr percent base on it consumpt . inde , oil resourc are not etern and some consequ of it incom lack are alreadi be face : price are go up and import polit decis ( such as go to war ) are be taken . moreov , virtual all scientist agre that the greenhous effect is go to chang our world if we do n't do someth . all those thing might lead to the slow discreas of the number of car . they pollut too much and might becom too expens . but , to me , say that thi chang will occur within twenti year is fals . inde , specialist estim that the oil resourc will still last for fifti year . moreov , develop countri , like china or india , are becom huge custom of the car industri . all thi tend to say that the number of car will still grow for , at least , twenti year . .. but yet , some chang can be seen around the world : new type of car are be creat . thu , i think that the car will never desc : it is just go to evolv to meet our need ! car will be run with new type of energi like hydrogen or solar energi . they might becom smaller that the car we know , includ an autopilot mode , have a total differ shape or even fli . but still they will be car ! the concept of car will never disappear becaus peopl need their independ , they need to feel free to go where ever they feel like and on their own . thi is to say that public transport wo n't ever outcom car . .. so the car of the futur wo n't , probabl , look like or even run like the one we have now , it might be a plane , a car and a boat at the same time , but it will never disappear . all thi make me think that say the number of car will decreas in a twenti year time is irrealist .
