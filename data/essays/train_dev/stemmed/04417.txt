i believ that peopl will use much more car in twenti year . i have two reason to support thi . first , the popul of the world continu to grow . in most of the develop contri , the speed of the growth of the popul is acceral . if there will be lot more peopl in the futur , there will be much more demand for the car . especi , the ratio of the peopl who have a car in develop contri is not so high . so there could be a great market oppotun for automak . and the automak are now make the strategi to take the share for the pie , as we are abl to see them in their annual strateg report . second , the car will be much cheaper in the futur . now automak are tri to make their car in china and other asian contri . thi enabl them to make their car much cheaper . that 's becaus , they can cut the salari of workier who work in the plant to make car . so that mani peopl , even in develop contri , will be abl to afford a car . howev , i do n't think the same type of car that we are now use will be use in the futur . the enegi they use to move car will chang , as the crude oil which we need to make gasolin is not enough for us to use continu in the futur . theseday , the automak are tri to develop car which move by use some other enegi like hydrogen , solar power , electr power and so on . the car which use new technolog are still expenc . howev , in the futur , i 'm sure they will be much cheaper . in conclus , i 'm against the statement . there will be more peopl live in the world , and the cost to have the car will be cheaper . so , the car will be use a lot more than now .
