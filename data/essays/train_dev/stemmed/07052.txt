in my opinion i think it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject instead ofspeci in one specif subject . i believ it is not so easi to special jonli in one thing becaus there will be alway someth you will not be abl to know . suppos you are a person who ha been alway interest in one thing dure hi life : peopl would expect him to have alway the right answer at the right time . but what happen if the person doe not know the answer ? peopl will be disappoint and will consid the person not so well prepar as they thoughtbecaus is not even abl to answer to what he ha to know . sever often it is easier to criticis instead of ask ourselv whi the `` specialist '' could not answer the question . it is also import to consid that the specialist will be disappoint too becaus he could not demostr he is a real specialist . he may start doubt about himself and he mayb give up about what he is do . in order to avoid thi embarass situat , you may prefer to have a broad knowledg about sever and differ subject . i think there are two reason for it . first of all , you can improv your cultur background and you will alway be abl to understand most of the topic peopl may discuss . the other thing is that peopl will come to you ask some help . if you can help them , you will impress them and they will realiz you are a person with a good educ ; if you can not help them , they will understand you becaus they know you are not a specialist and you are not suppos to know everyth .
