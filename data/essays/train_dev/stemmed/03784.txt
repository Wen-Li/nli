i do n't agre with thi statement for differ aspect . first of all , the school offer me the possibl to know a lot of inform about all theme and it offer me the possibl to tell my opinion about differ argument . all these thing are veri interest and import but i often see that what we learn in abstract it often it doesn ' respect realiti . the most interest exampl that i can do to explain thi point is the univers . i 'm a student of the last year in manag engeen and in all these year i 've studi a lot of mathemat model and way that explain how it 's possibl to manag a compani . in these last month i went to interview differ compani for my final project about perform manag . in these interview i realiz that their way to work is veri differ from the model that teacher explain to me in the differ cours that i follow to the univers . sure the basic inform are the same , but the real work is veri differ to the concept and idea that i studi . for thi motiv i believ that idea and concept are veri import to a student to learn and to undestand but all thi is onli the underground know-how that everyon must have . that it is veri import and to tri to appli what we know to the realiti and to tri to larn especi from what happen everyday .
