i do not agre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all , car industri is now develop veri fast in the develop countri such as china and india . these countri have larg number of popul . larg popul mean big potenti of car comsum . peopl live in these countri are becom richer and richer . therefor , more and more peopl in these countri are abl to buy a car . in the futur 20 year , the number of these group of peopl will grow bigger so there would be more car in develop countri in twneti year . secondli , in develop countri , most of the famili have their own car . car play a veri import part in peopl 's livi . peopl will feel veri unconveni if they do not have a car . thi situat will chang littl in twenti year . although scientist ha creat mani kind of new tranfic machin , none of them could take the place of car . car have influenc peopl 's livi so signific that it is imposs to chang the situat in twenti year . thirdli , the style of car may chang a lot in the futur . it is true that resourc on the earth are declin veri fast . it is also possibl that one day we would have no petrol to fill our car . howev , i believ that human be can find new resourc use for car to take the place of petrol . in fact , nowaday there are mani car which use electr . i think thi techolog will be veri use in twenti year . it is much more practic and cheaper to improv the car than to creat a total new trafic machin to solv the resourc problem . car have serv peopl all around the world for nearlli 100 year . car industri and car scienc have improv a lot in these year . i think scientist could find out new way to make car more use , more suitabl , more clean and more popular . to sum up , it is veri possibl that there will be more car in use than there are today .
