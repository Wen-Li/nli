there are lot of perspect and opinion about the number of car in use in the futur . some peopl think that we will have plenti of car as the day are go by , howev , i definit think that we have fewer car in our futur than today . i 'd like to repres my argument base on the three follow reason : the shortag of fuel , the mass transport , and restrict . first of all , we are go to face the shortag of fuel . as we know , car definit reli on fossil fuel such as oil and ga . without fuel , no car can be move and work . current and futur situat relat to the shortag of fuel will lead us to hesit to buy and produc new car . furthermor , develop in our scienc allow lot of countri to build well-develop mass transport such as subway and express train and convien bu system . increasingli , peopl will prefer to util mass transport rather than to drive their own car when shop , go to work , and travel . develop system in mass trasnsport will casus a revolutionari commut habit to citi dweller . lastli , we are expect government restict on use car in near futur . current in my home countri , car driver have to pay high tax and fee for caus trafffic jam and environment burden . environemntalist strongli suggest that car produc and car purchas have to pay more money for use car . in addit , mani peopl agre to the idea becaus they want to take clean air in . govern ha no choic but impos more fee and tax for use car , and will creat variou way to prohibit car owner from use car . in short , i absolut believ that we will have fewer car on the road in near futur base on the above-ment reason . shortag of fuel and government restrict will make driver hesit and at the same time , they will choos to take mass transport .
