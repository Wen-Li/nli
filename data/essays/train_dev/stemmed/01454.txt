i disagre with the idea that the number of the car in use will declin in two decad . there are two reason for thi : convini and necess . first , car are realli convini . it enabl you to carri a lot of thing when you go shop and to go mani sight like seasid area . recent survey show that two third of famili in rural area of japan have their own car to parchas thing , go to work and so on . thi fact illustr that car are necessari for these peopl . thi trend is not go to be chang in twenti year as long as rural area exist . moreov , car are demand even in citi area . you can see much traffic jam in tokyo , osaka . and nagoya . so , peopl will continu to enjoy the convini of the car . the second reason is that car are necessari for develop countri and countri which have big soil . car play an import role to develop a countri . for exampl , thing which is use to make haus must be transport by car . big countri ca n't make train rail
