i do not agre with the statement that there will be fewer car around in twenti year than there are now . in my opinion , the number of car will either stay the same or increas . there are sever reason which support my opinion . first of all , i think that our societi , at least in the first world , is so advanc and program on a continu progress that we would not be happi about take a step backward by reduc the number of car . i could not imagin live without a car . peopl in today 's societi have gotten so use to have car that they even reli on them in sever case . a man , for exampl , who work in an offic which doe not have ani connect with the public transport network can not get to hi offic without a car . moreov , one can tell from the develop concern the car busi that there ha alway been an increas of the number of car sinc the invent of the first car . thi fact make me suggest that thi develop will continu in the futur as well . besid that point , there is also anoth reason which need to be mention . even though peopl know about the environment problem which car fume caus and even though most of them are also awar of the fatal consquenc thi could have , such as pollut of the air and destruct of the ozon layer , thez do not intend to chang anyth . most of them simpli get on with their live , drive their car as usual . consequ , it can be said that most peopl think of the consequ as still be far awaz from them and their person fate . they do not realiz the disastr consequ of their behaviour becaus they do not show up that clearli at the moment . howev , there is still an even more import reason whi i do not think that the number of car will decreas in the next twenti year . in my opinion , there might be a point of time when more peopl actual start to worri about the environ and the effect of use car . anyway , i do not think that thi will caus the number of car to shrink but that it will rather lead to an increas in research and develop of new technolog which prevent the car fume to harm the environ .
