everybodi ha differ opinion and thought about the upcom gener . some peopl doe n't think that young peopl give enough time to help their commun . as a young person i agre with thi statement and i think that young peopl can do more to help their commun . everi countri is rais the children with differ cultur , that whi i just can give opinion about my countri . nowaday , we see that most of the crimin are young peopl . i ca n't realli say that it is all the young peopl fault . i do n't think the commun is help young peopl with their problem also , which make us come to thi point . if the commun is not give enough attent to the young peopl , they ca n't expect young peopl to help their commun also . i know that young peopl are the survivor of their countri . they have alot of responsibilti for the commun . most peopl expect them to do better stuff than they are do now . there is a big gener gap between our parent and us . they do everyth to help their commun and we have to take them as a role model for us , but becaus of thi gener gap young peopl just do n't think it is veri interest . i know that young peopl doe n't help the commun but we have to think thi statement from a differ point of view also . they are young peopl and they have their own problem which make them think that it is more import then the world . i am sure that no matter which countri they are from it is all same with young peopl . that is not fair to put the responsibilti of the commun to their shoulder . i am sure that nowaday young peopl are go to be good adult which help their commun and go to have alot of responsibilti .
