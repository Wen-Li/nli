i thing the statement '' young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help thier commun '' is wrong and right . you have to look at all aspect thi statement give us . on one hand exist enough peopl who do not interesst for commun . these peopl are in their own world and could onli see their own problem . sure , you have to manag your own life first till you can help other peol but there are also peopl who have a good life and no problem and are not interesstest in social life . on the other side there are mani young peopl , who are visit old peol or do other nice thing . the problem nowaday is the polit . if the polit would not be as bad as it is in the moment , younger peopl would have their head free for other thing like the commun . for exampl , the problem to get a job is a veri difficult thing . mani factori - owner want to have good worker who should not be silli . so the not intellig person are not get a job . if you have no job you can not buy food or can not rent a appart . when a young person ha a problem like thi , that he or she mayb ha to sleep at the street , he/sh can not look after the commun . sometim also the problem exist that peopl want to help , but they can not becaus the social-hous are in a bad vioc . if that happen there is no use for the biggest help . so all in all you can see that for everi statement you have to look at mani aspect to get a result . but in the end i think the statement is right becaus young peopl have their own thing they have to do and could not care about so much aspect in their town . and in the end you can see that everi person is a littl bit egoism . that is veri dissapoint but the truth .
