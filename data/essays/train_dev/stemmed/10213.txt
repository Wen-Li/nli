one attempt to take risk of tri new thing when anoth doe not . in my opinion , the latter would be success in hi life . becaus when one tri to learn everyth , he doe not obtain anyth i think . first of all , it is import that one ha hi part in a group . when i wa in a volleybal team , i wa do the power hitter of the team . i especi practic for hit rather than receiv . in comparison , my teammat who were at the back side posit were particularli practic for the receiv . it is import that one tri to obatain one skill in depth rather than just to touch everyth . secondli , when i wa a kid , i alway tri to order a dessert of which i hardli ever heard of ; as a result , i mani time had hard time finish them up becaus of the weird tast or not use to them . thi illustr how new thing make peopl careless of think about choos it befor act . becaus i wa fascin by the fact that it wa a new thing to me , i did not realli care about what kind of food i like and how it will be to order it . thirdli , mani peopl who can continu to keep on do one thing are expart of someth in most of the case . becaus they can remain to think about how to improv their skill of them and are abl to keep practic for such long time , they can get the skill fulli . for instanc , my ex-calligraphi teacher wa of cours realli good at calligraphi . she use to learn it sinc she wa in the elementari school and still keep on practic for herself . it is not alway easi to learn one thing for almost entir of one 's life . as a result of practic for such long time , she could becom a teacher of calligraphi . in conclus , i person believ that it is the way to success to keep focus on one thing rather than alway tri to start new thing . even though i admit that there could be more chanc to find the thing one is good at if she alway take a risk of tri , onc one find the thing to work on , there is no more need for one to find anoth one . she just need to becom an expert of it .
