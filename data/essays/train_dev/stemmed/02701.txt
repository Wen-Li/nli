i can not realli agre with the statement . in my oppinion it is better to be special in one specif subject than to have a knowledg of mani academ subject . i think in today world compani want peopl to know everyth about the area they work in . what should a compani do with someon how know from everyth a bit but doe not realli have fundament knowledg about a certain area . that is also a reason whi i decid to studi a special subject . i for exambl studi intern financ which is a small part of the big econom area . i think for myself that thi decicon the best wa i ever did . becaus their are so mani peopl who studi econom i mean good they may have a broad knowledg about all area but at the end they would not be abl to understand the financi sector as good as i can . as far i know compani are look special for peopl from the financi sector which are special in that field . which advantag and disadvantag would it have ? on the on side with a broad knowledg you might be more flexibl . becaus those peopl could work in all econom area they want . on the other side i am not sure if a broad knowledg is enough to fullfil your aim and make the big money . you can work in all econom area but to becam at top manag you should know about the fiel you are about to manag . that is a advantag me with onli a special knowledg . i would know about the area i am about to manag and would know how to handl the problem which might occur . a disadvantag realli is that i am realli stuck onto the financi sector . if i want work i am not that flexibl like i would be with a broad knowledg . but if i add up all those disadvantag and advantag it is still good for me to be onli special in one subject . i may onli have thi oppinion becaus i am veri interest in that area i am studi . but figur do not lie compani at the end prefer specialis employe .
