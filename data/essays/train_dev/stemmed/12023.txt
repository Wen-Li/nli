the field of mechan engin ha improv in sever way which is be reflect in the new gener car . it is clich that onc we get accustom to a comfort way of live then it is rather is veri tough to get rid of it . ` comfort ' and ` luxuri ' are like trap , onc we get caught we could hardli make way out of it . so thu , i disagre with thi argument that car would face a declivn in their usag . car have been the major mode of transport in the world sinc a long time . peopl util car for a varieti of reason such as - it give an enjoy , thrill and comfrtabl ride , some peopl are fanci about it , it could be util at emerg time when public transport is unavail , in order to avoid crowd in the public transport , to expos their financi statu too . car too have their neg aspect such as increas air pollut , accid etc . but these are avoid and alter aspect . pollut could be avoid by util unlead and well rectifi petrol . and peopl need to be more prudent to avoid accid . so thu we could ward offf with the two major neg aspect . the past ten year ha seen immens enhanc in the field of car manufactur . new car with more addit featur are beiong produc , which attract the peopl to it . so all of a sudden the usag of car can never ceas and there will not be ani declin in their number . i would say that there would be no feliciti reason for the car util to drop . atleast the manufacturerss would never let thi happen . thi field might show more improvementr rather than declin . technolog is show tremend improv in all way . so definit , car util will not declin . so i conclud by say that as long as human race exist the exist of car too will continu becaus we human are after all materialist and thu the craze for car will continu .
