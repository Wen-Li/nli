the issu at hand is whether it is better to have a broad academ educ or to special in certain academ disciplin or field . on the one hand , there are good reason for a varieti of academ experi . if you receiv a broader educt , your academ background will help you to be abl to work in differ kind of job . for exampl , if somebodi ha not onli studi medicin but busi administr as well , thi person will have a lot of opportun on the job market . he or she can work in a clinic as well as in a consult firm . furthermor , differ academ field provid differ approach to solv problem or to describ the world . be abl to see sever view , somebodi will gain a gener view of educt and scienc . for exampl , a student who is a candid for a degre in econom but who also doe attend some extracurricular cours in psycholog , will be abl to better understand whi poepl in econom theori act the way they do . on the other hand , it is neccessari to develop a certain profess . that is whi somebodi should focu on one academ disciplin in particular . today there is a veri strong competit at the labor market . a student who doe not special in one or two subject probabl will not be abl to succeed in a highli competit environ . for exampl recruit of lead invest bank can not employ somebodi who doe not have a detail knowledg about certain topic . moreov , time you spend on tri to get broad academ skill , can not be use to spezial in one particlur topic . thi is a trade-off-problem . when i also attend extracurricular cours , there is - in consequ - less time to deal with those cours that are neccessari to receiv a degre . thi could also lead to the aspect that is mention abov . final , after consid all these pro and con , i feel that the veri best is to focu on a certain academ disciplin and to special . mayb one extracurricular cours can be attend each term . thi will provid a solid educ and good opportun , but will use the broad suppli of a colleg or a univers in an effect way as well .
