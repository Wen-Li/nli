i did n't agre with the point of view that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . first reason is that i think travel is a veri person experi and that doe n't need mani peopl come and finish with me . second reason is that the travel agenc will bring me to a fix place and fix time to travel place that most peopl should look and that also mean i ca n't have enough time to take adventur . third reason is that most of the tour guid realli just provid limit and small inform from the tour text book . i will provid more detail about my point . the first reason i did n't like to join a travel group is that i think travel is a veri person experi that is a process of dialuat with myself . i will enjoy the singal travel experi that i can read , stay with the local resid and sit down to write when i meet what touch my heart as my wish . the second reason is that the travel agenc alway provid some limit place that cost them less money and limit the time for the travel spot . so i ca n't have some more adventur to deeper place , talk with more peopl , and take more detail on the place . that is veri piti . more over , they will bring me to some bore shop center that are alway wast my time . the third reason is the most import part to me that is the toup gide are n't local resid or they are just provid too littl inform to me . some even ca n't give me more inform except from the tour gide text book . to my point of view , i did n't agre with the point that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . becaus travel mean to me is more person , more relax time to go and to touch the thing and to understand more about where are the cultur differ . so fix time and fix place way of travel group is not just not my choic .
