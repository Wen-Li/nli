i can not agre with the statement which is that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i actual think the statement is opposit , which is older peopl have enjoy life more than young peopl have in recent year . in my countri , japan , there are mani young peopl who do not do anyth ; they are stay at home and they do not go to shcool , do not go to work , or do not do part-tim job ; they do not want to do anyth , or they do not know what they want to do . now the kind of youth have been increas , which it is a social problem in japan . thi problem is symbol the young peopl do not enjoy thier life . they get confus about their life . they do not know how they can enjoy thier life , becaus they do not have mani experi and they can not find or understand what thing they are realli interest in ; but they are stay their home . thu , they do not tri to enjoy thier life . in while older peopl know how to enjoy thier life becaus they have mani experi to find what thing they are most intererest in . and mani older peopl have work for a long time in some offic or in home as housew . so , they want to use the time for themselv thi time . they know how to use the time moreov , they have desir if they quit job , they want to go hike or travel , spent thier time for their hobbi . they tri to use the free time as they want , which is that they enjoy their life . there are two big differ between young peopl and older peopl . it can not say all young are same like non-desir peopl or all older are same like desir peopl ; howev , it is true the non-desir young peopl are increas in our societi . japan is the countri which there exit most a-long-ag peopl in all over the countri . thu , that is veri good situat , which older peopl enjoy life . they can help increas japanes life motiv especi for young peopl who do not enjoy life .
