i do n't agre with thi statement . there are some reason whi i disagre with thi statement becaus i believ that the relationship between the costom and the compani is veri import for sell the product . first of all , if a compani of a product advertis the product much better than it realli is , the custom misunderstand about the product . it mean the compani pretend the custom . when the custom notic that the advertis is not true , the custom will think that the compani pretend him or her . therefor , the custom will never buy the product . second , if the maker use an advertis which is not true , a lot of problem will happen . for exampl , when a custom bought a product which is advertis much better than it realli is and use it , and then it harm the custom becaus of the not true advertis , the custom will claim to the compani . and if the problem becom big news , the compani will get huge damag . final , if the advertis make product seem too much better than they realli are , they might be crime . in the case , the custom will never beliv the compani , and they never buy the compani 's product . to sell product , the compani need to make good relationship btween the costom and compani . for make good relationship between the custom and the compani , the compani have to give correct inform to the custom . for these reason , i disagre with thi statement .
