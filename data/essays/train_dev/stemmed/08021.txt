i agre with the statement , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . mayb to learn fact is import to student . but i think if they understand idea and concept , they will get fact , too . i think to understand idea and concept are more easi to understand , instead of just learn fact . when i studi the biolog , and histori in english , my tutor alway give me an exampl , and idea . and it is alway help to me , and i will never forget about it . for the foreign languag student , the idea and exampl are help . becaus they can not understand the english well as american do , they could not just learn fact from the book . so , the idea or concept are veri import to them to learn fact . to understand idea and cocept are more fun to do . if student get idea , concept , and exampl on the pictur , they can understand more clearli . to draw pictur or diagram , student will have fun in the class . it is like laboratori in the biolog class . the laboratori exercis is so much fun , and student can get main idea of what they are studi . i think the statement `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn facts. '' is true . if teacher and student can learn lesson togeth , and if the lesson are fun , student would like to go to school and they would like to learn in the school .
