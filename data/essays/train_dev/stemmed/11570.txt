along with chang in gener , induviu belief , thought , and reason chang . i have seen gener right from my great grand mother age down to my littl sister . for me the defin of enjoy hold a lot of signific . enjoy accord to me is a state in which an induviu attain `` ultim happi '' in what ever he or she is perform . i complet disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . to say that young peopl do not enjoy life comparit is fals and incorrect . if the defin of enjoy remain stationari , then so doe it impact on peopl life . the onli differ aris in th eway peopl perciev and interpret it to be . enjoy and relish life to the fullest can be accomplish in sever differ method . to enjoy life one doe not have to be of ani particular age limit . my sister often ask my grandmoth to go and enjoy her life and not sit in front of the televis box the whole day and eat . but my grandmoth often tell her that for her the televis and food is her ultim sens of enjoy . for my sister to parti and go out everyday with her friend is her sourc of entertain and enjoy but for someon whose old may look at it in a differ way . they may say that thi girl is spoilt she goe out everyday , but that is her sens of enjoy . the differ clearli lie in the way peopl interpret it . but accord to me my grand mother is enjoy her life as much as my sister is and she love her life to be the way it is . by watch televis it doe not make her inferior , she reciev as much as joy and happi as my sister doe by go out and parti . there is no consis defin of enjoy my grandmoth is express the ultim sens of happi she sachiev by do teh deed abov which is basic her defin of enjoy . ye , the gener have chang , technolog and scienc have advanc a lot into thi modern world of our . but emot , feel and the way to express it have all remain the same . it is import that the young gener begin to valu and respect the emot and the method of express them from the older gener .
