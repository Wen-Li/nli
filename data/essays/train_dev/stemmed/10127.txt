the reason that the younger seem to enjoy life more than the older gener is that they seem to have a greater abil to make what they desir for to come true . thi could be becaus of the greater energi level that the younger gener ha when compar to the old . the second reason is the flexibl attitut that the young can wear . they are easili adapt to the situat and chang accordingli and make the most of the thing , but on the contrari the old are not that flexibl . they do not want to chang from the normal routin work that they tri to . they are veri much use to the old work that they alway do and thu they miss enjoy on other work which they can . exampl a group of young peopl when they are out would alway like to tri out new thing which they have never befor done but old peopl are alway end up do thing that they have alway been do . but on the contrari enjoy would mean differ to differ peopl . the old grandpa of two children would find great pleasur in tell a stori to hi littl grandchildren . the old person would find immenc pleasur in that and that enjoy can not be neglect . the young may consid it to be bore but not the same feel is carri by all . the old person would have tri all that the younger gener is present do and now is just enjoy by look at how the young do it . even that may give immenc enjoy to the old . the old person would enjoy to the maximum when he is around with hi famili and share thing with them . thu it can be conclud that the mean of enjoy is diffent view by differ peopl and can not be weight on superfici appear and ha deep mean .
