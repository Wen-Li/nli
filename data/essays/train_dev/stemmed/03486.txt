when consid thi issu , some peopl agre that it is better to special in one specif subject while other seem to agre that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . as to me , i agre to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . current , in thi democrat and economic-fre world , we need peopl with variabl abil no matter where they belog . peopl who are use to work alon may be dislik becaus everi work seem to be creat by `` copor '' in today 's societi . `` copor '' mean respec and multi-cultur . onli through it may human be creat a better consequec of their work . therefor , it is not the matter how much quantiti one can contribut to the group but qualiti one can produc by hi own , even that a littl bit but preciou knowledg , which suddenli occur to hi brain , may come to a signific key to success . i rememb one time we classmat had a huge project to be done , someth relat to `` fantasi literatur . '' we were terribl nervou about that present becaus final we decid to talk about the great volum , `` the ring of the king . '' we spent a week for prepar from search to powerpoint . actual , onli two of us had finish the three book , and other just `` tri '' to understand some episod . howev , we did make effort to use variabl angl to do analysi , especi when we began other relat book read . so , when the day of the present wa come , we group not onli had full prepar about the main top but also some materi develop by our extra read stuff . through thi experiec , i realiz that it is not matter how much you have learn but what more you can possibl give out , which is be develop and potenti erupt by individu effort . therefor , in my opinion , i think it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject .
