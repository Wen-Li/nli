the issu at hand is that the young peopl do to not give much time to help their commun . ye i agre with thi statement . thi issu is veri import as it show the unawar of young peopl toward their commun . i do n't know what 's wrong with today 's gener . now a day nobodi is concern about the welfar of their commun . everi individu is so busi in his/her own live that they are not even bother about thi . the first reason is that the youth today is so much interest in just fill their own coffer and for them wealth is everyth that they do n't have a singl second to wast on such a stupid issu as thought by them . the second reason is that they are forget the valu of a commun . today peopl have becom so selfish and so inhuman that they show no respons toward their commun . they are just flow with the tide of 21st centuri and do n't want to realis their duti . furthermor , it the modern time which ha complet trap the youth in it web and is not let them to make a nobl move toward thi issu . well it hightim and the youth will have to come back from hibern , otherwis their ignor regard thi issu will simpli destroy the valu and ethic from the societi . lastli , i feel that the elder should take part to help young peopl to be an activ player in help their commun . the elder could be the right teacher under whose abl guidanc the life of youth can flourish .
