i agre with thi statement . in fact a lot of product are quit differ from the exampl given in their own advertis . i mean that peopl , who studi the way to present an articl or a product and finnal to prepar an advertis , want to attract the attent of the costum , instead of describ the qualiti of the product . use thi kind of techniqu , the advertis risk to have a product differ in qualiti respect to the one , the custom have in mind . for exampl , i have bui a toothpasta that say to radic transorm my smile in a whiter smile , but after the four week that the advertis suggest to use thi product my smile wa not so differ . in my opinion the advertis want to demontsr that hi product is the best , or is better than other . in some case , to do thi , he decid to say someth not complit true or not at all possibl in order to attract the attent of the peopl . he lie a littl , but he may pose hi attent on the indefinit line , that divid peopl who believ in hi advertis and peopl who do n't . in particular peopl who believ in the advertis do n't accept to discov that the product is veri differ from hi idea . in conclus in my opinion is not alway a good idea to lie or to present product better then they are , becaus the custum want what the advertis say and do n't want a bad surpris .
