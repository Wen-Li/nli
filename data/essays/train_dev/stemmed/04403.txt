the issu of car number is veri import becaus of environment espect that are involv in thi problem . on the one hand , we can thing that in twenti year there will fewer car in use than today becaus of the limit energi sourv such as petroleum . on the other hand , peopl which consid develop countri , or former develop countri such as china or india can support the idea that the number of car will increas . in my opinion , the number of car will decreas in develop countri as in europ or north america but will increas in newli develop countri as china . first of all , we have to condid that the whole world is chang becaus of the scarciti of energi that will be an veri import issu in the next twenti year . actual , it will involv high price for gazolin for exampl . for instanc , peopl which doe not need long travel by car will use other way to travel such as bike becaus car will be too expens . then , we know the countri that use a lot of car are the develop countri and now , new develop countri are come and it inhabit are go to be abl to buy car . thu , car number can increas a lot dure the next twenti year . final , my viewpoint is that there will be high differ in the car consumpt between develop countri and countri like china or india where the number of car is sharpli increas . moreov , number of car in more littl asian countri is grow too . for instanc , it is a new thai problem in bangkok . to conclud , it is difficult to answer and predict the car consumpt in the worl that involv a lot of phenomena like energi avail or countri develop but environment problem are link to car number and some law or regul about environ may decreas the quantiti of car dure the next twenti year .
