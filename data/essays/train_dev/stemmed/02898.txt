peopl often think that young peopl tend to enjoy life more than older peopl do . i personali disagre with thi statement . i strongli believ , as i myself get older , older peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl becaus of the differ in experi time the one ha spent . first , old peopl tend to live select life from their experi . although thi seem not veri excit , as younger peopl alway look so , the scale of `` enjoy life '' is way higher . for exampl , i often go to hot spring with my wife for vacat . i never thought of go to just take a bath take hour of time in a car to reach the locat when i wa in teenag . but after all the experi that i visit sever hot spring , i know the well of it . now i know it is veri relax and comfort to just be there , i never offend use my time for transport to that locat . as i saw the hot spring for the first time , it wa veri excit but never felt that it wa enjoy . sinc i have more experi , with hot spring , i choos to go there rather than the situat i happen to be there . i feel that i am select choic of event base on the experi how well you can enjoy . for the younger peopl , as i recal my younger age , they often look joy onli by the excit from the first or rare experi of event . i wa enjoy veri much play with my tv game , 24 hour a day , 7 day a week , straight . i wa excit to becom better at the game and talk about it in school , at that time . after all that excit and experi , i never play tv game . now i choos not to do whatev will not my life better in term of live life . i learn from the full-tim game player experi . now i am confid in spend my time for good of myself . in conclus , as i point out abov , i total believ that old peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl do . i definit think that i am select what is good for my life and i am enjoy my life a lot better than my younger age .
