i agre with the statement that say `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' i think that the statemnt is right becaus of mani reason , one of thi reason is the technolog in our life thi day , if we talk about the present time we will see that the car are esseni in our life , befor a veri long time , car wa not necessari for transport they can use train or bicycl and mostli they use to walk , and in near past , everyon use to have one car , a whole famili consist of larg number of brother and sister , son and daugther use to have just one car , but in these day everi person could have two or more car , in thi we see how technolog becam a part of our live . in futur i think there wont be car at all or at least not in thi huge amount that we have it in thi day , i think that the scentist will discov other way for transport , they would chang the car use petroul by other with differ shape use light or use other thing , or even futur peopl could have a bag in their back , and whenev they want to go to some where they just press a littl button and they fli or even wear a shoe which make you to jump a larg distanc or thousand of idea that will make us not use the car and the train , which make our atmospher clearer and better way to live . alhough i think that thi step will happen in futur , but i dont think it will happen in near futur , becaus thi kind of step need a plan with the risk that could be taken in such case , with opprotun for everyon to have thi ventur ,
