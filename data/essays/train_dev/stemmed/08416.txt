i disagre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there can be mani exampl . at univers where i attend there wa student club which help the commun , especi the farmer or poor local peopl . and the histori of the club can be date back to 100 year and there is still young peopl who join the club nowaday . also there is no sign of the declin member of the club . and there is newli develop movement that help peopl , like habitat , which is build hous for the poor peopl . thi kind of activ did not exist at sever year ago . but now it is popular form of the extra-curicular activ between young peopl . some peopl worri that the strong competit among young peopl for colleg admiss , which is veri import in korea , can lead to the less time for their commun . to deal with that issu , new educ system now assign specif amount of student 's time for the activ help the commun . and there is point associ with thi activ , which can be advantag for the colleg admiss . thi kind of newli develop educ system show that young peopl , even those who are consid most busi , can give more of their time to help their commun . howev there can be chang in the form of help over time . and some form of the activ can be seen as a no help activ in the eye of old peopl . nowaday the young peopl can help their commun use the newli develop technolog like internet . for exampl there is web site where peopl with troubl can go and write about their problem and the young peopl who want to help them can give them specif advic . though these kind of activ is new and unfamiliar , it can be also consid help their commun . in summari , in korea , histor , young peopl , especi those who are colleg student , are known for their strong interest in their commun . though the specif activ can chang overtim , there is no specif evid that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . and there is lot of newli develop activ help commun . that can lead to the conclust that young peopl nowaday also give enough time to help their commun .
