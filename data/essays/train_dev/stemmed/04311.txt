i donnot agre to thi statement becus accord to me have broad knowledg of mani academ subject to special in one subject is just like jack of all and master of none . i think if you are special in one subject , you will have more job oppurtun , you will be prefer than other peopl who have knowledg of mani subject . firstli , it is seen in mani institut , they prefer master for the higher post in their institut becus they have knowledg in depth by have lot of expossur and experi in same subject . as seen in medic field also , that peopl prefer to go to a doctor who ha the master degre than a simpl m.b.b.s. doctor . as you becom special in one subject , you have the knowledg in depth and in a proper way . these are the reason whi i feel that have special in one specif subject is better than have broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
