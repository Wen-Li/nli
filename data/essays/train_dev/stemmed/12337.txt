the program of studi cours requir a thorough prepar and in order to make the best choic in thi prepar you should keep in accountvari factor , for instanc what is most import for a student to learn and here come our question : is it more import for a student to understand idea and concept or to learn fact ? i do n't complet agre with the statement that understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact becaus i think that both thing are import : understandig idea and concept is necessari becaus theori is the basi of ani subject and you must know it , on the other hand , if you onli know theoret idea and concept you wo n't be in touch with the realiti and , as a consequ , you probabl wo n't be abl to use your theoret knowledg in practic . furthermor you should n't forget that theori come from experinc and the object of experi are fact so , in order to have a complet view of thing , a student should both understand concept and idea and learn about fact . concept do n't come out of nowher , for instanc , a lot of scientif discoveri arous from notic some unusu fact that were analys and led to some theori that were demonstr . therefor , if we onli understand and memoris concept and idea we miss a lot of element that help us to understand thing more in depth . a good exampl of how learn fact is as import as understand concept and idea can be given by the studi of histori : if we studi a polit theori , we understand it in depth but we do n't have ani idea of how it wa actual implement we will have just a partial view of thi idea , base onli on theoret element and we wo n't be abl to figur out wether it is good or not wether it is realist or not wether the man who elabor wa right or not in hi view . in conclus a must say that , in my opinion student should both understand concept and idea and learn fact .
