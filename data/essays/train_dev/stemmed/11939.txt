in my opinion , special in one specif subject is better than have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus of the natur of knowledg such as plenti and complex . sinc the 17th centuri , mani invent were made . inform use to make these invent and inform provid by these invent are accumul such that noon alon can know all of these inform . for exampl , in a typic univers there are princip depart such as natur scienc faculti , literatur faculti , social scienc faculti etc . . all of these depart have also subdepart . in my univers , for instanc , busi administr , aconom , intern trade are subdepart of social scienc faculti . a person can onli attend onli one of these subdepart such that it is imposs to finish all of these departmen at the same time . so have a broad knowledg in mani academ subject are not that much possibl . anoth reason is the complex of knowledg in ani specif subject . when you want to cure an ill for exampl to cure the ill aid , you should specil on virus which are the caus of aid . know mani academ subject such as optic , pscholog , literatur will not make ani use to cure aid . sinc you can onli learn by do it , special is better . consequ , special is better than broad knowledg .
