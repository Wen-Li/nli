i desagre with the idea that it is more import for student to understand idera and concept than it is for them to learn fact . factor make student to face on the realiti , help student to understand idea and concept better , and make student more attent about the field . one of reason i desagre with thi idea is becaus student should know the realiti . if student just studi about idea and concept , they can never lean what is go on in the real world . for exampl , in busi class , student will learn about stock . if student do not do a simil game of market stock , they will never know how it is diffecult to guess what is go to happen next one second . fact help student to learn the real world by themselv . in addit , if student learn mani fact , it is go to help student to understand idea and concept more . for instanc , in busi class again , through a simil game of market stock , student understand what stock are about , whi compani have stock , and so on better . it is more effect than just learn idea and concept . final , lear through fact can make student to be interest in that field . in fact , a simil game of market stock made me to be interest in busi world . i had never been interest in busi at all until i did a simil game . i knew the fact of busi world and it caught my mind somehow . besid , i am major in busi in colleg now . there are more studet who had the same experi . in conclus , it is better to learn more about fact than idea and concept . howev , it is wrong that learn onli fact are the best way to learn someth . it is also import to understnd idea and concept . it is just learn fact is more import than understand idea and concept .
