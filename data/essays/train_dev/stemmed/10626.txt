advertis seem to ha becam a busi techniqu for introduc product , especi in over exager way , to gain the public 's attenet . yet , the destir of introduc and show how good the product are might mislead the public to have an irealist imagen . some advertis give exager statist which are not real and give the buyer wrong inform while some advertis onli focu on give the statist that are benefiti and ignor give the inform on which the product might affect the user after use the product . for instanc , there are lot of advertis about loss how much weight in a certain shrort period of time . these advertis sure are too exager , therefor , lot of the buyer suit the brand becaus they do not get the same effect as the sampl person show in the advirtis . as i mention , lot of advertis use exager to fasin buyer and pursuad them how good the product are /
