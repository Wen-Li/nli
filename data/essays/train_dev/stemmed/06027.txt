i disagre with the statement that have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject becaus it is veri difficult to gain full knowledg on all subject , nobodi in thi world i think who know everyth , everi one in thi world is specialis in a particular thing for exampl a pilot he know everyth regard an aeroplan but ask him about a train he may not b abl to discuss . i have seen mani elder peopl give me an advic say that `` travel in both the boat is alway difficult '' well it wo an advic given to me by my teacher when i wo prepar for an entranc exam while pursu my engin he said if you are realli interest in the entranc exam then concentr on it rather comin to the school becaus go school and studi for an entranc will not land u ani where u neither abl to get good mark in your engin nor you get select in the entranc it work out for me got good mark in engin when i left studi so we can consid thi exampl for the given statement . if we want to acquir the broad knowledg on mani academ subject we can not abl to master in all the subject which is of no use in thi societi to get a good job even for work it is import to master a specif subject unless u have a complet knowledg reagrd a specifi subject hoa can anubodi offer you a good job u just cant get a job say you have a broad knowledg on mani subject it ha been alway a difficulti for a human be to do mani thing at a time due to the mani factor which he depend on for exampl the time factor , tired etc. which can b obstruct doin the thing at a time even if you review the peopl around you you fill find peopl master in a specif subject for which they work for exampl a comput softwar engin who is specialis in deal with comput so it is alway better to specialis in one subject rather goin for mani subject
