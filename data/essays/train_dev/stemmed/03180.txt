for a better commun , everi individu of that particular place ha to provid a help hand to reach it success level . consid the young peopl nowaday , thay have to contribut their part to help out his/her commun . i person agre with the statement that , young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun for the follow reason . young peopl is a combin of colleg go student as well as recent graduat one from the univers who spend most of the time search a better job . the stress on the student is so high these day that they hardli get time to entertain themselv . that is , they are alway tangl with their studi and assign they need to complet . in such case , they dont have time for other activ like improv their commun . other reason is , whenev they get some time young peopl prefer to spend time with their famili and friend rather than improv a commun . thi is the caus of the excess burden they are face from their daili schedul pattern . for instanc , i myself be a graduat student , whenev i get some time from my assign , i would prefer relax at home than go out and improv my commun . young peopl also feel that , if the commun head and the correspond head feel respons and do their part correctli then there wont be a question to call young peopl to particip in such programm . young peopl have to concentr well on their studi and go on up to their satisfact level becaus these are the peopl who are the citizen of tomorrow . young peopl have to mould themselv in such a way that they could becom the role model for their younger gener . in the conclud note , young peopl dont give enough time for the improvis of their commun becaus of the abov state reason .
