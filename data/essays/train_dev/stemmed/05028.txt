in answer to the given question , i will first focu on the perspect of a prospect univers student who is tri to decid on a field of studi . should he rather follow hi multifold interest or concentr on one specif subject ? in recent year , mani new , multi-disciplinari major have been creat at german univers , such as `` philosophi & econom '' or `` cultur studi '' , which incorpor studi in ecnom , polit , law , languag and region cultur . for a student face with such a choic , i would alway recommend to opt for one specif subject . i believ that multi-disciplinari studi can onli convey a superfici knowledg of the variou field they cover . within the spectrum of hi studi that usual last three year ( for a bachelor 's degre ) , the student will studi so mani differ issu that he/sh is never given enough room to fulli penetr ani of them . especi for student who have not yet decid on a specif career , studi variou academ subject all at onc will confus them rather than focu their thought . in contrast to thi , a student who decid on one tradit field of studi such as law or econom will at least have solid train in that specif field , which equip him/her for a pre-specifi career . the student can then either follow thi career or make a consciou decis to choos anoth path , rather than just be confus by a varieti of rudimentari knowledg and not have learn to priorit . to make my point clear , i believ that it is crucial to have a fundament train in one specif academ subject . howev , thi doe not impli that your academ think should be restrict to that field onli . if the purpos of academ work is to find solut to real-world problem , then it is absolut necessari to incorpor differ viewpoint into your reason becaus one disciplin alon will never cover all aspect of an issu . in thi sens , i would say that it is import to be apt in one specif subject in order to make profound statement , but other academ subject should never be entir neglect .
