in thi era of modernis , where man ha reach space , develop nuclear arm and made other tremend progress , the time is more in favour of a specialist . though a gener knowledg about basic subject is essenti the indepth knowledg of specif subject is mostli requir . the curriculum of a school is so devis as to teach the grow child the basic subject like english , scienc , mathemat , social studi , moral educ and so on . as the child grow a stage come when he ha to choos the subject he would like to special . in colleg the student are requir to opt for a subject as their major area of studi . he ha to choos hi career . nobodi would disagre that there is not much of use of literatur and econom if a person wish to be a doctor or other scienc major . similarli the person opt for busi need not care about studi biolog . be a medic graduat i understand that today the world is in favour of specialist . a person if he ha contract a diseas goe first to hi gener practition who tri to manag the case but if the case is not recov with hi treatment he refer it to a specialist . thu the specialist look into the problem and treat effect . the specialist sometim may face problem as he ha to deal with a case who ha diseas in mani organ system thu he ha to take the help of other specialist . the need of broad knowledg about mani subject may help in securin good posit in quiz , exam . there are some job , that requir knowledg in mani subject , like teach school children , take care of librariesetc . but on the whole most of the job requir the knowledg of a specif subject . in conclus i believ that it is better to have indepth knowledg of a specif subject than broader about mani subject as one should not be `` jack of all trade but master of none '' .
