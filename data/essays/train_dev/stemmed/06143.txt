i do n't think that spend time for thi reason is not realli import anymor . . but it 's true , young peopl do not spend a lot of their time help their commun . should they realli do thi ? what for ? there are other thing they have to concentr on , such as school and work . a few year ago , it wa probabl differ and it wa more common to spend time help their commun , but everyth is chang , for exampl peopl and life . young peopl realli have to do much more than peopl the same age a coupl of year ago . young peopl realli have to work hard to finish school , to find the right job and to be sucess in life . there are mani other thing that are much more import than spend time with help their commun . young peopl should better hold on to their dream and the govern should hire peopl to do the work that ha to do with the commun . there are so mani peopl without work , even if it 's not the best paid job , they will be happi to find a job instead of sit on their ass at home , watch tv without do anyth challeng . we do n't want lazi peopl in our contri , the worst thing is that we have to pay for thi kind of peopl and we do n't want that , peopl get angri when they think about that . we want them to work , to work as hard as we do and to gain their own money . i disagre with the statement abov becaus of the fact i mention in thi essay . thi essay definit make clear what i think about it , and that there is no need for young peopl to help in their commun , becaus we want the govern to do someth !!!
