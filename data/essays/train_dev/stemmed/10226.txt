i dont agre with the statement that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to special in ani one subject . i feel both approach have their own pro and con . let us analyz the issu with some specif exampl . student are ask to take up mani divers subject so as to have a basic knowledg of all the disciplin . thi is veri import becaus no field work in isol . the subject of geolog or art is incomplet without the studi of histori . in fact the knowledg of one field is often requir to solv problem in other . now imagin a scenario if the specialist doesnt have ani knowledg of the other field . how is a physic specialist go to solv hi complex problem invov mathemat if he doesnt have a broad knowledg math as well . can he afford to go to the the mathematician everi time he ha some doubt with hi math ? that is not a feasibl option . he ha to develop an understand of math as a disciplin so as to arriv at a comprehens solut . we see mani master student major in more than one field . thi is becaus their interdisciplinari knowledg will give them a comprehens understand of the problem . today world is increasingli put up problem which often requir inter-disciplinari knowledg . the team that work in the field of technolog have a divers compost . they have specialist of technolonogi work in tandem with peopl who have a broad knowledg of differ techonolog . as a specif exampl in softwar technolog , mani applic now requir user interfac in a technolog differ from the one use to do back end transact . to make thi work you need more than just two specialist of the two technolog involv . it is not go to work if each of them is total unawar of the other technolog . it will certainli help if they can get anoth member who know a littl bit of both . thu both approach are requir for a comprehens understand .
