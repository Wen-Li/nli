i would support thi statement . it is logic that advertis let product look much more innov und better as it , in fact , realli is . look , if you were an advertis creator and know innov for thi product , which should be emphas , the thing , which improv the usag of it , you have to focu on it . let the commerci look like it 's an incred invent made by the compani and thi onli for the viewer of the ad . it ha to be attract for the consum , so that he think about buy the product . if there is a advertis tell me , as a consum , about the advantag and a lot of other thing , i 'd not think much about it , becaus it 's onli one in a million of new thing . but by tell me the outstand advantag , the product could attract me and so led me to a shop to buy it . to reach thi point in the mind of peopl who see thi commerci , you have to emphas the improv and even let them appear much better than they are in real . you can also use a comparison between the product , which you are advertis for , and anoth one . by do thi the other product ha to perform veri bad , while `` your '' one act normal or even unbelievingli good . now let the bad perform seem as the standard befor the new advertis product were invent , creat also an overr imag of the new one . do advertis in thi way is the onli opportun to led peopl to buy thi and not anoth product . it is even the onli way for a commerci to get recogn by the audienc . the way how advertis are made led to the statement that most of the advertis produc make product seem much more better than they realli are .
