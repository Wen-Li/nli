i do agre with the viewpoint that most advertis make product seem much better than they are . in fact , the purpos of the advirtis is to incit the desir of the custom and increas the sale of their product . it is unavoid to use some kind of commun skill to stimul custom to buy their product . in order to increas the sale of the product , advertis will mask some kind of shortag of their product and onli put emphasi on the outstand point of the product . for exampl , the renov of the processor of the person comput is fast . mani processor manufactur alway emphas on the process speed of their product . howev , they never mention some import featur such as how much electr will be use for use the chip and how hot they will produc dure usag . for a good comput , low temperatur and stabl perform are far more import rather than fast speed , howev , the advertis never expos their shortag . anoth exampl is the advertis for restaur . they alway show how good their food are and how low cost for their food . howev , the advertis seldom give correct inform to costemor that what kind of food is good for health and necessari for human bodi . the purpos of the photo of the advertis is to aris the interest of custom and the ultim goal is to sell their product . in addit , when we buy food in mall or supermarket , we can often discov that the pictur do not match with the product . the photo of their product are sure more beauti than they are in realiti . good advertis will deliv the correct inform to the custom and help custom make reason decis . on the other hand , inadqu advertis will affect the brand imag of the product and further damag custom . in my opinion , more and more poor advertis are show throuth differ media and thu it will be more difficult for custom to make right decis in the futur .
