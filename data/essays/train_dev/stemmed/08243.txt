the comparison between the life of two differ gener is alway difficult , but it is possibl to find reason enough for live in both age . i think , that the youth ha more advantag . first there are physic paramet , such as the use of muscl , which allow young peopl to do much more than older peopl . furthermor older peopl have usual more deseas and are not strong enough to do what ever they want to do . anoth interest point is the way of think . young peopl have not to think about money or insur . they have their mother , who buy the food , clean their room and their cloth . the onli problem for peopl at thi age could be possibl the school , but it weight less if i think about older peopl , who have to get job . older peopl have to think about money everi day becaus their respons for their famili is extraordinari . a third point is the possabl for adult to make what they want . for exampl they can studi what thezbuy what they want . simpli they have much more choic than younger peopl . final if i could choos , i would like to be young becaus i like it to do some activ , which i can not do when i becom older .
