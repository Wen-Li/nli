jack of all trade but a master of none . what would be the posit of a person in today ' world who ha a broad knowledg in mani academ subject instead of special in one or be an expect in one . i believ that a person should special in a specif field and then excel in that specif field . as today it is the time for profession and so each and everi sector in the world is look for expert in that particular field . for exmpl a person who is not special in the field of comput , but ha a vast knowledg of everyth where would he be stand in the world of comput , no where , as he wont be abl to have the integr of and wont be have the complet knowledg of comput . if one ha to succe in life he should get in a particular field he/sh is interest in and should excel in that onli . now day everi person ha knowledg about most of the thing in the world , but can that person be a success person in particular . it is also state in english literatur , in the famou greek play dr. faustu . though he had the knowledg of each and everyth he wa fool to give up hi soul just to know the knowledg of black magic . i even support the counter point that a person should not restrict his/her knowledg but even the a person should be a master of one and then of cours becom a jack of all trade . a person can alway move forward , but i believ with someth in hi hand on which he can fall back on . at least that special is there with him . now day surveri have prove that a practic person i prefer to a doctrinaire. a person who is total base in theori if doe not think about the pratical of life , how will peopl consid him over the other . thu , in the same way i believ that a person should be the master of one and then the jack of all other trade .
