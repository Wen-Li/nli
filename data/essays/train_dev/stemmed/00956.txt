travel is the best way ever to explor the world , discov new place and rest . some peopl prefer to spend that time in a group with a tour guid and other prefer to stay alon . i will definit say that i disagre becaus , by myself i can visit whatev i want , i will never get bore by the discuss and i can rest whenev i want . first of all , the wors thing when you 're in vacat is to be oblig to do exactli what the major want to do . becaus you are in a group of differ peopl you can do what you want to do , of cours . you have to go where everybodi is go , eat where everi bodi eat . instead of that , when you are by yourself you can decid exactli what you want to visit without be contrari . for exampl i wa in itali for vacat with a group of peopl . i realli want to visit a veri famou museum , but i could n't becaus it wa n't on the program of the day . secondli what is n't benefict for my vacat , is to get bore by the discuss . when you in the group , at certain time the guid tour have to talk about the histori of the citi , the peopl . .. most of the time those subject are n't interest . i ca n't imagin myself in vacat lay on the beach while the guid tour is talk about origin of the beach in the world or someth els . final , the most import thing while you 're in vacat or when you travel is to be abl to rest when you want to . one day i wa in germani with some friend of mine and a tour guid . everi morn at seven o'clock he wa suppos to wake up everybodi for the break fast time . that made me so mad becaus i could n't rest at all . contrari , when you are by yourself , you do n't have to worri about the time or rush anywher . so you can have more time to rest base on the fact that you are your own guid .
