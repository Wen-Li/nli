i disagre with the statem that travel in a group with a tour guid is the best way to travel . one reason whi i think it is not the best way is that a group contain to mani differ charact and opinion . the issu is that peopl like differ thing ; for exampl , if one is in a group , visit a museum , some member of the group would rather focu on the realli known paint , meanwhil , other peopl would rather rush thrue the entir museum to see all of it just incas they wo n't have enough time in the end and other may just like to look at one paint for an huge amount of time . keep thi exampl in mind , how would you sattisfay each and everi charact at a tour ? in my opinion it is not possibl and i rather look at each paint , at an amount of time which is convini for me and look just at paint i am interest in instead of tri to keep up with a group . add to that , if you take someth like an entir trip , one would have to follow the tour guid and may miss some interest place he might would have seen if he would have been by hisself or with just a few peopl . take my last trip for exampl , i went with my parent to san francisco and drove all the way down to lo angel . i plane the entir trip and focus just on my parent and my passion like amaz view over the bay , visit monterey , drive thrue some dessert , drive across the golden gate bridg and visit those nice littl countri citi on the way down there . while we were in lo angel , we were mostli on the beach instead of visit lo angel . just a few week later , my friend took a tour from san francisco to lo angel . first off al she wa cold in san francisco becaus she did n't expect thi cold weather . we did n't expect it either but we did n't have a tour guid and could stop to buy a sweater for each one of us . furthermor she did n't have ani idea what monterey look like , she saw the bay bridg just from far away . the last horribl memori she told me wa that instead of watch sunset on one of those great cliff she wa chase her group thrue lo angel and saw mansion of `` star '' she never heard of . my oipinion is clear , i will never travel in a group led by a tour guid . by the way , my parent enjoy our trip and think it is one of the greatest they ever had .
