in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . have broad knowledg of mani acedem subject give us a lot of inform about variou topic . thi help us to identifi the area or subject in which we are interest . for exampl , an individu who ha knowledg in art , histori , econom and scienc will have a larger scope to select hi interest area of studi and pursu hi higher educ in that domain . but by special in one specif subject , the scope of select of other interest subject is lost . also , broad knowledg of variou subject give us a larger scope for inter-disiplinari work . have consider knowledg of two inter-rel topic , can help us understand the subject much better . for exampl , have knowledg of mathemat can help a lot in studi physic . modern world demand integr of more than one technolog . also , it would improv the job oppurtun . as the world move toward develop , the compani which hire individu want them to be flexibl enough to work on more than one project at a time . individu who have broad knowledg of variou academ subject are help in thi regard . moreov , have knowledg of more than one subject will alway be help in job search . also there are certain job which requir the knowledg of more than one subject . for exampl , for an effect design of an automobil , it would be better to hire a person who have knowledg of mechan engin and also who can simul design on a comput system there by reduc the manufactur cost by a great deal . from the abov fact , i conclud that it is better to have broad knowledg of variou academ subject than to special in one specif subject . we need individu who are multi-tal to make innov and make societi a better place to live .
