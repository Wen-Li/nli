i there wa n't twenti year a go , but i know that in that period there were fewer car in use than there are today . i think that there are mani histor reason to explain the huge spread of the car in the last twenti year . start thank to henri ford and hi way of product of car it wa possibl to start to make car at minor cost and in a minor time . thak to thi start improv the car ha becam a common meand of trasport . in fact , a product less expens ha permit to reduc the price to buy a car and alway more peopl can have the possibl to buy it . a second histor reason that have caus a big speard of the car is the economi improv of the societi . after the industri revolut , the factori ha becam the most common way to produt . with the arriv of the factori most peopl start to work in a factori . dure thi period the societi wa grow , the trade wa improv and therefor also the weaht of the peopl wa increas . thank to thi better econom situat of the peopl it wa grow also the number of peopl that can buy a car . anoth element that dure the histori ha had effect on the spread of the sell of the car amoung peopl is the improv of the tecnolog . chiefli in the last year , which the improv of the tecnolog ha gone at a big level , alway more car have made and more car have sail . in conclus i want to underlin that the car is a veri common mean of trasport , but nowaday there are too mani peopl that use the car . in fact the use of the car caus much pollut at our environ . i know that tha car is the more easi maen of trasport , but i know also that if all the peopl of the word use alway the car , also for do few km , too mani environ problem will born .
