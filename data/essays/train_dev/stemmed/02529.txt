in thi essay i am go to explain if i agre or disagre that in twenti year will be fewer car in use than there are today . first at all i think that nowaday there are realli a lot of car , that are make realli dirti and unhealthi the world . thi is due to the low price of the car and the increas salari and need of the societi . our world just care about materi thing and we are forget that in a few year mayb we will not be abl to walk in the street becasu the sun will be realli unhealti for our skin . so i think that is realli difficult that the number of car decreas in twenti year , except that the state start to work today in thi problem . i think we are realli selfish becaus we are not think in our futur gener . so i think that the best think to do now is start to work in thi . the action that i would do to decreas the number of car would be the follow one . first of all i would increas the public transport , but i would also improv the condit of the buse and i would decreas the price of the public tranport . secondli i would increas the tax of car due that they dirti realli a lot the citi and they also damag the envairo . to conclud , i think that if the state start to work hard to tri to decreas the number of car will be possibl in twenti year that there will be fewer car than there are today , but i think that is realli difficult to reach thi object , becasu until now realli a littl of peopl care of our natur , and if we want to decreas the number of car we will have to work realli hard with the help ot the state .
