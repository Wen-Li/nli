some peopl prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guid , but some of the other prefer to travel alon or with a coupl of partner . in my opinion , i do not agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are three reason base on my experi convinc me that the best way to travel is alon or with partner . first of all , self-organ travel maintain person prefer on rout . it would be dipress that some place one wish to visit are not on the tour list . to travel alon hat the benefit of choos whatev one like and whereev one want to go . for me , travel is a self discov adventur . without the freedom to make decis dure the travel is lack of the mean of travel it own . secondli , i prefer to organ a tour on one own becaus one would learn more and get the most of the period of time . from collect inform of the destin and research the cultur differ , one abtain so much more knowledg along with the plan . furthermor , plan the schedul would help one to get the basic knowledg of the trip . on the contrari , in a group led by a tour guid limit the possibl to explor interrest fact of differ cultur and also limit peopl 's incent to get more to know about the backgroud of the place . thirdli , the flexibl schedul make travel more enjoy . everyon who had follow a tour trip had had such experi of rush to follow the schedul . self-organ travel is flexibl that one can make decis base on the weather , health condit , or even mood . for exampl , if one get too tire from yesterday schedul , one can just sleep more until the the energi get back . flexibl schedul not onli adjust the person condit better , but also bring out unexpect surpris dure the trip , which is one the most wonder part of travel . for exampl , five minut late for the bu might lead one to anoth rout , but the other way which less travel by might be more beauti than the origin plan . in conclus , there are so much more fun to travel alon or with a coupl of partner rather than follow the fix schedul . in my opinion , the most momori moment in a travel are those which i did not expect .
