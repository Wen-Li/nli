i mainli agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . firstli , i wolud like to mention that there are differ type of student . each of them learn in a differ way . therefor it is not surprins that there is also a group of student that onli learn fact , without be interest in how and whi scientist , historian or author thougt about and invent fact and thing we learn about nowerday . some of the student admit that they are abl to keep fact in mind but that they are not abl to understand logic idea and concept that lead to these fact . secoundli , onli learn fact or also understand the idea behind them depend a lot on the subject a student studi . for instanc logic think is necessari for a mathemathik student but not for a histori student . from my point of view understand the idea and not onli learn the fact is alway import , no matter what the subject is . furthermor also in subject that are mainli base on fact such as histori or biolog there might be question about the reason for a certain develop or the student might even be ask to tell their own opinion consid specul about futur develop in these field . in thi case the student who also know about idea and concepst are much more like to be abl to give a good answer than student who simpli learn the fact . anoth import point is that nowerday student are veri keen on get to know the reson for certain fact as well as solv problem they eventu have to deal with in some tasc , especi in practic subject such as chemistri and physic . moreov student who onli learn the fact , learn them for a specif test and forget them afterward . but student who learn the fact and also the idea and concept often keep them in mind for year so the thing they have learn may helf them also in far futur . in conclus i must say that i consid the learn of not onli fact but also idea and concept is the more effect way of learn and is therefor prefer by most of the student .
