to be gener , student can be childeren , teenag or univers student . all of them are not so matur , especi childeren , then teenag , the last one univers student . becuas of be so young , they need to learn first , then they can think . in primari school , first they learn how to write and read . to provid commun and understand what it is go to happen in their environ . they tri to learn write and read . after learn read and write they start to read all book , newspap and to write a poem , a letter , a note etc. , they start to learn more in highschool either about class or about be person . after high school they go to univers and again they still need to learn a lot of thing about life and about their major area . becaus of these situat they need to understand idea first then they can learn fact . if they understand idea first they can think themselv . they can have their own person . if we do n't teach differ but good idea in school , they can not learn the fact in true way . becaus of that in school , they learn all classs like math , chemistri , physic , biolog , histori , phylosophi , religion , health , etc . after take these class they understand that which area they like and which occup they want to have in the futur . after graduat univers when they get a new job they face to real life and they start to learn fact . becaus they have respons of new job and they earn their own money after all . they do not live their parent anymor and they live alon to take their desicion themselv . at that time they start to real thing in life and mayb they will be worri about their futur . becaus of that they will want to be again a famili and they will marri and have a child . accord to my wite in the abov , first student need to understand idea then learn fact . in my opinian it is the healtiest way for student .
