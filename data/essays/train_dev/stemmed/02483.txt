i definet agre with the statement ; in my opinion , idea and concept are inde extrem more import for student than mere fact . in fact , from my person experi , be a law school student who went through a long school career , the primari scope of learn is get a real deep idea of the topic and therefor be abl to master and criticis them . that ha alway been my attitud , sinc the day i start school . in fact my mother , whose profess is teach , alway taught me that the concept are the most import thing for a student . thu , on the other hand , memoryz fact , date and name it 's complet useless becaus as time pass , they will soon becom confus , unclear , oscur data until they will complet disappear from our mind . there is no use of know a date / name if you do n't know what it relat to . on the contrari , as you learn , if you focu on the idea and the concept , you wo n't ever forget the essenc of ani topic . accordingli , in my opinion , onli by focus on the substanc of the differ topic the student can form themselv with a seriou knowledg . ultim , i think that it 's realli import for student to think about what they studi , to identifi the underli problem that are brought along with everi topic and to attempt to form their own opinion about them . onli with thi attitud , the student will be abl to becom knowledgebl human be instead of a group of worthless sheep that doe n't know how to think on it own .
