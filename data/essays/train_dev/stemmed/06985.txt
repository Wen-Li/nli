i think that it is better to special in one specif subject than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . from now on , i mention two reason for my thi opinion . the first reason is becaus modern societi or compani search for the person who is specialist . recent , societi is becom wors in a sens of economi . there are mani compani which can not manag . so societi or compani need a person who ha special skill or knowledg . the second reason is becaus i think the person who ha a special knowledg is strong in mani field . if special , you can get variou occup . you will be cherish by mani besi person . to have special knowledg chang you as specialist . so you will be strong . in conclus , i think it is import to special in one specif subject . to do so , your abil will be higher and higher .
