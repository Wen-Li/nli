the issu of advertis may be consid in differ way . it is often believ that the purpos of advertis is onli to make peopl awar of the exist of the product . howev it is also true that , in some case , advertis make product seem much beauti or much use than they are . take all aspect into account , i strongli feel that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the first reason for my belief is that advertis alway show product in a beauti environ with peopl who seem veri happi , who do not have daili life problem . .. i think that thi fake represent of life make peopl want their life to look like advertis and to achiev it ... they have to buy thi new product if they want to have a better life . anoth way to justifi my point of view is that make product seem much better than they realli are is consubstanci to the purpos of advertis . inde , the aim is to make peopl think that they must buy thi product , as a result advertis have to convinc peopl that thi one is better than all the other one . last but not least , i am firmli convinc that the aim of advertis is not onli to make product seem much better than they realli are , it is also to brainwash peopl in order to make them interest onli by materi thing . all thing consid , i would finish by say that , in my opinion , the result of advertis are that peopl just want to buy more and more thing in order to lead a more happi life like peopl they can see in add but , actual the fact that they have more and more desir make them more unhappi .
