ye , i agre with that in twenti year there will be less car in use than are todi . there are mani reson to hold thi view just like air pollut will go out of control , no fuel to drive car , no space on road for car and final new technolog will develop new thing . firstli , human are use more car , so by more number of car produc more air pollut . so such air pollut will goe out of control of human be . so at that posit human can not live and that time he will not use car . secondli , human also use much more fuel now a day to drive car . thi approch of human be is not good and resours of fuel will end at some time . so due to shortag of feul man can not use car in futur day . for exampl , my friend use hi bike for shorter rich work , by that wrong approch feul is wast and it is not good for futur . thirdli , as year pass humen will find new faster or good option for car . so by such new technolog it will happen that car will out date in next few year . final , as the number of car are increas but the place for drive or to park car is constant . so in next few year there will not ani place to drive car on road . for exampl , my friend 's famili is have three car for three person . so that number of car they can not have place to park all car in their plot . in short , by humen act pollut will increas and they will not use car . also human be use more feul and that will caus of non use car . also their will not be ani place to drive car on road and new technolog will give new option to man . so accord to in next few year car will not be use .
