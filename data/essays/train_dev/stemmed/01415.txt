travel is an impot part of life . rare there is a person who doe not travel or doe not like to travel . i think that a person should travel in group , by thi a person can have more secur . if a person travel in a group of hi friend or famili member and they are visit to some new place they will need a guid . guid can tell us the histor import of the place we are visit to . as the guid know all the area and place of interest so he can guid us well . also if we are visit to a place where there is differ type of languag use , guid can act as an interpret . so i am fulli agrr with the idea of travel in a group led by guid . first reason that whi i am in the favour of tour guid is that the guid can tell us the import of that place in detail , which otherwis we cant get enough through other sourc like book etc. for instanc last year me and my friend visit some histor place in india like agra , delhi and jaipur but we peopl do n't think like hire a guid , so v face much problem over there . second reason in favour of hire a tourist guid is that the guid is well known to the area where we are vist and he know veri well about the other place which we had not heard earliar . so he can make our travel experi more interest by introduc us to the new place . anoth import reason that i am in the favour of tour guid is that we can easili come over the languag problem if we are visit a place with differ languag . for exampl if we are visit european countri than we might encount with the languag problem over there . and we can come across the difficulti of interact with peopl . a tour guid can act as an interpret between us and the peopl of the other region we are visit to . to summar , the best way to travel is in group led by tourist guid , so that we can come to know in detail about the place we are visit to , we can enhanc our experi by introduct of new place and we can handl the situat of languag problem and last but not the least by travel in a group we can have a sens of secur .
