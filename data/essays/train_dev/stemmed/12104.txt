i believ that young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl for sever reason . young peopl have more energi to spend becas thay are in good shape and they do n't have ani physic problem . they can practic ani tipe of sport and spend hour outdoor play with their friend . they have a lot of free time due to the fact that they do n't work and that they do n't have to look after ani kid . dure thi free time they can go aut to bar , pub or disco and meet new friend . in addit to thi they can also meet a girlfriend or a boyfriend and have romant dinner . young peopl do n't have problem with money becaus they can alway ask to their parent if they need them . use the parent 's money they can buy a sail boat for the summer in order to enjoy the sea dure the summer or they can buy a pair of ski for the winter time . dure the summer school vacat they can also travel around the world use airplain or boat . they can , for exampl , organ a tour of all the main town of europ . in everi town they can tri differ restaur , go to see concert and drink all night long . when they are at home they can use internet to buy sever item , meet new peopl and creat their person websit . unfortunatelli they do n't spend part of their energi to help old peopl even if they know that in fourti year they are go to be old too .
