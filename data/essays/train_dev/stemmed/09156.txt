the issu at hand is whether there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than today . the question is veri interest sinc the number of car use have a tremend influenc on our environ becaus of the pollut . i person believ that there will be more car in use in twenti year than today . the first reason i think thi is becaus the number of peopl who can afford a car is constantli grow . although we do n't know how the econom structur will look like in twenti year we have to expect that in the big countri like china and india more peopl will earn enough money to buy a car for their person need . anoth reason whi i assum that more car will be on the road is base on the assumpt that the peopl 's search for individu is constantli grow . mani peopl do n't want to be limit by public transport to get to their destin . they use their car to travel whenev they want to the place they would like to be . they 're not limit by timet or the locat of the train/bu station . my final thought which support my opinion is that car are also a sign of wealth . in contrast to the peopl who can afford one car for their person transport there will be mani peopl who earn enough money to have even more than one car and that onli for the purpos of fun . there are a lot of coupl without children who have 3 car . one car for each person for the daili use and the third car , for exampl a sport car or a convertr car , for special occas . there are also a lot of collector of veri old car , call oldtim . conclud the argument abov i can say that we should definit expect more car on the road in twenti year than today .
