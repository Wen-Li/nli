be specialis in one academ subject or in mani subject which is better ? and is it true that the more subject u specialis in the more acadam and better you will be ? peopl 's opinion in the number special differ wide , but the question is which is better ? first of all , to be special in one subject make the person more profession in the subject he choos . secondli , in work he would have a higer rank which mean that more salari will be offer to him which can lead him to have a better life like have luxuri car and hous , but the problem that it may be hard for him to ind a good work if he wa special in a rare subject . also their are quit alot of advantag for have more than one special subject like1-mor oppurtun for him to find a work2-giv him the chanc to work in more than one place which may lead to more salari but in the same time more stress3-mak him have a better place in the commun due to hi knowledg in mani thing which may make him help mani peopl . but in my opinion , have more than one specialz subject is better becaus it is possibl for the person with mani special to have the same degre in all of hi subject as the person who ha just one specialz subject with the degre . also i think that have one special subject may take a big effort to find a good job with a good salari . for exampl my cousin studi in us comput scienc and came to uae to studi there but couldnt find a job becaus it is not need in thi countri so he had to studfi again anoth subject in order to live hi life . as they said the more knowledg you have the more import you will be in your counti .
