i strongli agre that student should have a good understand of the topic . they should have a deeper knowledg of the concept and idea . wherea learn from fact can be addit to it but one can not sole depend on that . variou exampl can be given in support of it . a good student is one who thoroughli studi the topic . goe deep into the understand and then correl it with hi view and idea . in thi manner he/sh will have strong basic . for exampl , in scienc subject or in physic conceptualis is the key factor . if we do n't studi the intial step like in physic variou theorem and pricipl we can never solv difficult problem in futur . a strong basic understand of all area will help us to deal almost everyth . furthermor , if idea are put on paper or use them one will come out with novel innov . like while do experi we put some report idea of a reseach to our work . and we come out with entir new result . so by put someon idea which he had thought of we accid or intellig come out with a new concept . so sure studi well and appli idea can improv our capabl . fact can be a guid souc but true knowledg come from understand thing . thi can also be appli in other field of music , danc and art . in these field if do not know the basic concept of - do re me fa so , one can not proceed futher to specialis in music . on the other hand in art work like in paint one should know the standard of use a paint brush , how to use it at the first place ? . similiarli , in danc as in salsa or ani other western danc one should know the basic way of do it then onli can learn other difficult step . so i would conclud by state that one should make their basic strong in order face difficult challeng in life and thi appli to all field .
