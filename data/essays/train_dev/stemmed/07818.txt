it is rightli said that `` knowledg lead to success '' but it is also said that `` half knowledg is danger '' . accord to me one should have knowledg of all subject when you are undergradu level but when you go for master degre or doctrat degre one have to specil in a perticular subject . have broder knowledg is alway use . one should have a broader perspect of all subject at school level and colleg level . thi provid them with a carrier option who are realli confus what to choos as there futur and what they are good at . knowledg is help in everi walk of life . peopl here are realli confus about distributng and how to util their knowledg . one should understand that knowledg is never wast . if one is gain master degre for instanc he can not do master in all subject . in that case he ha to choos a specif subject . but imagin if there is a group of old school friend meet after sever year and if all are from differ field . imagin a person sit quit and can not speak becaus he ha no knowledg of what they are argu on . what a miser situat that is . henc accord to me everi type of knowledg is use in life but one ha to make a choic in later part of hi life have to go for a singl subject .
