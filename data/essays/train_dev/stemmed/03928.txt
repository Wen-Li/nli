in the begn i would like to draw attant about the diffrenc between knowledg and educ . all the time most of educ is special in one or tow major while knowledg can be in more major and you can get diffrent kind of knowledg throw ride to musc in differ fild . when i look at thi phrese in the left of the secreen i tri carfyulli to analys thi sentinc with my point of veiw . i found out that i agre & disagre in the same time . becus it is veri import that we have some peopl specil in some major such as doctor be dermatologist can not see or cure canser patient who havecanc from thi exampl i come out with my agre and , when i look to the knolwdg side i find that the disagr is also can be in thi matter . some one will have to have the knowledg from differnt kind of acadm sourc in order to find sulot for probelm . we reali need both peopl to have knowledg in order to keep thi knwledg contnu for ever and we need peopl to do special studi to have more experinc and to discov new thing with regard to thoer specil . whi do we need bothknweldg and specilatiez ? we need the knowledg to storm our mind to feed our brain like the thursti desert need the rain and we need specil so some one can do somth acuret with an outstand effort to came with good end like the bug they can not make honey but the bee can do that so all we need her is knowledgew and spicalti to come togoth . i see that all humenbeen should gother for the acadm knwledg in order for thi earth to beom more educ
