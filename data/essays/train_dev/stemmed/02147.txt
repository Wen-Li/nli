i agress that it is more import for student to understand idra and concept than iti for them to learn fact . first , if student can understand idea and concept , they will util them . understand them make student more better . for exampl , student understand them can make thier opinion use . in addit to , understand idea and concept is more eassier than learn fact . becaus , if student were abl to understand them , mayb , they can not forget them . but learn is not . secondli , to larn fact is difficult . for exampl , if student tri to rememb fact , they might spend more time than understand the idea and concept . we should save our life 's time . if student learn fact , they might forget them . thi is poor activi . third , learn fact is not cheeper than understand idea and concept . if we tri to learn fact we pay the fee . and if we choos to understand idea and concept , we can understand alon . for exampl we can read book . read book is use in understand idea and concept . learn fact is unus way to gain knowleg . we should gain knowleg . so , we can get a job . get job is veri difficult . the world econom is unclearli becaus of high oil price , weaken dolloar and so on . therefor , possibl , i recommend understand idea and concept . if i could back to the past , i would understand idea and concept . i never could learn fact . becaus i do not have littl time . time is money . rememb my word . so your children will be happi .
