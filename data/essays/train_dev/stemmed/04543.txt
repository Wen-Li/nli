i agre thi statement and we alreadi see the exampl of thi statement in world . let take the china as an exampl , as we know the popul of china is to much and grow day by day for thi reason peopl prefer ride bicycl instead of driw car . if we think that everi chines peopl drive to work or home or anoth place then the traffic would be the biggest problem of the china that is whi chines peopl prefer the bicycl . in my opinion the popul of other countiri in the world will becom like china in next year and peopl would rather prefer altern way of transportaion , and i think the best altern would be the bicycl . let talk about the benefit of bicyl ; 1 ) it is healtier than driw ; as we know in our centuri peopl dont have enough time for sport and exercis , becaus we need to work hard and if we use bicycl then we would catch the chanc of exercis while go to work or home . 2 ) no traffic problem ; bicycl is easier to use and it is smaller than an averag car so if we use bicycl instead of car than we wont have too much traffic and parkng problem . 3 ) no air pollut and energi save ; as you know the exhoust of the car pollut the enviro , and also in today economi the oil price are rais day by day , and i am sure that futur 's biggest problem would be the the oil and pollut problem so peopl would like to use bicycl to save money and tri to live healtier .
