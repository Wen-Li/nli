concern the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they know how to do well , i agre to a cerain extend . while certain peopl can achiev a certain level of success by onli draw on old knowledg the major of the peopl who have success , do so becaus of their willing to break out tri new strageti . the first part of my essay will give argument for thi fact , while also provid exampl . the second part will draw the attent on the fact that experi and old strategi can still be useful , while onli partli . if one look back in time the most peopl that can retrospect regard as successful have taken risk and tri now stregeti . the willing to break out of fix pattern of societi and tri new approach ha mostli result in success . thi appli for variou field , such as natur scienc , humanitarian scinec and especi the busi world . to give an histor exampl , gutenberg invent print as a mean to reproduc text in the 15th centuri . with thi he risk the anger the cleru , who had a monopoli in thi field . howev , he wa success and chang the way of publish forev . also today we can find similar exampl , which can also be much simpler . for exampl the starbuck inventor had the simpl idea to sell standad coffe to go at variou place with a brand name that stood for qualiti , as oppos to the classic behauvi of drink a cup of coffe in a cafe . howev tri out new thing is not suffic to be success . it is import to have draw on a certain knowledg and certain skill that exstist alreadi . without those skill the develop of a new idea can easili result in faluir . for exampl the build up of the starbuck empir , which wa found on a new idea , would never have been possibl without the knowledg of olod establish econom principl and busi knowledg . to conlud i want to draw aon the import of the two element that are import when tri out new thing . it is import to use long establish skill and knowledg in order to develop a new a idea and realiz it as a porject . thi approach is onli logic becaus old knowledg and skill have onc been new idea that peopl fought for . it therefor behov us to use those old method to realiz new and dare project .
