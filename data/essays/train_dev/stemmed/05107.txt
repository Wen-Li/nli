describ what is meant by `` enjoy in life '' could be veri suject . differ peopl might have differ view / reaction on similar situat . while one person might seem to enjoy loud , head-bang music , it might seem sheer nois to anoth person of hi age . i do not quit agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . some peopl enjoy everi moment of life regardless of their age , while there are other who spend all of their time crib about what life ha offer them . enjoy life ha noth to do with age , but rather it ha everyth to do with attitud . how one react to situat , how one take life as it come to him . it is all about that . one could look around to see live exampl and the messag would come out clear . there are old peopl who enjoy live a retir life , spend time with their famili and friend , socail and do what they feel good to do . on the contrari , one will find young peopl alway strive to make a better live , chase their dream and tri to win the `` rat-rac '' . it is one 's attitud that decid how one 's life is go to be . as i state earlier , peopl might react differ in same situat . some peopl might enjoy sip a cup of hot coffe in the cold weather , other might just curs god and natur for the un-easi that the weather ha brought into their live . enjoy is not , rather should not be relat to age . i could feel good take a walk down the seasid with my friend when i am young , and i could veri well enjoy the walk when i grow old . as they say , `` old in age doe n't mean old at heart '' ! in conclus , i strongli feel that old peopl could enjoy as much as young peopl do , in their own sweet way . to add to that , they do n't have as mani respons as young peopl do , so they need not worri about mani thing . life offer everi one , a packet full of enjoy ; it 's on you to open it care so that it doe n't spill out .
