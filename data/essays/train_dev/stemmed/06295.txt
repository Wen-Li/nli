accord to me peopl onli becom success when they tri new thing and take more risk . if a person will continu to do the same thing what he is well know for then their are less chanc that he can earn more profit then what he is earn now . peopl like bill gate or ambani took risk and came to the posit where they are now . i will take an exampl of my friend 's father who use to sell toy on cycl . he use to get up earli in the morn and come back late at night . one day he wa offer a chanc or you can say it a risk . the risk wa to invest some amount of money in a busi . if the busi work then he would becom rich but if it doe not then he will loos what ever money he ha and becom veri poor . he took thi risk work veri hard for the busi to earn him profit . he start with samll amount of profit then he invest that profit again in the busi and kept expand hi busi . today he is one of the richest peopl in our societi . so now we atleast know one thing that without risk their are veri less chanc of becom success . my father is also veri rich and ha hi own busi but when i grow up i do not want to continu my father 's busi becaus im get a platform . im get help from him which i do not want . i want to take risk and start my own busi . it is not neccessari that you will alway have success if you take risk sometim you might loos everyth but it all upon how you take risk and on what you are put your money on ? so if u have the courag to take risk then you should otherwis continu the same way and do the same thing your whole life .
