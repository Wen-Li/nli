nowaday , we are more and more affect by the advertis in our everyday life , in which we can hardli avoid face them . some peopl would deem that most advertis are veri acur and trueli display the qualiti of the product , other , in contrast , total disagre with it which is also my point of view . there are numer reason to support my idea and i would like to introduc two of the most conspicu one . first , the purpos of advertis desid it natur . we know that the advertis are use for introduct , for which ton of money are invest by the compani to make their product well-known and popular . what they expect are the profit , they need the commerci to bring in more money . so of cours they want to show the custom the best side of their product , while some time it is true and may not so appliabl in other condit . take the soda pepsi for exampl , in the commerci the pepsi seem like to be so cool and so delici and drinkabl , it can wipe out all of your heat within , but actual ani kind of beverag can make it . so the natur of advertis for make more profit for the compani make it display the best point of one product , which make the product seem much better . it might be too arbitrari to desid that most advertis are `` fake '' onli by what i list abov . anoth reason for my inclin that they are not so accur lie in the effect of star . the commerci tend to hire star as their spokesman , for exampl , the film star , sport star and beauti model . the result are veri obviou , make the custom to believ that they can becom star if they use the same product , which is an addit function that the product can not actual provid . take a certain brand of eye cream for exampl , if in the advertis nicol kidman is introduc thi brand , custom will tend to believ that that eye cream will make them as fabul as nicol , while sadli they may not be . so the effect of the product is enhanc by the star , result in the rel fake impress to the buyer that the product is better . all in all , base on what we have discuss abov , we can get the conclus that although most of the advertis are true , but the ad effect may be fake to some extend .
