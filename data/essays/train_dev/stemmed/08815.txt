advertis product is veri import for the compani and without do it , the chanc of make a big profit is a slim one . you can see and hear commerci almost everywher , if it 's on televis , radio or on the street . but are the product realli as good as they alway look like in commerci ? in my opinion they are not . there are a few reason whi i think thi way . first , the food alway look so delici on tv and advertis , but if you go to the store or make them product by yourself it never look like the pictur on the packag . there it alway look shinier , everyth seem to be seper when they cook it and it seem to smell veri good . i heard befor they use someth to polish their product so it look shinier , they also use onli the best and good look food and sometim they even replac it with plastic imit . for exampl if they show you a delight chocol bar , it 's usual just a piec of plastic made look ident to the bar . and if you buy it sometim you might be disappoint , becaus it look a lot differ , it 's smash or crumbl . second , clean product are not alway as easi to handl as the televis show it to their custom . for exampl the new swiffer duster , which is a fluffi cotton pad on a plastic stick . on tv the woman just take one of those pad and stick it on the plastic handl . in my person experi it took me quit a long time get it all togeth and even if it 's handier than the regular dust cloth it still doe n't clean as good as the old method . final , cloth are anoth major point in my suggest that advertis product look better in commerci . you alway see them good look women and men on tv that seem to have a perfect bodi for ani kind of cloth . when i go to the store and tri the same one on i usual get disappoint , becaus they do n't look nearli as good as they do on the model . there are quit a few reason whi most product are n't as good as the one in the advertis . but there are some that i bought and i am veri satisfi with and do n't want to miss them in my hous .
