that is a difficult question becaus i think it belong to differ commun . in some region i would agre with that statement becaus there are polit problem that help to let the problem grow . there you find children who grow up without a father or a mother and no one who care about the young child . i understand that these children have no interest to help their commun when they are older becaus no one help them . otherwis it could be that especi that peopl search in commun for help and if they find some they are pleas to help the commun if the help is need . furthermor often you find good condit in wealthi region . whi ? i think they have not that problem like peopl who have to work hard for everi littl thing . these peopl live through the day without think how they surviv tomorrow . in my eye young peolp spent a lot of time to help there commun . pleas do not missunderstand me . but i think if peopl have not that all day problem , they are abl to spent more time in help there commun of cours . furthermor there is an other problem . the televis show how the young peopl have to live today . an there you see often that the children or young peopl work alon or spent more time with other think as to help their commun . on one hand our commun want that we are succesful in what we make and often that is onli possibl if we do that alon and if we spent a lot of time for that but on the other hand the commun sai that we have to spent our time for them . i think that is not possibl . each person ha to think about what for him is import an where he want to focu on . if both direct are equal you have the best way to success in that commun . conclut i want to say that everi person ha to find hi own way and especi the young peopl becaus they grow into that commun with their choic .
