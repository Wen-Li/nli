in my experi , understand idea and concept are more import than learn fact for student . even student know lot of fact about subject exactli in the book or from other sourc , it would be noth if student do n't understand the concept of the idea in the subject . through my experi and from teacher , understand concpet is more worth than learn fact . for exampl , when i wa take intern busi class , i wa learn about the cycl of stock market that how it work . befor the test of that subject , i memor all the fact that i learn from a teacher . howev , i did n't get good mark on the test becaus i did n't understand ani concept or idea of the cycl of stock market . like thi , even the teacher also think that understand concept of subject are more import than the other thing becaus if student do n't understand it or not abl to appli their idea to the subject , it mean knowledg that student learn from teacher or class are noth use . basic , understand idea are harder than learn or know the fact . student could learn the fact easili from the book or other sourc . on the other hand , understand concept requir lot of read and understand what is happen in the subject . therefor , it is not import than to understand concept becaus they do n't know how they use the concept into the fact that what happen . it impli that understand just few concept or idea are more worth than know everi fact . even if you do n't know a lot of fact than the other student , you could possibl guess the fact throught the concept that you understand . due to these reason , i think that it is more import for student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . some peopl would say that fact are more import than the concept of idea or subject , howev , if student are not abl to appli the concept or idea of subject into the fact , it mean noth to studi the subject .
