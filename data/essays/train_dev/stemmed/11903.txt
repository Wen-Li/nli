i think it 's better to special in one specif subject than to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . today we find a job world that doe n't wait our studi , our train . graduat are much more than in the ` 90 , and afteral they are more younger , the challeng in these term are veri strong . the industri , the compani , ... the job world mark point on these : your skill have to be more stronger than a while . we studi to find a good job , remun and , anyway , that turn back award . becaus of thi , if all of we have broad knowledg of mani academ subject ( who better of other , that 's clarifi ) , we certainli have more problem to find the dream ' job . in spite of thi , if somebodi ha a specialist skill , mayb he 'll find less work announc that respond to hi qualif , but sure he wo n't challeng , such as other with a widespread standard knowledg , too hard to obtain that work . i 'm an `` almost engin '' , i see everi day on the newspap , on tv , at my univers how hard is today find worthi peopl : too mani peopl have to broad knowledg of mani academ subject , too mani peopl have to challeng on the same job . thi is my person opinion on thi statem
