most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i do not complet agre with the abov statement becaus advertis have both advantag and disadvantag . firstli , i will discuss about the advantag with quit a few exampl . what exactli a person look for while buy a product ? may be the price , qualiti or some other factor . more clearli , we can say that he or she is not sure in certain situat . final , they make a decis to buy someth new which they have seen last night in the commerci ad . simlarli , when peopl doe not know anyth about a particular product , in most case , they reli on advertis . that an other plu point of advertis . apart from thi , most of the time peopl spend their leisur time by watch televis and read book , which are the excel sourc for advertis . as a result , public come to know about the new product through the ad . come to the disadvantag , the first and foremost is with the children . whenev they found the ad to be attract , they want u to buy the product for them , regardless they use it or not . when come to the food stuff , they alway tri to go for the junk food , where the ad cash in by show them attract . sometim , we see some of the product to be less expens . we usual get attract to and purchas them . but the final result is that it get damag after a short period . we have to compromis for the qualiti . in the conclus , i would like to say that advertis doe not make us buy less qualiti product all the time but they do sometim . it is our mental abil to think what to purchas and what not ? in most case , the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are
