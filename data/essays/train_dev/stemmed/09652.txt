from my perspect , i do agre with the concept of young peopl nowaway do not give enough time to help their commun . the reason whi i have a strong feel toward it is becaus that for the past four year i have been help at the orphanag constantli , but i seldom find ani other young adult like me who is will to take part of their time off in a week or a month to help out those who are in need . mayb i am be too harsh on my peer for ask them to give someth back for their commun , but somehow i start see my countri , taiwan , ha becom a place with cold-heard younger gener . sinc i am a person who walk between the two world , the unit state and taiwan , i share my equal halv on both of my home . i often sign up commun surviv with my peer in the state to just more or less make our commun better , and to provid some care and love for the peopl who realli need it . most importantli , i feel happi around , and some sens of have a meaning life . i even see more young adult in the state are will to help out their commun by do ani kind of servic . mayb that is whi the state is still grow as a steadlili countri , and thi is someth that my chines folk will never understand . there might be some factor for caus thi kind of tragedi . student here are still be punish with corper punish , and their teacher alway brainwash them by tell them that school and grade come first , and noth els is far more import than academ . mayb therefor kid stop concern about what they should actual be care about . the outsid world is no longer a huge impact on their life besid school . i think thi is one of the major problem which drag young peopl to becom less prone to serv back their commun . what we need in the societi now is someon who ha broader horizon , and audaci enough to show some passion to encourag our young peopl to onc be abl to provid some time to help out their commun . sometim i do feel it is a poster thing to realiz that there are less peopl who are will to assist their commun , but i certainli do understand that it is becaus of the surround peopl are live in , with pressur and incom difficulti , that they can not even have a time to rest and think about the thing that will bring love and happi to other peopl and their further gener .
