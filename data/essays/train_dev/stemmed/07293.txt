some peopl say it 's better to special in one specif subject . but i think it 's better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject for two reason . therefor , i agre thi statement . there are advantag to special in one thing . and also it 's need in some occup . a exampl which make thi clear is that a pilot need special knowledg about an airplan and how to fli it . but i find more advantag to studi mani academ subject . first , i think if thier knowledg are broad , they can have wider view . for instanc , as an internet servic ha invent and a better transport system ha develop , you go abroad more frequent . also you becom to see mani peopl who have differ background . at that time , you have to recogn and understand other cultur or histori . if you do n't have a wide view , you ca n't understand and it may be a conflict . second , today , t 's realli complic connect societi so it 's realli import to studi sever academ subject . for exampl , if you are a doctor , you must know how new machin work too . if you know about the mechan of human bodi , it 's meaningless . these day there are so mani high tech machin or robot . so doctor need to know high level phisic too . overal , i think we should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , as we can get wider view . also , becaus a societi is complic connect .
