in my opinion , i think it is much more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . when student in school , obvious they can learn almost everi thing form the teacher , but after they graduat they have to lean the social skill all by themselv . befor they are go to learn the social skill indivisu they need to know how to learn by themselv , there is no teacher anymor . as a student in high school , there is a math teacher of mine alway tell us that preview the lesson befor learn is much better than do noth befor lesson . preview the lesson and learn it all by ourself is use for us to know how we can learn by ourselv without the teacher . we alway face some the question that confus us and there are also sever question we can not solv easili . we have to face them and tri our best to solv it , we do not have to care about whether we will get thi question or not while we are do the preview . if we final solv them all by ourself , then we are not onli feel well but also earn the expir about learn indivisu . if we can not find out the way to solv the question , we should bring them to ask the teacher while we are in the class . we can learn how to solv these kind of question onli by teacher point out some way that we can go , becaus we have alreadi tri it befor the teacher start teach . it is also a good way to rememb thi kind of question . when we face it in a quiz or test , we will easili rememb what the teacher ha taugh and find out the solut . not onli these , we also learn the skill of how to studi independli which i think it is most import . when we finish our educ in school , we are go to find a job or whatev we need to do . mani of thin that we have learn all by ourselv . and the way we can learn thing indivisouli is to get the idea and concept then it is for us to learn fact .
