i 'm not complet agre with thi statement . today , in our world , i think that peopl ca n't do an activ without a gener knowledg of mani academ subject . infact , our societi impos to peopl to have a base cultur and econom knowledg to do everi work or activ . it 's also veri import that peopl are n't onli just like a comput special onli about think they must use in their job . for a big good societi , it 's import also that peopl know a littl bit of cultur , economi , art , religion , histori , and other . .. school must do all it . but when a man decid hi futur , the job of hi life , he need to special in hi specif subject . he must know more think as possibil about the activ that he have chois . sure , he can chang , alway . but if i go to an architect to ask him to project my hous , he must have all the knowledg necessari to project me a hous , and i do n't want that he studi battl of waterloo when he wa at school ! now , i think that better think is : everybodi must know battl of waterloo , or the import of artist element in a hous . everybodi must know most import notion of gener cultur , but it is also necessari that everyon found hi road , and he start to walk to the destin that he have chois , he studi more notion as possibl about it . at the end , he will be abl to do an activ in the best way , and he will be veri import to the other member of hi societi .
