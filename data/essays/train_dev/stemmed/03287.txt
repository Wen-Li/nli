i agre with the fact that most of the advertis ( ad . ) make product seem much better that they in fact are . in my opinion mani time ad . fail to meet the spectat creat when you final get or check what advertis . ad . have mani time veri few to do with realiti becaus of sever reason . i will discuss about some of them from my point of view . first of all , the current tough competit for almost everi product in the economi make the compani exagger the benefit or characterist of their product . everi compani show their product in the ad . as the best and far away better than the other made by competitor . when i wa a child mani time i got dissapoint with most ot the toy i receiv as gift at birthday , those toy seem to be much bigger on tv that in my hand . anoth point ha to do with qualiti . mani time the qualiti you get is much worst that what is offer or suggest in ad . for exampl the sport shoe never last me so longer than i expect from the ad . i see and the price i pay for them . moreov anoth issu is custom servic of servic given to custom onc he or she bought someth . in ad . most of the compani focuss on their qualiti and respons . unfortun most of the time you can not get easili a satisfactori repli to one question or complaint rais . i face bad experi with the call center of the telecom compani wast a lot of time and money in uselless reclam . anoth trick use by ad . is the way those ad . are show . normal on tv you can see gorgeou peopl or aggress music , so you rather pay attent to the person or musich announc the item than the annonc item itself . link to thi is when famou peopl as actor , actress , film maker , sportmen or sportwoman are use in the ad . to sum up , i do not believ what is show in the ad . sinc they make the produc be more attract than they realli are . ad . are not factual most of the time .
