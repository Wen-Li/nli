special in my opinion is a key word that ha to be taken into account . from experi that have occur to me in life i have forg a neg idea of the knowledg of mani subject . i i think thi is a valid explanatori element therefor i have decid to includ thi happen in order to give my thougt some back up . my english teacher in the 12th grade made a clear distinct between the italian teach system and the american teach system . the italian system had a vast program but it did not prepar student for `` that specif sector '' in univers and then work . on the other hand he emphas the fact that the american educ system had fewer amount of topic but the piec of inform absobr by the student would have surli been store in hi long term memori becom perman knowledg . whilst depth knowledg can connect a student to `` work '' in gener , the student with a vast but more superfici knowledg will probabl have more difficulti in settl and find an occup suitabl for him . for all these reason i think special knowledg ha a more utlist aspect that the knowledg of seldom subject lack . it is true that knowledg of a varieti of topic can be appli in other life situat but the need peopl have in our societi are differ . a person goe to the univers as he want to have knowleg on a certain topic , thi knowledg will enabl him to find a job . recal on anoth life experi , my father that own a fabriqu told me how he had some employe that lack of the work skill . all turn out to be a wast of time sinc he had to teach and explain the inform that ha not been taught previous . if a person special on a singl subject he will easili work effectivli therefor the result for societi will be postiv . i think school and univers should provid thi system and then they should give the opportun for student to reasearch singularli . if a person is attract by the vast varieti of knowledeg he should research and studi on hi own , an unclear knowleg of mani topic may undermin work system in societi .
