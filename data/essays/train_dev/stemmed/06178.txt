i agre with the statement that '' most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are '' . usual the product in the advertis are shown to be more good look , eleg , tasti , good textur , and all the higher qualiti , for which most of the time they do n't possess all those qualiti . for exampl take an advertis of suit 's and shirt , the dress they show seem to be veri beauti and attract , elegantli colour , but the same when you see trueli may not be so good , the stich may not be so perfect , the colour shade may not be appropri and it may not fit well . the other exampl , if we take the advertis regard the food product , they show them to be veri tasti and delici and they also show that they can be prepar within few minut , but actual when we realli tast them they may not be that delici , or it may even take long time for prepar it . even the advertis on variuo medic product show that the medicin work realli faster , in a more effici way , and they show all the thing that make us appeal that the product is of superior qualiti , but in real they may be associ with variou side effect and may act differ on differ individu or even the cost may be higher . for exampl onc i wa watch an advertis over the televis which wa an equip use for reduc weight . the advertis said that we got to workout onli for 15minut on that equip and no diet necessari and it would make you lose about 5 pound per week , and even they were show some of the peopl and their experi who use that product and by look at all those i wa so tempt to buy the product and order it , but onc when i got the product and start use for few day , i could n't see ani lose in my weight but i also notic knee pain problem by use that equip . so , with that i clearli came to know that never beleiv in advertis as they usual make the product seem better that they realli are to increas their sale . so , atlast i strongli agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem better as , that thi the primari job of advertis in order to increas their sale and benefit , and it 's our duti to care judg the true characterist of the product and decid whether to buy or not .
