i think that in twenti year there wo n't be fewer car than there are today becaus of differ factor as it can be tha growth of the popul , the improv of the technic or the global . the popul is grow on everi countri becaus of the improv in the saniti , technolog . .. that make that the popul growth also in the `` first world countri '' so morew peopl will be abl to reach a car . also , one of the main point is the improv of the technolog . mayb it can be thought that becaus of the polut or the non pollut plan that the govern are tri to impuls in some year most of the peopl will chang their car for the public transport . becaus of that the car compani are invest money in evolut new green technolog like hidrogen batteri that will make possibl to use a car without polut , in fact you will creat just water instead of dioxid carbon that is realli harmful for our enviro . in deed , that improv of the technolog will make cheaper all the proce of make a car , so there will be more peopl who will be abl to obtain a car when befor that improv they could n't . and here is where the global get 's in . all the old technolog that are not use in the `` first world countri '' will be sold on sale to those countri that are not that rich . in that way , countri where most of the peopl could n't afford a car , they will have car reachebl . and that mean more car bee use on the world . to sum up , i think that all the problem such as polit plan or enviroment pollut becaus of the use of petrol , will be resolv by the improvemnt of technolog that is alreadi known , such as hidrogen batteri as i told befor .
