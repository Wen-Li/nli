`` noth is better than to be youth ! '' , is somethin that my grandfath is remind me about everytim we meet . so mayb it 's someth true about it . i personali agre with the statement . there are much more young peopl , who seem to be confid and happi about their life than in the elder popul group . the biggest fascin about be young , is the freedom you have and all the posibl that still can be reach . when your young you can make mistak and wrong decis , which doe n't mean you have fail for ever . there is alway someth new to see or to do when your young . for exampl get in contact with peopl from all over the world . travel wherev you want to , and work where you decid . the life can be so unexpect and spontani while be a teenag or student . if you 're bore by your situat , as a student you have the complet rang of possibl to chang your life , and to enjoy again . in my opinion , to be old , is the absolutli other way around . if you have an own familiy , which of cours can be veri nice too , you ca n't chang the way of your life immediatli - what young peopl can do . later on , you hardli can chang anyth , includ a bore job you 're put into . mani old peopl seem to me frustrat and unhappi about their life - unfortun there is hardli ani solut for them . to show up the sitiuat even more clearli , i would argu that young peolp chang the world and the rule of life . the older peopl just follow the newborn trend . and i don ; t have to emphasic that it is better to control other , to enjoy everi new develop is the plessur of the youth and not of the older one , do i ? for mani old peopl their last plesur is to see their rel achiev and grow up . they follow the life of other peopl and not their own . .. trueli frustrat . the option of get new hobbi , or abil is someth excit . but thi is mainli reserv to the 17-32 yearold group . i am peronali veri confid and lucki eith my life and in my life , and enjoy everi day , all the possibl and oportun . car
