i disagre with the statement becaus take risk is veri danger and often becam veri unsuccess over mani year . there are hundr of compani i never heard of that were found by a person took risk to make some money . even though it may sound easi , but it is veri complic : deal with employ , monthli or yearli payment , govern tax , etc . as the result , onli a few compani or even no compani will surviv . the result make mani peopl becom moneyless or deptor . take risk is not a good idea . tri is not a bad thing , but risk is not a good thing . there are onli a few peopl who succeed by risk , while there are million who unsucceed by risk . that 's whi peopl who onli doe what they alreadi know how to do well succe more often than those who take risk . for exampl , earli pioneer tri to make fli possibl for human . of cours , the inventor succeed , but the other lost money , wast time , or even die . but now billion of peopl fli each year in an airlin or privat airplan . how did that happen ? the manufactur compani invent better airplan , base on the earli inventor ' design . in other word , they invent what they alreadi knew how to do well . then the manufactur compani succeed , sell thousand of the same model , for the same price , and end what it 's like today . there are mani success peopl who tri new thing and took risk . but there are more peopl who succeed by not take risk and onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . like i mention earlier , take risk could chang peopl 's live in a bad way by make them lose money , or even kill them . but onli do what you alreadi know how to do well is an easier and safer way to succeed .
