i studi commun and i have learn that one of the object of advertis is to rescu the posit thing of a product or servic . so i disagre with the statement that `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' becaus i think that advertis do n't make product seen better , they just show the posit thing of a product . for exampl , if i buy watch , mayb my watch are n't cheap , but they have a guarante for 10 year . so i have to commun - in the advertis - `` my watch are n't cheap but you are go to save a lot of money becaus of the 10 year guarante '' . what is not permit is to be dishonest . in a class name `` legisl of the commun media '' i learn that are advertis code and rule that shoud n't be broken . in that code is state that compani ca n't lie about their product . onc i heard a profesion in advertis say that `` if you have to use dirti kind of advertis is becaus you are'nt a good advertis '' . i complet agre with that . if you are profession in what you do , you will sure find a good qualiti of the product to advertis instead of break rule and be dishonest . it true that advertis have to persuad , but there are a lot honest and legal way to make an effect persuat . of cours there are advertis that make the product seem much better than they realli are , but i do n't think there are the most . there will alway be peopl that brake rule , but you will surpris to see how mani peopl make hi best effort with the rule they have .
