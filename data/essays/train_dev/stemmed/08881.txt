the depart i am current studi ha the polici to encourg all the student to special on financ or market . the logic behind is that you can not make smart choic if you have less and broad knowledg in a specif topic . i total agre with the idea that focus is better . becaus i believ that you can not talk or make comment about everi topic in the world and to special encourg you to learn more and make you love the topic . firstli have broad knowledg of mani academ subject onli give small opinion about them and one can not know the detail . therefor the abil to make comment on the subject and talk about the issu becom imposs . for instanc someon who watch onli the teaser of a film onli can tell one or two sentenc . howev a person who watch the film and read mani thing from the magazin about the film can make comment or discuss about the film . thu the peopl have less about a topic have not the right to discuss about thi issu and can not be abl to make smart comment . secondli know a lot of thing about an issu encourg to learn the topic more and make love the topic . becaus the beauti hide in the detail . when i start to learn about a topic it alway seem to me veri bore and hard to understand . howev after pass thi point and come to the detail i find thi subject more interest becaus i start to understand . thu know the detail make the subject import for me / to sum up becaus the polici of my univers i am use to focu rather than have broad knowledg . i would like to special in one specif subject becaus of two reason . the first reason is the abil to make comment and discuss bout the issu . the second reason is that detail make me love and encoug me to learn about it . focus is alway better than know less but about mani subject for me .
