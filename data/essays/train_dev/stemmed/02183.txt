take risk and tri new thing are import factor in order to be success . howev , it is equal import to be sensibl at the same time in order to achiev someth . one the one hand , onli peopl who are will to tri someth new and to take risk can stand out and do better than their competitor . it is neccessari for peopl who want to have success to believ in their idea and to be self-confid . a person that never dare someth will most probabl not be veri success . today , innov is veri import but alway connect to a certain risk as well . e.g. launch a new product can fail complet , cost a lot of money and it might even lead to a compani 's bankrupci . howev , if it is success , the profit of the innov is usual higher than the profit of product that have been establish on the market for a long time . onli compani that come up with innov regularli are competit and abl to maintain thier market share . one the other hand , peopl who do not know when to stop often risk a lot . if the risk is to high , it is better not to take it . to my mind , it is sometim better to stand still than to risk lose everyth . if someth is not veri like to be success , it is a veri import characterist of a person in a high posit to decid against it . furthermor , it is not alway neccessari to do new thing if the `` old one '' work well . in conclus , i agre that peopl tri new thing and dare thing are often more success becaus one can onli stand out in today 's societi by differenti from the other . thi is veri import sinc success is defin by do better than the averag . nevertheless , i believ that it is veri import to know , when someth is too riski . onli peopl who balanc these to factor well will be realli success .
