i most certainli agre with thi statement , `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' . the two exampl of my experi and aspect of magazin worker will verifi the truth of my posit . a few day ago , my mother bouth a car cleaner which wa advertis on televis . the advertis wa too exagger . it said that everi scratch can be erais with that product . after my mother saw that advertis , she bought one without hestit becaus recent her car got a big scratch somehow . howev , my mother and i found that it doe not work as it advertis . we knew that we were diceiv and decid not to believ anyth advertis but onli the experi of the other . there is anoth exampl . when i read the magazin , i alway want to buy someth advertis no matter it is expens or not . by peopl who alway focus on sell the product to consum , mani magazin are decor with fanci word and exagger . we need to consid about that group of peopl . in that peopl respect , they do not make product but onli thing they have to do is make advertis great so that they need to draw peopl . their onli purpos is to make peopl to buy that product which mean they make advertis make product seem alway nice and perfect . who woud show their shortcom of product ? becaus of the exampl abov , i believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they relli are . everi consum have to be wise consum which mean they need to compar the real product and the advertis befor they purchas . so if one would like to buy the product onli see the advertis , i would like to say the one , ` do not believ most advertis but be wise and smart consum ' .
