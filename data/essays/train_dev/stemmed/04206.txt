in my point of view , i can not agre with statement ; young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . becaus , i think , order peopl have experi , knwoledg and shape of life . young peopl almost think that they can ani thing and they can break some situat with young power . but it is not ture , mey be . all need is , in my opinion , experi . when we solv some problem , we will call back own experi . and if we got a same stiation befor , we could find solut form experi . older peopl have lot of experi , becaus they live long time than young peopl . so older peopl could find solut soon . less problem make enjoy life . second , older peopl have mani kind of knowledg . thu , older peopl can understand the almost thing . and they can share these knowledg with hi sun or other peopl . he can teach somet . it is so exicit and enjoyn thing . in the other hand , young peopl can not thi share . becaus they are so young and they have not enogh knowledg to teach for anoth person . final , older peopl have shape of life . it mean they can find a answer ; who am i and what is distnat of life . in yougtim , we alway search some ansew ; who i am or what should do in my life . in that situat , we have no time for enjoy life . we alway should keep think or search . order pepol , howev , will some answer about thi question from enoght experi or knowledg . so they can not hurri in their life and they can enjoy hi lest of life . all in all , seeminglli , youg pepl have lot of time and they can enjoy their life more , but , in fact , older peopl can more enjoy than young peopl . becaus they have experi , knowledg and shape of life .
