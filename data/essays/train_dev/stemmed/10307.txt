first of all i would like to defin what a car might be in 20 year . for me it is possibl that car can fli in twenti year . thu , the traffic will extend from the ground into the air . the world 's popul is increas everi year , which mean that there will be more custom , who will need a car . china , for exampl , is becom economicli more and more successful . there will be an increas in the employ rate , which lead to a higher qualifi person and an increas in the individu incom . basicli , peopl can afford more , and one of the first thing someon buy when he can afford it , is a car . at hte same time more poepl mean more logist to sustain the basic neciss of life . there will be an incres in public transport as well . if there will be rescrict on the total number of vehicl on the planet becaus of pollut , i simpli say that fossil resourc will be exhaust in twenti year , anyway , and that engin will run on electr from sunlight or other clean energi sourc . car are the cheapest choic for transport , next to train of cours , but they are much more mobil than train and therefor more frequent use to transport good . i guess that the car produc industri will although have a word in that matter , becaus it is an ever new invent section of industri , which provid may work place all over the planet . the car industri can count on government aid should it ever come to a point when no more car are need , which will never . ever ! therefor i total diagre with the statement , that there will be less car on the road than there are today . human societi and the world wide trade would crush down without a agil and cheap transport systam as car .
