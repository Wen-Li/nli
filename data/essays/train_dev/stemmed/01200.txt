do you agre with the statement that young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their commun ? for my person and fond , i agre that yonug peopl spend too less time on concern their communicati . in addit , i will argu over the belif in the follow reason . first of all , i think that young peopl spend too much time on their stude and play . for exampl , most of student go to librari for research inform after calss . in addit , mani student go to play basebal and suffer the internet in their free time . moreov , some young peopl prefer do other execis to help their commun . furthermor , young peopl think that it is wast time for help communicati . in a word , few young peopl will to help their communicatii . secondli , young peopl think that it is not necessari to help their communicatui . for exampl , mani young peopl spend mani on buy their toy instead of help other . in addit , most of young peopl think that communicati is not their best friend or relat , so they do not will help them . moreov , the soical structur ha a great chang nowday , few young peopl ha also chang thier concept about how to help other . furthermor , young peopl ha mislead concept that they do have responbl to help other . in short , mani young peopl do not give enough time on thier commun . in summari , i think that young peopl do not give enough time to help their communicati becaus they do not realiz that help other is an essenti vituer and valu for human . in the end , i will conclud my argument by emphas that young peopl do not understand that the enjoy and happi from help our commun .
