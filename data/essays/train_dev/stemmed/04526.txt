nowaday lot of peopl look for success but they do not take risk to achiv it . from my point of view , success is someth that you have to look for and to work for but it is not someth that come to you without effort . thu , you have to take risk rather than keep your whole life onli do what you know as it decreas the possibl to be succes . on the one hand , some peopl decid to dedic their entir life to do what they alreadi know how to do well but who know if there is someth that you could do better but you are not awar about it ? for instanc , if you are a veri good dentist but you have alway been work for someon els you will never know if your own bussi would be more succes than the one of the person whom you are work for . on the one hand , you could be work your whole life for someon els and do what you know how to do , dentistri in thi case . on the other hand , you could take the risk to open your own bussi and even to creat your own franchis . nevertheless , take risk doe not mean success becaus your bussi can fail and you can loos money as well . for exampl , if you decid to open your own practic you can find that you have not patient and of cours , that you have no money . but , you can realiz that with the time your number of patient increas as well as your money and that your practic is be success . howev , you can never know if a project is go to be succeed if you do not risk and tri it . therefor , peopl can work in what they know how to do well and becom succes after have risk someth , in thi case money to invest . wherea , peolpl that is work in what they know how to do but they do not take risk are less like to succeed . so , we should take risk in order to succeed and also to learn what we did wrong if we have been unsuccess .
