if i wa ask `` there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year '' , i would answer i do n't think so . there are two reason in my opinion . first , some peopl use car , while other use train and buse , but both transport are veri busi in the morn . so see from nowaday situat , to dicreas use car will lead to a seriou problem . for exampl , we ca n't get on the train which we want to get on becaus of busi and full , we are late to be the go place becaus of train 's late run . therefor i do n't think there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year sinc if there are fewer car in use , public transport ca n't work . second , sinc mani peopl love to drive a car includ me , i 'm sure that car in use will not dicreas . moreov such as peopl do n't like use busi train . they prefer drive a car to use anoth transport . lastli , car compani sill develop car 's model , cost and now they tri to make new kind of car like economi car . so i beiliev car in use are increas .
