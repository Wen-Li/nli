i agre whit the answer . my opinion is that car is veri import for the peopl , for the live of peopl , becaus the moder peopl use the car for live . thay use the car for go to work , school , holyday , for spend a good time in the near citi . .. twenti year old ther wa less peopl and the peopl use other transport for move , and the prize for buy a car is veri big for the normal peopl . onli few peopl can buy the car . today the prize is less and mani peopl can buy . today the industrian produc a lot type of car for ani type peopl and ani type use , thu ani peopl can buy the veri good car for you life / job . now i would also like a draw your attent for the use that the moder peopl do of your car . the problem is not how lot car there is , but how may use car ! the moder peopl wrong use a car . the govern give a possibl to use an other instrumen for travel , there is an airplain for the long long travel , there is a train for a long travel or bu for short travel , but the moder peopl prefor use a car , whi ? becaus the car is more confort . . but is mor expens for the peopl , petrol is careful , and for the comun , the heart is ill . when ther peopl know thi the peopl chang the type of your live , i think that thay continu to buy a car , is import , i think that there is one car for ani famili . . for the emerg , but if the peopl use less the car the cost for the comun will be lesat . few peopl know thi but thay , for now , do not chang your comportamnt . .. i hope thay do thi . . in a futur .
