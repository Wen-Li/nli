as told by our ancestor `` knowledg is wealth '' , ad to that most of the individu today believ that it better to be knowledg about as mani subject as you can apart from your academ . knowledg is never confin to one particular subject or topic it increas along with your intetrest . not mani peopl tri to explor knowledg base avail around them . a person can do miracl in hi academ but a person who can out perform in an area which is out of hi scope would be appreci for hi achiev . ani student need not tri to learn everyth avail in the librari but go an extra mile studi someth which is not relat to hi academ but which help him in real life alway benefit him . it may be histori , polit or scienc anyth of that matter . nowaday student realis the use of be more knowledg about extern affair which alway been part of a normal convers they have . mani student who tri to acquir bookish knowledg need to be taught about the import of realtim knowledg . apart from academ subject we can make atleast basic of other subject mandatori for student by which they turnout to be more knowledg . take an exampl of biolog student who is workng in a laboratori with electr equip may not be awar of the amount of power he is play with , which might even cost him hi life , so it would be beneficail to eduact him about work of electr as well . thi allow him to be more care when he is deal with someth which is not of prior import to him . at the end i would like to say that it alway help you to grow as an individu when you deriv as much as you can from the vast knowledg base avail around you !!!!!
