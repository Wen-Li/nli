understand idea and concept and learn fact are both veri import for student . idea and concept deriv often form fact and fact are alway influenc and produc by idea , so i think these two element are close correl . for exampl , student can learn a lot by stude histori , which is a complex mix of fact , idea and concept . they should learn what happen in the past , the fact , the war , the move of peopl , but they should also know whi these fact happen and possibl tri to connect caus and effect . if you just learn abstract concept and idea it is not easi to put them in the concret life . idea and concept have their origin in fact that have happen . so it would be insuffici to learn them and not to learn the fact that origin them . for the same reason i think it is veri import to learn the fatct togeth with concept and idea that help to understan whi fact happen . i think that if you sudi just a list of fact without to tri to find the reason and the consequ of these fact you can understand properli the import of fact you studi . i think that also in scientif field fact and idea should be learnt togeth . if student learn just theori they miss the real import of idea and find . they should understand what the idea and concept they studi mean in the practic , how they can be use and have alreadi been use . so i think it is veri import to consid both point and that student should learn idea , concept and fact togeth
