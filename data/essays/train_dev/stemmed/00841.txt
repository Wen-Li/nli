i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . now , to make the statement clearli , i defin the age of each peopl . i set the age of young peopl around 20 , and the age of older peopl around 60 . i can not decid which peopl enjoy more becaus both of them ha differ kind of thing to enjoy their life . so , i would like to compar some point . the ordinari differ between young peopl and older peopl are the phisic abil , the quantiti of money , the varieti of the experi and so on . now , i compar these thing between young peopl and older peopl . first , as to the phisic abil , young peopl ha more abil than older peopl . so , we can say that young peopl enjoy more than older peopl such as sport or danc all night or other thing which need energi . second , as to money , most older peopl have more money than they were young . so , older peopl can enjoy more than young peopl when do someth cost a lot . for exampl , my parent enjoy their life with use more money than it use to be . they go to the restrant often and eat delici meat , and they go to concert or see the show . these thing are cost too much for the young peopl to enjoy often . third , the qualiti of experi is greatli differd between young peopl and older peopl . becaus young peopl have not know variou thing in the societi yet , they can experi new thing everyday . so they enjoy know new thing , new peopl , new way of think . on the other hand , older peopl can live with their variou experi for their long life . in the 60 year , they experienc variou kind of thing which the young peopl have not expereinc yet . so , they know more enjoy thing than young peopl . consid these point , i can not say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . both peopl enjoy their own life with their own step .
