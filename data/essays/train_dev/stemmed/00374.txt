the question of how mani car will be in use in futur time is veri signific , in particular with regard to the enorm damag the use of car caus to our environ and the shrink oil suppli of the world . it 's a matter of fact that soon we wo n't be abl ani more to drive as mani car as we are drive today . thu , we should think about altern solut in order to come from one spot to anoth . mayb today 's car are the less pollut ever , but nevertheless the air pollut caus by everyday traffic is still enorm and nearli unbeliev . thi air pollut doe not onli affect futur gener , but we as well feel alreadi the consequ , such as a constant elev of the world 's averag of temperatur , lead to a danger shrink of ice in the mountain , or unknown climat catastroph such as hurrican . becaus of these climat chang and their direct impact on our live i think , that soon the question , whether to drive by car or to take a train , will no longer be a person decis . besid , the cost of provid an own car increas more and more . when somebodi drive a car he 's total depend on the oil compani 's will . it is true that they are defend the high cost by bring forward the difficult polit situat in the countri where they are exploit the oil , but for the consum thi doe not chang anyth : he ha to face the high cost . thu , these high cost will soon oblig the peopl to consid altern , becaus they ca n't afford the amount of money that is necessari . and even if the cost will reduc to the former level , oil exploitaton remain a temporarili limit exploit , becaus it is no renew ressourc . so , sooner or later , everybodi ha to chang hi habit . in my opinion , a futur vision of street with onli a few car drive , is a posit one . the best thing i can imagin is a world in which nearli all place are connect by a train network . the construct will be expens but it will be worth it becaus everybodi will use it , in particular if thi kind of travel offer accomod price .
