young or old .. it 's all about joy there are differ between the think of old and young peopl due to sever reason , the most import of it is their life style and experi , and their method to enjoy themsev , as the definit of enjoy life and how to enjoy life can differ from young peopl to older peopl in a huge scale . as a young woman , i believ that youth enjoy life for the sake of enjoy it and not for the happi that thi joy can result . young peopl think that there are mani year left in life and we should enjoy it as much as possibl befor they have seriou respons such as career and famili . unfortunatli , some time enjoy life for young peopl mean irresponsibl and careless in life , thi is not true for all young peopl , but mani of them interpret it thi way . accord to what i mention befor , i dont agre with the statment that say `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl '' , as i believ that older peopl do enjoy life , but in a differ way than younger gener would understand , thi is due in mani reason like the lack of commun between older and younger gener , and their differ difinit of enjoy life . for exampl , i enjoy life by travel around the world and by meet new freiend and new contact , and i alway request my mother to do so , but she as an older gener tell me that her biggest joy now is to rais her children well , and to watch them get success and happi , while year ago she use to enjoy her self differ . therefor , i believ that older peopl enjoy life as much as younger peopl , and sometim even more , but the differ is about the think of older peopl , and their experi after grow wise and matur , which are great thing that the younger gener can learn from , and therefor enjoy life more .
