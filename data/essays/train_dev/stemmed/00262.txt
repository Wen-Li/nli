in our societi , be success ha becom a necess , due to the veri strong pressur face by the individu ever sinc he is a child in term of financi , intellectu , cultur and person achiev . what is it exactli that we refer to when we talk about success peopl ? what is it about them that we envi so much ? are success peopl those who take risk and do new thing , or those that stick to their domain of expertis ? it seem to me that we ca n't figur out what make somebodi success if we do n't ask ourselv in the first place how we defin success . the imag of success that prevail in our societi , through advertis , televis or star , mostli deal with materi good that have littl to do with person achiev and basicli reflect financi success . and even though everybodi critic it , we have to admit that financi and materi comfort are the most common and envi form of success . consequ , we might conclud that to achiev thi goal , it is smarter to find a domain of expertis and stick to it , in order to becom a well-known doctor , lawyer or scientist and benefit from it in term od social statu and financi advantag . nevertheless , be a success person might mean someth veri difer , if we put in perspect the inher social pressur and focus more of the individu 's happi and self-achiev . beinf success in the eye of the other is one thing , feel success and happi is a total difer matter , that might impli to satisfi one 's curios and follow one 's dream . in that case , success peopl are the one who tri new thing and take risk , in the sens that they follow their instinct and sometim jeopard their financi comfort to achiev someth more person they believ in . of cours , when these peopl are famou rock star or movi icon , everybodi will recogn their success becaus they also made a lot a money , but what about all the total anonym peopl ? to me , a lawyer that turn in a restaur owner , a businessman who decid to write poetri are success if they feel good about what they do , no matter how they are perceiv by societi . to conclud , i would say that do new thing and take risk is total necessari for the individu to face the difer side of hi person , but they do not alway match with be success in the social meaninf of the word .
