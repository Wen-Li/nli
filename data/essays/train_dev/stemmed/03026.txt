we can see mani advertis in our life . on tv , magazin , newspaer and even we can see on a street through the window . do these advertis make peopl to buy the product ? absolut ye , becaus most of them make product seem much better than they realli are . i have three reason whi and how advertis make product seem better ; advertis show onli good thing , they use popular person as a model and they repeat same thing . first of all , advertis show onli good thing . they naver show neg thing . for exampl , there is a comput . thi comput is veri fenci and look good howev the function is veri limit and it ha small memori . would the advertis of thi comput say that it ha limit function and small memori ? it would show onli good thing and overst about it howev it would not mention about bad thing . peopl do n't know about neg thing and know onli good thing so they may think product are veri good . second , they use popular person as a model to attract peopl . mani advertis use popular star in spite of pay huge amout of money . peopl think they can be similar with the model as they use the product . for exmapl , model of cloth ' advertis are all pretti and skinni , becaus peopl think if they wear the cloth they can be as pretti as them . last of all , they are repeat so peopl remind the product anytim . same advertis are repeat . sometim , i saw same advertis for more than 10 time a day . although at first time i just pass the advertis , howev later i wa interest in the advertis and the product . advetis repeat same state and action so make peopl agre with them . for these reason , advertis make product seem much better than they realli are so make peopl buy product . in my opinion we should be care with these advertis to not buy that we are not neccessari . advertis is just an advertis . we can enjoy to see it , howev we should not beilev all what they say .
