the futur ha alway interest human be , as well as technolog . we happen to wonder about sever topic , like guess if there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today or not . we could agre with thi statement and think that there will be other way to move around in the futur , but we are not sure of anyth for now . thi is the reason whi i believ in car rather than in futur technoligi , such as fli ship or so . we can evoqu the presenc of the train and the plane , which have a rather good success among peopl nowaday than in the past . thi would be a good point , becaus peopl take them a lot more than ever . thi is due especi to their effici and safeti . they are faster than a car and safer , for exampl . some of us might prefer to travel by train or by plane sinc we do not have to drive or to focu on what is go on , and that we can fit a lot more peopl in these mean of transport . howev , it is rare to arriv exactli where we want to by train or plane . that is , we will still reli on someon to come pick us up at the train station or at the airport . to my mind , i do not think that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year . inde , peopl are buy more and more car , as in the unit state . other countri are begin to do the same . everytim we need to go somewher , it is becomimg automat : we take the car . thi is faster and easier for un sinc we do not have to walk or do some physic activ . human be are becom depend on their car . thi is anoth reason whi i think there will be more car in use in twenti year . in conclus , i do not agre with the statement given , but in the pursu of the car industri . the car ha becom a part of human ' live ( for most of us ) , therefor i believ it still ha good day to come .
