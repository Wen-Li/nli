in my opinion , for student it is more import understand the idea and concept than just learn the fact . the advantag of understand the idea and concept is that it is hard to forget , and easi to use . if i lean somet deepli and understand the idea , i would rememb that forev . in additon , if i see someth which is similar or differ thing but contain the same concept , i can straigh understand it and use it . for exampl , i learn account when i wa in a first year senior high school studend , eventough i onli did it for a year , but i fulli understand all the concept . afert i go to univers , i restart to studi account , eventhough i learn that two year ago , but i still rememb most of the thing . that help me save a lot of time , and have extra time to studi other subject . on the other hand , if i just lean someth without understand it , it would be easier to lean and i do not have to spend a lot of time to undersand it . for instanc , onc i wa prepair the histori test , there wa not much time , so i just rememb it without understand how did everyth happen . at the time , i pass the test , but for the final exam , i have to studi that again , becaus i can not rememb anythin at all . in summari , i think student go to school for learn someth to improv our life . futhermor , to extend our knowledg . we learn the idea and concept from school and put it into our daili life . that is the purpos of whi we go to school . howev , if we go to school and just learn all the fact for just pass the exam , then we completli missunderstand the purpos of eduact .
