it is a controvers issu that which is more import for student to understand idea and concept or to learn fact . some peopl say that student learn fact becaus it 's easi to memor about someth . but in my opinion , student have to learn idea and concept about someth becaus of two reason . first of all , learn idea and concept are a basic way to understand everyth . if they just memoris fact about someth , for exampl , mayb at that time they think they know everyth . but after that if they met some problem that are simmil with someth that they just learn , they will not be abl solv the probl becaus they just learn not basic idea and concept but the fact about someth . which mean they do n't know how to solv the problem and how to think to find the way . second , if student learn idea and concept about someth , it make student can more creativ than that they just learn fact . for instanc , if student learn about a car and underst idea or concept about how to move the car , after then they can expect that how to move a truck or bu . also , they will think about other transport like a train or subway and think about their work . mayb these think way make student more creativ . in conclus , becaus of reaon that i abov mention , student have to understand idea and concept when they learn about someth . it is a best way to understand and also it help student think about everyt creativ .
