a lot of young peopl i know want to live their life in a veri intens way while they are still young . they think that when they get old they will not be abl to enjoy life as much as they do now . but is thi realli true ? well , first of all young peopl normal are healthier than older peopl . so they are abl to be activ everi day and do all kind of sport or to travel a lot . they can also go out at night till veri late , have fun in bar and club . by do so they get to know a lot of peopl and make a lot of friend . while still at school young peopl are most like to have more free time than adult in which they can do whatev they want . they are less respons for other than older peopl are and can therefor tri out more thing . on the other hand older peopl do n't have to find out what they like , they alreadi know it . mayb they have less time becaus they have to go to work , but they have enough money to afford their hobbi . also other thing in life get more and more import . like famili or the job . most peopl who enjoy their job also enjoy their life . all in all i do n't think that young peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl . i think that they have just differ way to enjoy their time . and none is better than the other . it s just a process that we all go through . what we mean by `` enjoy life '' chang as we get older . and older peopl alreadi had their `` wild time '' - when they were young .
