i agre with the statement . first , in the tour we can make new friend . in my case , thi summer i went kamikouchi by tour , and then i could make lot of friend . fathremor , i wa abl to get the inform of other tour from the new friend , and next summer i will go with them . second , we can go trip without prepar , even the place we do n't know . forexanpl , if we wish to go egypt and we do n't have ani inform of egypt , mayb we can not find the way to go egypt with own our self . but if we join the tour , tour guid will get inform for us and introduc lot of place in there . in addit i can go trip alon . i do not have to find friend who are intrest to the same place . all i have to do is choos the place to trip and find the tour to complet my hope . so , i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
