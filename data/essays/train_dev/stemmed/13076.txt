i disagre about , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , becaus learn fact are more interest , student can get more inform when they are lear fact , and student can also understand the idea form fasct . when student are learn someth , they usual veri easi to get brod , that is more fun if teacher talk about fact . such as a histori class , if the teacher just talk about the year and what issu happen in the year , stduent do not formili with it , and the teacher talk about some stori about thoe issu , student will pay atent to the fun stori . student need to learn mani inform everyday , and learn fact could get mani inform from it . if a teacher show a fact about law , student may learn about mani other knowleg , like math , differ peopl . student learn fasct is not just for fun , is also can get the idea when they are learn . when a teacher are talk a stori , student are still think about it , like which is de bad porsen , which is the good thing to do , and so on . i think learn fact are more import .
