i 'm learn polit at the univers and it is veri hard to agre with thi statement . it is also hard to respons whether concept or histor fact are the most import to know becaus i think that we hardli need to refer to common concept to gain some time between poepl who share the same knowledg but those concept are in gener tightli link to the context from were they are born . to explain someth for instanc a govern composit , action or organis we 'll need to refer to common concept such as `` check and balanc '' , `` proportionn major '' , `` executif power '' , and so on . . you and your auditor must share the same definit of such term to understand each other . but at the same time , in order to realli catch the mean of thi word or concept , you need as an intellectu process to refer to someth concret . for instanc , as you may talk about dictatur you will often refer to hitler . when you talk about commun , you will think about what happen dure cold war between the unit state and russia . idea and concept are not more nor less import than fact . the both are hardli link in my experi work onli in an abstract way use combin of concept to explain someth would be , at first , veri hard to understand becaus at the first concept you do n't understand you would be lost and furthermor you may not rememb what you ' ve been listen for hour long . secondli , i think that even in polit wich is call a scienc , poepl may share differ definit of a singl concept for instanc : democraci . is a fascist parti democrat ? no ? not allow that veri parti to take part of elect is more democrat ? concept and idea need the fact and context to be understood . and we can say that to realli classifi a fact or a context in an intellig categori we need concept and idea that we share . thi explos is call an insurect , thi one an incid , thi one a revolut and so on .
