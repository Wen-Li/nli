i think that there is no real decreas in the amount of time that young peopl are dedic to help their comun nowaday compar to what wa usual in the past . as far as i am regard , what realli ha chang is the way peopl , and youngster as well , contribut to the life of their commun . until less than one centuri ago the famili wa the center of the comun and most of the social need where cover trough the help of the famili member . for exampl , if we think about the care of elderli peopl , it wa almost entir carri out by famili member , therebi reduc the need for help from the surround commun . of cours thi requir all the famili member , also young peopl , to take an activ role in the famili life . nowaday is not the same anymor and in order to have the same `` servic '' is requir an higher involv of the commun , sinc the famili , have chang so much , is no more abl to take care of the same function and requir support from outsid . thi mean that there is a greater need for volunt insid the commun but at the same time pepol should be abl to dedic more time to the commun , as they are requir to do less within the famili . the same is true for young peopl , who are in fact activ in a lot of field . i myself wa for sever year a volunt for an hike club , and devot most of my sunday from spring to fall to lead group of kid to the mountain to discov natur . some of my friend have been involv in care of elderli peopl and some other are volount for the red cross . of cours those occup are not take all of the avail spare time of young peopl , there is alway the chanc to do a littl bit more , and there are some who are not contribut at all , but i think that there is no real ground to say that young peopl in gener are not help enough . most of them are do their best to help out .
