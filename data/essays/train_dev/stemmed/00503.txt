some peopl might say that young peopl nowaday have enough time to help the commun around them . but , person , i think young peopl had limit time to take part in the commun activit . where i live , in japan , the young peopl do not spend their time for commun . so , i would like to illustr the situat below . most importantli , young peopl in recent year tend to be more busier than those in previou year . for exampl , the recent young peopl have to studi from the morn to the midnight everi day . they have to go to junior or high school and also have to go to the preparatori school in order to get in a competit univers . moreov , they must take part in the club activ such as basketbal club or judo club after school to strengthen themselv physic and mental . i think there are more time for univers student to help their commun than ani other student in differ age . but after graduat from univers , young businessperson must work from earli in the morn till midnight in japan . they could not afford to have suffici dinner time becaus of the hectic schedul . therefor , they hardli have time to spend for commun activ . in addit , the young peopl tend to get involv with the familiar relationship in their spare time . for instanc , they pleasedli meet with their friend in weekend , howev , they are like to be reluct to particip in the program to help their own commun . there are not so mani mutual relationship between the young peopl such as high school student and the peopl live in the area where the school locat or their own hous locat . addit , the mani young peopl in their 20 now leav their own hometown toward the central citi to live alon and enjoy their life time . they increasingli tend to get involv with peopl in the close and comfort relathionship . it mean that it becom more difficult for the young peopl to get involiv with local commun . consid from the point mention abov , i think that young peopl do not have enough time to spend for commun activ . person , i hope that more young peopl help their commun to build the relationship between the peopl with differ age and in differ situat and adult support the young peopl .
