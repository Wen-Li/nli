eventhougth , some peopl think that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani subject rather than to special in one specif subject ; there are other peopl that think it is more import to have a huge knowledg about one specif topic . base on my own experi , i can said it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , so i agre with the statement . i have been work in a big oil compani sinc 2000 and in these time i could do a lot of thing and i learn a lot of thing of mani subject . in fact i am geophyci and i am go to do a master in busi next year and it is a result that in these six year i did a lot of differ thing in a differ posit in my compani . i think that if i can do a master in busi i will have more skill in order to reach a good posit into my compani becaus i will do the same work that i am use to do , but in addit i will be prepar to face a differ challeng . i am sure that is better have knowledg of differ academ subject becaus thi give us the skill to do a lot of differ work , it is veri import in a world where the technolog are chang veri fast , and where it is difficult to know how the realiti can chang so it is neccesari to be prepar for these chang moreov to have the skill to surviv into a competit world . in conclus i strongli agre with the idea that is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus in thi way we can have a open vision about ani problem and we have more skill in order to surviv in a competit world .
