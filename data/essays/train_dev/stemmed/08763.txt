it wa five o'clock and i wa sleep on my confort bed in my home . suddenli , i woke up cri and scream . i could n't believ it , i had had a bad dream . befor , i realiz that dream had a profound effect on my feel . the dream wa about a trip where i got lost and there wa nobodi next to me . i wa afraid !! . i agre with the statement that say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . the reason whi i agre with that are my person experi of travel alon and the cost first , one of the reason to travel with a group is my person experi . i went to brazil alon and i did n't enjoy it so much . i realiz that i do n't like travel with no peopl . all the trip should be done with peopl who you care alot . moreov , i would like to visit other place like bolivia and chile , both countri from south america . but , i 'd go with my close friend . one who spend with their rel or lover have fun more than one who spend time alon in a foreign countri . futhermor , the cost is anoth reason whi i think that take a guid for your group trip is a good idea . visitor spend more money go by themselv to an unknown place . if you have a guid , he or she is go to tell you where you should go to eat delici nativ meal . also , he or she can tell you the cheaper restaur in the citi or town . in aditt , everytim you travel with a group , the disco and tavern are the favorit place to have fun . there , you can danc and drink all you want with less money . in conclus , the best way to travel is with a tour guid . he or she can show you where to go , where to eat and where to have fun without pay big amount of money . other way to travel is do it with a group . to be in a foreign countri alon is not agood idea becaus someth could happen to you . moreov , be with your bestfriend or mayb with your famili make the trip more excit and unforget .
