i think it depend how you want to travel and where are you go ? . when i go with my famili i prefer to travel without have a tour guid . and also if i want to see some specif place or visit some friend . becaus when you go with a group which are led by a tour guid , you have to do what the guid say , and you have to go where the guid goe . and sometim i prefer to do what i want at the time that i want . usual thi kind of travel [ by a tour guid ] it can be a littl bit bore , even more if you do not understand what doe the guid is say . and also it could be tire . for exampl there is a schedul in thi kind of trip . you have to wake up earli in the morn otherwis the guid and the group will leav and they wo n't wait for you . and then you have to do what it say in the ittinerari . of cours if you want to know differ place , for exampl europ and you go with a group with peopl in your age , i think it could be realli funni and great . becaus at the time you are know new place , know about differ cultur , you are make new friend . and in thi case you do not waist so much time look for the place or ask where to find what you are look for . also in thi kind of trip you know more place in less time . becaus they alreadi know the import place and the rout that we should take . i agre , fortun i did thi way to travel twice and i will do it again if i have the oportun . ani way of travel is good , of cours if it is for fun or cultur .
