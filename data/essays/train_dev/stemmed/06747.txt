when you are a student , there are mani differ way in which you plan your studi or , in the other hand , the way your teacher or professor help you to do it . i believ that when you are a teacher you must have some point clear when teach your student and with that i mean that you must understand that is more importan that student understand idea and concept than learn fact . when a student learn concept , he or she is abl to manag gener idea and adapt what he or she have learn to solv or explain some other situat that will come in hi futur life , when the student learn thing simpli as a fact , that idea can not be adapt or foccus to understand or explain other topic . when the student start a process of learn there are differ form in which they keep the inform they reciev . the first one is understand idea . they need to understand the gener idea of the topic and they must be abl to relat it to common daili thing . understand idea will help the student to work with the princip idea of the topic , it will help him to see the main point and will help the student defin in an accur manner the caracterist of it , that mean , he will be abl to give a concept . when we talk about an specif topic some time is veri difficult for the student to express what they are think , you can have the idea but you can not transmit it to other peopl . if a student learn onli fact , probabl those fact are uniqu , that learn will onli be use in that specif situact , you can not gener , so de student will not be abl to use that knowledg in order to solv ani other problem . what is necessari for the student is to catch the precis inform , that mean , to get the concept clear , to understand the main idea and over all , the student must be abl to transmit that knowledg to other peopl . that is whi is veri import that they understand idea and concept . when a student is capabl of transmit the inform he learn ( idea and concept ) to other peopl we can say that he realli learn what we expect .
