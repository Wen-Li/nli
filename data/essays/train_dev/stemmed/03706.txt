basic , i agre to thi statement . to understand idea and concept is more complic than just learn thing by heart , and thi is also what academ cours tri to teach their student . be abl to present own idea is more worth than just re-produc thing , like you do if you learn hard fact . that 's whi i think that do research or develop or understand idea and concept should reward higher than simpli reproduc thing . scienc could not work without ani ` think ' , and that is what student at a school or especi at an univers are suppos to learn : to get behind the thing . furthermor , most fact are base upon a concept . that is an addit reason whi understand or do scienc is more worth than just learn someth by heart . on the other hand , it is mandatori to have a huge knowledg about simpl fact in certain area . you are not a good scientist if you do not have a huge knowledg of fact , and if you think about a lawyer , it is necessari to have both , the import , and seldom use bill in mind ( and these are a lot if you count them ) . but that doe not make you a good lawyer . you have to combin thi knowledg of simpl fact with concept and idea , and these two thing make you a realli good lawyer . in certain area , it might be enough to have a huge knowledg , and you do n't have to be that great think person . if you think about work in a librari , it seem to be more import to have huge knowledg about the book which are in the archiv instead of be abl to understand complic concept or idea . if your skill have a focu on just one thing , thi will not be a key to success . to combin these two skill , be abl to understand concept and simpli to learn thing by heart , is a good mixtur and can guarante for good result in the job , but also in life gener .
