think that the student of today will be the peopl that will rule the world tomorrow make me agre partial with the statement . infact , what would happend if two leader of two differ countri had to solv a problem concern intern relat . if they onli base their decis on fact that happen in the past , instead of analyz and understand the problem , they would probabl take the wrong decis . nevertheless the same thing would probabl happend if they did not consid or know ani solut to past problem similar to the one they are face now . if a student is capabl of understand idea and concept he will be abl to manag ani situat regard those idea and concept . he will be abl to analyz and studi the problem in depth and , at the end , come out with a `` tailor made '' solut . thi is import becaus if you onli learn fact you treat everi similar situat in the same way , with the same solut , wich will probabl be the wrong one . thi is becaus everi situat is peculiar , it ha million of differ variabl , and , to solv a problem concern that situat you have to know most of them , and that happen onli if you understand the concept that are behind that precis situat . howev , learn fact is import becaus if you do not reli on past experi as a pattern for futur decis it is like to take the wrong decis anyway . what i would like to point out is the fact that both of these approach on how student should studi are necessari becaus they compens each other . if you combin the them you increas drastic the possibl of find a solut to problem concern a topic becaus you understood the concept and idea that are behind it and you can compar a possibl solut with the solut that somebodi els took for a similar problem . in my opinion , a balanc mixtur of both the two method would be the best solut , that is whi i onli partial agre with the statement .
