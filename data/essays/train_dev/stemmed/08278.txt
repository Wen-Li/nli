i think it is veri rel the answer to thi question . rel becaus of the kind of peopl who are travel . in my opinion , i would prefer to travel with a tour guid , who can help me with ani doubt that i would have , and that would be with me alway expla to me the histori of the place i am visit ( thing which i consid veri import ) . but there exist person who prefer to make their trip alon , without ani tour guid to be there to help them in ani problem they could have dure their travel . i have an idea of that peopl as veri independ peopl , who like to take the risk of be almost lost , or mayb they just feel more adventur when dure their time in the trip , they doesnt depend on anyon to make the thing done . person i do not prefer thi way of travel , as i alreadi said , but i would make an except just if the place where i am visit , i alreadi know . i consid that it would be sure complet the tour to the place , if you go in compani of some one whose work is to show the histori to peopl , and to explain how doe thing work in the place . becaus not evri singl detail is on a tourist map , is it ? there are not better instruct for the peopl who are tourist , as the one of the `` nativ '' . there is just one thing in which i agre with the peopl who doe n't take a tourist guid to lead their trip , is that some time it is a lot much better to be alon , and to discov the place mysteri be one 's self . i think that is the onli point with wich i would agre with the travel who doe not take a tour guid . so it is veri rel what would be best for peopl , becaus there are a lot of differ point of view .
