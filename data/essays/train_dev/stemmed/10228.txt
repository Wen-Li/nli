in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . what will happen with the develop of car ? will the amount of drive car in 2030 increas or decreas ? let 's take a short look on the fast develop of car . they were invent in about the 1920 and becam more and more popular for all peopl all over the world within the last centuri . nowaday , it is unbeliev not to have car or a possibl to lend one , if you need one . peopl got use to their drivabl possibl to get from point a to point b whenev they want to and how often they want to . they do n't depend on ani buss , train or even flight . even think of the high tax and fee one ha to pay if he use ani public traffic . besid the fact , a car is one 's chanc to get form a to b , a car enabl you to feel free and independ . if you want to go on vacat , get your car readi and leav your homecountri . but thi , unfortun , is luxuari , especi in time like thi when oil-pric is as high as it ha never been befor . one ha to effort hi or her car . have a car , turn out to be a question of money and the possibl to effort it . it 'll be senseless , to spend all your loan on ga , would n't it ? ! furthermor , the amount of ga that pollut the air everyday , everi minut , exactli everi second , is still rise and doe n't seem to get less in futur . although there are sever techniqu develop and invent , it 'll be a problem and influenc the environ a lot . what will be in about 20 year ? will peopl think about thi fact and problem and turn into anoth develop of enviroment and social think ? will there be a chanc to be fewer car use than they are today ? in my opinion , i do n't believ in thi solut , be fewer car in 2030 than they are now . peopl more and more get selfish , alway want the best and newest version of an invent ( car ) and they probabl will chang a certain way of group , social and enviroment think but they wo n't chang their behavior toward car-us . in my opinion , there are onli two thing that will lead a chang in the amount of car use . first the chang of law by the govern enforc peopl to fullfil certain polici in car use ( such as car share , car-fre day , etc . ) and second if the oil price is still increas !
