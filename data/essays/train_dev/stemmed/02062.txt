in my opinion the statement is partial true . i think the success of a person depend on sever factor , not onli on the capac to to take risk . for exampl a realli lucki man doe n't need to take ani risk for accomplish what he is do . i know a guy who just won the lotteri , he is a clearli `` success man '' , or at least he got more success then me , infact now he is have fun on hi big boat , and i 'm write an assay to pass the toefl test to be accept for an internship in the other part of the world , and i will work for free . thu , accord to the socrat ' theori , the point is to defin the definit of `` success peopl '' , and i think there is n't ani gener definit of `` success peopl '' , i think a success guy is the one who improv the world . accord such definit one who want to belong to the `` success peopl '' group should he have to follow the way he can afford best . if he improv the wrold he belong to the `` success peopl '' group . to acheiv that point he can both employ new thing and take risk or just reus what he alreadi know . the goal explain the way use to acheiv them . all the peopl are differ , so one can acheiv the goal to improv the heart in one way , anotheron can acheiv the goal in a differ way . the import thing is to make the world better . a way could be let me pass the toefl .
