in ani kind of educ , teach , or learn institut , there are mani way in which class ( specif academ ) are impart . mani teacher like their student to understand the idea and concept they are learn , and other teacher like them to learn about the same thing by teach fact about it . accord to both of thi idea of learn , is it better to undersand idea and concept of certain topic ? or is it better to learn the fact about the same topic ? i think that it is veri import to learn fact about ani topic you want to learn about . learn fact is someth that will help you in the futur becaus they are veri use . for exampl , learn the fact about certain roman leader who lost the empir will help you in the futur , if you are a leader of ani kind of institut , to avoid commit the same mistak as he did . anoth import thing about fact is that they can never be chang and that most of them are import to know about in order to understand peopl who are `` expert '' in the career you are appli to . in that way , you would understand what they 're talk about if they mention ani of these fact . final , fact are import becaus they full-fil your gener knowledg on mani aspect ( as they say : knowledg is power ) . in my opinion , understand idea and concept about ani topic is someth veri import in life . understand idea and concept about anyth will help you to appli these same idea and topic in the futur and make thing right , thu becom a practic person . when you understand a concept or an idea , you do n't need to learn anymor about it becaus then you can use it or appli in ani way you want , especi in a job or a career . when you understand a concept , you can even explain it in mani way or in your own word ( it 's better than memor thing ) . if you understand an idea , then you can appli the knowledg you have about it and turn it into someth practic . for exampl , if you studi to be a mechan engin , and you understand the whole concept of car motor , then you can be abl to use thi concept to fix motor , or to explain or teach other about motor in a simpler way than how you learn it , so that they can appli the concept in a practic way . in thi exampl , if you keep do thi or appli your concept on motor , you can even becom the owner of an import car compani or an import workshop . after these explan and show my reason , i think i agre with the statement that say `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . thi probabl sound too rude , buy i realli think it is better to be a practic person than just be a `` smartass '' , and you can achiev thi by understand idea and concept as a student to appli them afterward in real life . and who know , mayb if you do thi , in the futur these idea or concept may help in your career or in ani day life event . thi is whi i complet agre with the statement express befor .
