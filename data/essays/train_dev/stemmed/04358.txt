travel is for me the best way to get to know newpeopl and their cultur . by travel you will know differ place and experi the trip in your own skin is someth that you will never forget . you can read mani book about a particular place but it is onli when you travel that you understand the cultur , architectur , etc. of that place . mani peopl say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid and i total disagre with that statment . i think that the best way to travel is on your own with a map . i have sever reason for hold that opinion . first of all , travel in group with a tour guid doe not give you the freedom to move around that you might want . when you travel by yourself you decid where to go and when . for exampl i remmemb when i travel in a group of fifteen person with a tour guid in pari four year ago . i plan and schedul all my trip with thi group and it guid becaus i did not want to travel alon . it turn out that i had a realli bad experi with them . i wa requir to get up veri earli in the morn becaus the excurs start at sunris . imagin that experi for me that i am not a morn person ! . moreov i did not get along with the peopl in the group . there wa a big age differ that condit all our decis . when i want to go to a pub at night the rest of the group prefer to stay at the hotel play card . i think they did n't realiz they were in pari . secondli , travel in group with guid is far more expens than travel by yourself . you can decid where to eat and how much you want to spend if you travel alon . you know the amount of money that you have and you know how you want to spend it . for exampl , you can decid to pay a boat around the river instead of pay a museum . to sum up i think that travel alon far outweigh the fact of travel in group . i must also say that the inform that a tour guid can give you dure the trip can also be found in mani travel guid and book . so you might want to read a littl bit befor departur .
