i will explain whi i disagre with the statement that in twenti year from now there will be fewer car in use than there are today . to start with as time goe by more car are be produc and sold allov the world . thi trend can be attribut to differ factor , such as the world 's popul growth or the lower cost of vehicl that lead to higher afford for the demand . the popul keep grow as i mention and for thi reason more peopl are will to buy car . also , as also mention abov , low cost of product given by modern technolog and new materi allow more peopl to buy a car . anoth reason that make more peopl will to get a car is given by the improv of the transport system pretti much allov the world . we see big highway and road be built everi day so that more place in the world becom better connect to each other . there are mani countri , such as itali for exampl , where the public transport system is not fulli develop , for thi reason a grow number of peopl prefer to have it own car rather than to reli on a way to travel that is not as effici . a psycholog reason also explain whi more car will be seen in twenti year from now than today ; the societi tend to be veri individualist and less social than it use to be . for thi reason more peopl prefer to be independent when they get around and the car becom their own shell . car can not be replac simpli becaus peopl need them to go to work , to travel , to see place in complet freedom ; sometim peol just want to get the pleasur of drive them and feel a sort of freedom . becaus of all the abov reason i believ more car will be produc and sold in the futur , therefor in twenti year from now we will see more car than today , not fewer .
