some peopl may think that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . other may have neg point of view . in my opinion , i argu that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun nowaday . there are some reason to support my opinion . i will mention them as follow . to begin with , as technolog develop , young peopl do not care about other thing except for the comput . they spend most of their time to surf the internet , play comput game , and chat on line . for exampl , they like to make friend on the internet and use msn messeng to `` talk '' with each other , instead of use the telephon . they are so intrigu in play game onlin that they do not want to spend time get along with their famili . in addit , young peopl are protect well by their parent . henc , they do not need to work hard to earn lot of money . they fool around all day long without be ask to make money for live . whenev they need money , all they have to do is to open their mouth and say `` mom , i want some money . '' consequ , they do not care about do someth mean to their communti . the third reason that i think young peopl do not give time to help is that the environ do not give them the opportun . for instanc , young peopl have a comfort and conveni environ to live . they are carefre and happi all the time , not worri about other thing . there are no difficuti for the young peopl to solv . therefor , they do n't have the idea to help other and even their commun . take into account the reason i list abov , i consent to the statement that young poepl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun .
