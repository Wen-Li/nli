me as mani other student face the decis either to have a gener knowledg about mani accadem field or to specialis in one field onli in order to be consid an expertis . the decis that will come out will reflect the characterist of the person . a person with mani interest will never renounc to the pleasur of know more and more differ thing . on the other hand , peopl with a passion will tend to specialis in a field that will make them happier and happier . a gener educ ha mani posit aspect such as a greater flexibl in chang prefer and vision for the futur . thi kind of prepar give the possibl to the student with no clear idea about the futur to postpon thi import decis and take time to identifi the main desir . furthermor , a gener educ give much more flexibl in adapt to differ job condit . a specif educ focus onli on a subject give the advantag to the student to be an expertis in a field . thi is a great advantag on the job market . in the same time , these student usual are much more rigid , unabl to chang and to handl with chang . these characterist are not alway requir by employ . person , i think that the best choic for a person would be a solut that take into account both it own person and the inner desir , for thi reason i do not think there is onli one best educ . furthermor i think that the accadem educ that must be follow should reflect the requir of the field that the student is studi , we can not compar the specif requir in medicin by the doctor with the gener cultur requir by an teacher .
