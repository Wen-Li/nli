i agre with thi statement . i believ that by understand idea and mostli concept is mainli the foundat to creat new fact . understand idea make a person more focus in the subject to discuss . it bring new thought in mind , and it point the correct direct or way that it intend . also i believ , that it allow the student to elabor on it own and it leav an open field for new idea . on the other hand , understand concept is fundement for the structur of a futur fact . if you , for starter , do not know the concept of thing , you lose complet orient toward thing . in order to solv a problem , is it imper to know the concept of it and what you are realli talk about . for exampl , if a student is ask to elabor an essay on the presid of the unit state , it would be more appropi to the student to understand the polit idea of have a presid , and of cours the concept of it . if the student onli knew for fact who it is and what doe he do , he or she could not have a reason judgement on the matter nor could have a respons decis in futur polit campaign . l support school system that involv creativ think and encourag a student to make decis on their own by understand and creat own idea . if we were forc to learn the simpl fact of everyth , we woul n't be abl to make a true opinion for thing and could n't be abl to give to new gener idea that will help them grow and develop even better than previous . final , i will like to finish my essay with a person thought . not everyth is for fact , there 's mani thing in life that doe n't have an explan for it , but if you understand the idea of it , you might as well live by it .
