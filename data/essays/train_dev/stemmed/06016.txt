i disagre with the statement , in my opinion it is better to be special in one subject field . in today world where the economi is grow at an uncontrol speed , everi industri is no less than a global giant , everi field is becom a money mint arena , in such an environ is will be a gross mistak to have a broad knowledg . special give one an indepth of the subject . it give one the chanc to excel and give one hunder percent to a specif field . it make us clearli see our weak and strenght and help us to evalu ourselv and see where we realli stand . broad knowledg is like a half bake stori where one is not excel in ani specif field . one can pick ani field , art , busi , music or even polit , everyth requir the best peopleand those kind of empoye who know their subject backward . in such a senario one can not take a chanc by have a broad grip on all subject . a situat such as thi would onli creat doubt and ultim a low pay or unemploy . there is anoth altern to thi dillema and that is that alongsid be special in ani one field one can also have a hobbi . for exampl , a film star , she love her news coverag , her fame , her glori , her fortun , but there are time when everyon want to forget their work and find themselv by do thing that they enjoy . she can do social sevic or someth small like potteri or photographi at a hobbi . ` if a bird spread it wing beyond it reach , it will crash ' . thu , accord to me it is more sensibl to choos one line of work and excel in it . but ye sometim we must retriev and pursu other samll activ as well .
