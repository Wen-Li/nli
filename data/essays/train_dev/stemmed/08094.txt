mani peopl believ that young peopl nowaday do n't give enought time to help their commun , other peopl , instead , say that the young peopl are nearest than the old peopl , at the their commun problem . on the one hand , the young peopl have most problem nowaday . in fact , in thi year the world is chang , becaus there so mani crimin and the citi aren-t safeti as twenti year ago . i 'm a young boy , and i can see with my eye the chang of my citi . for the young peopl is not easi to live in thi jungl . .. secondli the young peopl nowaday than twenti year ago , go at school and at univers and the time are so littl . . in fact , i 'm a student and when i come back to the univers i haven-t mani time to dedic for my hobbi . .. or other job . the new young peopl spend most of the daili time at school !! on the other hand , is true the fact that more young peopl , often , when come back home , play at videogam or speack between other boy and girl , with internet . .. instead can use thi time for help their commun . but thi new gener , is the gener of internet and is more difficult to teach the import of the commun . to sum up , the young peopl have few time to dedic at their hobbi , but when they have a free time , their use thi preciou hour for videogam , internet . .. and other hobbi . in my opinion , i 'm a student and i attend at univers of milan , i have veri few time . .. but at the week end , when i return to my hous , i think at my commun . at sunday i organ with my friend , the game for the children of my town , and i 'm happi becaus i see the smile on the face of these children . is in these moment that i can say that i have do someth of good .
