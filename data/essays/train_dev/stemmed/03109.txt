gener peopl beliv that the student should special in one specif subject than to have a broad knowledg of mani subject , becaus they think that a person will not be take all subject in there futur . `` there are particular futur for particular subjaect '' thi mean that though there are mani scope in our futur be we can not afford to take everi thing in our futur . henc that is whi we should concentr in one subject for one particular futur . accord to me , we the children till class eight should take all the subject becaus it veri neccessari to have a gener knowledg of each subject but onc we have reach to class nine then it is time to think about our futur so it will be good if we concentr in just one particular subject . henc from my point of view it is better to special in one specif subject . will specialis in one particular subject help ? ye veri much becaus then it mean that we are focuss in our future. , let say for exampl if a person dream is to studi intern relat then he/sh ha to specialis in polit scienc , but if he/sh is take other subject to then that might distract their concentr in one subject that is veri import for the person . that is whi i think that we be children should concentr in just one subject that is veri import to us and will make a lot of differ in our life . lastli i would like to conclud by say that `` precaut are better than cure '' so it is better that we take just one subject and concentr in it to make our futur better . but it everi one point of view that matter and i beliv in listn to what our heart say and move accordingli . thank you .
