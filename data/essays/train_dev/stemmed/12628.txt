when think about the next two decad one could imagin a lot of new invent and innov that facili our live or even chang it drastic . the prospect in technolog develop are promis and therefor i believ that there will be fewer car in use than they are today . in my opinion , the main mean of privat transport twenti year from now is still go to be the car . i do not believ that there will be an invent which is abl to replac the car . in the last coupl of decad the car ha assum an import role in every-day life . it is too much includ in our life routin as to lose signific in as littl time as twenti year . howev , the machin that will be call `` car '' at that time will be veri differ from the car we know today . technolog develop will have to face the problem of rapidli declin natur ressourc veri soon . as car use up the fuel given to us by natur , the develop need to find altern energi sourc that are abl to replac ga . method like use electr or solar energi which have alreadi been invent have to be made more practic in order to convinc peopl of the advantag of chang to new technolog . the lack of indefinit natur ressourc combin with a slow develop of new technolog will decreas the number of car in use . peopl will have to find other mean of transport in order to get around . bu transport will be increas and peopl might stick to thi kind of transport in order to save money and time as they do not have to wait in traffic jam when go to the offic in the morn .
