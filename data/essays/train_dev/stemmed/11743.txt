i disagre with the statement , becaus for me is ever necessari to take some risk and tri new thing to have succ and not onli when you know how to do well . in fact for me , if you dont't tri one thing , you do n't tri anoth thing becaus you do n't have the experi that the preced thing can give to you . for exampl , if you do n't tri to use a bycicl , you do n't learn to go whit it , and after you do n't learn to use a scooter , becau is more difficult than use a bycicl . but if you learn to go whit a bycicl , after you can use also the scooter ; so you can use both of them . the experi that you tri to do , help you for enthir your life . thi is the main reason becaus i say that is import to take risk and tri new thing and new adventur . and for me also the worst experi are import becaus also thi experi help you not to commit the same error anoth time . in fact , for exampl , if you drik mich alchool befor drive , and after you make ani incid , you learn that you do n't drink ani alchool befor you drive for the next time . so , in the end , to take succ , for me is import find to tri the higest number of thing you can do
