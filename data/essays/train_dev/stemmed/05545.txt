thi statement seem like a biblic rivel , but can be true if we consider onli our europ . if i see the past , realli , i see that in the last thirti year we have had at first a rapid , after more costant , growth of the number of car in gener . realli , the growth of car can be interpret by the develop of our europen societi . of cours , thi growth ha token with it other problem , like the pollut , or the growth of the price of oil . so , in europen and american citi , i think that there will be a slow declin of the use of car , caus by new law against car - use and it pollut , or by the encreas of price of the fuel , or by the oblish ( i hope !!! ) of the use of pubblic trasport in the centr of our citi . for thi reason , in europ , i think that the statement will be true . altough , if we see the world , it is sure that the total number of car will grow : some nation , like china , or india , or brazil , are becom modern nation , and peopl of these area , will want to have a car like us . in fact , a good part of thi peopl , that is migrat to the citi , will have a better input of money and will be abl to take a car . so , thi fact will caus new pollut for these countri , and until the govern will not make new law , it will have a growth . so , in conclus , with a global vision . i am disagre with the statement , and i think that the situat can onli becom more neg . we must catch a solut not for car , but for pollut , and with the reserch to creat a car with hydrogen like fuel , we will live better with more car .
