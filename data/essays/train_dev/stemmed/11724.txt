mani peopl think , young peopl have enjoy live and they think old peopl do not enjoy life as much as young peopl do . i agre with peopl who think like that . i have sever valid reason which support my idea . first of all , yaung peopl enjoy life more becaus , thay are full of energi and that caus them to do anyth in ani time . for instanc , if a young person decid to do someth hard , that person achiev that aim veri easyli , but an old person can not doe that thing easyli and it caus dissapoint and that disapoint make old person unhappi . for me an unhappi life is equal to an unenjoy life . secondli , young peopl have lot of time and becaus of that , they do not have to be in a hurri to do someth , but old peopl think they have sever year to live so , they tri to do lot of thing at the same time and that make their live unenjoy . young peopl are look forward to futur but old peopl do not . old peopl heve disapoint about their past experi but young peopl do not becaus they have lot of time to fix those disapint . the last but not least , old peopl have health problem due to , their age . becaus of that , they need to stay at hospit or need privat support and i think that make them to live their live unenjoy . young peopl do not have to spend their time at hospit due to , health problem . they can spend their time more enjoy with do differ thing such as , travel pley pc or date with their friend . all in all as i mention befor young peopl live their live more enjoy rather than old peopl do . becaus , old peopl have health problem and they are not energet and thay are not strong enough to do entertain thing . the long and the short of it is that , old peopl are not abl to do thing that they want to do and that make their live unenjoy .
