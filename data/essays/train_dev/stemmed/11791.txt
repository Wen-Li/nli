in my person experi , i 've notic that have a better knowledg of one specif subject is better than have a broad knowledg of a number of academ subject . at the univers i attend differ cours refer to three main area : histori , law and econom . after my graduat i can say that i had a good knowledg of a seri of academ subject , but i realiz that thi wa not so good for those who are search a job , in particular the first job experi . in fact , like all my friend did after graduat , i began to search for a job . in tri to find someth adequ to my generalist prepar , i 've understood that it is difficult for peopl who do n't have a special to find a job , in particular a qualifi job . talk with some friend come from econom studi , they all told me that the labour market ha notabl chang in recent year . these chang took place sinc a strict divis of work had becom a necess for compani and factori , for exampl . consequ , it could be notic that who offer a job is gener look for qualifi candid , for peopl who have a high knowledg of a particular topic or , in better word , who is special in a specif subject . i have found that thi is true , becaus all my friend who obtain a phd or attend technic faculti have found a job in just a few month , while other with a more generalist knowledg or univers degre are still search for a job . in conclus i agre with those who prefer to special in a specif subject , becaus i think that in do so , they could have more chanc to find a job .
