traffic in big citi continu to increas day by day and the ammount of car on the street are constantli rise . some peopl think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i agre with statement becaus of the rapid improv in technolog and becaus of the decreas in petrol resourc throughout the whole world . traffic is a major problem in metropolitan . for exampl in my citi there ha been an incred increas in the amount of traffic in the last year . road are nearli everywher cover nearli one third of the citi landscap . there is nearli nowher left where peopl can sit and enjoy the fresh weather , wherev peopl go in the citi they smell the disturb smell of petrol and chemic gase caus by car . i think in the come year govern will consid thi as a great problem and they will start find solut to thi car problem . in my opinion technolog will be their biggest aid in decreas the amount of traffic in our citi . the increas in petrol and ga resourc in earth is undeni . mani scientist fear that in the come year . there will be absolut no resourc left to use for car or other transport . we are live in a world that is constantli use these kind of resourc without do anyth the reproduc them . imagin the world as a huge water wel . we are constantli take littl gulp from it not and think what will happen when the water is finish . as an addit the more we use these resourc , the more expens they get . thi is whi i think that human will be forc to creat new way of transport . like transport that use sunlight or hydrogen for exampl instead of petrol . thi way car will no longer be apart of our live and we will start use differ kind of vehicl that have differnet name . as a result i think the amount of car in the come year will increas becaus of the size of te problem state abov and human will start use altern vehicl that wont caus the same problem and that will make life easier .
