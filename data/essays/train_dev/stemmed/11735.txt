i think that a person who want to be someon ha alway to make import decis and take risk do chois . he ha to start from what he know , but he ha to tri someth new to be satisfi and to achiev a great success : thi is what make the differ bettween normal peopl e succes peopl . in the past much peopl had taken risk and thank to them now we can turn of the light , write on our comput , take a plane or drive a car : if the world look onli at the past and peopl live without tri to discov someth new , the futur will never come . a person 's success dipend on the abil of look at the futur and understand what the futur hide ; if there 's no one who want to do somenth new and everybodi continu to do what we alreadi know , there will be no success and no innov and the world will never chang . even if i agre with the statment , i think also that the present is import too and is unuseful tri to do someth new without know how to do well what we just know . i think also that is import take risk to achiev success without damag anyon : so it 's import that everyon trye and take risk use coscienc .
