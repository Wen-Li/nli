i disagre with the statement , in order for a student to learn someth and benefit from it in the futur he need to learn fact becaus fact are base on thing happen in realiti so when a student get to learn from a fact he will be abl to face each neg point of the subject . first , learn fact especi from histori and literatur men like shakespear , roald john , etc. will help the student to learn and be foretast about the subject than just give him what shakespear wrote and request him to memor . understand idea and concept make the student to hate the subject becaus he feel that he must understand and memor so for him it a long process while learn fact is more help becaus it a studi of realiti that happen onc in life to simulatan peopl . second , as import absolut it is more import to learn fact becaus student have to know and feel about other who suffer previous befor them and how were they abl to reach their goal . thi way of learn will encourag student to know about these fact and also be abl to learn them to their friend and other peopl . furthermor , some peopl may disagre the idea of learn fact and prefer understand concept while they dont think how will the student be abl to understand all idea becaus most idea are unreal and mani student hate to learn fake thing such as scienc fiction , terror stori and so on . third , anoth popular reason is that most of our educ place follow the rule of understand than learn fact , i dont think student are more realiabl to thi processs mayb if they tri to learn process the educatin zone would find a good reaction from the student . in conclus , i advic all student so tha they enjoy educ themselv to learn fact , ani given fact that would feed them in the futur for them as individu and to other as acknowledg student .
