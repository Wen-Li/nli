i agre with the fact that it is import for student to understand the idea and concept than to learn fact . idea and concept are two essenti factor for learn . idea are the way by which one would learn about someth by hi past knowledg , by hi past experi or by your imagin . concept are the one that provid you the with the fundament of learn thing . take an exampl of car and an aircraft . both are differ object for tranport . the idea behind develop them wa to develop differ mean of tranport fulfil the differ need of human . the basic concept involv in develop them are the differ law of motion , pure scienc . the fact is that a car is use for transport on land wherea an aircraft is use as mean of tranport in air . it is import for a student to understand the idea and concept rather than learn the fact first . the fact can be learnt onc you are profici with the idea and concept . if they onli know the fact and not the concept , their learn would be limit . if they continu to learn thing thi way ( by know fact ) , they would not be abl to appli knowledg of their learn . emphas further , it would be import for the student to learn the idea and concept first which when combin would give rise to fact . thu a student if learnt the basic idea and concept of law of motion could automat understand the fact involv with that . idea and concept , fact are differ way of learn thing . but idea and concept are the foundat pillar of your knowledg . your build ( knowledg ) strength lie in your foundat and not on our asthet view ( in thi case the fact learn ) which just give a shallow knowledg about the strength of your build founadt .
