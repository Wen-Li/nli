whether understand idea and concpet is more import than lear fact is a good point to discuss as there mani talk go around regard chang the studi pattern in mani univers . i believ that it is veri inport for student to understand idea and concept becaus the main aim of educ is to gain knowledg . the student goe to school/univers in pursuit of knowledg which is base on concept and idea . the fact can not be understood or relat unless the concept behind the fact is known . for exampl , one can enjoy beauti of ranibow , but can not understand how it is form unless he/sh know the law of dispers . secondli , understand idea and concept will help student to focu on the studi . the fact can draw student 's attent in mani direct that will not help him gain enough knowledg and depth about the subject . the understand of idea and concept will help improv think abil of a student in right direct . it can help student concetr more on ani subject . the idea and concpet are usual scietif proven thing which make them are trustworthi . with onli fact , the student can onli guess about the reason behind the fact . no one can answer the reason behind appl fall down from tree without explain law of graviti . the next reason for me to support thi point is that understand idea and knowledg can make student organ his/her studi in time manner with proper focu . thi would help a student to gain suffici knowledg about varieti of subject in a given academ year . if the student concentr onli on fact , he/sh will not be abl to pay attent to all the subject taught in the curriculum . thi will narrow the futur scope for the student . lastli , i feel that understand idea and concept can help student to come up with new reasearch on certain thing happen around us . the student can form baselin with the help of idea and concept alreadi known and can explor the unknown thing . thruogh their research . thi can result in mani further develop in our life such as new medicin that are more effect , technolog to help improv our day to dat activ , etc . . with all the point , i strongli feel that it is more import for stduent to understand idea and concept than to leearn fact so as to gaim more knowledg about varieti of subject wihtin give academ time which can help them to broaden their futur scope and carrier .
