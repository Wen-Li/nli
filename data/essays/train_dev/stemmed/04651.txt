i disagre with thi statement becaus i do n't think that the broad knowledg of mani academ subject is more import than to special in one specif subject . in mani kind of career , there are mani career which need the special skill in the process . there are sever reason . first , in execut the work , if we have more special knowledg in the work process we can do the work more exactli and fastli than the peopl who ha not special knowledg . for exampl , a friend of mine ha special knowledg in busi market field more than other so now he ha a splendid job in a famou big compani and he is execut the work excel and mani co-work are respect him and hi work skill . second , in some case , the peopl who ha not special knowledg may not execut the work at all . for exampl , my major is architectur , exactli interior design . in architectur field , if the planner or design ha not special skill or knowledg about structur and resist for mani thing ( water , wind , heat ) , he can not design the tall build , airport , school even if small hous . for abov statement , in thi world , there are mani kind of work which need the special skill not onli architectur field . so we have to learn about mani knowledg in the specif subject to work for the specif field . final , have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is just onli memoris the britanik dictionari . with these mani knowledg we can onli use the knowledg at small and paltri question and we can not use the knowledg at special work field . if we want to have a good job for me make much money and feel happi with our job , we have to have the special knowledg in our specif subject or field .
