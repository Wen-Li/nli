i disagre thi statement , but i think that thi idea is not total incorrect . in twenti year the thing chang and i dont't know how we will travel with . the today car are a veri import problem becaus the car creat a lot of air pollut . the car are the most pollut produc on the earth . in thi case i think that peopl in futur want to chang theyr abitud and so travel with a differ transport ( train for exampl ) . but i think that in twenti year car chang too . i see a not pollut car use a clean energi and the problem of pollut will be stop . my preoccup is about the number of peopl that in twenti year can becam too much for travel with car . what that i think is that in the futur can persist onli the taxi and the bu becaus the space will be full in the street . peopl will travel most with airplan becaus the journey will be longer than at present . my wish is that we find a solut for the air pollut and not onli obviusli , and i dream a modern wonder car go with a particular new energi discov from a new particular planet . i think it wa possibl . the solut if the peopl want is behind the corner . i have studi for becam a design and i want to se car forev and in my roul i want to understand what is possibl to do for resolv the car pollut problem . the problem of air pollut in twenti year becam a veri veri seriou problem . there are now a new solut with new engin wich go with gpl or new oil
