i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are sever reason to prove thi opinion . first , student understand and learn easili about the subject if they know what idea and concept are . for exampl , in math class , they are learn about the multipl formula . at the basic level , they onli memor the formula . four time four equal to sixteen . thi is not difficult , but in problem solv quetion , they need to think about the quetion what formula they are go to use . at thi point , they need the skill deriv from the main concept and idea about the multipli system . second , if they just learn the fact , they onli need to memor the fact that happen in a specif time rang . they can not appli the fact into real life . in real life , peopl confront mani unexpect moment . they should be wise to solv problem when they are in difficult situat . howev , if peopl onli learn the fact , how can they solv other problem that they have never experienc ? therefor , peopl need to appli idea and concept that they have learn to the problem in real life . third , everi subject is interact each other . for exampl , math and scienc are relat subject and social and histori are relat subject . peopl would not know how they are relat and studi well both subject if they do n't know the concept and idea of each subject . everyth that surround peopl in their live are relat and interact each other . peopl studi subject that are relat our surround . if they onli know the fact , they can not be improv and go ahead becaus they have onli limit knowledg and skill . to think broad and fix the problem , peopl have to know the real idea they have to achiev and the main concept of the subject .
