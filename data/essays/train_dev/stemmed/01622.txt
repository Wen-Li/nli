nowday , book contain a lot of inform which we know or we might not know and it is a veri good tool for us to improv our knowledg by understand the idea or concept from book , so most peopl think that understand idear or concept are more import than learn fact ; howev , i total disagre with that due to the sourc of book and knowledg which is outsid of the book . obvious , the reason for understand idea from book is import is that book contain a lot of inform which are believ and reliabl , but have you think about how doe those book come from ? . usual the all the knowledg is from the outsid of the book and book is just a collect for those idea or concept which were found by practic . take the exampl of the shape of earth , long time ago , peopl learn that the shape of earth is squar from the book and they understood thi inform without doubt . howev , the true is not the same as the concept that earth is squar but round . thu , could you say that understand the concept is more signific than learn fact ? of cours not , peopl usual take mani practic in order to indic the concept and learn from the fact is more memero and more trustabl . moreov , there are abund of knowledg which are outsid of the concept . to be more precis , our knowledg is chang everi miumit everi secand , so if you just understand the concept , that is not enough . in addit , if you learn fact , you will not onli know the concept which is from the real life but also it will be unforget for you . in particular , when i learn tabl tenni by myself , i alway take mani practic in order to reach the correct positur or action . after my practic , i realiz how can i do it right and how can i chang some movement in order to confus my partner and win the game . briefli , the idea are from the real life and if you just understand the concept without experi , you will be useless . in conclus , understand the idea or concept is veri import and veri use for our futur , yet if you ignor the valu of learn from the fact , you can not be successful in the futur . after all , all the concept are from the real life and they are chang by the experi of fact as time pass .
