i agre with that statement becaus of these reason . at first , understand idea is realli signific for student when they learn new studi , for exampl , when i wa a high school student , i start lear physic . i t wa dificult for me to learn fact and formula withought understand idea . i could remenb fact , but i did not understand and put into long term memori . howev , when i wa taught the idea of physic by my friend , i could understand . i knew fact , so it wa easi to accompani that idea and fact . if i learn idea and concept first , i would rememb import formula and fact for a long time . thu , understand concept is more import for student . in addit . understand idea and concept is help to student . when i took ` american govern ' class , the instructor explain meaning concept of thi class befor tell fact . he introduc huge imag of thi cors , and he suggest idea of each term for thi class . i am an intern student , and i wa not use to american govern , becaus hi introduct wa realli help for me . if he introduc just fact or fact , i would not get import of thi class and be interest in american govern . therefor student can take advantag by understand idea and concept . although learn fact is also meaning , it doe not help student . when student want to know someth , learn fact is use becaus they do not have to spend much time . howev , if they understand someth , it doe not function . understand idea and concept doe not mean onli obtain idea , but also lear fact . in my opinion , understand and lear are accompani with each other . when student gain somet , they should understand that , and then they can learn fact deepli . thu , i agre thi statement .
