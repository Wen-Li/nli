from my point fo view , answer that question requir a previou one - what doe the word ` commun ' involv to you ? . as far as i am concern , that word is not affect by a lot of factor , by a number of mean . .. ani person will probabl tell you that those who develop their normal life around you are your commun . be religion the main - or most common - reason for that union , most of the time . as i see it , to find the honest , deep , vivid mean of ` commun ' you have to look much further . i would name as my ` commun ' those peopl who affect my life in differ aspect , who have the power to chang my path one way or the other . those peopl with whom i live and learn everyday . my commun and me are abl to play a larger and more import part in one anoth 's life . i do not agre with the idea of young peopl not use their time to help their commun . actual i believ that most of them do it everyday , by take an activ part in their own life and in the one of those who live with them . to exemplifi my point i will add some case consid by me as some relev way to help . a boy who spend hi time explan to a classmat a problem that will help him pass an import exam . a law student who ha to work everyday as hard as possibl and studi , she doe not have time for herself , howev , she teach her niec english for free each weekend to help her pass , becaus that girl know her brother can not afford extra english class . in a nutshel , if those who agre with that statement consid young peopl to be selfish , i think they are complet wrong . what is more , they should take a moment to look around and to ask young peopl what are they do , i am sure that they will prove them all wrong .
