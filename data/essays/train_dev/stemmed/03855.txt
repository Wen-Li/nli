ye , person i agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . that mainli becaus we all know how to do a some stuff well . we are all special in someth or anoth , it may be uniqu , but the fact that all of us are good at one thing is realli - not uniqu . henc , if everyon doe what they are good at it , they will be reason success , but more veri success or famou . peopl who like to tri new stuff , who like to innov or who tri to take risk , are the one who are dare enough to know that their idea and plan might fail , but if they happen to go right - noth stand between them and success . here , i would like to state the exampl of the wright brother - the one who are the mastermind behind us fli from ani destin of the world to anoth such destin . train were common that day , travel by ship and car were also few of the more common and conventi tradit meen of transport . howev , the wright brother had an idea , which wa outlandish at that point , but if it click , they would have success at their feet , and the entir world would know them for that . and that precis what they did . they put that idea into practis . did their bit , and came out with a devic that travel in air , and take u place in such short distanc that were onli dreamt of in that gener . that whi peopl who take risk , who have the courag to think out of the box and are will to tri their idea becaus they have confid in them . by do so , they take a chanc of it fail or succeed . fail , and the critic simpli say `` we told you so .. '' , succeed , and everyon is astonish , and hail you - quit rightli so . peopl onli take risk becaus they have faith in their idea and concept . peopl who have faith in their idea and concept are gener veri intellig and smart peopl , innov peopl . henc they go ahead , take the risk , and bask in the glori if and when their idea prevail and the entir world ( as in thi case ) reap the benefit of their courag , idea and mainli - execut . therefor , i would like to conclud that ye , everyon can have a rel amount of success , but the one who stand out for their success stori are the one who take risk and tri thing which other do not dare dream off .
