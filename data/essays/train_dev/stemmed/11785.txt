first of all i would like to agre strongli with the statment , becaus i am work as a lectut at the faculti of educ , and as you see thi statment match my work close , and due to my practic experinc with the student i conclud that the human brain is compos of two main part , one is respons for the logic , and the other for the memori , and i also found that it is better to the student to learn how to think rather than how to remeb , in anoth mean it is better to the student to understand idea and concept rather than to learn solid fact as it is for the followig reason : 1 - if we use to drive a solid fact to the student and make them remeb it dure the exam , we make the do not use the logic part in thier brain as i mention befor , and that is lead to make them lazi to reach to ani knoweledg alon without the help of the teacher . 2 - also the student who learn solid fact have n't the abil to solv ani problrem out side the fact he learn , and that action kill the creativ insid them . 3 - but on the other hand , if we train the student to think and to understand idea and concept , we can improv the creation of thse student and make them reach to the mean of the fact by themselv . 4 - understand idea and concept also help in the enhanc the two way commun between the student and rge teacher , becaaus , as you now , there is a common role say that ( to understand you must to ask ) , and as aresult when you ask your two way commun skill improv . finali i would like to mention that use the system of ynderstand idea and concept will emerg a creativ student , which after graduat they expect to be a good teacher have the abil to commun good with their studen , and and also they expect to be a brightful person in their commun .
