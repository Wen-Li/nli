nowaday there are lot of select or attract for young peopl to spend their leisur time . i agre with thi resolus that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . my primari reason is that they are indiffer from their commun . especi where i live , in tokyo japan , young peopl are not interest in their enviro . we do not know even our neighbor . it is total differ from the old era in which peopl use to help each other . in thi era , we have the system , what is call , goningumi . it consist of 5 neighbor . thi 5 menber must help each other . for exampl , at funer the neibor have to be receptionist and make dish for comer . thi way of think to compens each other still remain in my hometown , but it is definet decreas . the commun among peopl is get lower and lower obvious . it might be becaus of the invent of internet . we do not need to commun neighbor activ . we can buy or enjoy thorough the internet even in case of emerg . the core famili is also the evid for their indeffr . they like small group . anoth reason is that the system of societi can not allow them to help their commun . i mean that young peopl have to aquir the up-dat skill to catch up with the improv of the comput . the content and how to use new softwar is develop day by day . then they tend to consentr on studi at home , and consuqu they do not have enough time to help their commun even if they are will to . for these reason , i agre that young peopl nowaday don not give enough time to help their commun . thi might be becaus of us . we had better encourag them to devot our commun more .
