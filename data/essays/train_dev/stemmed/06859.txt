the import of understand concept learn fact is an import part in an educ system , but what count most is understand the concept and idea . first , if a student get to understand how a certain system work , he would be abl to understand the effect it ha and be abl to assimil the informatioon faster . if he memor it as a fact without understand the concept , he is probabl go to forget it the next day . i take myself as an exampl , i am a pharamaci student , and in my field there are lot of fact , as exampl , a drug lead to a certain effec , but understand the mecan by which thi drug work in the bodi and whi it lead to thi specif effect make it easier for me to learn it and later use it . anoth point in favor of understand concept is that by do so , the student will be abl to develop hi logic and analyt think which wil allow him later to applic what he learn in anoth field or problem . for instanc , understand whi the earth gravit around the sun is more import than the fact itself , becaus understand thi concept enabl the student to appli it to the whole astronomi field includ the understand of eclips and season chang . final , when learn fact , student tend to accumul inform and stick to them , wherea tri to understand an idea lead them to do their own research on the subject , to have their own judgment and approach . they tend to broaden their mind and increas their curios . i think that learn fact is import depend on the field of studi becaus there are thing that ca n't be explain or are beyond student understand , but what is the most import is to understand the concept whenev it 's possibl becaus by do so , a student manag to develop hi way of think and to appli the concept to anoth field .
