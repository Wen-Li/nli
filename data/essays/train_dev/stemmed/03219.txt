i do not agre with thi statement becaus i think that it is more use to know onli a few subject deepli than mani in a superfici way . i think that everyon , especi student who go to the univers , should have a gener cultur knowledg but thi is someth that goe beyond the accadem role . in my opinion it doe not make ani sens to attend a class about a cours you are not interest in or that doe not have anyth to do with what you realli want to studi for your futur job . unfortun , i person experienc someth similar dure the past three year becaus when i start univers i did not know what i wa go to studi precis and as i want to graduat in languag and litteratur i thought , as most of the other peopl in my class , that i wa not go to studi anyth els except from econom in which i want to specialis . could you immagin my delus when i found out i had to studi mani useless subject ? whi did i have to studi thing like philosophi or histori when i knew i wa not go to use it in my futur ? in my opinion the decis of student to go to univers is someth veri individu and it ha to be respect , from the governa as the educ institut . i believ that it is up to the secondari school the respons of teach the gener subject and when a student goe to the univers thi must be taken for grant . final if you realli want to be strong in your futur job and you realli want to do it in the best way you can , you have to focu on it and learn as much as you can about the subject relat to it . whi should a futur manag want to know someth about
