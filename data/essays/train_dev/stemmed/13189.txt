new york citi , 2026 . for a time-travel from today , the citi is hardli recogniz , for one main reason : car have almost disappear . where are all the yellow cab , the traffic jam and the continu flow of car ? instead , there are electr buse , and a few fuel cell car , that onli the richest can afford . is thi assumpt realist ? in other word , will there be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today ? in order to answ thi question , i will evalu the differ factor that play a role in thi issu . as we all know , oil and natur ga resourc are doom to be over by 50 or 60 year . in the meantim , their price will continu rise as it alreadi doe . thi lead to assum that car are go to becom a luxuri that fewer peopl will afford , and henc that the number of car will decreas . furthermor , global warm is now be face as a real issu for our planet , and fuel consumpt by car larg contribut to it . some govern are alreadi rais tax on ga , in order to make peopl reduc their use of car . they also encourag public transport : 30 peopl in a bu repres a much smaller impact on environ than 30 peopl in their own car . howev , oil price rise and global warm are also face with a more innov approach . technolog are be develop which will allow car to be cleaner for the environ . hybrid engin , cell fuel , electr engin , are probabl what the futur of car is made of . as soon as the price of these technolog becom effect and competit compar to oil , we may expect a rise in the use of such car . the remain question are mainli when thi shift will happen , and whether the price of a car will be afford . i think we may first expect an overal slow decreas of the number of car in the next thirti year , follow by a rebound . mayb by that time our behaviour will have chang , public transport will have spread wide , and the rebound will not occur so much . but own a car is - and will alway be - a pride and a featur of independ , which lead me to assum that car have a bright futur .
