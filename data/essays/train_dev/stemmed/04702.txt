the statement given is that the young peopl in the modern societi are not show interest in help the commun . ye i agre with the statement mention due to mani reason . one of the reason is that the student now-a-day are show lot of interest in the enjoy itself . they spend most of the time with their freind and goe to pub or some other place and spend time . now-a-day the cultur is like thi and even their parent are not show interest in guid the children . the young student prefer to spend most of their time in play game . thi is a great enjoy for them . the other reason is that the peopl now-a-day becam veri competit and the onli aim for them is to reach the higher posit and earn more money . so , in order to achiev thi they are work more and more hour and they are not at all look to help the social organis . for exampl , i can consid my freind as he got wa recruit in social commun offic . here servic should be done to old peopl and the children who lost their parent but the pay will be littl less . he done the job for two month without willing and gave up ultim . he do n't have interest in sevic and he need more money . i think thi is a good exampl for the abov explan . one more reason is that the mindset of the young peopl will be somewhat selfish and alway compar with the neighbour peopl . what those peopl did , they want to do the sameth and seek higher posit . they wont bother about the societi and the peopl who need some help from them .
