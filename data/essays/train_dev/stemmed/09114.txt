i do agre with the statement that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . today gener is caught up with a lot of other issu which they feel are import and necessari for them to surviv in thi world and also to be happi in the futur . these thing includ get good educ which take up a lot of their time and energi , then they feel the need to earn a lot of money so that they can afford whatev they want in the futur and last but not the least to spend the extra or free time enjoy life by attend parti and watch movi . present gener ha the urg to studi more and more so that they can match up to the expect of the chage world . frankli speak it is not their fault either . everi one requir a certain degre of educ to support themselv and to be abl to interact and commun with the peopl of other countri . thi is so becaus most of the word carri out by our countri is in collabor with the develop countri like the u.s.a. and therefor to match up to their educ requir it is import to be well educ . to gain such qualiti of educ one need to devot full time and energi and so doe not get the oppurtuinti to help their commun . addit to the educ qualif a person need to have a good job in order to support hi famili . in the era of increas price and low pay structur an individu need to work like a pig , as most of them put it , and then alon be abl to match to hi live standard . if someon doe not do the requir amount of work expect from him then he is not given a chanc of promot which inturn decreas the avail of resourc with him to live peac and happili . thi is anoth reason whi today gener is not abl to give enough time to their commun . final , i think that as the world chang , the prioriti of the peopl live in that gener chang . earlier peopl use to util their free and extra time in help old peopl or do some amount of social severvic . everi one had a feel of respons towatrd the nation and it citizen . but today if someon ha free time they would want to rather go for a movi or parti and enjoy themselv , instead of even think of the weaker and underpriviledg section of the sociti . in conclus , i would like to say that everyon in today 's world ha becom selfish and therefo want to think of themselv befor other . today 's gener ha forgot what is `` servic befor self '' .
