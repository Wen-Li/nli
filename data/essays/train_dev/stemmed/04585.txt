the follow argument is about if it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . today everyon dream about to have a veri broad knowledg and want to know everyth , but is it alway help ? i think it is veri import to learn or to know a lot of differ thing , which give you a basic knowledg about how the world work . i think that the peopl have to know that for exampl in histori the import fact like when the first world war wa and who stalin wa and where the industrilis start and so on . but in addit peopl should know about mathemat , geographi , their own languag , too . i think peopl should be abl to handl with mathemat problem and should know the grammar of their languag . but it is no use to know from everi singl subject just a littl piec . it is better to special yourself when you want to work , becaus work alway need a specif subject . for instanc when you want to be a professeur for histori , you have more to know than onli the question about who wa stalin . than it is import to know that he wa a dictat of the ancient russia and that he want to make a communist area out of the world after marxism . if you want to practis a specif work , the result is that you have to special you , becaus you have to know all background in order to do your best in your work . but i think , if you want to commun with other peopl it is verz embarras if you do not know about some usual fact , which are a basic knowledg for everyth you do . imagin that a stranger come to for exampl germani an ask you how mani region germani have after it reunif and you could not answer him . that would be veri poor . i think everon ha to know that germani ha 16 region . that is a fact . so , all in all i would say first one should know about the basic fact of mani academ subject and than he or she should special him or her in one specif subject in order to work later . i would do it like thi .
