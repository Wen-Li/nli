i disagre with thi statement . in my opinion , it is more import for student to learn fact than it is for them to understand idea and concept . peopl in these day seem to pay a lot attent to idea , but the fact is , thi made a lot of useless ` invent ' . for thi , i saw a new ` invent ' the other day . it wa a littl fan that could be tie on the arm , which could be use for cool off the hot noodl while peopl are pick up the noodl . the fan is not tini , but even if it is , is there realli a lot of consum for thi kind of product ? i do not think so . if i were the custom , i wo n't even bring a fan to a restruant just for cool off the noodl . thi is one exampl for peopl onli get the idea but not the fact . as a matter of fact , mani of the concept and idea are theori , which just came from hypethosi . if everi student do not pay attent to the fact that are in daili life , how will they abl to find out or even to do lab without a habit which is call `` to discov themselv '' ? idea and concept seem to be veri import , but if they are just there without fact , i do not think there will be anybodi to be abl to understand them . it is the twenty-first centri , societi and technolog are updat everyday , if peopl onli get the idea and concept on the text book instead of get the fact , they will not be abl to fit in thi societi veri well , due to their lack of method that will work the best and creativ . and those method and creativ are mostli came from the fact that they have ` store ' day by day . ` student ' now are the ` peopl ' in the futur . that is whi i think it is a lot more import for student to learn fact than it is for them to onli understand idea and concept .
