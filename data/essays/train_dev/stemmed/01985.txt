there are mani way for young peopl to help their commun . i person disagre with the say that young peopl now are not give enough time to help their commun . as a univers student , friend around me ha join some chariti project and i myself also go to the children near my neighnor everyweek to take care of the children . first of all , there more and more club or student societi establish in school to help the depriv peopl . for exampl , my professor told me that there were onli one chariti societi form by student ten year ago , when she studi in our universuti . howev , there are more then eight student societi which help peopl who need help . second , more and more peopl are associ with help the commun . while there are more and more chariti societi establih , that mean there are more and more peopl involv in thi kind of activ . accord to my own experi , thi is true . dure my freshman year in univers , there were onli three peopl in my class join the group which do chariti . but in my junior year in the univers , there are more than ten of my classmat devot themselv into commun servic . last but not least , thi summer when a work as an intern in citi bank , they have a poject call `` read for the futur '' . thi profect is to gather univers student to let them read stori for the children in the less develop area . citi bank count the amount of time they read for the children , that wa more than a thousand hour in three month by onli a hundr student . as a societi develop , there might be more and more problem appear . on the other hand , there are also more and more hot-blood young peopl are well to spend more of their time devot themselv into help the societi .
