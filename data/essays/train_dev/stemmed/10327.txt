there are certain area that differ from each other accord to how a student studi in those area should respond to the need of the area he or she studi in . . although some of them such as mathemat requir a student to learn fact , understand idea and concept about an area or an issu is more import . one of the reason that can be given to the statement that understand is more import than learn fact is abil to appli what a student learn practic . for exampl , i am studi pyscoholgi and it is not enough for me just to learn the fact about certain thing . as i want to be a pyscologist in the futur i need to appli what i learn and i need to solv my patient 's problem . thi certtainli requir to understand idea and concept of what i studi . the other reason is that a person can be more creativ and do well on their exam when she understand the idea and concept . rather than accept the fact after learn it , student can discuss the concept and even improv the idea that they underst . in my depart i have a frind whose concept of studi is totali differ from me . while i alway tri to learn the main fact and concentr on them , she focus on concept and just tri to understantd idea . what i observ recent is she is do better than me in exam and thi lead me to becom a conclus that sinc i onli focu on learn fact , it make me limit to them and i can not answer or respond to anyth practic . what is more is she is more creativ than me in produc solut to practic problem of some patient that we studi as an exercis in a hospit . to conclud , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept instead of learn fact . that is the way i want to chang myself toward also .
