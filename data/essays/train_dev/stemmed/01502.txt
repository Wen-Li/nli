some peopl might think that travel in a group led by a tour guid is a good way . but , a group tour normal ha it strict schedul and doe not offer the tourist in group ani chanc to meet mani peopl in new place . so , i strongli disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . first , a group tour ha it own strict schedul and all the tour team member should follow it . and it mean that i can not choos the place where i want go and the food which i want to eat . for exampl , when i went to thailand for the first time , i chose a group tour becaus i wa young and it wa the first time to go abroad . i realli want to go mani attract shop and spot in the street in bangkok , but i could n't go there becaus i wa in a group tour and i had to follow the schedul which the tour compani offer . and i had to wake up earli in the morn and had to go back to hotel in earli even , even though i want to enjoy more sleep in the bed in the morn and want to go outsid in the night . it wa realli bad experi . second , a group tour doe not offer mani opportun to meet other peopl for it tour team member . becuas a group tour move togeth by it tour bu , it is difficult to meet mani peopl in new place . but if i travel alon , i can meet mani peopl and feel their cultur . when i went to tokyo by myself , i met realli mani peopl there . i could talk with them and some of them becam my friend ! even though i could not go a lot of sightse spot as effici as a group tour , choos a place where i go and go there by a subway were realli excit experi and japanes peopl were kind to let me know the way . all thing consid , i definit beliv that a group tour led by a tour guid is not interest or excit at all . by go new place alon , we can learn more about the new place and feel much about the peopl there .
