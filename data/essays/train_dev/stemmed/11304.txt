in ancient greec , a philosoph who found hi own school expect applic to know geometr as well . is that still the case today ? we shall herebi prove that due to the advanc of scienc , thi ha becom almost imposs , though a broad cultur is a paramount asset to modern life . mani philosoph and genius throughout histori show that have an extrem broad knowledg wa possibl : voltair french philosoph of the end of the seventeenth centuri , wa an famou writer as well as a good ingen in agricultur . at these time , there had been a major intellectu movement whose goal wa to gather everi scientif and technic knowledg in encyclopedia . sinc there wa not mani of them , contributor to those book had to acquir thi knowledg themselv ! moreov , it wa seen as a way to set oneself appart from old religi scheme which were seen as a tool of obscurant . yet , now that scienc triumph from religi doctrin which were judg somehow simplist as explan of natur process , the scientif methodolog itself ha made univers knowledg virtual imposs to gather for one individu alon . be the key to the improv of product and the welfar of human be , scienc wa ration to such an extent that no one can publish ani decent academ articl or research work without have been grant the diploma to do so , which impli studi the subject for durat that can reach decad . one usual ha to attend class for more than ten year to becom a doctor ! nevertheless , one must not forget that scienc bind with elitist norm of educ can becom a threat to democraci , as soon as knowledg becom the privat properti of a small group of overspeci offic holder . ignor as a way to keep peopl under control wa most commonli use in authoritarian regim such as south africa , in which the coulour-skin could not be taught in english , which wa the languag of the administr . thi aim to prove that though special is requir nowaday , a broad cultur is vital to everyon in order to prevent ani abus .
