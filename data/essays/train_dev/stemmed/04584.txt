it is gener believ that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . some peopl think , as young peopl are less awar of the serious of certain event , they can enjoy everyth more than older peopl do . other peopl oppos thi point . as for me , i agre to say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . on the one hand , young peopl believ that older peopl can enjoy life more than they can . when i wa a girl , i use to think that my parent and my grand parent are veri lucki , becaus they did n't have homework , and could do whatev they want to do . i rememb when i wa 13 i said to my mom that i want to be 30 right now , becaus at thi age , noth were forbidden to me . i wa so fed up to hear the adult say `` you can not do thi , you are too young '' , or `` you can not stay here , we are discuss about a subject that you can not understand !! '' i wa veri upset , and thought that would be great to be older so that i can realli enjoy life . howev , i do not see it thi way now . it seem to me that be young is synonym of be free , be independ . we can do whatev we want to without be alway anxiou . . is that good ? am i suppos to do thi ? i realli believ in the fact that , as young peopl are less awar of the serious of certain event , it is easier for them to enjoy life . moreov , sinc we are still young , we have everyth to discov . it is great and amaz to discov some new countri for exampl when we have the opportun to travel , to learn differ cultur from all around the world . furthermor , as we do not have children yet , we feel free to go out at night for parti , to do mani thing we wo n't be abl to do in the futur . inde , day after day , we would certainli feel bore to do alway the same thing , and we would not enjoy it like . last but not least , even if we have to studi a lot , even if we have to work hard and may feel depress time by time , i must recognis that it is even more interest than stay at home everyday . it is more excit to live without know what we will do tomorrow , than live everyday like . on the whole , i admit that i agre with the statement , becaus i think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do as it is the first time they had discov everyth . carp diem
