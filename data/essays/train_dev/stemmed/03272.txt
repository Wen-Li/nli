it is usual said that life is short and nobodi should wast hi time . i think that it is talk about both young and older peopl . howev young one are physic capabl of have more enjoy experi than older one so doe it mean that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl ? not realli to my mind . the prioriti of both are total differ , for instanc young peopl can enjoy highschool or colleg and what goe along ( parti , trip , human experi ) nevertheless older peopl would actual enjoy have time for themselv or those they love . if we take a grand mother as an exempl , she mainli worri about her grand children and her children , she enjoy wit her grand son grow into a remark person . older peopl are more concern about their own famili instead of their own satisf and that is what make them happi . of cours she still take care of herself and ha her own way to entertain herself howev it will not be the same as when she wa still in highschool , she might want to becom garden or travel all around the world , but her need are more cultur and family-lik than those of young peopl now , if i take a sixteen-years-old boy , it is signif differ . inde hi first concern is hi own satisfact although he also care for hi famili . nonetheless he want to have fun with hi friend go out or play sport . hi need are person and simpl . he just have to seiz the day without have to worri about hi salari or hi electr fee . he is not respons yet so he is enjoy life without have the same concern as an older person . to conclud with , i would say that both enjoy life as much as they can even though there still are except . thi doe not appli onli for teenag and age peopl but also for everi categori of age . eventu , a teenag will grow and chang , so will hi interest and hi way of enjoy life .
