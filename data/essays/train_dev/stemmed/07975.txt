i disagre with thi statement . i strongli believ that in 20 year there will be more car in use . first . whi do peopl buy car ? becaus they want to get an easi access to everywher . they can go to wherev they want . though the mordern transport ha provid a fairli conveni way for peopl to travel less time . can a plain directli take you to a beauti rural villag ? no ! howev if you own a car with gpr . you can go to everi corner on the world . second . what kind of peopl buy privat car in our countri ? the answer is wealthi peopl . now the number of the rich mushroom , and these rich eagerli want to buy a car when they were in a poor statu . becuas they think a car especi a high-rank car can show their statu . in the common estat where i am live . when i wa veri young , i could see few car pake in the estat . as i grow up , i can see more and more car begin to park below my build . now the park area ha been full with car . what doe that mean ? that mean the live standard in my estat can show the whole citi live stantard is grow . with rapid econom growth in our countri , i hold that in our countri there will be more and more car , and so doe it in the world . third . though a lot of peopl are complain about the fact that car 's emiss will caus the green hous effect and traffic jam dure the rush hour dure the day , i believ these problem will be solv in the near futur , becaus the car manufacter are invent new-concept car which cover less area and without ani carbon dioxid emiss . these car will definet attact more peopl to buy . fourth . pocess a privat car can have more privaci which a lot of peopl concern about . in the public transport , your behavior is limit . to all of these factor , car have a lot pf advantag , peopl in the futur will more like to choos their own car rather than take the public transport . so i believ that there will be more car in use than there are today . of cours , i will buy a car for my self in the near futur .
