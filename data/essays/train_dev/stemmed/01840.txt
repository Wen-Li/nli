i think it is more import understand idea and concept of the thing than learn onli the fact , but i also think it is import that you learn real fact of the idea and the concept you have learn befor . when you studi someth that is not obviou or immediatli rapport at the real life , for exampl math , if you are a student , you 'll ask to yourself whi are you learn it ; on the other hand , if you plan a littl inform program , you 'll know immediatli what are you do and whi . if a boy decid that he is n't interest much more on the whi of the thing , he should have to learn onli how someth is done . thi is the case of most of the physic job like seller or someth els . otherwis , if you are interest on idea , you can learn a lot of thing . if you studi properli someth , you 'll discov that all in the wolrd , is strictli relat , for exampl the same law that govern electr , govern also the the water flood . in spite of thi , if you do n't learn ani real fact , you might loos ani capac of use what you learn ; in fact i know a lot o peopl that are famou professor at univers , that are n't abl to take care of a flower , or they are not abl to make most of the simplest hous work . when i wa younger , i attend a technic school . there , i learn how to make an inform program , how to build a littl integr circuit , and similar thing , but i did n't realli understand what i wa do . onli when i came to the univers , i discov that the thing i wa do were not a `` god present '' , but were someth that came out from the law i did n't studi . finali , i think if you want to becom somebodi , you 'll have to studi the idea of the thing but you will also learn the fact .
