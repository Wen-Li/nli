in gener it is veri hard to compar the level of enjoy life between younger and older peopl . they live in differ situat with differ problem and challeng . firstli one ha to consid the situat in which the differ group are . both have an uniqu profil . the big part of the young peopl ha onli few money , becaus they are go to school or studi at a univers , so the possibl and the offer are differ from those who are older and have rel more money . young peopl often enjoy their life by hang around with friend , do sport , in short activ that cost onli few money , on the other side older peopl go to work and so they have rel more money which they can spend by eat in good restaur , visit the opera or travel . by consider these fact my opinion is that in gener no one enjoy their live more . becaus the differ ressourc which are necessari to enjoy your life are balanc . to underlin thi , one can compar a student with a retir person , the retir person ha a lot of time , he can decid what he doe everytim , in spite of thi he is n't in an better situat than a student that ha n't a lot of time for enjoy , the student have to prepar himself for hi exam , but thi time that he use for studi is no wast of time , probabl the student is enjoy hi matter , els he should n't have choosen it . on the other side the retir person ca n't fill allwaz all it freetim in conlus i disagre with the statement , obvious it is balanc , nevertheless everyon should enjoy everi second in hi life .
