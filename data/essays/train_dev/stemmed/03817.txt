i agre to the follow statement , that ` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are ' . mani compani produc good and market them to the field by market them or advertis them through t.v show , advertis etc . ani product in thi world must meet the iso ( intern standard organis ) standard in their valu and qualiti . one can know about the product by watch the advertis or the hoard avail . the market produc maintain the ad in such a way that , ani peopl can easili get impress to that product and buy that . they show high standard in market them rather than in maintain the qualiti . for exampl take a simpl product like a babi milk powder , the current and present ad will be in such a way that , it show as if a babi can becom super man by drink it . no bodi need his/her child to becom a superman , they onli want the minimum health need for their babi to grow . the ad will onli impress the children to get attract to it . anoth exampl for thi type is the product of bath soap , the market member will make the ad for the bath soap so impress by keep celebr for that ad . so that all the young and youth girl becom desperet toward the soap think that they are the celebr . everi one know that by use that soap an ordinari girl can not becom an celebr , everi one know it , even the product peopl knew it . yet they are make it . am not say that the advertis are wrong , it there wish to make or not , my opinion is to maintian the standard in there product , as mani peopl trust them by go through the ad . as huge amount have be place for a product on their advertis , they have to keep an equal and energet intrest on their qualiti too .
