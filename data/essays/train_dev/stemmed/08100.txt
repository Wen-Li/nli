even if it alway useful to know some major fact , i advoc the fact that it is more import , and fundament , to understand idea and concept beyond the fact . there are three reason whi i perfer to understand concept than to learn fact . first , to understand the concept may allow you to find or discov the fact . for instanc , dure a biolog experi you can get the right conclus by reason . anoth way to get the result could be to know by heart the answer ' , but next time the result may be total differ and you 'll not be abl to explain whi . so learn without understand may drive you to some dead end . that also the case in a lot of area link to mathemat . you can find the most of the answer by manipul a few concept you understood . in addit , the understand is the basic of ani scientif domain which are , nowaday , so highli valu . second , i think that thi train of the mind will help you to adapt easili in new situat . i learn japanes charact a few year ago . i wa in china a few month ago and i had no big troubl to deduc the mean of the charact and find my way in the citi of shanghai . even if the chines charact are more complex than the japenes one , you can still deduc the mean thank to the asoci of the unitari charact compos the bigger one ( call kanji ) last , i 'm sure it is the best way to remind thing easili . for instanc if i ask you : do you know what are the main color use by miro in hi paint . you may know it becaus you saw mani paint from thi artist but a veri easi way to remind it is the follow one . onc you know that miro use to live in a small citi call ` mont roich ' , which is a small citi close to the sea . you begin to understand the first color is the red . it come from roich , which is close to red . the second color is the blue which repres the sea . the third color is the green of a certain plant ` the carroubi ' . and the least one is the color of flower : yellow .
