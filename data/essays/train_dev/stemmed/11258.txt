i believ most advertis make product seem better than they realli are . thi is becaus the kind of thing shown in advertis do not take account of real life condit , also to differenti product from other competitor they are hype for their good . firstli advertis make product seem better than they realli are becaus when advertis is made they do not account the real life condit . for exampl when an advertis of a bike is shown the advertis do not take into the account of brake , stop , idl of the bike when they show the mileag of the bike which is most of the time never turn out to be actual achiev at all . with hype mileag quot in the advertis the product in thi case the bike seem to be a better than it is realli as it can not deliv the quot mileag of advertis . secondli compani intent make good advertis of their product than they realli are to differenti their product from the other product which are avail of other compani . by do thi they tri to creat a brand and a nich of their product which is veri much smiliar to the other product . take for exampl laptop compani like acer , hp which show about the eas of work , graphic display which would not caus eye strain . but in actual it doe it and is veri similar to the other product . ultim advertis make product seem much more better than they realli are .
