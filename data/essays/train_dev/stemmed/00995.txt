it is hard to identi the one way in thi dillema have broad knowledg about mani academ subject than to specializa in one specif subject . accord to me , to spealiz in one specif subject provid so much detail in one subject , creat expert in specif subject and increas concentr on the issu , make team spretual , so the new achiev can be achiev easili . first of all to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject make the one skip the detail . therefor they can never have deep knowledg about the one main subject . on the other hand , in the one will speliaz in one subject to do not skip the detail , sinc it ha so mani time to focu on the subject . secondli , if the one tri to know everyth , acn not be expert of one subject . if the specif subject is special than , and make deep investig about the area s/he will be known as the expert on the issu . then after , i can call special as expert in addit to those if the one ha broad knowleg of everyth , s/he would not except the team work , sinc s/he can see himself as the one know everyth . fourtun , the expert would want to get the other aspect about the project and can creat the effect team work and brain storm in order to achiev the result of hi or her project . that mean get inform from other specialist . at last the expert can achiv the result of the project more easliy , sinc s/he would onli concentr what they should do . if the help is need than they can get help from other expert . therefor it would maximaz the efficeni of knowledg . as a result , be expert , ehich mean have special knowleg on specif subject creat team spretual with other expert easili , increas concentr and creat focun on the target and at last creat big achiv , so we need expert in order to courag big achiev .
