advertis are design to sell a product , and to that end they can go the extra mile that might just push a custom to buy it . .. thi can sometim mean that an advertis compani will resort to sensationalist announc that could fall into the categori of miracul in regard to what the product can do for the consum , and sometim it mere result in an extens and color use of human languag . in the case of those advertis that would aim for exager the effect their product will have on their consum , a great deal of color metaphor and even lie might use . a diamond ring could miracul make the consum look younger and more success than they realli are while in realiti it all depend on the consum 's abil to `` dress for the occas '' . a dietari product might reduc your waistlin to that of the skelet model you see in a magazin or that of an actress in a movi , when in realiti you would probabl have to have a balanc diet and - more often than not - an exercis regimen . where use languag color is concern , we can often observ skill writer with an ampl vocabulari avail to them as a mental arsen develop piec of literari art that charm the consum . thi is by far the prefer method as it intent is not to propagand or sensation ( as would be the case of the first case ) , but to use languag in a lyric entic form that catch the roll of a tongu or that particular inflect that might season a simpl phrase to the point of perfect in the ear of the behold . in the end both case do in fact make a product usual seem much better than it is . in rare case will a product satisfi the consum as much as a well written piec of literatur cover the product . it 's my belief that the aim should alway be for the product to be exceed by it actual valu or effect . .. howev , it should never be at the expens of the verit truth of the product . after all , creat fiction regard a product could lead the consum to drive a lawsuit against the compani respons for it develop as well as the advertis . .. we live now in a world where the public demand qualiti . .. even though it seek fantasi .
