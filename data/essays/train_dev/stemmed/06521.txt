intelectu or practic what will be the best for us ? about if it is more import for student to understand idea and concept that is for them to learn fact , i believ learn fact are more import than memoric and idea or a concept becaus about a fact you can develop and idea or a concept . when we want to develop or introduc an idea or concept we have to demostr we are in the right posit with a fact , without a fact the idea doesnt work . for an exampl : in some forest and agricultur school the student learn make with their hand what they should learn , they go to the feel and work that is the way they learn , thi is a veri way to teach . anoth exampl : when we are kindergarden student the person who take kare about us do not teach us first a concept , they teach us first how to make the thing . in cienc for scientisfh or a manag in a bussin the fact are more import than concept , that doesnt mean that concept can not help us , but all we learn at school be realli help to us just in the time we use thi in the real life . so that way i believ that fact are more import that concept and idea , becaus you can infer and idea becaus of a fact . how i believ that in some school should be more practic , thi way the idea or concept that the school or teacher want we learnd wont be so easi to forget , becaus with a fact we can rememb and import idea , and anoth thing is have a fact in a class will be make us more interest the compreent or even teacher can atract the student more than a regular class .
