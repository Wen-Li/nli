today , more and more often old peopl is show by the societi as slow and sad peopl . but thi point of view is realli restrict and can not be share with everybodi . first , to my mind , the definit of `` enjoy life '' can chang with your age : not becaus you can not enjoy like befor but just becaus your mind chang . for exampl , when you are a child , `` enjoy your life '' is just to play with your game . when you begin to be a teenag `` enjoy life '' is to begin go in club , in bar . when you are thirti year old , you need to enjoy life spend time with your friend or succeed in your job . i think when you are young , it is realli hard to understand enjoy life of older peopl becaus you did not discov what they live and what they need . then i think anybodi need to enjoy hi own life with hi own dream or hi own hobbi . more when you becom older , your bodi can accept everyth it accept when you were young . someth which wa realli sweet and so easi to do when you were young can becom quickli hard and so strong . then a thing , you think in your childhood too hard or too string can becom with your age realli easi , funni or sweet . for exampl , to do go in club or do extrem sport can becom realli hard when you are older , and to learn chess can becom realli enjoy when you are older . to conclud , i do n't think everi bodi can have the same one , becaus thi term is link to the target you gave to your life . thi target can chang and is too much personn to be share with everybodi . and thi is realli hard for the differ gener to understand whi older or younger enjoy life with a anoth anoth activ which is not your view of `` enjoy life '' .
