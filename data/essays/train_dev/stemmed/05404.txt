in my experi go to travel with a group led by a guid is much better than ani other way . and that becaus these follow reason . enconom reason . go by group is much less expens than go as individu becuas the less cost of group transportaion and reserv like hotel ani other place . a lso be led by a guid will give more inform from hi experi about where is the best place to go with the most cheapest price . anoth point is that go with a group is more fun . realli in my experi it is realli more fun to have the pleasur of vist new place with a group and also let by the guid . and it give you more inform about the region that you are vist becaus the guid will give you some import inforamt about the histor place for exampl that you are visit . and also you can share and take some expereinc from the other memeb in the group . anoth point to focu on is go by a goup to some place is realli more safeti than go alon like mountain as an exampl . sinc have a memeb in the goup that may help if some thing happend to you is veri import and have a tour guid who have the experinc to pass these problem is also a basic . the last point which is more interest and happen to me when i went with my partner to anoth countri without a group is that we realli have problem with the commun with the peopl over there . sinc the langaug and the custom are not the same , and that will not happen if we had a guid at time who can talk that languag . and from that time i advic most the peopl to go with group letd by a tour guid .
