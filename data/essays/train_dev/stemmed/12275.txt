in address whether younger peopl enjoy life more than older peopl , i can not state for certain . howev , i think that enjoy life is not heavili depend upon age , but rather on the differ situat of each person . admittedli , young peopl seem to enjoy life more than older peopl on the outsid . thi is becaus younger peopl are more vibrant , adventur , and have more energi . they have less respons than older peopl , give them more freedom to explor and have fun . but i can not rule out the burden that i have experienc grow up . for exampl , the pressur of enter univers , then graduat , and then acquir a job . it seem that overcom a hill led to an even bigger mountain . howev , i can not ignor the fact that as peopl grow older , they have achiev mani thing along the way . for exampl , a stabl job , leisur time to do hobbi , birth and nutur of children are just some of the thing that can lead to an enjoy and fulfil life . in addit , the period after retir seem so liber and enjoy . but on the other hand , older peopl have more respons , mean less time to yourself to enjoy life . it seem that who enjoy life more , the younger or older , doe not depend on age , but rather on how the individu grow up and becom older . some peopl may think that their childhood wa a disast , without mani good memori , while be at there happiest at an older age . on the other hand , some peopl may miss their childhood and wish that they could go back to the innoc day when they were free to do whatev they want . in conclus , i do not fulli agre with thi statement , as question happi base on age doe not produc a reliabl answer . rather happi , whenev experienc depend on the individu life
