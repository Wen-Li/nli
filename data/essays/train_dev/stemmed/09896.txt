i am not sure but i think that is probabl that in twenti year will be more car in use that now . from 1980 to now the car grow about 4000 % . the problem of thi is if in twenti year we find a new metod of transport faster , cleaner and cheaper and the car will be forbiden . for exampl the peopl in in the 1930 could though that in twenti year would be more ship to went from europ to usa becaus it wa the onli method of transport but twenti year later appear the airplan and desappear the ship . or the train wich were the onli method of transport from a citi to a other citi or town in the begen of the 20 centurytheir were sustut for the car or the airplan . other problem is the surviv of the car if the oil wich is not eterni , finish . one day the oil will dissapear and the car will find other metod of propuls or dissapear but i think that thi is not the princip problem becaus now there are car who use electr , sun and other type of energi . i think that it is probabl that will exist the car in twenti year but will be differ that now know . for exampl you will not drive the car will wear a comput who will drive for you and they will be faster and safeti . other posibl is that the car will be abl to fli . all is posibal and i think if now we can do airplan who can stop in the air and land in a littl zone whi in a futur will be abl the car fli ? in definitli i think that twenti year is a littl time to dissapear the most commoun method of transport in the world but it is posibal that they will be more use or no .
