recent , the product of advertis have develop , so most advertis advertis product much better than actual . is it realli good for custom ? i disagre with the statement for these reason . first of all , when custom tri to buy someth , the advertis are also one of the point that they chose which to buy . if the advertis is too much better than actual product , custom will disappoint . second , it take much money to advertis . in order to attract a lot of custom , produc make advertis wonder , so when thi situat happen , the cost of advertis becom much more expens . if produc spend money to advertis more than to make product , they can not made real good thing . in addit , product may becom poor . also , it is bad not onli custom but also produc to make poor product . it mean that custom do n't want to buy poor thing although the advertis is realli nice , so product ca n't be bought . in conclus , it is import to attract custom by advertis , but it is not good to spend too much money to advertis . so , i think that the produc should make product better and spend money to improv product and invent new thing rather than great advertis . therefor , i do n't prefer to make product seem much better than they realli are by advertis .
