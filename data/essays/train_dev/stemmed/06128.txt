i agre with the statement that said `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . the reson whi is becaus noth is fair . life itself is n't fair becaus if life wa fair whi there are a group of peopl that are suffer and a group that is rich . in my view to be success in thi type of life we live on today take a lot of risk becaus to me be a success is that when a person finish with school , have the type of job that he or want , and have a famili . for exampl school is n't easi there are so mani step a person need to finish with school . that 's is the reason whi today most teenag are drop out from school . i believ in myself a lot i know that to be success a person ha a lot to go through . accord to an articl that i 've read said a lot of freshmen drop out from collleg becaus the cours are to diffcult or they get drunk and get kick out from there . howev i think the statement base on the articl becaus success is just word if the collleg freshmen step up than they will be success which is they can get their colleg diploma . the articl and the statement touch me a lot the peopl that get kick out from colleg could have been me , my famili , or you . as long as we know what there for noth could step on our way . success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well is just a sentenc everyon can achiev it . if you or me is n't afraid of take risk .
