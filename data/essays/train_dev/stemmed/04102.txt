i agre to the claim that it is inde import for student to understand the basic idea and fundament concept of ani scienc rather than just learn the fact . observ the fact is just like a surfaci phenomenon . onli , when we penetr through the exist realiti of the subject and understand it inmost charecterist through analysi of observ idea an concept , then onli we can correctli map them to the exist fact . understand idea and concept is noth but a sort of research . thu , we can redefin our knowledg on the subject and find out the innov and possibl way to util it for our use . if we just concentr on fact , then sometim we may just get carri away with our erron conclus . onli , through understand it fundament featur we can analys it 's basic natur and can put forth satisfi theori that work well with observ fact . mankind had progress significantli most of the time through understand the idea and concept relat to the subject rather than learn fact . ofcours , fact too have their signific , but onli analysi of the subject will make progress in that field . for an exampl , let take the field of vlsi ( veri larg scale intergr circuit ) . onli through the understand the concept behind it made signific chnage in it field . onbodi can realli look into the integr chip and learn how it work . onli , through a thourough analysi of idea and concept we can actual fabric a chip . in thi case we have no scope to observ the fact rather than understand it . the main reason for support to understand the idea and concept is , then onli the student will have complet idea about how the fact will actual take shape . then , they can plan for innov and alter in it . that how the concept of research aris . onli through research have progress to thi extent . by understand the basic concept and learn , analys fact will becom automat . but , the convers is not true alway . the first one will prompt for further research while the later , just give a dri understand . the basic natur of a research is noth but understand and thouroughli analys the idea and concept . which ultim boost the progress of that field . especi , when it come to the student it is their responsibl to understand what they studi and if possibl bring out the best innov out of the exist one . learn a fact is mere acquis of some knowledg regard that which often have lesser import when compar to understand the concept and analys through idea . so , i conclud that it realli import for the student to understand idea and concept reather than to learn the fact as it motiv them to for research and come out with excel enhanc and new develop . ofcours , learn fact is import , but it is of lesser import when compar to understand the idea and concept .
