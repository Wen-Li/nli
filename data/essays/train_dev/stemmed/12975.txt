some peopl might say that learn lot of fact is more import than understand idea and concept . howev , i think understand idea and concept are more essenti . there are two major reason : to be confid and to be logic . to begin with , student could get confid through understand idea and consept . you might say that learn mani thing can make peopl more confid . howev , you may not deni that without understand them , nobodi can use it confid . moreov fact are usual so common . by contrast , although idea and concepst are notperfect , peopl can get deeper knowledg by flow the idea and conpet . as societi is get more complex , the competit is get fiercer , therefor , the mean of export ha chang . it wa to know mani fact , now it is to understand whole idea and concept . moreov , as far as think logic is concern , understand idea and concept are more import . i took the histori class when i wa a freshmam . i learn mani import fact in the class and i got a great score on it . howev , i forgot most of them immedietli after a final exam . in comparison , when i took a physic class , although it wa chaleng to me to understand the idea and concept , but through that proccess i could learn the way of think logicali . thi logic approach help me to get better grade in other cours , too . in summari , to understand idea and concept is necessari for student to get confid and a way of logic think .
