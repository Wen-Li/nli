the advertis world is a big and unexplor think wich the human of thi time have to live . i am a comun expert and it is a shame to accept that most advertisement make product seem better than they realli are . it is a true . but whi i agre with the statement ? there is a simpl reason : the most import thing in the advertis world is to persuad peopl to buy anyth , in a lot of case , thing that probabl peopl never is go to use . there are two posiblli reason that make that the advertis peopl do thi . one is the money and the other aspect is the peopl 's ignor . the money is the first reason that make to do thi . in a world when onli the most powerful surviv , the money is the best way to get the thing . it mean , that if you have money , you have power . and it is what the bussi men and the compani want : power . then , if they have succesful with their product , they are go to have money and consecu power . for that reason is that the advertis make producto seem so much better than they realli are . the money , and the obsess for money get that the compani and the advertis peopl do not take care about the qualliti of the product . it is like `` if that did not work , it is better for us . now you are oblig to buy again our product '' . the second reason whi most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are is the peopl ignor . for exampl , if you see the new product to lose fat on tv , probabl you want to have thi at home and in the 95 percent of the time thi product is not go to help you . but the adverstisement tell you that you need drink or eat thi for five year or someth like that . then , the problem is that if the peopl doe not enouhg inform and keep in the ingnor , they are go to buy the product dure five year . but , whi do you think that one simpl capsul or one simpl tea is go to help you to lose fat ? do you think that is simpl ? no , it is no simpl . thi is a larg proccess that need so much time and work . but the advertisement tell us that it is not necesati , and we believ they . as a conclut , i think that thi problem , thi lie that the advertis peopl give us , should have regul by the gober of each countri . whi ? becaus it is not possibl that they , for money , power and ignor , give us a lie , a fals product .
