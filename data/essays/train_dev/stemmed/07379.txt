`` the idea and concept tend to creat an intellectu '' thi proverb held equal good when we talk about lear process involv proper understand and concept . it is not onli , hold good for the student alon , but also hold good for each and everi individu who are in the process of lear . though sinc the student are build block of the futur gener , more emphasi should be given to them . besid , lear fact contribut veri littl in actual learn process . the veri first point whi the student should learn by understand idea and concept is that becaus onc the student understand the concept , he/sh can easili appli the concept in ani field to solv the probem . no matter how difficult the problem is . for instanc , in the regular class of math and physic , where the subject is occupi with full of formula and fact , it is veri difficult to memoris all the formula and fact state in the book . but if student understand the idea and concept then he can probabl deriv mani formula by a singl standard formula , then , in thi case he / she doe not need to remmemb all difficult formula which will be veri exhaust and time consum . moreov , if the student onli tri to know the fact then there is a possibl that their knowledg will be narrow . what i meen is that when the problem come which he/sh is not awar then it will be veri difficult for them to solv the problem becaus they onli know the use of fact in one particular place . wherea , if the student ha understood the concept and idea then he / she can solv ani of the problem by virtu of the underli concept involv in that problem . on the other hand , lear fact also contribut in lear process upto certain extant . for exampl , in chemistri , until and unless student learn the period tabl , it will be veri difficult for them to understand the rest of the inorgan chemistri , henc , in thi case it is imper for student to learn the fact also . to sum up , in major of the field , learn idea and concept are more benefici becaus it give the solut of a problem all the time . nevertheless , fact are import in fewer condit when compar to lear concept . but in gener for the good knowledg and proper understand combin of both would be better choic .
