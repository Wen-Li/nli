in a way , i would agre thi statement . in my opinion , it is essenti to have a wide rang of knowledg to state in thi societi we live in . for exampl when you discuss thing with someon or when you have to write an essay you have to be pen for argument which may stay in conflict with your person opinion . then you have to know how or whi thi argument is come up and how you can built a new argument . thi is a lot easier if you can see the link between all the the subject . thi implimis that you hava to have a certain level of knowledg about sever academ topic . moreov , the link often give you the oppurtun to creat own and especi new aspect or theori of an issu . on the other hand , i assum that it is n't possibl to be awar of everyth in thi world . as thing and especi knowledg are chang that qucikli in our societi , it will be hard to bring yourself at the up to date level of knowledg in each academ subject . anoth problem is that peopl alway have a special field of interest . thi might be becaus they gain experi in certain topic in their childhood or their parent introduc them in a special academ field . for exampl , a lot of cildren would like to be an astronaut . as a result of that , they will probabl concentr on issu like astrolog , star and so on . i 'm sure that thi concentr on one field can chang in your person life quit a lot . therefor , i suggest that you will becom a specialist in certain academ topic which are most interest for yourself . but you should alway tri to keep an eye on other subject becaus knowledg can influenc eachoth and could give the movement to new aspect of knowledg .
