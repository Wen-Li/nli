about thi topic , either option have disadvantag and advantag . if i choos one side , i will choos learn broad knowledg about mani subject . there are three support idea about my choic . the first reason is broad knowledg about subject help peopl to have enlarg work choic . if i know knowledg about scienc , market , and bussi . when i invent good product , i will start bussi and market by myself . i can be an owner of compani , scientist etc . these broad knowledg help me to get more choic of job than when i just know about scienc . furthermor , it will bring more financi profit and better reput . the second idea is extent knowledg substitut peopl 's work when if peopl fail their main subject or work . let 's say i just know about paint industori . when the other substanc , which will use instead of paint , is invent , i ca n't get ani job becaus my major knowlegd becom useless . howev , if i knew mani knowledg about mani subject , i can work at the other area . therefor , learn broad inform about subject is better than just learn one subject . the last reason is it help peopl to stand out at mani place . if i just know about scienc , i can show off when peopl talk about scienc , howev , except scienc , i ca n't show off my abil becaus there are none left about the other subject . howev , if i know mani part of subject , i can show off my knowledg everywher and everytim . it help me to live more confidenti , moreov , i can self-satisfi . becaus of these three reason , learn just one subject is not as good as learn broad knowledg about mani subject . therefor , i think that if peopl alreadi learn about just one subject , i wish they got an attitud to pay attent to other subject also .
