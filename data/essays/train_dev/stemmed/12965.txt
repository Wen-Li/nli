yeh , it is veri import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , becaus it will help them to have a grip on the concept . studi the concept with out ani idea will not develop the knowledg of the student , the student knowledg develop onli when he think on the topic . how he/sh get that think ? onc if they are have some grip or idea on the topic . the student knowledg will develop base on their understand capabl and also their think capac . i am agre to the concept becaus i have a practic experi onc up on a time . two student of my class attend to an exam with full of practis . i am explain the practis modul of both of the student , one student had got a text book and memoris through out the day with out breakag and also without ani idea . and the other person who also studi the same text book but he is not read , he is understand the concept . after they arriv after the exam one of the person who prepar whole night without ani brakag told me that the question papper is veri hard and i didnt understood the concept of the papper . but the other person told me that the question papper is veri easiy to answer , i answer with in 1 hour out of 2hour . that much of easi the exam is ... he told like that i cant get first whi they are tell like that , when ask both of them how u studi i got the answer for my question . on that day itself i understood that the instead of memoris the word we will go for understand which will be veri help full to the person to develop in ani way . final i conclud in such a way that peopl must understand the concept or idea , instead of studi that first we have to studi and we have to understood , without that we ca n't achiev ani thing .
