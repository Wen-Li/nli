although some may believ young peopl nowaday give plenti of time help out their commun , i believ they do not . there are two main reason : their attitud and lack of time . first of all , young peopl nowaday do not have the attitud or motiv to help out their commun as they believ it ha no benefit on them . these young peopl believ they do not need to help out their commun as they believ other peopl will do it instead of them or it simpli a wast of time . i believ they do not understand the moral of help the commun in need . furthermor , young peopl nowaday are a lot lazier than they use to be and so they lack the motiv as they consid help the commun will be '' work '' , and as we all know , young peopl tend to dislik work as it is not enjoy . thi motiv is probabl influenc from school work which is more of a requir rather than a choic . secondli , the fact the world is becom more competit and also a lot more interest , youngster are becom more involv in other activ and their studi rather than contribut toward their commun . these young peopl may have object such as go to the best univers or simpli enjoy life by relax , and in my person experi , i have never come across a young individu who actual want to give their time to help their commun . as a result , as young peopl prefer to spend their time in a differ way , there are veri littl that feel they should help out their commun . in conclus , as young peopl are not tempt to help the commun as it is not enjoy and the fact they have better , perhap more import thing that must be done , young peopl nowaday do not give enough time nor effort to help their commun .
