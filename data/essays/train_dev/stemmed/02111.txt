i agre with thi statement . i am 18 year old , so i can be said one of young peopl . actual i am the one who do not give enough time to help one 's commnic . i move when i am a elementari school student and i went to non-publ school in my junior high and high school day . so i have not so mani peopl in my citi . neither do my parent . i live in an apart hous and have littl rel with the resid . it is said that peopl live in an apart hous have littl frendship nowaday , i think so too . and more my famili includ me buy food in derivari servic , so i do n't know about my citi 's shop . most of young peopl nowaday may be same as my lifestyl . especi if one doe not born and bred in the citi where one live now , one have less rel to and pay less attent to their commun . and if one 's parent is familiar to the citi where they live , they tend to becom less connect to their commun . i also beliv that there is anoth attract place like stand shoppingmal in the place where they do not live . so peopl do not stay in their commun and go anoth commun . of cours everi young peopl theseday do not live like that . some have the experi to join the festiv , matsuri or some sport that wa held by commun , and other have connect to commun 's presid or some person , therefor they know a lot about event held by commun . howev peopl like that is not so mani . thi is whi i beliv that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun .
