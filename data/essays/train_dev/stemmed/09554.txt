i do agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . young peopl have a lot of energi insid of them , that motiv them to go further into new field and explor new idea . and that physic power that help them to resist hard time . these explor and resist make them atchiev their goalstherefor enjoy life . while old peopl have n't got thi energi and physic power to motiv them and lead them to theiir dream . young peopl have thi gift , insid of them , energi and physic power . thi energi and physic power can motiv them and lead them to accomplish their own dream , and by accomplish their dream , the term enjoy life is fullfield . for exampl , if a young man ha the dream to becom a doctor , inord to cure sick peopl . therefor to becom a doctor that requir alot of work and studi . alot of peopl might say that he doe n't enjoy life , but the true fact is that , he is enjoy life by do the onli thing he think will proff hi exist and will improv from peopl 's live . on the other hand , if an old person had the same dream of becom a doctor , will be veri hard for him to accomplish it , becaus he doe n't have that gift ani more , the energi . without have the energi , he will struggl to accomplish hi dream . i 'm not say that he wo n't accomplish hi dream , no what i mean is that he wo n't enjoy hi life in order to accomplish hi dream . he will fight against hi poor resist bodi in order to reach hi dream . at last he did it , he accomplish what he wa aim to . but if we put the young and the old of thi exampl in comparison , the two accomplish their dream , but the young is the one who enjoy life . he enjoy the pleasur of use the energi insid of him in order to motivat him , so he may reach hi goal to conclud , young peopl have a gift , they may use it or not , that depend to their inspir to fullfil their dream . thi gift of energi and physic power give them the opportun to fullfil their dream , on the other hand , old peopl lack these trait .
