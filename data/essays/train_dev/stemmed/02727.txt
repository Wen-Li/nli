i do not agre with the statement that ` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn facts` . i dont think that you can understand idea or concept of someth when you do not learn the fact . fact are more import than idea . they should both know the fact and concept about someth so they can analys the situat themselv . they can not know someth by not learn the fact . they can not be complet conciou about a subject if they do not know the fact . the onli thing they know is the idea about it . i also think that just understand concept and not learn fact , do not encourag student to observ or investig . we all just learn to understand other ' idea . mayb i would not agre with those idea if i had known more about it . you can not ask question about thing that you dont know what the fact is . henc just understand idea will not let us ask question . mostli in histori lesson we onli understand idea or concept about lot of thing that we can never be sure if it is the truth or not . also i know it is hard to know all fact about histori but i just wish i could . besid all those abov by think as the mean . fact mean someth total object and can not be chang . howev idea is opinion of other peopl and mostli are subject . the fact are alway object . so it is more reliabl . to put it in a nutshel for be more object , ask more question about and make the situat more understan for ourselv we should learn the fact .
