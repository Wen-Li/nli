i disagre that the trip which is led by a tour guid in a group is a best way to travel . sure , if we travel with a tour gude , we can enjoy a trip even if we can not speal english well becaus if we have a problem , a tour guid will help us to solv the problem . in addit , we can go to famou place in a good way . it mean that we can go mani place without wast time . at the same time , we will be abl to get a lot of knowledg about the place which we go from a tour guid . if we travel with tour guid , we will enjoy and we will be safe . howev , if we travel with a tour guid in a group , we have to mind time anytim . if we have free time , we have to come back on time which a tour giud say . if we want to look more , we can not do that if we travel with a tour guid . if we have a place which we want to go , we can not go there if the place is not the place of cours even if the place is veri near the way of cours . if we travel by ourselv , we do n't need mind time . we can stay the place as we want . furthermor , we can make a plan the travel as we want . therefor , we do n't need got to the place which we are not interest in and we can go to the place onli we are interest in . in my opinion , plan the trip is one of the enjoy of trip . if we make a plan from first to finish , we may have some ploblem . howev , if the trip is finish , we can get a lot of happi . therefor , idisagre
