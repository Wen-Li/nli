peopl usuali say `` no risk no gain '' . i adher to thi principl . in order to get unconvent success one ha to aquir unconvent mean rather than stick to convent way and just manag to do well . so the statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' , is true . our histori give the evid that how courag and enterpris peopl excel . in primit day when sail wa difficult and danger , peopl with pluck set out to sail and ventur new land and accumul wealth . these peopl are still refer to as success peopl . did primit peopl stick to convent and would have been complac with their simpl life , our world would have had a differ face today . in an entir differ scenarioi would like to bring in an exampl of a motorbik compani . thi motorbik compani had a monopoli in the sector of two stroke bike . i rememb everi youth those day wa interest in buy thi perticular bike . suddenli one compititor of thi motor bikelaunch into the market a four stroke bike with a better mileag . thi new bike in the market wa the hot cake now and the compani that had the monopoli earlier strted lose ground in the market . though thi is an exampl of a manufactur compani but the moral of the stori can veri well be use for peopl also . the reason whi the success motorbik manufatur compani lost it 's market wa that the compani wa complac with it 's perform and it never felt the need to innov or take new risk in the field . so in nutshel it can be said that be enterpris and take risk are one of the great attribut of a success person . and by break the convent success peopl acheiv unconvent result .
