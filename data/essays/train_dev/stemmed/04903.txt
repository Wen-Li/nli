in my opinion , older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl . `` enjoy ourslev and have all the fun we could have . '' is what most young peopl think of . they spend time to do sport , to date with peopl , tend to club and pub to find their fun ; drink and smoke to make themselv feel more high , more excit . it 's not a healthi life , and not a responesbl life also . when peopl are young , mostli they spend money given by their parent , instead of spend money earn by themselv . and , secondli , young peopl alway tend to be selfish and take less care about other . they do n't actual know how import other peopl roll in their life . in that case , they will do less contribut to the either farmili or commun . so , in my view , young peopl do not know `` how '' to enjoy life . in contrast , old peopl , on the other hand , think otherwis . '' enjoy ourselv with other peopl , have fun while we can . '' is what they think . they are more matur and know what they are suppos to do . old peopl usual go travel when they have free time and extra financi abil . they go to club too for differ purpos , have a drink with friend or old classmat . most of them know how to lead a life which is healthi and full of happi . also , old peopl know how to make themslev help and valubl to other . they know hwo to share happi with other peopl . especi when they had their children . they enjoy a real `` life '' . in all , old peopl know how to enjoy the life and they are enjoy more than young
