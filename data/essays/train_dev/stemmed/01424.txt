no i do n't think so . becaus , world popul is grow up rapidli . therfor the car user increas in twenti yer . the person who have a opposit view to me might think about increas of popul case someth bad to natur . for exampl , acid rain and greenhous effect . the ga from the car is one of the biggest reason of air polus . if these problem get wors in twenti year , it seem to have strict control by the gover to solv these problem . so it might be decres the car user . but i think we do n't have to worri about that . becaus today , there are car which are move by solar system and natur oraganisum oil . `` puriu `` invent by honda is a kind of car use the solar system to work . it is quit expens but it must be less expens in futur . and a lot of countri tri to make oil or gasolin which made from natur thing , so there are much more car in use in twenti year . i mean the car that is kind to natur and human be .
