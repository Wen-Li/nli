i total agre with the statement , i think it is veri import for student to learn and understand idea and concept , that stand behind the fact . studi histori for exampl , we 're better know whi the first and the second world war happen , than know how everi singl countri organ it trupe for the conflict . what i reffear to is the import of commun what are the reason of the fact instead of know mererli what happen that day . go on with the exampl of histor issu , it ha a great relev to understand the reason , the ideolog , all the complex contest in which a fact is in . .. even becous we are suppos to learn about those way of think that led ancient peopl , and contemporari peopl to great success , and to great disast . . what wa the thread run through these event , how some dictat were abl to strike a chord in peopl . .. that is what should be wide unsderstood . if we consid other matter , like studi mathemat or phisic and scientif studi , i still believ that is more import to understand how to get to a certain theori than learn onli that formula . moreov , as a matter of fact , we tend to forget mostli of thing we learn by chanc , but we easili rememb what we total understood , becous we undestood the mental process to get to that particular solut . in conclus , learn the concept and the idea , we developp our mental and logic function . thi help not onli in succeed to examin and test , but in everi singl thing we do in our life
