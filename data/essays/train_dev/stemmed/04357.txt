i agre with the statement argu that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , accord to the gener concept of advertis and my own person experi . first of all , the aim of advertis is to sell those product they want to sell , therefor it should promot consum 's desir to buy those product . thu advertis are n't suppos to make ani neg impress about product , sinc their aim for cell them , not to make peopl refus to buy . thi is whi most advertis tri to make an effort to show product better than the actual product becaus they want to sell as much as possibl . by use better pictur , catch copi , extra . for exampl about an exagger that i found in my person experi , i bought a deterg that had a catch copi of `` never left dirt on your cloth '' in it advetis . i wash my cloth by use a laundri machin with that deterg although i later found out some dirti spot on my shirt . it had n't got clean off at all . i got so disappoint sinc i believ in that advetis , although i can not accus it . advertis should n't be total fals but still consurem should be awar that mainli they contain somewhat exagger , to show product better and make peopl buy . in addit advertis is not a declar toward the consum , becaus we consum have to judg whether we believ that advertis or not . as i discuss , mani advertis includ exagger about it product , therefo i believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in fact i wo n't accus most advertis even if they contain some exagger , becaus we know each compani ' desir to make product popular . thu each consum should have an good eye abl to judg whether those product can satisfi their expectat .
