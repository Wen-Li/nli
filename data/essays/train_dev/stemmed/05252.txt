i agre to the statement . in my opinion there is famou say that `` to get success you have to take risk '' , i agre to thi statement becaus i feel that success dosent come without take risk in life . today is the world of competet and to compet in thi world you have to tri new thing to get success . in order to get success , sometim you tri to find out new way . by go on those way you think you can achiev success and you often take risk in your life . i feel if peopl onli do those thing which they think know how to do well they can get success upto a certain level but can not reach height of success . in my opinion everi one ha it own defin of success and it depend on the person to person till what extent they can take risk in their own life , for some peopl success mean peac of mind or a happi life . but for some success mean reach the height of the world , to conquer the world so that person tend to take more risk comparis to that that person who is happi in hi own world , or to that person ha differ mean for success . for exampl , if you take the exampl of cricket if a batsmen want to score quick run he hast to play slodgi shot in order to take quick run so he ha to take risk . sometim he get success or sometim he fail . so it just depend on the person is he readi to take the risk in term of get success ? but i dont think you can buy success without take risk . sometim i feel is `` success ha it neg side '' . thi question alway bother me a lot . is success dosent come without take risk ? till now i am not abl to find out the answer till date , may be i have not achiev success yet but the day when i will achiev succ i will come to know
