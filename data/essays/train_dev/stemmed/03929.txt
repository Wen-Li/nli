from my point of view , i agre with the statement that it would be better for a student to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than to special in one specif subject onli . i will explain it from three aspect , person interest , person develop and vanish subject . firstli , not much student can realiz their interest that which subject they like most . mani of them , includ me would get frustrat when we should make a choic among thousand of subject to studi in univers . howev , if we no need to choos a specif one to concentr on , we can expos to differ kind of subject and henc develop our interest . it is realli regrett if we make a wrong decis is choos it . secondli , broad educ can nurtur student to be an all-round . all compani demand all-round instead of student with specif knowledg . of cours , everyon should have his/her strength and weak . howev , broad educ allow student to develop more comprehens . for exampl , the art student may be weak in commun skill or the scienc student may be too ration . but if all student are put togeth and studi more subject , a student 's person may have influenc on the other besid gain other subject ' knowledg . last but not least , it prevent some subject to be vanish or even disappear . sometim , student choos subject that have good futur career such as busi . few peopl would choos subject just base on interest . therefor , thi leav some subject like chines histori to becom vanish . but chines histori actual is worth studi and import for young peopl to familar . at thi point , if we set broad knowledg is a must , the problem wo n't happen . in conclus , studi in mani subject is better than special in one as it allow student to develop more interest , to becom all-round that can benefit their futur career and also prevent some subject from vanish .
