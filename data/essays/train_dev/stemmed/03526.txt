i do not agre with the statement `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . '' i think that older peopl have as mani way to enjoy life as young peopl do . even though young peopl and older peopl have differ way to have fun , i am posit that everyon in societi ha mani opportun to enjoy her/hi life . first , mani young peopl enjoy play sport , play music instrument , hang out with friend . for exampl , i am a high school student , and i feel realli happi when i play the piano , when i play tenni with my friend , and also when i go to movi or bowl with my friend . i see other high school student have fun play soccer , videogam , talk with friend . there are mani other way to enjoy their life too . second , i have seen on televis mani older peopl play game , have good time with their grandchildren , read mani book , etc . they can find the way to see happi in their live . my grandmoth like sow , and she told me when i wa littl that she like sow but also like peopl 's happi face when she gave them someth she made also i have seen old peopl play golf , or meet with old friend from their high school or colleg . howev , it is true that younger peopl would have more opportun to enjoy mani thing becaus of youth . older peopl would have less energi or have lost some abil to do someth than younger peopl do . but even though older peopl may have less opportun to enjoy life by play sport or someth that need much energi , they of cours can have someth they can do without move a lot or use much energi . there are also mani thing younger peopl can not do becaus of less experi . for exampl , as i mention abov , meet up with old friend is a thing onli old peopl can do . again , i think older peopl have mani way to enjoy life as well as young peopl do . the way may be differ , but everyon ha mani opportun to have fun in live , becaus i think that is what most peopl live for . everyon ha someth he/sh can see happi in to live long .
