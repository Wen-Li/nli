it is commonli state the the onli part of the human life when you can enjoy yourself is when you are young , and sever writer and philosoph wrote about that topic : actual i do n't agre with thi statement for two main reason . in the first place , asd they feel to have plenti of time , young peopl usual can wast their time in someth that later can reveal as someth trivialor not worth do . i rememb have spent entir day watch tv , alon in my room , rather than go out with my friend for a walk , or to have refus to practice a sport just becaus i wa too lazi . now that i 'm busi and i do n't have spare time , i realli feel as i had wast my time . on the other side , young peopl have to think serious about their futur , and in mani case , in order to accomplish their object , they can not wast time or money to enjoy life . for exampl , if you are studi at univers and want to have good result , you have to sacrific your time to studi , or , even if you have plenti of time , you do n't have the money to enjoy yourself . if you want to marri , you have to save money and thi mean that you have to sacrific mani pleasur of life . on the contrari , older peopl can frreli enjoy their life : at the present time , while i 'm busi studi in order to enter in my phd program , my parent are travel around the world with their friend and enjoy their hobbi . i think they are realli enjoy their life , not onli beacus they have gain , after year of sacrific , the time and money to do it , but also becaus they have the capac to recogn the thing that the realli can make their life pleasant and worth be live . consequ , they are abl to place everyth the right dimens . i think it is possibl to gain thi capac onli with experienceand in some way , both young peopl wast time and young peolpl sacrifi themselv for the futur can later becom abl to fulli enjoy the life .
