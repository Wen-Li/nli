is there fewer car in twenti year than there are today ? although there are mani variabl and uncertainti may affect the number of car , i agre with the statement . first , the airpollus is gete more and more seriou . in the last centri , the human be have made too mani car . in some big citi , the exhaust of car is the main reason to caus breath ill . the gover also notic that , and it tri to prevent the problem get wors . one way is to reduc the number of car . besid , to drive in the rush hour in the citi drive all driver crazi , and it is almost imposs to find a park lot in the down town . the trafic problem in the citi also attract peopl to go to work by take public transport , and give up their desir to own their car . the number and qualiti of public transport are grow in most countri , and i think it can replac the role of car in the twenti year . final , the oil price now ha rais about three time as three year befor . the pertroliem will be deplet someday , and peopl 's concern about the problem is reflect on the price now . so the cost to maintain the car is much higher than befor . i believ under the presur of rapid growth of oil price , peopl will turm to other choic , such as bicycl and bu , and the the number of car will be reduc . all in all , i regard that almost all the varibl do not promot the increas of car , and fewer car in the futur can be expect .
