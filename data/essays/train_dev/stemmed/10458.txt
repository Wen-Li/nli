thi is a controversi issu to defin the import factor for sutud . someon priotiz knowledg of idea and concept that student gain is a most import factor of educ , howev other may say that experi from fact is an import factor for sutud . these prioriti would depend on life everyon 's previou life experi . in my case , i wa grown up in a school that gave me mix educ method , and that the method wa equal balanc . sinc i recognis mix educ polici , both factor are key to obtain better concept , and at least i can say is both factor were need and just one of those would not bring the signific result . when i wa elementari school student , i learn concept of insect . that wa a first time that someon told me concept . i engross in the idea and bought mani book about insect . thi easi introduct of concept brought me a signific knowledg even i spent my time and fund to have more knowledg of insect . thi experi realis me the import of understand idea bring me more knowledg . in contrast with thi experi , i learn concept from fact that i face earthquak when i wa 10 year old . at that time , i did not know what earthquak is . first trembl wa come , and everybodi went down stair or desk to protect one 's life . although i never knew such action had to did howev learn imedi amd so did i . thi action kept me from potenti damag by earthquak . after the earthquak pass , my teacher gave us a concept . in thi case , have to learn fact gave me a concret concept and idea of what earthquak is . i say both factor are equal influenc and valu for better educ and each is more or less ha valu for better educ . as i experienc both factor brought me a ration and educ valu for my studi even if each of those is differ experi . sinc the purpos of student is to have best educ , no matter what the method is , both method can bring valu for student .
