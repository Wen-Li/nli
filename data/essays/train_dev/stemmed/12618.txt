i agre the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guid . last summer i went to itlay with a group and a tour guid , i like my trip becus i meet new peopl form diffrent place and shier same inform . if i did not with the guid i would miss mani place in itali . in the same time , i did not konw the histori for the place i had visit . two year ago , i went to japan with my friend , most of the time we were lost becaus , we did not speak thier languag and did not know thier transport system . travel with the group and the tour guid is cheper than trave alon and you cane see more place in limit time . in addat , some trave agent have mani tour so , you can select what you like . howev , they have program dure the trip to make the travel enjoy they trip . there is bad thing when travel with group , some pepol do not respect the other and make the travel do not like the trip . but in genral i prefe travel with group and a tour guid .
