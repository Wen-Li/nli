evri one of us dream of enjoy hi life dure all hi live period until hi last day . but i personali think that young peopl enjoy life more tha old peopl . fisrt young peopl have less responsibl toward the familiy , so they have much more liberti to do what they want and to go wherev they peref . they could enjoy their life by travel or take risk in some adventur , do danger thing or crazi thing , while old peopl have their famili and their respons to take into account . young peopl also could go to some entertain place with their mate such us pub and diskotec where there is so much nois that the old peopl could n't bear . there is also some nice place that are open exclus for young peopl , old peopl are note permit to enter them . an other point to be mention it is the health issu , young peopl are generali healthiest that old peopl , and thi make them abl to enjoy mani thing in life for exampl , last at night , play some amaz sport like car speed or jump in mountain . they could also afford work hard and have an extra job to gain more money that help them to entertain them selv . they could also travel to ani place without reserv becaus they are in good health so they could bear long trip , they do n't fear that the whether would be hot or cold , they could bear it anyway becaus they are still young and they have strong health . so i think young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl .
