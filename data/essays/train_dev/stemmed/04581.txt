broad kowledg of mani academ subject is much better than special in one specif subject in my opinion . not onli becaus it will be more interest but also becaus peopl will benifit more if the subeject are vari . the main reason that broad knowledg is more help is that peopl will be awar of mani thing in thi world . they can expand their knowledg in an easi way too . if the subject are limit , a lot of peopl wont care to know about other thing in the world or in the kingdom which we live in . they will be satisfi to have the inform that are circuld around the environ they live in . i cant judg and say that all peopl will have poor knowledg , but i 'm sure that the major wont have that good knowledg . in other word , our societi will be weak . also if knowledg is limit to omli one subject , scientist would n't have reach the success which they have today . for exampl , if nuoten did n't bother to expand hi research on the graviti and stay on figur out whi the appl had fallen toward the ground , i do n't think he would have known the formula of graviti at all . he could have spend hi whole life think alon and not know the reason of graviti . i think that hi effort in studi everi singl detail made him conclud the concept of graviti . if i were given the choic in ani univers or in ani school whether to studi onli my major or have addit subject , i would choos to studi both my major and other addit subject . that way i will be not onli well educ but also my mind will have a good understand of the world which i 'm live in .
