statement about the futur are alway extrem unpredict . but in thi particular case i stongli support the idea that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use that there are today . twenti year from now there will defin be less car than there are today , due to variou reason . the main reason be that , even if there are car , what will they run on ? ! unless human invent an effect way to run car on someth els other than petrolium , car can not surviv . also , twenti year later the wolrd popul will almost doubl ! so there would not be ani space for more car . liter ! the rapid use of effect public transport ha alreadi begun as it curb the inconveni of traffic , park etc . the peopl of the world will realis that if there are too mani car , there also might be too much pollut , and the corrupt of the environ is someth we can not risk even today , let alon twenti year later ! the awar of the populu of the world will defin increas and by then everyon will realis that if each person who travel from place to place ha hi or her seper mean of transport then the whole world would be one big traffic jam ! for exampl , today in downtown manhattan , it doe not make senc for one to have their own car becaus it is much easier just to walk to take a cab . in my opinion , within the next decad the world will see the maximmum number of car it ha and then the declin will begin . car in urban area are alreadi begin to caus a problem in mani countri . they creat nois pollut , emmit harm carbon monoxid gass , and are veri danger to pedestrian owe to the tremend traffic ! in conclus , i would like to say that there will defniat be much fewer car twenti year from now than there are today as it is inevit . therefor i agre with the abov statement .
