i think to understand idea and concept is more import for student than it is for them to learn fact . the reason is that to understand idea and concept is more creativ activ for student . when we tri to understand the idea and concept , we must consid lot of factor of idea and concept . at first we must confirm whose idea or concept they are , to add more inform to them as the background . next , we make analys whi they have the idea or the concept use aquir background inform . after these prosess , we can aproach to the stage to make answer or own opinion . to get answer or opinion , student can make discuss with friend , parent , and brother . in additon , they can get some suggest from their teacher or they also can make investig use book or internet to add more inform . i think that these consequ prosess are veri import for student to develop their way of think . in contrast , learn fact doe not need such prosses . it is easi to access the fact without ani kind of think . to learn fact , student just sit down on their seat in the class room and just listen to what their teacher say . in thi case , the inform is onli given form their teacher to student . if student listen to what their teacher say and write down it on their notebook , they can get new knowledg . but do they use their brain to consid anyth dure thi behaviour ? the answer is no . they just listen and move their hand to write . these prosess are not creativ and mayb macin can do it complet . in conclus , i strongli think to understand idea and concept is more import for student than it is for them to learn fact .
