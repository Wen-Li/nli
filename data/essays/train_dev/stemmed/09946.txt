i agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . sinc young peopl are make our societi these day , in my opinion , the societi is made good for young peopl . there are mani place in which young pepl enjoy and older peopl can not . for exampl , game center is the place where we can play mani game . mani young peopl go to there and enjoy game . howev it is too danger for older peopl to visit there sinc there are mani bad young peopl . also , i think that young peopl have chanc to commun with peopl more . young peopl go to school and meet friend . they also can join mani activ out of the school . older peopl may join some activ but there are not mani activ for older peopl . in my experi , i went to the usa last year as an exchang student nad i met alot of peopl who i could not see if i wa in japan . if i were older , i am sure that i could not go to america and have great experi . in addit , older peopl have physic problem . it is hard for older peopl to go to mani palac and enjoy all of them . howev young peopl have more enagi so they do not get tire easili . therefor i think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl .
