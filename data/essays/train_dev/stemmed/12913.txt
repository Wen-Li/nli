i total agre that all advertis show there product much more better than they realli are . ofcours that is what the advertis are made for . the advertis are done so they well attract the audianc 's eye . and that is done by make an exadur of the subject , becous if that did not happen the audianc will forget what they have seen eventuali after they see someth eals . for exampl the car advertis , they well show that the car 's desin is realli fine and smoth by certin light reflict that will trick the audianc eye . also they will say that the car 's engin is realli powerful that they will show some loud soundeffect of the engin like a formula one car , and also the speed of the car can be easli trick the audianc by ani special 3d effect . here the advertis can engaudg either or all of the human senc sight , hear and so on . imagin if the advertis are done by show the product how they realli are like , then everi product that are at the same calss will be sold or known by the same number of peopl . then there would be no real competis between the advertis compani . my openion is that the advertis compani should have a certin kind of inspect . that would make sure that the product are match there advertis , so in that way they well beld a trust between the audianc and the product that are been advertis in the futur .
