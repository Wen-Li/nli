idea , concept and fact are veri import part of a student curriculum . a good student alway look for invent new thing or desir for conduct new research in hi field of studi . for thi he alway look for new idea and concept . i prefer idea and concept are more import for student rather than fact . an idea can chang ur life . we all new whi newton wa famou . he wa sleep beneath a appl tree when suddenli appl fell from the branch , he thought over it about whi appl fell down , whi didnt it go up , thi concept or thi idea led to the famou theori which we know as newton law of graviti . see what an idea can do , it creat histori and those who look for new idea and concept wiil definit creat histori in their futur cours . so understand the concept and idea will help a student drastic . for ani student irrespect of hi field of studi he ha to use hi own idea . for instanc a student who ha join a graduat cours in the field of space explor , he ha to produc a thesi on the relat subject which should be obvious a new and an intrest one . for thi altough he ha to collect data from previou fact , he ha to incorpor hi own dimens or view of the subject what he ha learn so far . for exampl the space scientist have to find out way and mean to preserv food as their expedit requir a 2-3 month stay in space where the condit doesnt suit for preserv the food . the student ha the chanc to innov a perfect preserv condit and for thi , apart from the data he collect from fact he ha to put forward new idea and concept to materialis thi . thi can be achevi if the student clearli understand the idea and concept which hve been taught to him by the professor or wherev he get inform from . that the reason i strongli prefer that student should understand the idea and concept veri well rather than just learn the fact . learn the idea and concept will definit diversifi the knowledg of student and they would be capabl enough for their futur endeavour . learn and use idea are veri import in ani one 's life .
