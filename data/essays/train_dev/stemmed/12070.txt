in my opinion , i agre with thi statement becaus if you have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject you are expect to work in mani sector if we take the view from a work aspect . you are also abl to turn into anoth sector for ani reason with out the need of a long and costli format about your new work . from anoth aspect , i think that a person with a global knowledg is more interest than a person how onli ha knowledg about a specif subject . in fact , with a person who ha a global knowledg you can talk about everyth and you are sure to learn someth and that is person will have a point of view about everyth . in the other hand , the other person would be more bore and not so interest becqus she onli know a specif subject so after at while talk about thi subject , you will feel a bite bore . but have knoweldg about a veri specif subject can also be veri posit . inde , in the busi sector , we can see that industri that are special in onli one sector are usual more effici than other campani which tri to extend theirselv to sever market with product that are complitli differ between them . inde , the special compani know veri well their product and also everi thing that it is around the productt : product , custum , market , competit . .. so they are veri good in what they do wherea a compani who extend too much will be in the end good in noth . as a conclus i think that you must alway find a balanc between bee gener and specif in everi t
