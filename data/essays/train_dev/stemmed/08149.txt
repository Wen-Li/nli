we often hear complaint from the older gener that the younger gener is spoil and selfish , lack the altruist natur to help the societi around them . although it is inde true for some young peopl , i believ that it is a littl far-fetch to presum that all young peopl do not spend enough time for help out with commun work in gener . to begin with , mani school have activ adopt variou program to encourag , or even requir student to join in volunt work . for exampl in korea , it is mandatori for junior high student to do certain hour of commun work , and submit documentari evid in order to graduat . i had to help out in a local nurs home for 30 hour to meet the requir . even in colleg , your voluntari work can be acknowleg as credit . some may argu that such particip is not genuin and self-motiv , nontheless , it is true that adopt of such polici inde ha increas particip of young peopl in commun work . moreov , it is not just the chang in school polici that made young peopl particip in help their commun . the grow awar of social respons among busi corpor is what also drive social particip of the young peopl . more and more compani are activ organ public campaign and voluntari camp to help the commun , call mani young peopl to particip in such program . mani compani , such the well-known samsung , organ commun volunt work program for their newli recruit employe to particip . other compani run volunt program that their teenag custom can particip in , such as in the success case of ` rainbow club ' run by sk telecom . to summar , peopl , as well as compani , are not sole judg by financi or academ sucess they are make as in the past , but also by the amount of social contribut . such chang notion ha motiv the young peopl 's more activ particip . i person believ that young peopl nowaday are activ involv more than ever , and will continu to do so as long as thi trend continu .
