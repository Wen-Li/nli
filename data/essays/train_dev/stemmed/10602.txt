it is normal for peopl to grow , and while grow , we 'll have a littl bit of everyth , happi , enjoy , sad and depress . ofcours , everi singl stage ha it own nice moment . but thi concept chang from time to time . for me , i think that young peopl enjoy alot more than what older peopl might do . for mani reason , the hard of life will auscal while be old becaus there will be mani factor interf with age process . one thing is that , the duti for young peopl will be much lesser than those of older one . all what young peopl ha to do is go to the universt , which is consid a sourc of pleasur , and all what he ha to do is pass it . here , he can do alot of thing to make him happi . he can meet differ peopl everi singl day , he can have hi own group to spend nice time with , he can go to differ place while be with that group , and he can enjoy be in an intim relat by have a girlfriend with whome he can spend great time with less commit . while , on the other hand , if we think about the older man who is supporrt that young man , we 'll find alot of thing to consid . he ha to save money for hi son 's univers , he ha to manag the situat of the whole home inwhich there will be other brother and sister , and he ha to keep manag for the wholi marriag life he is have . also , in older peopl , they will start think about some issu aris later in life like retir and loos signific other . final , everi singl stage of life can have it is own sourc of happi and sad . but be young will mean less duti with much fun .
