in twenti year it will be fewer car in use than there are today . i think that petroleum is becom more and more expens and that in twenti year it wont be enought for the rest of ther global popul . so i 'm sure that it will be less oil or petroleum car in use but i 'm sur that peopl and human will find a way to commercialis altern energi and we will be abl to use it for our car . by the way , it 's alreadi possibl in brazilia where petroleum is be fire by a new kind of oil , the sugar alcohol . thi new gener of car 's oil is well known in south america countri as sugar is one of the most famou good of the countri . but it 's not a reason , the world popul is use to car m they are in our way of life sinc a hundr year and even if it work with a differ kind of energi , peopl wont like to drive someth els than car becaus they are use to it . there is no reason should be eras , our world live with it for so long that if we chang it we will lost a part of our histori . it 's whatev import not to dream on the situat , huge lobbi in the unit state and in orient are not enjoy in those new technolog and they will make presur on the gouvern for it not allow those new possibl to their countri . for exampl in franc it 's total forbiden to ride a car that doe n't work with petroleum or gaz wherea there is alreadi a lot of new type of energi like betrav or hydrogen that should be comercialis but cant becaus of the oposit of the state . howev we will use some other energi than petroleum but in the next twenti year it seem pretti hard to imagin that the world will stop run after petroleum and will be cultiv differ kind of plant in order to go work or to be abl to leav for holiday . so in order to conclud i think we can say that whatev what happen , it will still be as much car in twenti year but the real question will be to guess how it will work .
