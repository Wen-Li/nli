you often hear that in the futur there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i also agre with thi statement . there are sever reason whi i think so . the first is that the cost to drive and possess a car would be much higher than today . becaus the price oil would get higher . also today you can see thi , becaus in the last year the price for oil is explod . and also the tax for car would rais becaus the govern care about the environ and need money . so not everi person will have the money to use a car . anoth reason whi car will be get fewer is that there will be a lot of other option to come from point a to point b in the futur . for exampl a transrapid will be built in munich in the next year . so mani peopl would not use a car if they have the possibilti to go by the transrapid . and today mani peopl research for new way of transport peopl that are not as bad for the environ as car are . a third reason is , that more and more peopl move into the big citi to get a job . so there will be more peopl in the bigger citi of the countri . and in big citi you normal do n't need a car . i think so becaus with the car you need su longer than if you user other possibl becaus there a mani traffic jam in bigger citi . for exampl a friend of me studi in munich and he need with hi car one hour to come from hi home to the univers . with the bike or the subway he onli need half an hour . so i think mani peopl will then use a bike or go by subway . for conclus you can say , that there are a lot of good reason whi in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than today .
