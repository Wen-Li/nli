today advertis can convic consum that everi kind of product is the best one and that you ca n't live without it . there are a lot of tecniqu that make a product irresist for consum . but is alway true that all advertis product are so good like it seem to be ? i think is not : they seem much better than they realli are . last week i bought an appl pie that i saw on a televis spot . in the imag report on tv it seem reali testi and healthi , but when i eat it , it wa not so good and i got sick . i could n't sleep all night long . in my opinion it would be better for food or dress compani to spend their budjet improv the qualiti of their product or decreas the price instead of invest it on advertis . the problem is that busi rule are differ from what is better for the peopl . but someth ha to be done . i think that certif of quliti are a veri good invest for the compani to show the real valu of their product end in the same time a good way for consum to verifi the qualiti of what they are buy and choic better between differ brand .
