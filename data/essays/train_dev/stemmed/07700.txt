i think for student to understand idea and concept is more import than for them to learn fact . i have veri strong opinion about that . my favorit subject is math and i like math but i can tell i 'm not suprer good at math but it 's alright not realli bad . on my way to do it math is i do not think about that the answer is . i need to know how should i solv it . if i just know the answer then what am i learn ? to find answer skill ? not realli . for histori and math or other thing to learn , first thing that you have to understand . you need to know what your do . my math teacher not onli count the answer . i need to show how i got thi answer . if i onli write the answer then i will lose my point . that is the idea that im tell . it would continu that if you have a same situat that you did befor but you do n't know what to do , then what are you go to do ? noth . i could tell the fact is just cover , and understand or concept is insid . i hope that peopl look at the insid . of courc the fact is import we have to know what is correct or not . i know mani peopl just want the fact expect the how did you understand . you have to make your own thing , that call understand . if you understand then you can solv easili that you expect . sometim just look at the bright side that do not just focus on the fact . you need to know the way you did . it is more import for student to understan idea and concept than just fact . it should be good experi for your life .
