i partial agre with thi statement ; accord to my opinion peopl should tri new thing as much as possibl in order to enlarg their horyzon . that provid more experi which is a veri import thing that is use in face new or unexpect situat . on the other hand , take risk could lead to the loss of success that one person ha achiev befor . so i think that a reliabl way to valu a risk is that to think about it consequ . for exapl we can look at economi market . economi market is a well known enviro where someon can achiev success and easili lose it . in thi field you may becom richer by follow new way of money invest , but if they fail , you would experi what realli the word `` risk '' mean . although continu in do what you know to do well , would take you away from loss of success , the onli way to have more is to do more . let 's see anoth exampl , which might sound more familiar and could explain whi i do n't fulli agre with the statement . we can easili aplli the statement to the world of work peopl . in your work carreer you can follow thi two main way : aplli for differ work in your life in order to get more experi or aplli for a work that you sure can do well and focus on it . the second way is better if you would like to achiev success becaus if you are sure you can do one thing veri well , it might be recogn by other peopl and thenyour carreer may proceed on higher level . on the other hand if you are forc or choos to chang work frequent , you wo n't get ani valuabl success . start a new experi , in which also we 're not sure to do well , could bring a sens of frustrat becaus the contin shift among work lead you everytim to the start point . now it might be clear what i mean when i affirm that i do not fulli disagre with the statement : it 's a matter of point of view , some life experi can provid success by risk , other can not .
