peopl have their own idea about whether young peopl give enough time to contribut to their societi . some peopl might say young gener would like to help their commun , sinc they can experi a varieti of thing . howev , in my opinion , it seem clear that young peopl do not give enough time for help their commun ; they are too busi and they are affect by bias inform . first , young peopl ha too mush work to do . it is gener agre that as societi is get compex , young peopl are too busi to develop themselv . therefor they would not have much time to care for their commun , for exampl , one of my friend like to do a favor to other so he got a prize from the princip of hi school . howev , sinc he ha to prepar for appli to the univers he want to go , he can not give enough time to help other peopl . in thi way , be busi is a great obstabl to help our communit . second , as far as multi-media is concern , young gener are onli concern about themselv . some peopl might say the multi-media ha noth to do with be selfish . howev , through the multi-media such as televis , student are inform that most of peopl in our commun doe n't need help , so they do not bother to do a favor to our commun . for instanc , the tv drama nowaday tend to show us onli the partial weatli class of our societi to get our attent , make young peopl think most of peopl do not need ani attent . therefor , the influenc the multi-media prevent young gener from help our communit . to sum up , young peopl nowaday tend not to help our societi in that they ha too busi to qualifi themselv and they are get distor inform about their commun . all thing consid , i think young gener tend not to do a favor to our commun .
