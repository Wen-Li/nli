some peopl say that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . gener speak i think that help commun is a veri import thing wich everi person have to make attent . not onli young peopl have to do it . i think that alway the young peopl are at the centr of discuss althought they have n't do anyth bad . everyon of us have to help their commun who need help . i think that one idea to improv the young peopl to help their commun is to creat a program at school that encur the student to do thi . the student could have two hour per week to spend with their unfortun commun . thu , all guy grow up with the idea that help each other is a best thing . so , anoth option is that the famili give to own son a good educ about help commun . infact , i guess that the best educ for the young peopl becom from their parent . so , mum and dad do n't loos your time ! educ your son to be avail for thei commun who neeed help ! when i am in the posit to help someon i do n't loos my time but hang up and help everyon . and i 'm young peopl ! nowaday , on my opinion , there are realli too much young peopl who do n't spend their time to help their commun due to the fact that they have some other thing to think and do like game or danc , etc.but , for me , those are not so import than help you peer . so , final , i agre with the statement that youn peopl don-t support heir commun , but i hope and guess that thi can chang if the societi inform the young about the problem of their peer and encur their work to help them .
