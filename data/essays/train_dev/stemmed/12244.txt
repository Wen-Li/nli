i do n't agre with the statement that in tweni year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in the last 100 year the growth of car in use ha follow an exponenti pace , to the point that in the world today there are sever million of car in use . that pace is like to continu , especi becaus mani countri all over the world still have a huge potenti in their car ' market , specif emerg countri . some reason that could hinder the growth of car in use would be a higher use in public transport or a feel of disdain toward car , which could be deriv from high oil price . a higher use in public transport could be result of no more physic space , but that may happen in big citi with a huge number of car , not in rural area or emerg countri where there still is a lot of room for car . in addit , peopl in those area have a big incent - if they can afford it - to buy a car becaus , sinc public transport is not common and/or effici , car in those area are even more use . an increas in the oil price could be anoth reason whi peopl would stop use their car , and eventu stop buy them . howev , we must not forget that the main car manufactur are alreadi produc some car that work with biofuel . those model are still almost experiment , but their technolog is highli suscept of be improv , so the number of car in use would not be influenc by high oil price . final , i have been use indiffer the number of car in use and the growth rate of car in use . it is import to note that even if the growth rate of car in use decreas ( in other word it doe not keep the same rise pace ) the number of car in use would still be higher than today . in order to make the statement come true the growth rate in the number of car in use should actual be neg , and i do n't think that is go to happen in the next 20 year ; the potenti to grow is still overwhelm .
