i agre with the statement that student should understand idea and concept rather than learn fact . understand idea and concept is import for student to acquir knowledg . onc if the student get idea of the concept he can easili understand the fact . let us take an exampl regar thi statement . suppos if a student ha a brief idea of polit then he can understand what is go on in the present world and presenrt countri . he can even describ how is it go on and what is wrong and right . i state that understand concept is the main criteria of the subject or lectur . if a student understand a concept throughli he can score good mark and he never forget that concept and idea in hi life time . thi is the way of student to develop in hi think and he can easili grasp the fact go around . idea and concept play an import role in the present educ system and present world . suppos if a person is have nill knowledg about polit it is difficult for him to understand the fact go around . if he dont know what is the concept of work and energi he cant understand the common day to day activ . let us take english if a student dont know the languag and alphabet of english it is difficult for him to learn grammer and spell . if a person ha nill knowledg about a topic he cant write an essay . concept and fact are veri import in all acept . if he just learn fact he get half knowleg of the concept . he can understand onli a part of the theori not total and complet . so i conclud that idea and concept play import role in understand fact . '' as great philosph said that half knowledg is alway danger '' .
