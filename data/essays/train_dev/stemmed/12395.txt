get the problem solv by your self i s apprici i take the pleasur of disagre with the statement becaus the student can understand idea and concept when he is taught by someon els but not by him self , when he want to learn he ha to workout by himself to learn the fact . if he is taught by someon els he might not be that abl to explain the same thing to the other person that effect . he might gho wroung but when he tri to explain the thing which he himself had learn he can be more effect and can easili explain what he learnt . for exampl : the person can not sit on the swmming pool and just understand the idea of swmming , he can learn swmming if and onli if he himself get in to water and tri to swim . in the same manner he ca n't just guid hi fellow person to sit besid the pool and understand `` how to swim ? '' they are sometyh that should be done by learn onli , like learn bicycl , swmming , hours ride etc . . a person can not sit on the poolsid and measur the depth of the pool he can do thi onli if he jump and see the depth of the pool . the thing that lag with the concet and idea are that they dont have the essenc of do the thing practic . `` the first person who came on the earth do not have ani concept or idea '' the thing is he got the idea onli when he start do the thing . these work gave birth to the idea and concept . i would like to discuess one thing here what i fthe scientist would not work out for the thing and sit with an idea he can not go forward and invent these lot of thing for us . learn fact gave birth to the concept and idea . if fact if the child dont know how to ride a cycl he could sit at a conner and listen to the concepti but can not ride the cycl unless he tri it out . for emaxpl a group of friend go aroung to a race club there they found that the idea and the concept that they had is difffer they will be shock to see the club i fthey r lern practic they can drive the car in the race . here i end my topic .
