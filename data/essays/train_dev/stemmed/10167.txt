as i have never had the opportun to studi one specif subject , i do n't realli know how it is like , but i will tri to imagin it the best that i can , compar it advantag to those of the other altern . a student who attend an univers cours have to do an import choos , he had to decid if special in one specif matter or not . i think that special in one specif subject is necessari in a lot of camp , for exampl for a medic or engin . in fact , is imposs to arriv at an high livel of knowledg in mani matter . on the other hand , exsist the risk of a wrong choos about the subject of special . i know mani person that have chang the univers a lot of time , and thi may becom veri danger for the career . it is also import have a complet view about an argument or a problem , and onli a broad knowlodeg of mani academ subject allow that . so , after look at all these differ advantag for both the side , it is veri hard for me to come a conclus . i guess the the best solut is to special in few subject .
