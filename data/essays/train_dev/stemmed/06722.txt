i agre with the statement . there are three main reason for that . first , idea and concept are more variou than fact . fact have the tendensi , but all idea and concept is deffer from each other by peopl who made them . second , to learn is easi , but to understand is difficult . student should studi hard and not get easi . final , if student understand idea and concept , they appli thier knowledg to thier life in the futur . onli to learn fact is not use . therefor , i think that student should make the much effort to understnd idea and concept , not to learn fact .
