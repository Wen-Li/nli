it is absolut true that most of the advertis make product seem much better than they reallli are . but how thi happen ? that is not an easi is question to answer , but i think thi is also the onli question to make in order to understand whi advertis have thi particular effect . i believ that the main strategi use by market analyst is simpli to influenc peopl by touch their weak . everyon of us for exampl , or at least most of us , want to be accept by societi ( our group of friend or our collegu ) . it is un unconsci process but it is like that , and we can do noth against it . as a consequ of thi process we tend to buy the product that we feel could chang in a better way the concept that the other have of us ; ani object that could improv of our social imag is certainli to be bought . i will tri to make an exampl . if i know that david beckam shave with a particular aftershav i might think that by use that specif product i will achiev the same social approv he ha . that is whi most advertis use famou peopl to sponsor a product : becaus we unconsci want to be like them . ani way , the question is whether there is a solut to thi kind of problem , it is in fact a problem the one we are talk about , becaus link to a weak of modern social commun . i simpli think that , consid that we can not chang the entir costum of our societi , the start point is be awar of thi fact . thi way of reason will make us more critic on advertis , whose product will seem no more as attract as we thought they were befor .
