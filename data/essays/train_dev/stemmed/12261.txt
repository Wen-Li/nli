it is gener believ that after twenti year , there will be fewer car than today . although mani peopl think that car are get more decreas , in my opinion , car will be much more increas in twenti year . abov all , nowday peopl want to live more conveni . peopl would like to save their time and money . so they may be want to their own car . for exampl , if they have their car , they will save their time and they can go everywher they want . car will becom most import thing in peopl 's live . then the demand for buy the car will be increas . for exampl , nowday one hous ha more than one car . becaus they want to move individu , so they just get one 's car . in thi sens , peopl need car imper to do live more conveni in individu societi . in addit , recent our technolog have develop continu . all over the world , they tri to creat new and innov thing . then we can not stop their need for make good and new thing such as robot , machin and car . some scientist tri to spread out the car whcih make no pollut or use natur resourc . if we have that car , we do not worri about the pollut which can be bad effect about car . peopl who do not want to pollut environ will be enjoy their live with their car which make no pollut . in thi respect , if scientist studi about the car which make no pollut and use natur resourc and spread out all over the world , we will tri to use the car much more than use the public transport . in conlus , i disagre that in twenti year there will be fewer car than today for the reason that i mention abov . to live much more conveni life and the develop of technolog influenc on the increas the car after twenti year .
