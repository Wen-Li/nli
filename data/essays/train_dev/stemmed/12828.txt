i am agre with the statement that say that succecc peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . in my person oppinion , i think that take risk and tri new thing we can have more exit in our live . if we do not know how to do someth , we have to take the risk to learn to do that thing taht we do not know . mayb it will not be easi but it cold help us to grew up as a person and can help us to have exit . peopl who do not want to have exit in their live alway do the same thing all their live . that wold be realli bore and sad . as human be we have to have someth to encourag us to be a better person . that someth could be to tri new thing . do new thing we can open the door to reach the exit in our live wich thet is what everybodi want ; also can endevelop the differ skill that we have and we could realiz our valu as human be . to have exit in our live can help us to find the happin that we have been look for all our entir life and can help us to share that happin with the person that we love , and also can encourag to other to follow and reach their dream and to be success peopl . the commun idea that we have as human be of a succecc person may be not the correct , most of peopl think that a person who ha exit in hi or her life ha to be bad or corrupt but , no , everbodi in thi life can have exit if we want , the onli thing that we have to do is take risk and tri new thing in our live and of cour we have to have the desir to do it .
