in order to contextu an specif academ subject , there ha to be a broad knoledg of mani academ subject . the balanc between the gener knowledg one gain and the specif knowledg one pretend to obtain is an import one . both knowledg are co-depend and inter-rel with each other . in my person academ experi , i could say that the gener knowledg in the humman depart , the physic educ depart , the antrhopolog depart and the social scienc depart ha led to a more profound and matur understand of my specif field of studi . my undergradu propos wa to combin all these field in the perform art , thu enhanc the possibl of a more organ and interdisciplinari approach to them . by combin physic train ( in theatr art and physic educ class ) with physcolog , anthropolog and humann class , one can achiev a more integr view of the human be within it ' s context . by expand knowledg into variou field , the be can enhanc theatric and creativ perform in a self-conci way . the bodi can therefor express it ' s integr in societi by develop a languag that articul racial , academ and social background . in other word , the bodi becom a didact space that express it ' s knowledg and transmit it to it ' s public . the spartan believ that a healthi mind in a healthi bodi is what made an integr citizen . my undergradu program reiter thi posit and expand it by incorpor the bodi in the `` whole '' of academ develop . if one want to be an instrument of knowledg for it ' s societi , then one ha to acquir a certain gener knoledg of all academ field , in order to transmit a concient and integr discours to societi . my specif knowledg field , perform art , is a great tool to transmit thi discours , use the bodi as a `` connector '' with it ' s societi .
