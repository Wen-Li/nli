it is veri common to see peopl travel to differ interest place in the world be led by a tour guid . my essay will talk about whi i would realli prefer to travel by myself instead of do it in group and hire a tour guid . first of all , you can easili notic that peopl who usual travel in a group led by tour guid are peopl who invest more money in their trip . that mean that the econom factor play an import role in thi matter . for exampl , peopl who travel to europ and have enough money to pay a guid would prefer to do thi becaus it would save them not onli time , but also effort to think how to plan a good trip . in my person opinion , i would rather prefer to invest my money in the trip and not in a person i do n't realli need . secondli , the age is a predomin factor in thi decis , as well . in most of the case , young peopl would prefer to travel by themselv to give the trip a littl adventur . on the other hand , it is rare to see old peopl ad adventur to their experi . they onli want to get the best of their trip without care about fun . final , and most importantli , peopl will enjoy the trip more if they feel independ to take their own decis . that 's what realli matter on a trip , have fun and feel free to do what you want when you decid to . to give you an exampl , when i had the opportun to travel to argentina for work purpos , we were offer a trip to a beauti villag . it wa an incred place and there were plenti of thing to do there . howev , sinc we were suppos to follow the schedul program defin by a tour guid , we were not abl to enjoy and to know the place as if we were there by ourselv . in other word , travel by myself is by far the best decis i could make .
