to answer the question if there will be fewer car in twenti year is not veri simpl . there are variou factor which might or will play a role in thi develop . in the follow i will tri to explain my point of view on thi topic . if the useag of natur resourc and especi oil will continu in the next two decad there might be a lack of petrol quit soon . but use up so much oil would also mean to continu wast our environ tremend . a lack of oil would probabl caus an increas of the fuel prize up to the point where onli veri few peopl are abl to even afford it . thi develop might lead to a think away from the philosophi that everi household need at least one car to a more money-sav one of use public transport system instead . in thi case the number of car would of cours decreas . but i think it is more like that other resourc will be use to provid energi to run a car ( for exampl ga or electr from renew resourc ) . thi would mean that there will be no consider chang in the number of use car . anoth posibl is that due to the polut of our indespens air the peopl 's awer of their environ will increas . thi could possibl have the effet to make peopl think more sustain about the question whether they need a car or not . if peopl are awar of the caus polut ha on our atmospher they might be will to find differ - mayb more uncomfort - way of transport . but in my opinion i do not think that thi mental chang will take place - at least not in the next twenti year . to sum it up , i think that the number of car use is hardli go to chang unless it get either unafford for most peopl - so they are forc to use public transport - or an awer of our natur arous in the peopl mind which make them will to benfit their environ not regard their lose of comfort .
