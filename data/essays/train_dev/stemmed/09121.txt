in fact , i totalt 100 % agre with that statement . while you are travil with your friend , ithink that you must chose a leadar for that trip for mani sevril reson : - 1 - the trip will be orgin . 2 - there will be much more fun . 3 - there will be no fight to where to go to . these are some of so mani reson . howev , i think that the leader should be fun and serios at the same time , becus that help to see mani place in the new town or citi that the group is visit . last but not least , i sujest to all the peopl whome want to visit a new countri or a new trip , that they should chose a leader to help the trip to went veri well , and that is my opinion .
