advertis sometim are just an inform that not show the true , it is just a way to show and offer the product . all the product have to have an advertis , but sometim thi kind of ad onli show the common rule that all the product must have . in my opinion advertis must show the true composit of the product , no matter if it signif a major cost for the compani who produc thi kind of product . advertis are veri import becaus they show us if that product is correct or no for our consum . i agre with most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , some product show qualiti that are n't true when you consum it , the onli thing that they concern it sell their product no matter if it is so good or no . they tri to hide some detail , and that detail can be harm for some peopl . a lot of peolpl ca n't consum some ingredi , for exampl a diabet person should n't tast sugar , but if an advertis do n't show the quantiti of sugar that the product have , thi product is harm for that person , even can caus an intox . i think we must creat a rule for advertis , all of the product should have a completi list of ingredi and the quantiti and qualiti of these , the product must be clasif . to conclud i can say that advertis sometim can be entertai but sometim can be cheer , all we have to do is look and tri to find the real purpos of the product .
