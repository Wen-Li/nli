i agre with thi statement base on my experi of travel . first of all if you contract a guid you can be sure that you are hire an expert in what you are a complet ignor and therefor he will do it , for sure , twice as good as you . to begin with a veri good reason of choos a guid we can say that it will be cheaper becaus he know the place and cost of the attract and in case you want to see a show that is held in two differ establish at the same time he could recommend you the cheaper , furthermor the decreas in other expens like lodg , food , etc. will sure yield that the money you are wast in your tourist guid will be less than the money you are save . other import reason is that you wo n't get lost , for exampl , onc when i visit barcelona i did n't want to get a guid becaus we onli had a few hour to stay in the town , my surpris wa when we almost lost half of the time look for a monument instead of take advantag of the amaz harbor or other event there . the last advantag of have thi person in a tourist group is that he know the citi and he will warn you of certain danger zone of the citi or disabl road , a person refer of thi reason ha happen to me a year ago when my famili and i went for vacat in seattl , we were walk in downtown without a guid and admir the amaz skyscrap of the citi when suddenli we realiz that it wa get dark , and of cours we did n't know that that zone inth night is a littl creepi ( of cours , no map warn you about that ) and when we decid to go back to the car we were in the middl of hundr of welfar peopl beg for money , fortun no disast happen to us but it wa a lesson that i will never forget . my conclus would be that a guid is best invest you can make in a tour
