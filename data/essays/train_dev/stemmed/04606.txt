i would definetli disagre with the statement `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . i have two reason for thi . one is becaus it is the thought that make a person enjoy their life or not , and the other is becaus eventhough i have onli live for 18year i have never hade a time that i thoght i enjoy my life more when i wa younger . i offten hear old peopl say that they enjoy their life more when they where young and when they could move more rapidli . howev i also heard a person say that they enjoy everi bit of their life sine the day of birth . i agre with thi person . the man said `` it is all in your mind , like or dislik , love or hate , enjoy or not . all that you think come from your mide . so you could find your life enjoy or not by how you think '' . what i notic from thi wa that the peopl that start to feel depress form the horror of gradual becom old , not abl to move or do someth that they use to be abl to do and etc are the one that believ young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . on the other hand the peopl that constantli think of new thing to do find them self enjoy their life . and anoth fact is that the depress could be cure by medic or modern scienc . in my case i know that i would go out and find new thing even when i get old . i might not be abl to walk without a stick or might even not be abl to get up from bed , but i know that by one chang of think everyth bore could be interest . in conclus , i beliv that old peol could enjoy their life as much , or more , than young peopl do . it is all about how you think and respond to your think . you could think all you want , but to make a diffrenc you would need to make some action .
