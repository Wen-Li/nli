i think it is true that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in my opinion it happen particularli dure spot on televis : in fact each of us can rememb that he brought someth becaus it wa introduc veri well , or becaus the spot wa realli nice or interest . it happen becaus the power of tv is too much strong , in fact each of us ha a tv and watch it everi day . all the reason that caus thi phenomenum concern busi , in fact industri use spot to convinc peopl that their product are veri use and they alway insist about the good qualiti of them . in my opinion sometim produc lie becaus they want to be richer and richer , but sometim they lie becaus they live in a critic econom period , even if i do n't want to justifi them . in fact we must consid that in the period of globalis a lot of product have gener a real invas of market all over the world , and it is veri difficult for industri to defend their product becaus the competit with other product is hard . about thi aspect we can rememb the most import new element of global econom , that is repres by the chines market . thi market through it low price caus a real crisi of modern economi and forc a lot of european or american industri to be more competit . as a result a lot of thi industri tri to send their product by do fals advertis about their qualiti . i think it is complet wrong becaus the custom alway want to buy faith product , characteris by a real good qualiti ; so if they are not satisfi by thing they buy , they will chang product immedi , particularli in the period of globalis , dure which you can find a big varieti of product .
