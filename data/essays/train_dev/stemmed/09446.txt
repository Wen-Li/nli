in my univers , besid our special there are differ subject we must take in order to graduat . for ani freshman student , ofcours he/sh will complain about these non-rel subject . but , when they finish their studi they will realiz the reason whi our univers ha done it , like i did . i agre with the statement say that `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' for sever reason . first of all , have a wide knowledg of mani academ subject would give one the power of face ani problem in the societi later when one garduat or even befor . secondli , that knowledg would give one a great apprortun to find the job he/sh would like to be in not nessari link to the academ special . a comput engin student , for exampl , attend differ class in design and program would give him/her better chanc in find a job than if he/sh did not attend these class . almost all job manag are look for peopl with mani differ skill in differ aspect of the life than an excel comput engin who doe not know how to deal with custom or collegu . most import reason , is that attend differ class with differ peopl in each class mean that one will get to meet mani peopl in hi acadm life . thi well help everi student to gain more experi for futur work life . learn how to deal with other is a veri import skill , becaus all job are bais mainlli on deal with the manag , deal with teammat if one is work in team project and so on . in conclus , i think all student should have wide knowledg of mani academ subject than stick to onli one subject even if they are not requir to take differ subject becaus it will help them a lot in their futur live .
