in japan , where i live , mani peopl think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . howev , i believ that the best way to travel is in a individu without tour guid for the follow reason . most importantli , travel led by a tour guid is bore becaus i can not plan the schedul of travel by myself . for exampl , i travel europ in individu 7 year ago when i wa a senior of tokyo univers . i travel with mr tamaki who wa my friend of the same tenni club of my univers . we travel around europ for 1 month to germani , itali , switherland , franc , and unit kingdom . we had not made the schedul fix befor the departur from japan and enjoy free travel without be bound to schedul . when we went sightse of old castl in germani , we becam veri much favorit of it and stay long time there . howev the japanes group led by a tour guid who we met on the castl had to leav there for short time becaus of fix scheldul and the look so sorri . i decid that i would never travel with tour guid on that time . second , i can not meet the new peopl other than the group if i am travel led by a tour guid . for exampl , i travel with thailand with my wife thi summer without tour guid . we met a coupl from canada who are almost same year old as us at samui of thailand . we got on the same boat to samui and becam a veri good friend . we are keep in tough with them after come back to japan . if i went travel in a group with tour guid , i can onli talk with the member of the group and there are much less oppotun to meet with peopl from other countri . in conclus , i prefer travel in individu without tourguid rather than travel in a group led by a tour guid .
