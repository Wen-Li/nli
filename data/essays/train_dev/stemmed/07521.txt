base on my travel experi , i would say that , inde , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . by travel with an experienc person , you learn from that person 's knowledg of the place , and you are abl to develop a deep and intellig opinion about what you see and experi while travel . two year ago , i visit new york with my famili , and i wa surpris by the great differ between travel on your won or with a tour guid . while we were travel on our own around the citi , we realiz that we were onli wander in the street , look at the tall build , but not learn anyth interest about the citi ; besid , without an appropi knowledg of the citi , we had a lot of problem in tri to find our hotel after we walk some street . the next day , we decid to pay a tour guid in order to learn more about the citi and it most import tourist spot . with the help of the tour guid , we were abl to know more about the citi 's stori , import place , good restaur , and mani other use fact that we would ignor if we had continu our self-guid and ignor travel . travel with a group led by a tour guid sure ha more benefit than just avoid get lost in the street : you learn more about the fact , the secret and the essenc of the place you visit . anoth exampl i can mention to reinforc my opinion about tour guid is the trip i made with my famili to china last year . as i said befor , with the help of a tour guid you can develop a deep and intellig opinion about the place you visit . when we arriv to thi asian countri , i had the idea that we were go to find poor peopl live under a communist regim ; after we travel some time by ourselv , my opinion about thi communist countri did n't chang . howev , when we took our tour around beij , the guid began to explain the current situat of the countri from the chines perspect . i wa surpris by the signific knowledg i acquir about the chines cultur after hear the tour guid 's opinion of her countri and the inform she had regard the situat of communist china . after learn from thi new perspect , which i may not have notic without a tour guid , i wa abl to chang my point of view about china , and to develop a more critic and intellectu opinion about the chines cultur and current econom , polit and social situat . after travel in new york and china in a group led by a tour guid , i reaffirm my opinion about travel about thi kind of trip . i hold my posit of complet accept for guid travel . if we had not had the help of a tour guid , my famili and me would never have been abl to visit new york as a true new yorker or to learn from the chines cultur from a reliabl and origin sourc , an authent chines tour guid .
