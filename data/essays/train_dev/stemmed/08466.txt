i disagre with thi statment becaus each compani , organis , factori , which made advertis in newspap have mani parpos , the most import one is to collect a larg number of money from coustom in order to achiv that the peopl work on that place should be true in what they said or if they are not mani peopl will buy their product for onc a time becaus they will find it differ from the one they read about in the newspap so a finnanci problem will be occur . but i thought that there is a few organ make advertis do not tell the real thing about thier product and sucssed , if we want to search for the reasult that they sucss for you will find that it is not becaus the advertis itself but from where the advertis is publish , becaus you know the advertism which appear in mani place mani and mani peopl will see it and they will be surpris for that prefect adject in that product then they will buy it and in the end theywil find the differ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my last obinian came from an experi , one day i watch in the tv an advertism about shampoo which call `` head and shoulder '' which said the thi sort of shampoo will make your hair shine , comfort , grow well , veri beauti smell , clean , keep the the colour of your hair when you die it and with veri littel price , after that i went to bye it and when i made a shwar evri thing wa correct excpet that it keep your hair colour when you use it as after i use it for one month all my hair colour chang . but in arab countri that could happen becau
