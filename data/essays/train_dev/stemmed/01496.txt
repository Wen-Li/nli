i agre with the statement becaus i think that young peopl have more opportun in life . three major point convinc me that life as a young person ha more to offer . at first the bodi of young peopl allow much more stress , therebi offer the possibl for variou activ . for exampl you can enjoy most sport and other leisur activ without endang yourself physic . you are also sound enough to travel for a longer time like for exampl fli to far away contin wherea you might not be abl to do that anymor from a specif age on becaus of medic problem such as a low blood pressur . as a second point life as a young person offer numer option for your futur both in social and profession view . you may have date and can search for the boy or girl of your dream unless you have not met a marriag partner yet . addit you can choos the career that suit your person prefer and even more import , you might tri out more than one profess becaus of your young age . these variou choic may make you feel happi becaus you can look forward to your futur . the last veri import point is that you do not have so much respons while be young . as an older person you might have to care for a famili or employe , thi may gener stress and make you depend to certain place or peopl . when you are young , you might move to anoth citi or even countri more easili . you are also allow to make mistak becaus you have time to tri it again and grow with the challeng . not everyth that you do ha to be reason , for exampl buy an expens car or have a danger hobbi like parachut or whitewater-raft . i am certain that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus of their advantag like good health , mani option and less responsibilti to take care off .
