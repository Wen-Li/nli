some peopl think that the youth nowaday are not interst in heip their commun . howev , i stongli disagre with that opinion , for the follow reason . first , a lot of young peopl includ colleg student and secondari school student are forc to help other by their school . most of the publich school have a regul about the obligatori volunt hour and they encoug student to experi to help peopl who are in need . in my case , to graduat both secondari school and univers i had to do the obligatori volunt . thi is not a good case becaus there 's no my will but it can be help to experi and can give some motiv to student . to meet the need of the school curriculum , i had to do volunt work for local commun when i wa a secondari school student . even though it wa obligatori experi , i could take part in commun program and i came to be interest in local problem and other peopl who are in need . moreov , these day a increa number of young peopl would like to particip in volunt work . they paricip in their commun problem by join some organ such as extra-curricular club in campu or non-government organ . through the organ , i have been abl to be a mentor to a young crimin who ha been under the probat by ministri of justic . when i want to join that program , i wa surpris by see a lot of univers student who appli for thi organ to be a volunt work . nowaday , a lot of organ set up and they are manag by lot of volunt worker . we need to keep watch their behavior . even though , they could start the volunt work to meet the school need , it can be last becaus of their strong will .
