car have been vey import sinc they were import . at the first time not mani peopl could afford it , but now most of the popul own , unless , one . howev , in the last year we have been told mani bad news about the enviro . car consum petrol and then it burn in order to make the car work . the result of thi activ affect a lot to the atmospher . the ultraviolet ray are enter in our sistem , cross all the cover of the atmospher . the enviro is veri pollut , and as a result of thi anim are desapear . anyway , car help in thi situat as well as the human be action . in the news they recomend us to take the bu in spite of drive everybodi their car . if that idea work the enviro would improv . besid , anim are n't the onli one that are affect , human can suffer mani injuri , for exampl problem when they breath or even it can be seriouli affect to the sight . moreov , block of flat are part of the problem of polltion , mani hous look dirti what that 's a consequ of the pollut . from my point of view i think that if in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than today that mean that peopl will start to take care of the enviro . not use the car constantli as much as we do now impli less pollut . although car not onli affect to atmospher with the pollut . there are so mani reason whi i agre with the statement . car are veri nois and much if they are in a traffic jam and they are in a hurri . when they start shout to each other . that 's not good for the peopl who is everi day hear thi unconfort nois . in a long time thi can caus mani health problem such as stress or even heart problem . final , i wolud n't like to forget say that the less car in use are in the street the more bu driver will be , that mean that there will we less unemploy peopl .
