are there differ in enjoy in life comapar young peopl and those of whom are older at age ? well , i think that is a question that depend on a person or differ background in which the person came from . howev , i do think that a more younger person will have the advantag in enjoy and have fun in life becaus they have less to worri about . when a person becom older they are more awar and warn of person and social problem , at school , friendship , grade and so on . what i thought wa the most difficult , while grow up to be a pre-teenag wa that i had to conform with other and i had to use the right choic of word . when you are littl you have limit thought of how your word may affect other and how you accept differ , but when you grow up , you may be discrimin and segrig becaus of your skin color and the cloth you wear , or the way you look . these problem caus you to worri more and be less out go . it can also caus you to be depress and make you choos the wrong choic in life . at school , not just young adolec but also colleg and univers student have stress up on manag their time to complet and hand in their assign in on time . with the grow stress , you can find yourself caught up on homework and write essay , which prevent you from have free time to spend for your like and enjoy . when you becom older you have to worri about mannag your deadlin at work , how you are go to pay the bill , conform with your co-work and more social problem along with person stress . with all of these stress and `` things-to-do '' go on , i do n't think that you will be abl to enjoy your life so much as well as a younger person with less stress and less work would .
