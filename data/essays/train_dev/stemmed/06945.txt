some peopl say that there will be fewer car in featur . but i disagre with that oppinion i think there will be more car than there are today . first , from the begin of car manifactur , the number of car have been incres . and there is no histori that number of car is decreasd that id first reason whi i think number of car will not decreas . secondli the affect of car are increas . today when peopl go sonewher they use car more than other public tranceport . becus go out by car is more convenion . and peopl want convenion more and more . and their is no altern to car . mayb you will say air craft , but there have to have to be wide land to aircraft to put on . but i think it will there will be less land in futur than now . anoth reason is that willb more popul in twenti year later than today . so as number of peopl grower , it will also grow number of car , peopl want . and in twenti year , car will develop more and more . and abil of human will grow . and if li that happen , gorven will lower the limit of age , which peopl can drive . like reason abov , i insist that there will be more number of car in twenti year than today .
