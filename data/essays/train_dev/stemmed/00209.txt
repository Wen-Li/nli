in gener , there are a lot of way of think about thi topic and we have to say that it depend on situat . but if given the choic and i have to choos , i 'd like to think that the idea in the statement is not accept for me from sever reason . first of all , as older peopl have gotten much more amount of knowledg and experi so far , life of those peopl would be certainli more an enjoy thing than that of young peopl . if consid one same phenomenon , for exampl the incid occur in intern diplomaci , the death or birth of their rel , or anyth , the feel or knowledg older peopl have is so deep and quantit . anoth reason that come readili to mind is that older peopl definit treat their live as more preciou thing than young peopl . compar with the time left for young peopl , the time left for older peopl is small . sinc older peopl have onli such littl time as their rest of life , i think older peopl must treat their time as preciou thing . of cours , i ca n't help admit that there are other reason which enabl us to think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . one specif reason that strike me is that it can be said that young peopl can feel more interest or can be more impress than older peopl even about the same incid . in jubvenil period , young peopl may be more sensit and can get more incis feel becaus such a period in human life usual make peopl be more sensit . if we consid the abov factor as the most import thing , we may say that young peopl enjoy life more . but on care consider , i think the posit factor in my opinion can offset and exceed the neg factor . actual , i 'm from japan . in my countri , there is one specif cultur that we should honor the older and we all want to and plan on becom affluent and hapi in the period when we becom older peopl . of cours , although everybodey in the world think as same way , the thought toward thi purpos is much stronger in my countri . as a proof of thi idea , the save rate in my countri ha been the first place for long period in the world . thi verifi our storong incent toward thi purpos . i think thi idea is corect . i do n't want to sent poor and destitud life in my senior life . consid all of the abov factor , although there are mani way of think , i 'd like to choos the idea that older peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl .
