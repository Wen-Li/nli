to make a statement , that in twenti year there will be fewer car then are today , a person would need to be complet unawar of the current scenario in automobil develo . henc , i strongli disagre with the abov statement . the modern automot stori is one that is spend a lot of money on research and develop of variou new technolog that will ensur the minimum use of petroleum as their energi sourc . although the current notion about the futur of automobil is that onc the suppli of crude oil / petroleum is exhaust in the next 50 year , all these car will have to be taken off the road . the abov reason may be true onli if the current level of develop is stop right now . there are consider number of newer strategi that have alreadi been develop like ` fuel cell ' , ` batteri power vehicl ' to counter the loss of petroleum run vehicl . these technolog are alreadi in their test phase of develop , and prototyp have alreadi been run effici . due to the eco-friendli natur of these car , it is reciev consider amount of support from variou organ . thi support ha contribut highli to the develop of such alternate/hybrid technolog vehicl . further more , look at the growth of world popul , number of peopl that will use ani kind of convey to travel daili , easili surpass all imagin . the growth of new world economi like brazil , india , china , is produc more number of rich peopl by the day . the averag global spend power of peopl have increas over the year and one can easili consid that thi growth will continu for the year to come . thi spend power give peopl the advantag of choos their own lifestyl - and an automobil is one of the most import part of a comfort lifestly . henc , i believ that the assumpt , that there will be fewer car in use twenti year from now than there are today , is not justifi . accord to me , we may assum that the older car , technolog will be sure be phase out by better altern in the come year . the number of car in use should defin go up than the current number as the number of peopl commut daili and their need keep rise .
