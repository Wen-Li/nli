to my mind , i think young and old peopl enjoy life from differ way . first of all , it is true that young peopl enjoy life becaus they are veri optimist . . they do not take care about problem of the world ; they just onli leav their life . . for instanc , at the age of 20 , young peopl like me are veri happi . we think that we are invinc and we think that in the futur we will not have problem like our parent for exampl . then , a lot of peopl and not onli young peopl , think that have 20 is a good thing , thi is the best period . . thi is the age of love , sexual experi , jod experi , holiday experi without parent . .. in fact , it is the age of discov . .. everyth is new and interest . .. so there is no way for young peopl to learn about life , onli just by enjoy life . but if young peopl enjoy life , there is also old peopl who enjoy it . that 's true . .. when old peopl retir from their job , they have a lot of moment for them . .. they can travel . .. they are not oblig to wake up everi morn in order to go to work . .. and most of the time , they enjoy life more than youger peopl . for exampl , my grand mother is veri happi to be in the categori of the old peopl . .. when she wa young , she could not travel becaus she had to work . .. and befor , life wa not the same as nowaday . .. but today , with her associ of her subburb , she can travel where she want . .. in addit , sinc she 's retir from her job , she ha travel everi where ; egypt , spain , itali , turkey . .. and so on . .. she travel a lot . .. and a lot of retir peopl or old peopl are in thi case . .. so we can say that to be old it is a sort of a second life where peopl discov again some thing , where they learn again about technolog , scienc , cultur , and also about young peopl . . so , in conclus , we can say that there is not a lot of differ between young and old peopl and personnali , i have never met a personn who did not enjoy life . i use is to say life is beauti so enjoy it . ..
