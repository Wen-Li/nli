i agre with the statment that young poepl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i have some reason to support my opinion . first , young poepl is more energet in ani kind of activ than older peopl . second , young poepl ha more chanc to studi mani subject , for exampl in univers or privat school . third , young peopl can make mani friend and have mani ecperi in and out of the countri . young poepl is more energet in mani activ than old peopl . in gener , old peopl ha a lot of money to spend compar with young poepl especi those still stude in high school or univers . although old peopl might be abl to get pension for send money , they are too old to go out and do some activ in commun . or simpli , they are too busi to take care the famili or hous . young poepl is veri activ in mani kind of activ . they join a tenni club , go to languag school and do some volunt work . if young peopl do n't have money , they normal earn money from part-tim job . young poepl ha more chanc to studi mani subject , for exampl in univers or privat school . in japan , when you want to studi in univers , you have age limit to be univers student . it is also said that when you are young , it is more chanc to remembr and studi well . young peopl can make mani friend and have mani experi in and out of countri . young peopl ha more good access to meet mani peopl . you can go to abroad , you can have good experi . but when you get old , you tend to be stay home and watch tv whole day . from abov reason , i agre with the satement that young poepl enjoy life more than old peopl do .
