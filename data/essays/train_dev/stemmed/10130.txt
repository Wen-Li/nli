the thesi that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do is a quit gener statement , which requir to be examin . firstli it is import to point out which thing are requir to enjoy a human 's life . to my mind even thi question can not be anwer in an object way becaus most requir differ from human to human . when we take a look at the exampl of have or earn a lot of money even there are differ among the peopl . for one person it is veri import to have a well-paid job for anoth it is not . in addit to that the opinion about what is a well-paid job or what is a lot of money are quit differ . but let us have a look at the exampl of be healthi . mayb it can be state that a good health is an univers requir to enjoy life . to my mind there is nearli a uniti in the opinion of peopl about the import of health to have fun in life . despit of the fact that it can not be gener state what good health is and when somebodi is ill or not let me use health as an exampl for a gener requir to enjoy life . base on thi assumpt it is difficult to say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus all peopl at ani age can have fun in their live in relat to their physic abil . mayb it is not possibl for an old grandfath to be the fastest in a 100-meter-run , but instead of thi he can do a lot of other thing like go on a long journey or write book or essay . a lot of young peopl do not have enough time to enjoy these thing . on the other hand an older person is limit in hi action by hi physic abil ( see the exampl of the 100-meter-run ) . but thi can also happen to a disabl young person who is not abl to walk . all in all i must say that it is not correct to claim that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , becaus there are so mani differ among all peopl .
