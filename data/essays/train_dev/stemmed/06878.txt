accod to my opinion young peopl do enjoy life more than old peopl do . the first reason that support my opinion is the age factor . young peopl are free from troubl or fear that come with old age . talk about the fear , i mean the fear of death and the fear of physic ailment that come with old age . although old peopl are free from the basic respons of life but still they cant enjoy their freedom from responsibilit the way they want or deserv becaus of thier old age and the problem that come with it . young peopl live with energi and a youth and posit attitud toward life . even though they have respons and goal to achiev , but still they are alway fill with energi and an attitud to achiev what they want from life . thi is becaus they are free from all the barrier that come hand in hand with old age . these barrier discourag old peopl from enjoy life to the fullest . they are nomor in a mental and physic situat to accept challeng in life . they are not capabl of set goal in life and thi inturn keep them away from the ecstaci and joy of achiev a goal that younger peopl have the abil to enjoy . anoth point of view would be the advanc in technolog and the gener gap . the older genrat is still suffoc in the claw of orthodox and conserv idea which also stop them from enjoy life to full extent . they are also unawar of the technolog improv that have taken place and are also not readi to identifi with them . they still want to stand by their old orthodox tradit and dont open themselv to the fresh breez of today world . they want to keep a close mind and dont want to breath in the fresh air of the modern world . all these factor act as big barrier in the way of their enjoy .
