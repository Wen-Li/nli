for a comun it is realli imporp that a lot of peopl help for free otherwis a commun can not exist . to clear what i am write about i will state first differ possibl where young peopl can help in thier commun and then answer whi they do it or not . in everi commun there are church where young peopl can help . a church contain peopl of all age and young peopl can help senior in a varieti of file as for exampl carri home their borrow thing or drive them home . young peopl can also help thier commun by partizip in a parti and tri to chang the polit in a new more effect direct . if young peopl can identifi themselv neither with a church nor with a polit parti the can partizip in social activ in gener . at first i would like to stress that not all young peopl do not give enough time for activi help the commun . on the other hand i am sure that there are too less young peopl help thier commun . a problem for most young peopl have is that they have to focu on school or univers in order to get a job in the end . mani young peopl do not partizip in the three possibl way state abov becaus they do not see consider . they are work for free and give away a lot of time and in the end most of the time no one pay attent for these perform activ . it is a huge compenporay problem that what count most is the degre from school or univers and social activ doe not get attent . i learn it by me own that anoth graduat pupil got a certif for good mark without havong done ani social activieti in hi commun . the other pupil who had nearli as good mark as he had did not get a prize for that . the societi should honour more social activ . even when appli for univers the student should have the possibili to show the social activ they have perform in the past . the circumst which may led to the situat whi too may young peopl help are that do not know where to go to when they are will to help . church and polit parti do not attract everyon . most of the young peopl may not just go to a hospit and ask there if they need ani help . i think the school and univers should offer more possibl for young peopl perform social work like instal a socail day where all student work togeth for the communitiy . the parent should wake up the social side of their child as earli as possibl . when the children see that the partent perform social activ for the commun it will engag them to partizip more . the last possibl reason whi too less young peopl help their commun is that the older peopl think that the young peopl are not reliabl enough for socail activ and do not give the young peopl the possibiliy to work for their commun . a chang of societi wil chang the young peopl ' behaviour an will bring us to the best we should start the chang .
