i disagre to thi statement . in my opinion the younger peopl should be the one give up their time up to the commun that are have a hard time . younger peopl are more in to thing but not in partisap in support peopl . whi ? i say becaus there is no benefit for themselv to collect . i think we should sponcer to the help-out like hand them out drink and bread . also the reason might be becaus they do n't realli know how much those help - need peopl are suffer . and for that i think it would be an awsom idea to set up an comerci for the peopl who do n't know the help need peopl situat . or we can use the idea from my homeland , south korea . in my countri student start from middl school have to fill out hour contribut to other . middl school student from the first year to the second have to fill out the total of 60 hour . they do thi by go to school that have student whose life is hard from their birth or by clean out area that we all own like park , pick trash from street and etc . i do n't think it 's a bad idea by let the student know how it is wonder contribut to our citi thi way . although these 60 hour effect you from go high school i got to know the wonder of contribut toour comunitiy like thi . i am a middl school third year student right now and i assur you thi is a great way to get young peopl stand up to thi . at first at my first year i wa stuborn about thi with my other classmat becaus it is hard work . and i too , say at first i onli ment to do thi kind of stuff becaus it wa requir in my grade . what made me chang my mine wa one of the experi i had . i sign up to go to one of the school that have student ` not like us ' . at first i wa afraid of them . that thought chang when i wa clean the window . one of that school student came up to me say hello in a weird way . but as hour past by i learn that that student wa interest in be friend with me . i guess becaus they came up to me differn i did n't realli know at first . well , that the case a me . i am hop to open a volunt club when i grow up , so i 'm hop these idea would work in the futur .
