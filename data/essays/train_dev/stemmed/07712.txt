enjoy the life ha noth to do with age , as a matter of fact , i know peopl whose age would reflect no enjoy of life at all but that in the other hand demonstr that enjoy life is better explain by the will to live . young peopl have misunderstand about what enjoy the life realli is . enjoy a day , enjoy a piec of cake , or just the blue of the sky and the evergreen three of your hous , enjoy the sensat we experi within everyday , love , lust , sad , etc. is sometim more deligth than tri to impress other one by do crazi thing or by just lead to the drug or alcohol that are nowaday commonli referenc as enjoy the life for young peopl . even enjoy life is not basic age determin , there are also situat on wich a person may have a tremend physic or phsycolog impedi that may result on be torn apart from the rejoyc of life , but even among these peopl onc someon told me about a stori where two sick peopl are on the same hospit room , but just one got the opportun to see trough the window , so everyday , the one that had no possibl to see trough the window ask the other one to tell him about what wa happen on the outer world . with great level of detail the person near the window alway use to tell about how nice wa the weather outsid , about how pretti wa a young girl that most of the time use to pass by the street , and so on thi man use to describ even the leav from the three that chang toghet with the season . unfortun thi man pass away and the other man unwil to see anyth request to be chang to the bed near the window , and so it happen , but terribl and great at the same time wa hi surpris when he saw trough that window , and could just see a wall , a huge wall that made it imposs to see anyth . so harsh is thi lectur that must help us to understand that enjoy life is up to one 's self , it ha noth to do with age , nor impedi , it is just a matter of will to live , desir to reach happi .
