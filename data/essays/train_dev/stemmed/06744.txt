i agre that most advertis make a product seem much better than they realli are . these day the advertis ha becom so popular that some peopl even have thi belief that they can not sell a product at all with out advertis it on televis or radio or wall poster . the first and the foremost thing in most of the advertis industri is present someth bigger better or unrealist than the usual product . these day there are advertis for everyth from a mole hill to a mountain . and thee day with the advanc in media ( radio , televis , internet ) the advertis ha becom so easi and so effect that it is deliv to each and everi person and who encount that adveris tend to buy that product . they are so impres . even if we go to a ga station there is a discount , for cloth , for medicin ,,,,, for everi thing there is some bonu ( so call ) to the custom , which is just , in my opinion is , anoth startegi to improv their busi and get profit . the other day i wa walk on a street and i see that on the other side of a road there is thi man bege with a note in hi hand `` need food '' and wen i look at him and tri to walk away he had taken out anoth note with '' need booz '' and ask me to give him some money for what ever note i like for . he realli advertis more than hi need or show someth to other which isnt true . he ha money bu it just that he doesnt want to work at all . here is anoth incid , i saw thi advertis in the news paper state that there is a store wide discount with a note on the front of the shop `` out of busi store close after 15 day '' and i went there . i like some shoe and bought them . after a month when i go to buy someth els in the same street i see the shop is still there . and i talk to one of my friend , who is in to market , told me that these are some kind of busi tactic they play . the most import thing is that the compani who advertis should recognis that the peopl dont mind the advertis , if it realli genun . i i have seen mani advertis in the news paper and televis state that loos weight and witha pictur of befor the treatment and after the treatment ( pictur taken sideway ) . and some wid befor and after treatment for hair implant or regenr . they say it is realli successful in most patient and if you go to them state that it ha not been success for me they blame you . they tell you that you are not the one who ha done the excersis properli or didnt take the medic regularli . i also agre that there is some genun advertis but we can hardli get to see that these day . due to these advertis strategi , over a period of time , peopl will realis that it of no use to fall in the trap of those advertis . and im sure the advertis will come up with some other solut for it , after all they will have to sell their product and we will have to buy product . i guess it will just go on . .. , ... and may be in futur they might advertis it genun ( the way it is ) , but as of now my option is that i agre that most of the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
