the number of car is a problem nowaday . it 's a problem becaus reserv of petrol are go to be smaller and smaller and becaus of thism the price of petrol is grow and grow . nowaday , the environment question is veri popular in european countri and car are consid as a veri bad element for the environ 's health . so , in my opinion , in twenti year , the number of car in europ , japan and unit state will be lower . but , in my opinion , car will be fewer in twenti year than today in develop countri ( in poorer countri ) like african countri or south american countri becaus for them , car still a veri import element fort the economi growth . peopl of those countri use a lot their car in order to go to their job wherea , in countri which are alreadi develop and rich , peopl use to take the subway , buse and the tramway . but , becaus the poorer polut repres a big part of the worldwid popul , if all those peopl are go to have a car , the wodldwid nu ; ner of car will dra ; atic grow . there is also the problem of the lobbi . the car lobbi is veri i ; portant in the unit state of america so , they will not allow the american govern to make a law about the number of car per famili . so if some peopl would like to make the nu ; ber of car smaller , they will be in conflict with politician and the lobbi . in ; y opinion , in twenti year , there will be a terribl struggl between the environment proctector and car constructor ( gener motor , ford , vw . .. ) . i 'm veri sure that green peac will be a more and more import organis becaus who doe n't want to take care of our environ ? in my opinion , the number of car can be also smaller in twenti year becaus circul 's problem are terribl in big citi such as pari or nyc . that 's whi nowaday , car are forbidden in the center of london . becaus of thi interdict , i 'm veri sure that a big part of londonian sell their car and did n't buy a new one . car becom useless in london . i heard also that pari would like to make the same . is n't that an evid of the fact that the number of car in europ is go to be smaller . as a conclus , we cam say that in some part of the world , in twenti year , car will be fewer but in an other part , their number is go to be less import .
