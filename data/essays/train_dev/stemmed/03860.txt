in the next twenti year , the number of car use will decreas in the more develop part of the world , where it will increas in the less develop countri , i believ . the reason whi i a behold such a viewpoint is due to take into consider firstli , the nation state 's control of their countri 's public transport polici and secondli , the fact that the thirld world or develop countri are get more and more domain of exploit for the huge transnat corpor ( tnc ) in our contemporari world . in other word , on the one hand while the more develop countri are put forward legisl that favour more their public and their secur , the less develop countri , tend to be more vulner to the harsh effect of the liber capitalist economi . in other word , they tend to get more attract to the advertis that are shown on televis , where due to these countri ' peopl lack of educ , as well as the weak govern polici ( as a result of weak nation state ) they get tempt to drive carswher the public transport is rather poor . let me tri to clarifi my point by compar my observ of two countri , that is , sweden and turkey . as sweden is a more develop countri in econom term and ha accordingli a social state that serv for the benefit of it peopl , the public transportaion is use huge ; especi the underground and the buss . howev , it is not just the use of these public transport but also the avail and qualiti of he servic that is provid by the state , which is a factor that count for the reason whi swedish peopl prefer to use the public transport more than the privat own car . on the other hand , although in turkey the public transport is get develop especi in the two big citi , that is , ankara and istanbul , it is still noth compar to sweden . the buss do not have a timet as in sweden or the railway is not as long and the line are not as mani as in sweden , which as a result make peopl want to own and use car insta of public transport . howev , apart from such a case , it also hold true that in turkey peopl believ that nice look car affect their social statu ( as the educ level is rather law ) . in conclus , the suggest that the use of car will be use less is not a `` black '' and `` white '' answer . it depend on the social , econom and polit condit of a countri as well as it statu within the global polit economi .
