i disagre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do n't give enough time to help their commun . rather , young peopl today are a dynam forc bring chang to the commun and nation they live in , especi here in south korea . first , young peopl involv in the commun have transform polit , most notabl in the 2003 presidenti elect . second , youth are play a major role in jeju island , help to get the island recogn as a unesco world cultur heritag site . third , young korean are help the nation in it 's geograph name disput with japan . for these reason , it 's not accur to say that the young gener is n't involv in the commun . young peopl have brought the wind of chang to polit in south korea . in the 2003 presidenti elect , conserv lee hoi-chang wa pois to win the elect , lead in all the newspap poll . young peopl , whose voter turnout had tradit been quit weak , support the progress candid roh moo-hyun while the older gener support lee . the old gener also had higher voter particip , so lee wa consid a shoe-in by mani . howev , 2 week befor elect day , mostli 20 - and 30-someth campaign activist for roh moo-hyun campaign for free in mani local commun throughout the countri . the decis factor wa the young gener ' use of the internet to bring far-flung commun togeth onlin . the result wa a come-from-behind victori for pre . roh moo hyun . thi never would have been possibl without the work of youth polit involv in the commun . second , youth in jeju island , south korea are the vanguard of the environment movement there . in 2002 , jeju island wa design as a unesco biospher reserv becaus of the uniqu of halla mountain , the highest peak in south korea . thi design came about due to a signatur campaign conduct by the jeju feder for the environ , a quasi-stud organ run by youth . also , the same young peopl are push to have jeju island recogn as a unesco world cultur heritag site in 2007 . these youth are have a huge effect on jeju island , help it to becom more internationally-known . final , youth in korea are help a larg commun , the nation of korea , in it disput with japan over the name of the east sea/sea of japan . up until the mid - to late-1990 's , no one in the world ever question the name of the sea to the east of korea , also known as the sea of japan . japan unilater name the ocean between korea and japan dure it coloni occup of korea in the earli 20th centuri . howev , thank to the effort of student and youth , thi name began to be challeng . student particip in an internet campaign to lobbi offici of intern geograph name societi to reconsid the name ` sea of japan . ' becaus of the overwhelm respons from korean , mostli the young , the intern geograph name bodi chang the name from sea of japan to east sea/sea of japan on nautic navig chart . thi would never have been possibl were it not for the effort of korean youth in the intern and nation commun . there are some who underestim the particip of youth in their commun , but the realiti is that youth are have a major impact on their commun through polit , environment , and intern activ . youth are import member as well as futur inheritor of their commun .
