i am absolut certain that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in fact , it is the motiv of the peopl who are creat the advertis to influenc the peopl and creat a perfect imag of a certain product . i will give two reason and exampl to underlin my opinion . the first point i would like to make is about tv spot and their style of influenc . by make a nice spot it is possibl to present a certain product in the way the produc want to . some time ago , for exampl , i saw an advertis about a tooth past with a whiten effect . in the spot a beauti woman , titl as the wife of a dentist , told me about her experi with thi tooth past . i could see her wonder white teeth and wa veri impress . next day i bought thi tooth past and hope to get more white teeth as soon as possibl . unfortun , yet my teeth have not chang into a more white colour and i guess i wa influenc by thi spot , which made the tooth past better than it actual is . secondli , i would like to refer to prospect about hotel . to present a product nice , photo can be suffici , too . i suppos , almost everybodi onc ha read such a prospect and wa impress about all the nice photo . on the photo , everi lobbi is modern and friendli , the swim pool seem to be veri big and the room are with balconi , plant , nice sofa and chair . howev , these photo mostli onli show the best part of the hotel . of cours , they do not present a complet impress , includ the more unrepres part . thu , these prospect creat an impress of the hotel which present them better than they realli are . as a conclus i would like to underlin that advertis are not forc to show the truth . it is obviou , that the produc of advertis take thi chanc to influenc the peopl impress of certain product .
