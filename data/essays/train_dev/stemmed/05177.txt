succ is a commum goal of everi one . but the definit of success and a success person differ a lot . some peopl think that succ is a logic and a natur consequ of a well done job , but other defend the idea that onli peopl who dare could be success . in my own point of view , i am partial agre with the first statement . in fact , to suc we do not need to be especi smart . and the success of what we do depend rather on the occur and the persever of our trial than on our willeng to take risk or on our curios . we have sever exampl of success stori of ordinari peopl that excel in their tradit job and reach fame and wealth by offer their custom a usual product but with better qualiti . and that reli on their own experi and know-how it mean that their success wa due to the fact of do well what they alreadi know how to do . thi point of view doe not exclud the fact that a lot of peopl have knew success by take risk or by tring new thing , way or method : it is larg admit that the dare , the courag and the curios of pioneer and scientist permit to the human to make great step in the way of prosper and developp . also discoveri and invent will be imposs without a touch of imagin and risk . in conclus , i can say that a success is a sweet meal that need , as ingredi , a bit of risk , a few of curios and a lot of know-how and a well done job .
