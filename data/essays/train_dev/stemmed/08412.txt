educ of student is veri import so we have to be careful . some peopl think understand idea and concept are more import than learn fact . howev , i disagre with that and i think not onli student but also adult must develop themselv with fact . peopl must be realist ; thi make peopl more successful and powerful . firstli , i think school should produc more realist peopl and sinc child had start primari school thi educ ha been start . realist peopl can be more successful as we can see in histori . for exampl , napalyon buenopart , wa intelig and realist . he ha seem alway realist sinc he born to now . as we can see three of hi word ; a person had came to talk with napolyon when he wa go the war , and he ask ` whi they alway do war ! ' and he answer ` money , money , money ' . i think it is a veri good exampl for a successful realist person . on the other hand we can see in histori fail peopl who were dreamer . mani kominist are veri good exampl for that . they live for idea and concept and they can not do anyth for peac or ani good thing for human . howev , other peopl who were realist are all written in histori book . as i can see it one pictur from my sit when i am write my essay , ataturk who is the founder of the turkish republ . he wa certainli realist becaus even ottoman empir 's dreamer behavior and forc on all peopl , he behav realist and establish thi modern countri . he knew where turkey wa and where other were , and he tri to develop like other develop countri such as europen and american in conculus , i think childeren must grow up with fact if they want to be a successful person and becaus of that we must educ them in that way .
