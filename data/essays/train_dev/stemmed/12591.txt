nowaday , the world is move at such a fast pace that it would be veri difficult for me to agre or disagre on whether car can becom fewer , sinc i ca n't predict what kind of turn the futur can take . so mani technolog and variou invent are take place that it is defin possibl for the car to be fewer in anoth twenti year . car have becom such a necess in our daili live that , i feel that car could probabl never ceas to be fewer as life goe on . car have brought such a big impact on our live that it would be imposs to think of a life without car and basic transport . car are our way of life - a necess , which we on ani given circumst ca n't live without . our life , theseday , revolv around go from one place to anoth , transport good and other facil and other variou activ connect with transport . to think that twenti year from now there could be fewer car on our road , than there are today is not imposs , it is defin a possibl as the world is progress and come up with so much newer and vari form of technolog and idea . it would defin be a big misinterpret of the fact - that the world is n't move on , if i would say that car can not be replac by someth much more sophist and effici for our daili live . in today 's world , noth is imposs . there is alway a possibl for the human mind to come up with anyth imposs . so come up with a replac mode of transport would n't be too diffcult . therefor , i would say , that mayb not twenti year from now , but defin somewher in the futur there will be a good and effici replac for our car , thu result in fewer car on our road .
