in twenti year the number of car is increas . i agre with thi statement becaus is true that peopl have more car than few year ago . in my opnion the invent of the car wa the most import invent in all the human life . from the begin of the twenti centuri car becam an import way to move but initi wa use onli by rich peopl while the other peopl use hors . after mani year thi invent becam so import that today is imposs to find a peopl that ha not hi car . and thi situat could be interpris as a posit situat becaus if all peopl ha a person car that mean that all peopl ha the money to buy and to maintan car . but thi situat in my opinion ha also a import neg consequ , the consequ is the increas of pollut . infact few year ago the atmosfer wa better than our atmosfer and peopl live in a better world . peopl seem that are not veri interist of thi import aspect and thi is a problem becaus thank to the pollut a lot of peopl die . thi is in my opinion the most import neg aspect but there is also an other aspect that is import to analyz . the aspect is the exager and ecces use of car and for thi reason peopl never go out on foot or in other way such as bu . go out on foot is import for peopl at all the age special for the adult that they work all the day so for thi peopl is import to walk becaus help them to think about their life . so in my opinion the increas of car in thi period is certianli a posit aspect becaus help peopl to move in thei citi but ha also a lot of neg aspect .
