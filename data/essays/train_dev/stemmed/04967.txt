i do not agre with the statement . i do n't think that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i 'm not say that it 's not import to have a rich knowledg about differ subject , but to be succesful in today 's world , is essenti to be extrem prepar about a specif subject . an exampl can be a compani that produc veichl . today in the market there are a lot of compani that make veichl , so someon who studi how to produc veichl is not so differ from mani other . so that ' s whi is veri import for thi person to came out with a new veichl that can make a differ . and to do so he need to focu on a specif subject . he need to studi more about a particolar caratheristc that other veicl do n't have to becam more succesful then the other on the market . for exampl it would be a good idea for thi person to focu and special in onli one kind of veichl , mayb he can focu onli in suv . he can probabl dedic hi studi in how to have a better gas/milag with these type of veichl . i drive an suv and i 'm sure that if he can do that he will be consid a god and the market of suv will increas drastic ! anyon who studi about make veichl can find a job in the veichl product , but onli who dedic in a specif subject can be more succesful than the rest and be on the top of the market . thi is onli one on an infin of exampl to explain whi i think that it ' s better to be special in one specif subject than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
