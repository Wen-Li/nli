long ha been written whether young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , as well as how old peopl enjoy life more than young peopl do . nevertheless , i consid that enjoy life ha more to do with peopl 's attitud toward life than with them be young or old . therefor , i will tri to describ some idea in order to support that enjoy life ha much more to do with an attitud than with age . for exampl , mani peopl could think that enjoy life may be relat to lifetim , therefor if you are young person you could enjoy life more than if you are old . old peopl could think that young peopl have much more energi , or more activ in a day and therefor they enjoy life much more than them . the onli thing they do n't stop to think is that usual young peopl do n't have as much spare time as old peopl could have . on the other side , mani young peopl could possibl think that old peopl enjoy life much more than them sinc they are retir and the could do whatev they want with their time . as i have state befor , i definit consid that enjoy life ha more to do with wake up everi morn feel as if you need to do someth , either walk , run , eat , sleep , work , etc. and how you will manag to take the best part of the day . no matter if you are young or old , if you have lot of thing to do everi day or no , the onli point is the attitud you put to live everi day in order to be abl to enjoy it . final , i could say that enjoy life is not relat to age sinc both be young or old you can enjoy life as much as you want .
