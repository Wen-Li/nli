in my opinion both scenario are veri import . in fact , it is true that idea and concept are at the base of everyth . if you have the possibl to studi and understand the theori , you can have a wide vision of the concept . it is also true that experi help you to understand what theori ca n't give you , like fact . in order to explain my theori , tri to imagin these two scenario : 1 ) imagin a person that studi all the theori , but he doe not never appli them in the real world . i think that in thi case you have not the possibl to `` touch '' with your hand what you studi . in thi sens the risk is to have a deep knowledg of concept without have experienc them . thu , is theori complet without experi ? 2 ) imagin a person that ha never studi ( independ by the reason ) and ha not a deep knowledg of idea and concept . the person make experi with the world where he live , he understand fact and concept through hi behavior , but hi knowledg is base on hi person experi , through hi angl of view . thu , is experi complet without theori ? accord to me , the best way to understand everyth in the world is given by a mix of both theori and experi . onli in case of cohesist of them it is possibl to have a deep knowledg everyth . in fact , theori allow you to studi idea and concept in all the possibl way and have a high vision of the concept . afterward , experi give you the possibl to tast , to touch with your hand what you previous studi , in order to increas your knowledg
