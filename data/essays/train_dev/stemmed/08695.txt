in my view , success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . be success mean stand out of the crowd , which also mean do someth differ than most of the peopl . mani of us like to keep do someth the same way they alway have , for exampl a doctor alway give the same medic becaus it work and it ha been proven safe for the patient . in contrast a success doctor might tri a new combin of medic to treat a patient . there 's the risk that thi new combin simpli doe n't work , or wors , that it make complic and therefor put a life at risk . but it could also cure the patient , which the old medic would n't have . and the doctor would be success . there are numer exampl like that in medicin . anoth exampl is an exampl of earli histori . first peopl were hunt and collect food such as plant , then someon must have had the idea to tri and cultiv the plant as well and to have domest anim . mabi they had problem first , but it work . popul size increas becaus of the better food suppli and peopl did n't have to move around like they had to , when look for new hunt ground . peopl who tri that first success had an advantag over the hunt peopl , who were depend on a good hunt . anoth exampl are invent like train . of cours , technic improv were a key factor . peopl alreadi had mean of transport like hors , but some peopl want to tri someth new in order to reach anoth place in a faster way . so they invent the train . at the start most peopl were afraid , they beliv that the great veloc would make them ill . but after a while they got use to it and train and those who built them got success . could you imagin our world without train ? i ca n't and i 'm happi that some peopl like to tri new thing and take risk , otherwis our world would stand still . in conclus these exampl show that take risk is a major point of be success , without take risk and tri new thing everyon would be mediocr and no progress would be made whatsoev .
