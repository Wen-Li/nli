it would realli depend on how much time i have to make the trip . if i had more than two week to travel trough a citi or two i would rather prefer to travel on my own and follow my own pace too , and more like if it wa a histor citi of the european union . if i had to do a fast tour through sever citi in a short time , i would prefer to have a guid , so he or she could show me the most signif place to be seen in each citi and i would not feel i miss the most import thing . other good thing about guid is that they usual are veri familiar to the place and it histori , they know the littl detail , shop , stori , costum and typic food everi visitor ha to tri at least onc to get to say they actual been there . mayb there wo n't be much time left to wander around look at the arquitectur or the landscap furthermor than what the guid ha alreadi schedul , besid there is alway a great number of person within the same group of tourist , take pictur and ask question all the time , so the tour can turn into a stress race against time . i would realli prefer to travel on my own with plenti on time , but who would n't ? unfortun that is not alway possibl . it is alway nicer to walk look around at the same time , stepe by littl shop and cafe , talk to peopl , ask for direct , go to the place you choos to go to and discov everyth on your own . i think that is the travel ideal for mani of us , but we usual have a hard time on find the time to do it that way , and instead make plan with too mani destin all at onc in a small schedul .
