most peopl are afraid to take risk or learn new thing becaus they guess that it might fail . howev , i believ that tri new thing and take risk is what make a person a success person . it is good to have one thing that a person can do well . howev , when he or she learn about a new thing , they can relat what they have learn to what they alreadi know . in my school , our civic class do the chart call kwl chart . it 's a chart list what i alreadi know , what i want to know , and what i have learn , which we filll out after the lesson . when i take the lesson with a basic knowledg that i alreadi know to learn a new thing , i can relat them afterward and also , infer factor about the topic . when someon onli stick to someth that they know and how to do it , they will not succeed in societi sinc they do not have broader knowledg than other peopl in the commun . i strongli believ that take risk is a best way to succeed . when peopl take risk and fail , they can fix what they 've done wrong , and get it right next time . for exampl , thoma alva edison had fail alot of time when invent hi light bulb , howev , if kept on tri and final made a light bulb that chang out live . if he had stick to the job as a railroad worker and not put hi job on risk for what he want to do , he would n't be call `` the wizard of the menlo park . '' take risk can also be sure of what someon is do . if someon made decis , he or she should be proud of it and stick to it . for exampl , the famou chairman of the microsoft bill gate drop out of colleg to start a new world that he want . he did not drop out becaus he could not follow the cours , but he drop out becaus he wa sure that he could make thi world differ . and by stick to the decis he made and work hard to achiev hi goal , he becam success and got what he want to get . even though he had the risk of not get a success job if he fail , but he came out success becaus he stick to the decis he made . if he just stay in school like a normal student , our life would n't been veri modern as today . be success is what moast peopl in the world aim for . howev , i believ that tri new thing and take risk make a person success such as bill gate and thoma edison rather than just do onli one thing that they are good at .
