more and more young peopl today are often consid as the kind of peopl who alway think about themselv not someon els . they alway think they are busi do some veri import thing , so they do n't need to think about spend their free time to help their commun , even though mani expert inspir young peopl to do so and mention mani time about that they can learn mani thing from the activ . so accord to the write question , my answer is that i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i have two reason to support my idea . firstli , young peopl today are too selfish to consid other peopl 's feel and see other peopl 's need . it is just like what i mention befor . they alway think they are so special peopl in their mind that they may think other peopl need to give them some servic for sure . to cuas the result may be that most parent today spoil or treat their children too much well , and forget to remind them the old say : give is better than take . so it is esay to understand whi young peopl do n't want to spend enough time for their commun . the anoth reason is that our educ system too much emphas that if student have a good grade in studi and then they will have more opportun to have a success futur that is wait for them . so now young student have a `` good '' excus to declin the activ about spend time to help their commun . in fact , it is not a good situat for young peopl 's growth , so govern and parent need to think about the issu more seriou .
