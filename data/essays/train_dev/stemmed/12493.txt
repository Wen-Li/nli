be a success person i agre with the statement . the feel of success is a great thing that is unresist to have it again . when a person is success then he/sh is happi and pleasant , so the one who tast the success befor , want it again and again inspit of the failur or risk . the success peopl are brave , they know and believ that the success is not imposs , it may be tough or riski but they know that the feel at the end of the success worth everyth . so when thi person is up to a riski situat , he/sh doe n't hesit to tri it . risk is a way , for thi person to reach the success . but of cours , thi person may not be alway so lucki , he/sh can also tast be unsuccess , he/sh can tast the unhappi . i think thi make that person more ambiti , more hardwork . next time he/sh will be more powerful for thi situat , readi for next round . do alway the same thing make us bore and it is the same for success . success peopl get bore of do the thing that they alreadi know how to do well . it is not a new thing for them and they are n't as happi as they were at the first time they succeed it . they start to look for new or may be riski thing . becuas the thing that we do n't know well are riski for us . and risk is attract for peopl who are look for new success . for exampl , when a success student get a bad mark , he/sh doe n't give up , work harder until he/sh becom success and also look for everi opportun inord to tri to be success , thi mean risk . in addit to that if the success student becom success again in anoth subject , he/sh find anoth subject to tri to be success . final , i can say that success peopl are unsatisfactori , ambiti and hardwork peopl . they love risk and new thing , and never give up after failur . they do n't satisfact by do that they know to do well . they keep on search for new and more success . thi mean be a success person .
