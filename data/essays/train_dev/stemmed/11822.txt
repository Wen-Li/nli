first and foremost let me tri to put on the focu of the term : in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i do believ that will be true . actual , in the futur , in the earth , the level of pollut will be veri great , the air will be bad and thi for the car 's pollut . even today in the big citi there is the problem of pollut becaus on the street there are a big number of car from the morn to the even . the peopl use the car to go to the work place , becaus is too far . a small number of worker , now , can go to work by tram or bu becaus the line are too short and so they ca n't arriv with the public object at the final place . also , onli few worker can go by bycicl becaus the street is too long . thi onli for the worker . the student , instead , can take the train , but thi is alway in late . so a boy or a girl goe by car . now i do an exampl that make my idea concret : when i go to univers , i 'm alway in late becaus the train is in late ( everyday ) !!! if in the futur , the govern will decid to increas the train 's line , the tram 's line and the metro 's line , so that these will can arriv in time , more peopl will take these object and not the car . i hope that in the futur the air will be less dirti than today ; i hope thi also for my futur children and for all kid . to conclud , i do believ that in twenti year there will be fewer car than there are now , or perhap i hope thi one .
