i disagre to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . i have two reason to support my opinion . first of all , i think there is a limit that peopl can learn . if they want to studi mani academ subject , the knowledg of them becom usefulless . i think peopl can not concentr them with such a lot of subject at onc ! it ha no mean that peopl have usefulless knowledg . secondli , all of the peopl must have the subject they are good at and not so . for exampl , i belong to the fuculti of art and letter . i think i am good at english and japanes but not good at math and scienc . my friend in thi faculti also say that . on the other hand , my friend who are in the faculti of scienc , engen , agricultur say that they are good at math and scienc but not good at japanes . it is obvious on hand ! studi the subject that peopl are not good at is not effect . they feel more bore when they studi such subject than when they studi one they like . these are the reason whi i think it is better to special in one specif subject . to concentr with one subject in particular you are interest in , it is done a lot of great studi each section .
