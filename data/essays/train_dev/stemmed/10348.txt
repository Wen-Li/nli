i donot agre with the statement that `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . i support my statement with the follow reason . it is true that the life syle of man ha chang drastic over a period of time and man ha to compet against time to go on . but there are mani social organis that mainli compris of young peopl who work for a good caus . for exampl , the blood bank in my citi ha more than 1000 young peopl as it member . they organis blood donat camp often in the citi and also provid it for free of cost . one more interest fact about thi is that most of the member are the young softwar profession and doctor who inspit of their busi work hour take out time for chariti . anoth exampl i would like to quot here is the hiv-aid awar programm be conduct in the villag where the peopl are ignor about the diseas . thi programm is organis and conduct by a group of young medic student of which i also form a part . we stage play explain the spread of the diseas , it danger effect and the prevent measur . we do all thi in the weekend and we are abl to bring out a consider chang in half of a villag . also , there are mani indian settl abroad . these nonresid young profession form into a group and carri so mani remark project in their home land through proper organis channel . thi offer a best exampl of the concern of the young peopl toward their commun . i person feel that the main constraint to today 's young gener is the time but not the lack of interest to help their commun . there may be a littl lack of awar in them and which requir proper stimul . so , with all the reason state abov i support my view that today 's young peopl are not reluct to help their soceiti . afteral , today 's young gener impli the futur of tommorrow .
