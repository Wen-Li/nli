the tendenc of the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' is right . i think so becaus i am a person who act riski and i had alway success . but befor you gener you have to know what risk mean in thi context . risk accord to your carreer is to be brave to live and work or studi in a foreign countri for longer than 3 month . risk in term of success in my opinion is to appli for anoth job even you are happi and safe right now with your situat . my risk start after i have finish my apprentenceship at neuss counti council as an it-specialist . work for a govern facil is quit secur . the chanc that you lose your job is low . but i have thought that thi can not be everyth in my life . i want to appli for a job in call center becaus i thought that talk to peopl might help my problem of commun . i appli for the best call center in my region and i work for microsoft . even now i am write my thesi to graduat at microsoft germani . i also work and studi one semest in the unit state . the time scale here is approxim 10 month . my exchang semest in south korea and my internship at the korean german chamber of commerc and industri wa also a great experi . if i review my journey right now and compar it to some friend who never left the citi where we graduat high school i can definetali say that i have an advanc statu . the reason for thi conclus is becaus thi friend of mine appli for the same internship program . so the argument are not onli my thought but my experi . addit i my friend had to admit that i alway have someth to talk about . and we figur out that the more inform you get the more opportun you can turn into success project . right now i am prepar to built up my own busi becaus i have contact worldwid . and not everi person in the world like to do busi unperson with peopl through the internet . so my understand of risk is to tri new thing . even if you are secur in your present situat . take risk is not alway danger . you onli have to evalu the k.o. criteria which could be essenti to have or to lose . peopl who alreadi have a famili with wife and children are not flexibel becaus parent have to `` feed '' or take care for their famili member . as long as i am young i alway will set new mileston to achiev my long-term goal to have a great life with my futur famili . and i also think it is more effici to `` risk '' someth when you are young rather when you have respons toward other . i hope that thi mind will have a great impact to my life . good luck !
