i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do n't give enough time to help their commun . we can see that in the increas lack of staff in chariti organis and lack of volunt in elderli home and orphanag . howev , there are three reason that can justifi whi young peopl are n't avail for such servic as their counterpart had been thirti or fourti year ago . first of all , the educ requir have increas on the averag and henc the time requir by young peopl to obtain the necessari qualif . thirti or forti year ago a diploma wa good enough to practic medicin , have your own clinic or work in a hospit with a good salari . nowaday you need much more than that , at least one master degre and sever research as well as a membership of a well-known medic bodi like the royal assembl of british surgeon . the same appli to all level of educ requir to perform certain job . second come the fact that educ , and life in gener , is becom more and more costli . thi forc mani young peopl to go to work earli in their live to support themselv or even their famili sometim . in fact , most of colleg and post graduat student in some area are part time student and part time worker . thi ha place heavi pressur on the free time avail for chariti activ the situat becom even wors if these young peopl decid to have famili with one or two children . in thi case the demand would be increas so much that some of them go home for onli three to four hour to rest and spend the remain hour work in more than one job or take care of their children or stude , in case they were ambici and persist enough to do that . we now come to the third reason in my opinion which is entertain . thi can be subdevid into two subcategori . first is the littl time left , if ani , for relax and enjoy , after the previou two reason i mention . in thi case young peopl prefer to spend such time in have fun and enjoy themselv rather than engag in an activ that will help the societi but be more depress to them . the other subcategori is the abund and diversif of entertain mean that did n't exist two or three decad ago . such abund and diversif is much more tempt to young peopl than work in an elderli hous or decor the street . they can select between cinema , club , differ kind of sport or music parti . and all exist in each of their area . thiri year ago there would be onli one or two mean of entertain and not work all the time even . that is the way i can interpret the increas lack of interest by young peopl to help their commun .
