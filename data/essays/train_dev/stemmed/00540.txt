i have two opinion on thi question that i will developp . firstli , i think that it can be possibl that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than today . in fact , today we have an import life problem which is the ecolog problem . as the climat is chang and the earth is warm , a lot of person consid , nowaday , that car pollut and to put an end to the warm process , we have to use no pollut vehicul like bicycl , ... thi kind of mental is more current in the north of europ ( sweden , finland , ... ) . in those countri , they use alreadi less car than a few year ago and prefer use bu or other public transport . moreov , in franc , we can notic that the cost of the petrol is veri import and we arriv to a point that we can say that it 's a lux to have a car as the petrol is expens . we can imagin if noth happen that peopl will developp the north mental and appli it , to make benefit or just economi . and deffacto , the car number will decreas . but in an other part i think that it 's not possibl that in twenti year there will be less car than today . in fact , i imagin that from today to 2026 car wo n't work with petrol but i hope with hydrogen , water or electr or sun light which will permit to resolv the ecolic problem we have to face on . chang the mod of carbur will permit to have a somethimng cheaper than the petrol so consequ , there will be more car in twenti year . final we have to reppear that in twenti year , there will be more than 7 trillion peopl on earth so normal the car number on earth will grow .
