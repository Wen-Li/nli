i think it is more import for us student to learn fact than to understand the idea . for my person experi , i learn more when i learn the fact first . i had been rais in taiwan . when i wa a student in elementari school , middl school , and high school in my countri , teacher taught us or ask us to memor two time one equal two , two time two equal four , two time three equal six , and so on . at that time , no one told me whi , i had been wonder whi two time one equal two , but i had no choic and be forc to memor them . as time went by , i have been taken mani math class , such as algerbla 1 , algerbla 2 , calcul , so and so . i realiz whi two time one equal two which bother me when i wa a 8 year old kid . i first memor the `` fact '' , and understand the `` idea '' itself . although now you may think there 's a time consum , and start wonder how long doe it take me to realiz the reason whi two time one equal two . honestli , it did n't take me too much time to understand the concept , and the most import thing is i got the idea by myself which is more valuabl . i feel more confid and start been an indep thinker . moreov , i wo n't forget about it becaus peopl alway learn by the experi .
