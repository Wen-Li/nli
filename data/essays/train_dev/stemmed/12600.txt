advertis consist of convinc potenti custom that a given commod or servic ha some posit qualiti that make it worth buy . in some case the advertis featur of the product either exist or not . for exampl , it is rel easi to verifi whether a claim state in a commerci that - under some condit - a car run on some amount of ga per 100 kilomet can be true or not . in thi case advertis can make the commod seem better than it is . howev , to my knowledg , these form of advertis are mostli forbidden in develop countri , sinc they essenti repres scam . in mani - perhap most - other case , the qualiti claim in a commerci can not be univoc defin as true or fauls . for exampl , a compani could advertis a drink it market as , say , the `` drink of the coolest peopl on earth '' . in itself , thi statement mean noth and can not be verifi . howev , if the advertis campaign is well design and a number of peopl accept the view that drink that specif drink make you `` cool '' , then advertis - to some extent - creat the featur it claim . in such case , advertis chang the product itself and is part of it . that is , a given item without advertis is in fact a differ product than the otherwis ident item which ha been advertis . therefor i would not agre with the statement that advertis make product seem much better than they are in fact .
