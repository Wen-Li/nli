i find it product and reward to special on one subject becaus one is like to progress better by stay focus on one area of thought . mathematician like andrew wile work a huge amount of time to prove a singl theorem , but he happen to solv one of the greatest enigma of mathemat . so devot oneself complet to solv a problem or to structur a method may result in an effect , all-inclus and creativ solut or understand . howev , special could also mean boredom or a wast of time . stay up all night pursu the same goal over and over again may caus someon to live an empti life , even to lose focu of what they were look for in the first place and therebi make mani year ' work obsolet . mani great thinker got stuck in their own mind , think there wa onli one import thing in the world , like religion or fanci metaphys entiti , shut themselv down from the rest of the world and , more importantli , from the opportun of growth and understand they had as human be . the mind ha to flow and explor , take new chanc , it is not contain in a box . after all , there are mani idea and project out there , endless possibl of how to make a better world . a wide rang of abil and knowledg of variou subject enrich peopl 's live and open their mind . the onli problem is that it is difficult to coordin oneself to grow in each disciplin , one can get easili distract and it is hard to determin what requir one 's attent at what time . still , the statement could be wrongli put forward . go back to wile 's experi , he could not have prove the theorem without have a wider mathemat understand , if he had n't look in archiv other ( more special mathematician ) would have consid useless or out of the subject , if he had n't dare to tri new method whenev it wa need , nowaday it is hard to think what it would be like to focu on onli one disciplin or scienc , sinc they are all relat with each other , and with technolog , in signific way .
