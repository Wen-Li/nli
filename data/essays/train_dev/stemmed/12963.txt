i am agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they are . i think that it is normal becaus the attend of the peopl are alway big . a good advertis must make a product seem much better than it is for a commerci law . in fact in the commerci law the product must be present like a better . if the advertis give some posit sensat to the peopl , it is just a littl step for make a good product . it is not import if in the advertis there is a good or bad product . but it is import like the product is seem . for exampl i want to buy a new car . i see an advertis that make a car like a good product and i want to buy that car becaus i believ that it is a godd car . thi is a littl exampl but for everyth we can make an advertis make a product much better than it realli is . the consumist world in that we live impos us thi new way of think . the peopl are joke to the adverstis and then they are unbeliv if the product is not like they think . when i wa a child i want a littl toy becaus in the advertis wa a new fantast robot and all the child want it . but onli with the passag of the age i learnt that not all advertis tell a trouth .
