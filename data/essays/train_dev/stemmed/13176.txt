i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . when i wa a high school student , i usual learn just fact . it wa a system of korean educ . for exampl , in math class , i could learn a lot of inform in short periord . howev , i usual got low grade each test . becaus teacher chang style fo problem in each test , i could not use such factor which i learn befor . that 's whi i think to understand idea and concept is more import . next , if i understand idea and concept of problem , i can use them in our live time . for instanc , i learn effect valu of electron product through my physic class . therefor , i can save util fee becaus i can find which product are more effect than other in home . final , if we know about concept and idea of some accid , unfortun accid would never happen in the futur . for exampl , if we just know factor of invat from other counti , the invat would be face again becaus we did not know how to prepar them . obvious , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . we can use idea and concept in our live and prepar bad accid .
