`` the world is a stage , and we are all player . '' as shaekespear told , we are the player on thi huge stage , who tri to enjoy in their short life span . in thi case young peopl are more lucki than older peopl becaus they have more life enrgi , and they did not see the bad side of life yet . my first reason is that the vivid energi of young peopl is higher than older peopl , for they have less respons . the older peopl have to sustain their life themselv , and sometim they have to look after the young . for exampl , older peopl have to work and gain money in order to get their basic life need such as eat or hous . howev , the young peopl do not have to gain money . they can get from their parent what they need . so , young peopl can use their all energi to enjoy the life , and they are more happi than older . furthermor , the young peopl do not have more experi than the older peopl , includ the bad one . the older peopl made mistak in their past , and are afraid to do those mistak again in their futur . while they are prevent themselv from bad event , they miss the enjoy thing on world . on the other hand , the young peopl , who have less experi can move further step in the enjoy life , for they are not afraid do the wrong thing . they even do not know what is wrong . while old peopl are be stuck in their bad experi , younger peopl live in the sunni side of the world . to sum up , be a young person i can say that the young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , becaus we are load with more energi to use for be happi , and we did not see yet the realiti which make peopl unhappi .
