thi statement seem to be true at a first glanc . but have a closer look on thi topic one should differenti more precis . first of all these type of statement can not be gener . thu it should at least be mention that we can onli speek of major . second one should be awar that an answer to the question whether or not young peopl enjoy life more than elder is highli subject . from my experi i would even oppos . admittedli younger peopl in most case bring along a higher level of physic fit . thu they have a broader varieti of entertain opportun . in turn thi opportuni might rais the confid of young peopl . but what realli matter is time ( actual my opinion ) . as i defin young peopl to be someth around 20 and older peopl to be retir , i think elder have signifacantli more time than young peopl have . thi degre of freedom ( in the sens of time ) allow for much more activ . while for instanc student have to learn and work hard to fund their studi retir person might meet with friend , travel around , go out and drink some , visit opera , go shop or whatoev . thi lack of time is a crutial thing that count against a superior fun-level of young peopl . secontli i think young peopl are expos to more stress . old peopl do not have to make decis like `` should i join thi or that univers ? '' or `` should i appli for thi internship ( respect job ) ? '' . thi type of decis - someon in the begin twenti have to make - caus an inher stress situat , which again lower life qualiti . thu i conclud from my person experi that thi relationsship doe not hold . i think it is actual the other way round . again , one should not neglect that thi answer is highli subject to the definit of young and old and must not be true for each individu .
