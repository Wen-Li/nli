in my opinion , i disagre the statement that say the young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . by contarst i think that both young peopl and older peopl enjoy their life for the follow reason . first , although not as much as older peopl can be seen on the street do stuff outsid , they have their own activti to do indoor . such as read novel , newspap , watch tv , sew . and other older peopl may go outdoor for sever time to exercis their bodi in order to be healthi and live longer to enjoy more life . moreov , the young peopl gener are still studi in school or univers . so they can enjoy their life by studi in class and some activt held in campu . for exampl mani student join club after school like tenni club , footbal team , piano club , draw or whatev . also there may be parti to celebr some festervi such as christma , halloween . in my school , the parti were alway full of student and teacher to enjoy . furthermor , the young peopl sometim also enjoy life with older peopl . for instac , the grandfath go to the park with hi grandson in weekend . both of them can play happili with each other . or even the whole famili go out for a trip is a typic event that reveal young peopl enjoy life with older peopl . although some of the older peopl have no abliti to enjoy the life , they have to stay in the hospit , some young peopl do thi too . howev , everyon should enjoy their own life whenev and wherev by everi kind of method to make their life better and meaning . all in all , nowaday older peopl and young peopl enjoy their life in the way they like . even though we can not see both side in one time , we shall observ their life care so that we can find both of them are all enjoy the life .
