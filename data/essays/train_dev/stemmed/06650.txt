youth can but doe n't know , elder know but ca n't ani more . that the way i would answer thi question . in my mind , when you are young you can enjoy the simpl fact of be aliv and have the whole life in front of you . young peopl are unawar of the miseri that goe along with live . for sure , health and hope help for enjoy life , but when you do n't know yet where is real happi , you just wast your time . older peopl mayb have anoth way of be happi and enjoy life that may not be worst : they know what they have done , and hope get idea of what they still can do . most of the time , older peopl have more materi well than young one and the satisfact of a well manag past life can keep an elder be happi , with hi famili , the hous he built , or the societi he help to carri on . moreov , thi state of thing allow them to know that they will do pass . .. so , whi not to do what you have ever want to do ? older peopl know that their time is to come , and regard thi , get pride of what they done befor . the reason whi older peopl may enjoy life less than younger one come from the fact that they sometim just live not to die , wherea young one just live to be happi . youth is for fight , build and lust for life , elder is for be in peac , get benefit of what you done hardli when you had the strength to do it . or that the way it should be . in the end , i would say that it 's easier to enjoy life when you are young , but elder way of enjoy life is much more true and deep .
