i agre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are three reason in my opinion which led to the situat . first , there are too mani amus activ to do . new high-tech toy and recreat are be introduc to the teenag and keep them stick on those thing . big compani use strong advertis and free trail to make sure the potenti consum will not do anyth els but spend time on the product . moreov , interact with friend take most of young peopl 's time . all of these activ occupi everi minut of them . second , the educ from young peopl 's parent doe not give them the idea . to live in a competet world , children are taught to learn knowledg as much as they can and give attent to other thing as less as they can . cram school is alway the first and onli choic for young peopl to hang around . they are told to keep their hand from thing that are helpless to their grade . due to thi twist concept , young peopl are not interest in commun activ . third , the media broadcast neg exampl which stop young peopl from take action . peopl refus to give time help their commun becaus of bad news . a crazi person might hurt an unexperienc teenag while ask for help . teenag can be in troubl becaus their lack of experi on help the commun . abov all , it is true that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . by observ those who live around , we can find out that young peopl will help if the neg condit are remov . creat a nice and friendli environ for teenag to open their mind will be the best way to let them give more time on commun activ .
