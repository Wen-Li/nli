i think to a larg degre that the fact in the futur there will be fewer car in use than today it depend strectli on technolog progress . have a look in to the past and compar that situat with the one we are live today we can say that there were a lot of discov process that allow the societi to chang it scenari . in fact 30 year ago , refer to the modern era , the scenari wa character by new hi/tech invent in the field of main of transport . in fact the airplan transport exist sinc 1950 but increas immens 30 year ago when peopl could travel around the world without problem . so , i think that if the technolog continu to perform and to grow as it did in the past i can say that probabl in the futur we will have fewer car than today . so i complet agre with the statement becaus i think that in the futur peopl will not use anymor car for ani kind of transport need , thank especi to modern technolog . nowaday if we have a look to modern citi we can see that peopl move from a part of the citi to anoth use underground . so i think that peopl will use fewer car for differ reason > first becaus they do not want to make the queue on the street second they replac car with other main of transport becaus they do not have to be concentr in to drive . third becaus in the futur we will have better main of transport , in fact we know that research are project a new type of train project . i am refer to the new train that will connect the europ with america . so thi train will be posit into a tunnel . the tunnel will be build under the sea that permit to the train to cross the ocean in onli 9 hour . so the futur human life will be veri differ from now .
