advertis is meant to attract peopl attent in order to sell a product . in thi case , i agre with the fact that most advertis make product seem better than they realli are . advertis compani use peopl 's psycholog in the way they present a product . they can make fustur custom relat to the product , and ultim buy it . advertis compani reli on how peopl relat to their product : for exampl , a brand of shampoo may want to reach out to stay at home mother and tell them that they will be `` sexi '' and attract by use it ; a compani that sell basebal bat may want to reach to father and tell them that by buy thair bat and play with their son , they will be hero . it is not necessarili the product in itself that attract peopl , but how the advertis is present and the idea behind it . not everi advertis product is good . for exampl , i saw an ad on tv about a vaccum . the ad said that the vacuum could even clean bacteri from the air and that it deep clean the carpet . it look good to me , so i bought it : the vaccum broke the next day . there is no real way from know if a product is good or bad becaus there are so mani advertis nowaday . the onli way of know is by tri out the product ; and by that time , the advertis compani achiev one thing : sell their product . advertis is a part of our societi to the point where we can not tell what is true and what is not in the matter of product : what brand is realli better ? do we take price into account ? as a custom , there is so much to take into account that we end up be confus and choos what `` look '' good . advertis know how to make use of thi fast-pac societi , where peopl do not have time to look close at a product befor buy it . it is ultim the way the product is present that make them profit ; not the qualiti of the product .
