there are so mani subject which entic our concern dure studi in univers . it is not a matter you 're bachelor or master or doctor . the real essent of academ subject , knowledg itself , is interest and attract for human . but , i do n't agre with the asset that we must boraden our knowledg better than special in on specif subjec . i will give you a two reason . first , there is no such easi academ subject which can conquer in one or two decad . almost everi academ subject need one 's whole life 's effort . most import thing to becom a intellectur is concentur in one specif subject not becom a know-everyth man . actual , human can not kwow whole thing of the world . for exampl , there is a person who i know . he studi philosophi and he also eager to know lot of thing about the non-philosoph thing . it is not a bad attutud i think . but , he did n't get the degre in year what he plan to get that becaus of that eager distract hi concentur . second , the societi want the person who ha knowledg which is special in one specif subject . if he know lot of other knowledg , of cours it is a good thing . but it is not a primari but secondari . peopl who are talent in one specif subject can work as proffession . but the person who know mani thing but not special is not a proffession . for exampl , there wa two friend of mine . the one of them wa talent in mani thing . he wa a good singer and good dancer . he also stude well but not the best . when he becam a adult , he get a job . but it wa not a special job . the anoth friend wa talent in onli school studi . but when he becam adult , he got a job in a special area and he got a lot of saleri . to sum up , veri essenti respect of academ knowledg doe n't allow multi-studi . becaus the abil of human is so limit , we must concentr in one studi . and the societi need proffesion person not a know-everth man .
