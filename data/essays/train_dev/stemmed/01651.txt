recent , i had a chanc to have brief meet with tom who just came back from the europ trip and i wa abl to hear abou the valuabl stori and funni episod . howev , he strongli mention about the lesson given by the trip and also eagerli tri to advis me that without a tour guid tourist are capabl of make a trip more interest and memoriz . convinc by tom , i do not agre with the statement that `` the best way to travl is in a group led by a tour guid '' due to two main reason . first of all , by depend on the tour guid , tourist danger lose their respos and also deepli becom depend . for exampl , let us say there are two babi who have been rais differ . the first babi , jimmi ha been gift with a coupl who beliv that babi must be rais with great care ; on the other hand , the jeffrey ha been rais by believ who desir their babi to bocom less depend . most like , jimmi rais with great care will be excess so depend that when he reach to the time to work in a compani , he will have mani problem base on the disabl to solv problem independ . howev , jeffrey will be realli strong and doe give up in societi even though advers tri to block him . secondli , without the tour guid , the tourist tend to more colabor each other in a group and natur make their trip more voluabl and memoriz . like i mention in the previou paragraph , be independ is realli import element for peopl in societi , but also know how to work with cowork is signific . accord to tom , he said that he had a lot of hard time to find place he and other in the group want to visit . and he ad that becaus poepl more tend to be collabor and agreeabl , they could have veri success and ineras trip . in conclus , by depend on a tour guid , it will be littl valuabl trip in the reaon of the high cost for it . so , if some want to have wonder , memoriz trip , he or she have to avoid a tour guid who probabl take hi or her independ .
