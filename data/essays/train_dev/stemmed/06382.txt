as i am a advantur like person , i doe not agre thi statement . to enjoy ani tour that must be in group but that need not to be guid by ani guide. reason for my thi think are as follow : firstli , guid is a profession person . hi aim will be onli one and that is to make hi coustmer go arround the each of the visit point without give the time to enjoy that place fulli . if we all friend togeth can make our own way by our own . secondli , without a guid you can travel by your own conveni . for exampl , last month i wa gone to a tour for bombay ( boolywood citi ) , lonavalla and khandala ( tourist place ) with my collag friend . these place are veri beauti and full of natur scenc . over there we had hire a guid to take us to differ place . that guid round all the place within one and a half hour . mani place were there to which he shown us from a long distanc . i and my friend request him to spent fraction of time over everi place ,, but unfortunatli he doesnot allow . our bad luck . but for anoth exampl , last year me with my rel gone to the tour without the guid . the place wa definatli unknown to us . but by our own affort we reach to that so i donot prefer to have a gui on tour .
