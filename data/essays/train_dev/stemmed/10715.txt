in our life , all of us want to live in good , confort condit , want to have a big hous and also a nice car and money till death . but for thi suitabl life can not be won easili . it want success . and for the success ; open mind , risk and new trial are necessari . there are two kind of peopl . one of what is success and the other is unsuccess in the life . in my opinion , successful peopl are open mind and alway readi to tri someth new and tri to develop a process or a project or a subject . in addit to these they like to take risk for the success . but on the other hand , some peopl stay away from risk , new project and also they are afraid of trial . they live accord to their life rule . if we focu on the professors-scholar work , educ and research in the univers , colleg and also in institud , we could determin the success on their face by investig their reliabl behaviour , talk , smile . .. etc we know that they dont get afraid of make mistak becous they believ that if they m make mistak it will turn to them as success on the other hand if the other peopl afraid of make mistak , take risk and stay depend on their own rule , could not be success . for exampl , if an unsuccessful student is investig , accord to the student behaviour and life , random studi time that wa set by her/hisself could be determin . in conclus it could be said that successful peopl are the peopl who are not afraid of make mistak and in addit to these who are not to take risk . they are alway readi to find out someth and develop . but as comparis abov , to do wahot is want doe not bring ani success and olso a comfort life we imagin . if life is just like a stair for peopl have beauti confort miney on the upsid , in my opinion successful peopl will go up easili but the other will not .
