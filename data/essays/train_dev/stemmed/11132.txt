i disagre with that statement that say `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . becaus everi year the technolog are develop and help to chang all te thing in better so the car is one from mani thing it will be chang and develop by technoloy . so everi person want to use the car to o to hi jop or to make shop or to take is familli in vicat . we cant aliv without the car in twenti year or hunder becaus the life will be difficult and the car make everi thing easi . espeaci for parent , teacher and student becaus not everi one can use atrain in close place . the old an cant use the bike . all the peopl are differ from each to other in power or the way they think and behavior for all thi we cant live next year com without car . we can use mani differ thing to move but the car is good thing to everi one can use it . i see it will be imposil to use aplan or a train in our citi or countri so the mind say use the car . everi one can use hi car alon in ani time to ani place that he want in easi and he chois the pest fo him an select the coulor that he want with agood technolog . there is mani price to buy for bore or for rich peopl .
