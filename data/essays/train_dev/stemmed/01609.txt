well i m not in favor with the statment given asid . as we know that for gracp or for understand ani kind of topic , we should rather must go through the both phase of studi . name first one theorit phase and second one is practic phase . in school level student onli follow the way that they had been describ in book mean they onli awar with theorit aspect of topic . i believ that text book are main media or way to provid thorough knowledeg about concept and aspect . but it is failuer to teach practic aspect of the perticular topic . student can understand the idea or concept of ani field by mere read the topic in textbook or by learn it in to classroom . so i think such student dose not have abil to explain or to demonstr the concept or in other way they dose not understand the fundament princip behind the topic . while mere read and understand topic help in assum percpetiv of topic . although onli read dose not satisfi the requir of best student , while he must go through second phase of studi . if the student have clear theorit concept of ani specif topic then he or she can work or handel the problem relat practic . for exampl one chemic engin student have onli school degre while oth have therot base with experinc in that field . then in such case most of the chemic compani will hire the experienc student as he ha better knowledg than inexperienc student . becos compani alway look for those person who have peculiar charcterist of both theorit and practic sens . by learn actual fact or get practic train he will feel more satiat . as onc in traine period he ha creat hi abil to find the econom and ecofriendli solut to the problem . thu final i believ that it not onli essenti to understand the fact about ani gernarl topic by read or list but also it will also flourish with actual practic on the field in kind of field .
