yup ! i do agre with is statement that most of the peopl in the world are not spend their atleast time to help their commun , becaus their is a major problem , is lack behind the peopl , at which peopl are not spend their time to help their respect commun is that everyon are selfish in their job , mean which includ mani . the peopl are more effect in their famili 's , with their wife and children . to overcom thi problem , peopl should take immedi action in thi case ,, each and everi one should built help natur , should obey their elder , younger and especi , should obey their parent , so by develop thi helpl skill in their natur 's the respect toward their communit will be gain and automat , everi one will help poor peopl . the major point i would like to contrast is `` donat '' , by make donat to the poor peopl , peopl could gain lot of respect in their respect commun , not onli donat to the poor peopl , also creat charit trust my make contribut peopl could gain higher prioriti in their respect societi . today there are mani peopl who are starv becaus of food , not onli food also with cloth and no shelter . howev today we are see that , most of the peopl are die with lack of food starvat and shelter , thi incid we are suppos to know by read newspap and by see the news , most of thi belong to poorer countri in which their govern is not in the posit to afford food and shelter to the peopl in their respect citi . so , in everi countri ( poor or rich ) govern should take immedi action on such type of incid and should provid the poor peopl to get them surviv in their life . the abov point which , i made is not onli that govern should help the commun but , it belong to everyon that each and everi person in the societi should behav as a responc person , should respect their commun and spend atleast littl time to look after the poor peopl and help them in their poor life .
