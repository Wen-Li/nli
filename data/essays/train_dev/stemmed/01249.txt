i like to travel with my father more than by myself . i alway travel in summer with my fimali . my father , mother , and bigger sister usuley go to differ counteri each year . travel with my father much better for us becaus , he is the tour guid . frist of all , travel with a tour guid will make the travel short and essi , sinc the tour guid ha an experi in hi plase . he will make my vecat more enjoynabl . scond reason is that , the tour guid will choos a good plase for me better than i do . one time when i went to new citi i ask for a good plase to go and how i can go there . in thi time i lost the way . so it save time to go with a tour guid who will take me there in a short time . and i do not need to think of time . fainal , first think i could teach my son in travel is to find a good tour guid . to save hi time and show him more plase in one trip . which would be better to have a oneperson who can help me to travel and enjoy my time without think of how and from where i have to go to that plase .
