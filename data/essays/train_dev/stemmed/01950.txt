i disagre with the statement that today , young peopl are becom reluct in help their commun . i agre that these day , youngster have start stay aloof , and they have begun to increasingli valu their privaci , but thi doe not mean that they are show indiffer to their commun . first of all , i believ that it is veri import to have faith in the commun which the individu ha to adher to , and make contribut to . if a person is fulli convinc about the ideal and goal of the commun , then he would show full support and cooper to it . recent , i heard a news that a former student of my colleg wa suffer from brain cancer . as soon as thi news hit the campu , mani student bodi becam activ involv in collect fund to succor the patient . thu , the young student show great enthusiasm inord to further a caus which they believ strongli . also , in my countri , mani polit parti have special divis call `` yuva shakti '' which are entir compris of youth , and which have come into exist onli exploit the strength which rest in the young gener . these young men activ support the parti principl , and do their everi bit to publicis their ideal and object . they spend their preciou time and effort , to help their commun . mani youth also associ themselv with non profit organ , in order to help the poor peopl to get acess to variou facil . for exampl , i am a member of a commun which aim at increas awar among unpriveleg and uneduc peopl about diseas , their prevent and symptom etc . we go from villag to villag in order to spread thi valuabl inform . in the last few year , that i have been a part of thi organis , i have seen a great increas in the number of youngster will to join hand for thi caus . there are numer other instanc in which youngster have been promis , in show support to the commun they are affili to , and so , i believ that they are stand up to the expect of the societi and are still fulfil their respons veri well .
