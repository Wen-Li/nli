no i do not agre with thi statement . i beliv that there are mani reason whi there will not be fewer car in twenti year , some of which are that : firstli , twenti year is not exactli a long period of time so i do not believ that in thi period , scientist will be abl to invent new way or method of transport for the million of peopl use car . even if they did have idea and sampl of invent , it would either take to long to put into practic for the public or simpli too expens for mani peopl ot use . in addit to all of thi , mani peopl are simpli content with use car nowaday so therefor there is not so much of a concern in find news mean of transport but more of an effect one . car are still in use . the onli differ nowaday is that scientist are tri ot find more effect and environment friendli sourc to use in car . so there probabl would not be a declin in the number of car use but a declin in the number of inneffect car in use . for thi reason there will probabl not be much of a differ in twenti year . also , if anyth , there will probabl be more car on the road in twenti year . due to the poplut increas global , there will probabl be an increas in demand for car , with respect to transport for peopl . thi increas in peopl will probabl reuslt in the urgenc to find new mean of transport but twenti year is not a long enough period of time for such drastic chang . so in conclus , there will probabl be mani more car run on the road in twenti year which is the near futur , then there are now .
