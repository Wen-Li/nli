i agre with the statement , and think that more should be done by peopl to help their commun . first of all , it 's easi to notic that mani young boy spend their time in videogam center , wast a lot of time and do noth use for the commun . besid , even if they spend hour in such amus place , they do n't look happi at all . probabl thi is due to the lack of human relationship that emerg from spend time with videogam , so i think that if they start spend their time in help their commun they will both use their time in a better way and be happier . for exampl , they could perform act for entertain old peopl . thi would make them make friend among other player , and let them show their abil in sing or play , or just let them enjoy in an environ that doens't requir ani profession skill . anoth use activ young peopl could do for their commun would be go to elementari school and sensibil kid about the problem of bullism , in an age where it emerg . if older peopl , like teacher , explain children that bullism is a bad , meaningless , complet unus thing , kid will probabl start behav even wors , to show that they are strong and `` adult '' enough to oppos teacher suggest . convers , if young boy or girl in the age of 20 , who are often seen as a model by kid , explain that `` be a bull is not cool at all '' , then studen usual start to behav better . i know it seem strang , but i can say it by a person experi of mine that it realli work . anyway i am happi to notic that some develop ha occur . for exampl , in my childhood there wa not so much attent on the condit of the riversid of my citi main river . they were realli dirti , you could find anyh there , from bicycl to refriger , from old tv set to wash machin . howev now , onc a year , dure a spring event peopl clean for free those riversid , and in few year it becam a nice river where some peopl start even to fish , someth that wa unbeliv until about ten year ago . thi make me confid in think that more and more nice activ will be develop , and that more and more peopl will devot their time to use activ that help their commun and , i think , their own life too .
