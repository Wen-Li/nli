well to start with i utterli disagre with such statement becaus i believ that a man 's life resembl the differ semest of the year , in each lie beauti and happi as well as problem and solut . younger peopl are more motiv to start thier journey in life , they feel stronger and more motiv to prove themselv , they have differ kind of activ and interest . they are in the spring semest of their llive , where they are still green and grow fast . they have a vast major of choic and a load of decis to make . while older peopl are more relax , they are in the autum semest of thier live , they made thier mind about the most crucial thing in life , they took desicion and they are handl life more matur , they are less motiv , but more awar . what am tri to do is to shed more light on the mental and the statu of peopl at differ stage of thier live although it doesnt effect or interact with how much they enjoy their life . but , in my opinion , what doe effect the level of happi , pleasur or enjoy in life differ from one individu to anoth , it is total relat to one percept of life and hi prioreti and goal . how much did i achiev till now ? what i want from life ? what i need in life ? do i have it ? we ask ourselv these question all the time . so , doe young peopl enjoy life more that older peopl ? ! not realli . to sum up must say that peopl enjoy life regerdless of thier age . thu what doe make the differ is not the age , it is the individu person and it look toward life , it achiev and the level of sucess and failur .
