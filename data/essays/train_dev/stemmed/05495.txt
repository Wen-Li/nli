whenev i plan for travel , i consid whether to travel in a group led by a tour guid or to travel individu without a tour guid . howev , even though there are some peopl who prefer to travel individu , i like to journey follow an instructor . as i have experienc in both way , i believ there are more advantag to travel in a group led by a tour guid . first , travel with a tour guid make peopl be more comfort . for exampl , when i travel follow a tour guid , i feel comfort about not think of the direct of the new place . the instructor had alreadi plan where our group wa suppos to visit , eat , and book the hotel , so there wa noth i worri about . second , it is safe to travel with a tour guid . becaus the tour guid know where we go , there is less chanc to be lost in the foreign countri . also it is more comfort to travel with a person who can commun in the languag of the countri which i do not know . last , it is easier to get inform of the place where we travel . sinc guid is hi or her work , the instructor know inform about where he or she take peopl . thu , peopl who travel within a tour guid easili get close to the new inform as they listen to the instructor . when i visit europ , i wa fullfil with the question of the histori of where i travel such as `` winter castl '' in russia and alp mountain in switzerland . becaus i did not know how to speak english at that time , there wa no way to ask to resid . howev , with the tour guid 's help and inform , i could satisfi with what i want know easili . with these reason , i disagre with the statement , `` the be wat to travel is is a group led by a tour guid . '' it is more comfort and safeto travel where i do not know much about it .
