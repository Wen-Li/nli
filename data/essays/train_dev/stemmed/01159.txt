with refer to these differ solut , i think that both the possibl have got advantag and disadvantag . in my opinion , if it is better to have broad knowledg or to special in one specif subject depend on sever factor such as the countri where do you have to work and which kind of job you are interest to . inde each countri ha got it own tradit and polit system that sure influenc the academ choic of a person . in my countri , it is more common to have a broad knowledg of mani subject so peopl could have a wider choic between mani job . it is also veri import which job you would like to do in the futur . inde scientif job need special knowledg of a subject such as chemistri or math . on the other hand there are sever job which need a broad knowledg of mani subject . for exampl a person who want to teach licteratur have to studi grammar , poetri , histori , and so on . although special in one specif subject ha got it posit factor , such as the possibl to find earli a good job , i sure prefer to have a broad knowledg for sever reason . first of all , i would like to know a lot about our world , and if i studi a specif subject i would know onli a topic . secondli by have broad knowledg you will be abl to choos between differ job . after all you can special yourself after that you have found a good job . so i gener do agre with the statement
