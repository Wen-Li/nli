i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . the first reason whi i agre with thi statement is that young peopl have chang . in old day in korea , young peopl were veri help . they help to build hous and fix thing , which are danger and hard . thi work were for young peopl and they did it without hesit . howev , these day young peopl do not care about their commun . young peopl , nowaday , have differ attitud . anoth reason that i think is that young peopl are not connect with commun . in korea , young peopl , who assum as student , are veri busi studi . they go school at 7 in the morn and come back in the mid-night . they have no time to particip for their commun . wherea , in old day in korea , there were more peopl who were not student and also school work were not hard . last but not least , some young peopl want to help their commun . for exampl , help and take care of elderli peopl or children . howev , i am not sure about other countri , but in korea , parent usual do not want their children , who are student , to help for their commun . the reason is obviou that they want their children to studi for their futur univers rather than care about their commun . take into account of all factor , peopl are becom more egoist , not onli young peopl , but also their parent and adult . anyhow , we may reach the conclus that the statement is correct .
