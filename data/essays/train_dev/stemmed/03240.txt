comprehens is veri import so ha learn fact . we learn thing everi day but do we all understand them ? if you can easili rememeb fact then it 's great but onc you know them will you be abl to realli understand them ? i am not so sure . if someon know by heart the whole histori of a countri but can not make connect between fact then it did n't realli help him to know the inform . if he understand it then he could possibl imagin what will happen or at least make a chang . of cours he can tell the stori to everyon but if someon ask him whi it happend he will not be abl to answer becaus he himself did n't understand it . on the contrari , if the person understand the concept and idea of the fact but ca n't rememeb it exactli , then i think it 's not so bad . nobodi can rememeb everyth , that 's part of the human be . thi person can alway search for inform . these day , you can easili look at the thing you are interesst in on the internet or with the help of book . onc he will have the inform it will easi for him to make connect with other thing . he will also be capabl to explain it to other peopl . if they do n't understand it the way he explain it then he will find an other way of say it . sinc he understood the concept it will be much easier for him then for the person who learn everyth by heart but did n't understand it . in conclus , i think it is more import to understand idea and concept then to know exactli everyth point by point without know what it realli mean and what he can do with thi inform .
