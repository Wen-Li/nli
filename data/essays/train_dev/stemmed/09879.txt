i do n't agre with the statement becaus of mani reason . one reason could be the lazi of peopl . i think that mani peopl like best move by car than walk , becaus car is more comfort and faster . anoth reason could be that nowaday car are safer than in the past so i suppos that in the futur they will be even safer than now . improv in produc will permitt avoid mani danger and incid , for exampl use super advanc airbag and staff like that . furthermor i can say that the increas of popul could be anoth good reason . i rememb my grandfath 's stori about car . he use to tell me that in the past not mani peopl could afford a car so they were fewer than now . in our societi mani peopl can afford a car , also use strategi like leas or rent . the popul ha expand and migrat from the centr of big citi to the nearbi town , like countrysid or small town . more peopl now need a car to go to work in big citi or even in anoth citi . anoth import reason is the bad qualiti of the public transport . often it is difficult to move from town to town use public transport becaus train are delay or the station is far from home . the subway also is not so effici . sometim it is even unpleas to use public transport becaus it is dirti , or broken in mani way . for all these reason i think that in twenti year there will be more car than today . i think that almost everyon think that drive a car is much more pleasent than take a train . popul will continu to grow up , and in my opinion more peopl mean more car , with all it implic like traffic and pollut .
