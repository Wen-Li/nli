i think that it 's not alway possibl to gener on psycholog topic so , person , i would neither agre nor disagre with the statement . i would rather say that it depend on individu situat . take the case of a success enterpreneur who built up a busi in a steadi industri without take risk , and maxim hi profit thi way . from hi experinc he learn that thing go well without chang . it is unlik that he is inclin to chang hi mind after have success with not take risk . although he 's success ! or take the case of someon specul on stock price . he ha learn , that if you hesit too long , your profit will be below expect sinc stock market underli extrem fluctuat . such a person would take risk if he is success . on the other side there are peopl who are inspir by their success to tri out new thing . they are not satisfi with the goal they reach so far and thu think of themselv as capabl to reach enw horizon . also , as they reach a certain degre of excel , and build up stong basi of exist busi relationship they becom more confid to make a riski decis or tri to walk a new path . there will be alway that `` net '' to catch them if they fall . howev , as person relationship are concern , i think that truli success peopl who are happi with their partner , who have found someon they love , someon to reli upon , are unlik to take risk unless there are desir buri deep insid of their mind . but it such case those peopl are n't exactli success but rather hypocrit . in fact , success is often base on learn from mistak made in the past . the onli way to make mistak and gain experi is actual take risk and tri out new thing . thi would support the idea that success peopl are more open to risk sinc they know that the best learn is often learn from mistak , sometim your own .
