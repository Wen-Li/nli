person , i agre with the statement ` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ' . there will be mani peopl disagre with thi , but there are three major reason to convinc . those three are health , knowledg , and transport . first reason i think thi way is becaus younger peopl have better health than older peopl . i wa play in the beach with my rel . my cousin and i were run , splash , swim , and surf . it wa a lot fun for us , as everyon agre . suddenli , my aunt call us to come out . it wa big surpris for us . she call us becaus my grandfath ha faint . as a result , old peopl ha bad health to enjoy their life . second one is that younger peopl ha differ knowledg than that of older peopl . most of my age ( 14 ) peopl know a lot of entertain place , and fun place . eventu , older ca n't go out broadli , becaus they do n't know mani place to go . thi wa my friend 's grandpar stori . it wa hot sunni day , and they were retir from their work so they ahv a lot of time to go out . so , they want to go out some where , but they could n't . they phone my friend , and ask her where to go , i wa littl bit surpris at first , but i understand that they had differ lifestyl than us back where they were young like us . last reason that i agre with the statement is becaus we have better transport . altough , grandpar have lot of time , some of them can not drive , becaus they had total differ live compar to us . nowaday , most of the univers student can drive becaus it 's wide use , but old peopl did n't have chanc to learn the drive . also , younger one can ride buse , subway , and skytrain . unfortunant , older ca n't go by stand , they have to sit down some where , but sometim public transport doe n't have enough spot for them to sit down . in conclus , young can enjoy life better than older . it doe n't mean that everi elder all like these , but a lot of proport of them are like thi . i think enjoy life when we are young , and enjoy more quieter and relax life is better for elder .
