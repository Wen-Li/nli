the question ha been ask whether it is more import for student to understand idea and concept or for them to learn fact . in my opinion , understand is definatli more import becaus it give the student a progress of explor , a chanc to be creativ and an unforget result . tri to understand idea and concept of a topic alow student to go through the invest process . for exampl , tell student that literaci devic such as metaphor , simili and imageri make write good is not realli convinc . instead , it would be better to let the student explor through differ type of litertur and found out themselv that certain techniqu add to the porfessio of write . understand how they work would give student a better lesson . get the concept and idea also provid student a chanc to be creativ , especi when deal with are . what kind of art class whould it be without studio work ? student should be offer to get creativ with colour , textur , mood and all sort of thing . who care if they fail onc in a while ? new creation found in the process of real understand . year after year , it is not the defin that student rememb , but the unforget experi that they learn . give out the fact doe not provid student a lot of though of their own . by understand the idea and concept , student gain the abil to conclud the fact themselv . even if they forget about the fact , they would be abl to `` reproduc '' them . fact is the devil that limit imagin and understand . thoma edison would be abl to invest without know the idea and concept of scienc veri well .
