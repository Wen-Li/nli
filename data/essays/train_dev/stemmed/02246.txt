* in my opinion it is better to special on one subject rather than mani academ subject but at the same time we should have a littl basic knowledg about the other subject too . it is alway better to have an indepth knowledg about one particular subject and be an expert in it or els the person will obivi be `` jack of all and master of none '' . have indepth knowledg in a particular subject will obvious make a person skill in that field and he / she can concentr and contribut the best toward that particular subject . i agre that the world today is rapidli progress in everi field . i howev total donot deni that we should not have ani knowledg about ani other subject rather the the one in which we are special becaus the world is grow too fast and if we are not awar of the develop take place then we will obvious be like a frog in a well . a person ha to be dynam enough and should be awar of all the field and shouldnt be an alien to a new subject . a dynam person in my opinion is a person who should be abl to talk about the comput at the same time should also know what the green hous effect is . given a littl math we should be abl to that as well becaus these are the basic which everi person ha to know . we human are social be and when move around in societi we meet peopl from differ field . when we convers with each other we should be abl to convers on ani subject though we may not essenti be an expert in it . i would like to conclud say a person should have a sound knowlegd of everi subject but at the same time he should also be an expert in one subject atleast .
