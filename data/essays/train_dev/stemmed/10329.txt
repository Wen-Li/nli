in today 's world the younger gener is seen as careless and and lazi . often we hear parent talk about how they do n't understand the life their children live and how they do not have ani ideolog they strongli believ in , like the one they had in the sixti wich were all about respect and help . as a young person i believ that i have some prospect on the situat nowaday . it is true that in the past year young peopl were more interest in music and their friend , especi in the ninete where music becam more angri with group like nirvana and metallica that had veri neg imag to show their audienc . thi violent reaction wa in part due to the fact that the imag they had of past gener wa not great . for exampl the hippi period in wich most of their parent live in wa long gone and all their ideal had been abandon , therefor `` peac and love '' wa n't a refer ani more becaus it had been a failur , so they had to find a new way of express themselv and tri the complet opposit . howev today more and more teenag are feel respons for the world they live in . they are now awar that they have a respons toward the futur and take more time to consid the possibl offer to them . of cours some are still unconsider and uninterest but other are make chang . we see a lot more humanitarian organis run by young adult , for exampl in my school there are three project that involv fundrais and the educ of other on the issu of the world like poverti and global environ and all of them were found and are run by student . thi show teenag help improv their surround and commun becaus they becom more respect and involv . it is therefor a mistaken idea to think that the younger gener is becom wors everi day . it ha over the year experienc differ way to portray itself and these changement have been essenti for the futur gener becaus it will give them an idea about the risk of go to the extrem and result from that will be a more balanc and help group of young peopl .
