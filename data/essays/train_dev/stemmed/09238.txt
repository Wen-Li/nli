nowaday , peopl are get busier and busier with their own bussi , especi the young peopl who are fight hard for their futur . as a result , there come the critic that the young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . in my opinion , thi statement is groundless and the youngster today do contribut to their commun to a great extent . to begin with , we will first look at the commun servic organis by variou school . take singapor as an exampl , it is compulsori for each student to accomplish a minumum time of 10 to 30 hour of commun servic each year , depend on differ school and differ level of educ . the servic includ help out in old folk ' home , organ chariti event and so on . it ha great contribut to the commun consid the size of student popul . and not onli singapor , school in other countri have similiar polici as well to make the student contribut within their abil . secondli , mani work young peopl today are voltunt in variou organizait such as hospit and kindergarten . besid donat their money , they also spend a lot of time in take care of the patient or children and gain a deeper understand of their need . in fact , from my experi of be a volunt , some institut actual depend on these young peopl as an effect human resourc . and each volunt spend about 3 to 5 hour per week in these voluntari job . lastli , there are mani other minor area that the young peol make contribut on . for instanc , to help the neighbour children with their school work is a form of contribut . and everyon may have attend some performc for chariti purpos , and that is help hi commun too . therefor , i believ that it is unfair to say that the young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . the help in variou form can be easili seen in everi aspect of our life . actual , i think the young peopl have done a great job in help out their commun .
