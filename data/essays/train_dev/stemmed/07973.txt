first of all i would like to approv my opinion on thi statement . thi is just what i would like to talk about , peopl who take risk and tri new stuff tend to get more success in their life , on the other hand peopl who tend to be close mind and onli do what they know and in the same way over and over again , thi would improv them at all . when peopl tri new thing they discov new inform , they allow themselv to think differ , to act differ , not onli would it help himself , it would also have great chang on the countri . thi type of behaiviour is what we call a part of leadership . when peopl do what they alreadi know how to do well and keep on do it over and over again , that would not help them at all , becaus they are do the same pattern , without interact with new featur and by that they are n't learn . in case of newton , we would n't have known today how to measur forc and gravit field if it wa n't for hi discoveri and hi dessiv state of mind . in other word if newton have n't tri and exper the stuff in differ way , he would n't have done what he did . scientist are tri realli hard these day to find a cure to canser and they are tri new stuff and thing and take risk , in order to do the best they can to get to the cure asap . in my point point of view i would take risk and tri new thing to get to the best state of knowledg i can get to . i am work so hard at the moment , tri new stuff and hope to becom a great man someday , hope soon . my advis to you all is to experi new thing and tryout stuff u never imagin your self do it . you never know what might be the thing that you would end up with .
