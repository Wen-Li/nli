i am in complet agreement with the given statement `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . idea and concept are veri import and they act the sourc of gener conscienc in human be . i feel so becaus understand idea and concept is far more import than just learn fact onli . if a student is clear about the concept and idea behind a phenomenon than it will hardli take a second to learn the fact . it is concept and idea that give rise to fact or one can say that fact is denouement of idea and concept . to clearli undersatnd take an exampl of `` fall of a hurl ball on the ground '' . thi fall of a ball on ground is a fact but the forc of graviti and the phenomenon of gravit come under idea and concept behind thi fact . so just learn that a hurl ball fall on ground is trivial as compar to the concept of gravit . also learn fact doe not count to intelligentia , one shuld have logic think and innov idea to get success in ani field . logic think is the path to success . and logic think develop onli when one think innov idea or mere idea , so one should think newer and newer idea to solv a problem . think innov idea lead to logic think and reason . as everybodi is famili with the milieu of competit , so to surviv and compet in thi competit environ the student shoould be ancourag the student should be encourag to go for understand of idea and concept instead of learn of fact onli . if the student are good then the institut will also succeed and definit the countri too . so to make futur gener better and competit the student should be encourag to understand idea and concept rather than mere fact onli .
