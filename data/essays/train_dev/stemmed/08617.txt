in the modern societi , mani thing have chang compar to the past . the korean trdition for hlepe other have dissap but instead we develop a new way of help our commun . so i disagre with the opinion . there are three reason whi i dissagre with the opinion . first , the tradit way of help other have chang into variou type . for exampl if you dial a certian number you can donat small amount of money or there wa thi event i went . it 's the program to feel the starvat , uncomfort hous and all the pain that the children in the third world countri are giong through . i donat some money and starv for 24hour . by do thi i help a child to eat three month of nutriti meal . so even though i did not visit a orphanag and did the clean and read children stori i help my commun . second , the student have nowaday have to serv their commun at least 20hour to go to high school or univers . mani peopl say that the true mean of help other is what come out from your heart not the grade . but becaus of thi system i learn the joy feel of help other . after than i did more of the help commun more than the school requir and i stare to get involv in mani chariti group and jion unicef . third , becaus of christian , mani student donat their money when they go to church and particip in activi to help the other in their commun . for exampl , my friend goe to church everi weekend to give food for the homeless in park . it is not onli christian that encourag help other mani kind of realigion encourag student to serv the commun . just becaus some tradit ha chage it doe n't mean that the young peopl do not give enough time to help the other . so becaus of these three reason i disagre with the opinion .
