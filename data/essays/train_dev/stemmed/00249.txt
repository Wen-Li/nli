although it may seem like young peopl do not contribut to the develop of their societi as much as in the old day , i strongli believ the opposit . in my opinion , daili life and social issu have becom so interrel that it is difficult to distincli see the youth 's contribut to his/her societi . consequ , youngster help their commun in the form of join social affili , take activ role in polit discuss and even work while they take part in educ activ . one way that youngster contribut to the well-b of their societi is through commun work they do in their free time . it is possibl to see mani univers student voluntarili particip in club where they have the opportun to help children , peopl with disabl and peopl who are in need . anoth solid exampl of youth 's contribut to the societi is their desir in express their polit opinion and take the necessari action . in my opinion , a strong societi is the one in which polit can exceed the wall of the parliement . in the countri where i live , young peopl form activ group to contribut to the well-b of their countri . thu , their contribut can not be neglect . final , it is not so difficult to come across univers even high school student work on part-tim job . to be more specif , half of my friend are both work and studi . consid the time they need to alloc for their studi , work while studi is not an easi task at all . thu , it should deserv the societi 's appreci . by do so , the youth make a signific contribut to the economi of their commun . there are variou exampl suggest that the youth is still activ help their commun . thu , it would be wrong to thing that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . it is just that they do it in a differ manner than the usual .
