at least i disagre with the statment say : `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' . to support thi idea let us explain whi it is import to specif in one subject . for exampl , when the student enter to the univers he should select one major and he should be specif in that major . when the student gradut from the univers he will get a job . as we know that in most of the jobe everyon ha specif assign in specif field . more than thi , when you get the assign , you should know all detail which are relat to the assign . if you are not specif in on major or you are take brod knowledg you will not finish or you may face some difficulti to do the assign . as a result if that , to choos one major or to be specif in one subject is better that to have broad knowleg to underst whay the student should specifi in one major . anoth exampl to illistr the idea of be specif in one fiel or in one subject is in the research field . for exampl , most of scintect are specifi in one subject and no one can invent new thing unless he specif in one subject . fore instantc , the scintect newoen wa major in physic and he would not find hi role `` newten role '' unless we wa in the phisyc fild . anoth exampl in thr write brother , as we knoe they are specifc in aerospac engin and they would not invent haw to flay until they are search and specifi in the aerospac field . as a concolus to be specif in one fiel is veri import that to be in other
