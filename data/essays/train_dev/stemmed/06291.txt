it 's all about the way of learn , everi teacher can learn hi student but not everyon can put get understand student could imagin what did he speak about . learn use fact are so import caus they are easier to be understood than idea & concept , becaus it 's more realist for ani human to understand fact that happen or seen , in chemistri lectur , student take some inform about cheimcal reaction , it 's effect , color obtain , vapor & so on .. but they will never understand what the professor mean until they went to the laboratori , & do the experi so they can see the idea & concept of their professor , then it 'll be easier to understand what did they took it is a fact for them , on the other hand , idea & concept took less time from the teacher to learn but mayb take more time from the student to memor , it 's away from hi think , it 'll be a kind of what call `` brain fill '' which make the student tire & easili forget it . but not all the studi could be relat with fact or we have fact with it , so idea & concept will be the major for those studi , in astronomi it 's hard to see everyth about those away planet or star from the earth but the idea & concept could work to explain thing it 's mayb imposs to have fact about but it 'll not be as clear as fact but it 'll do the work . as a chemist i think than studi relat to fact could be easier to understood & harder to be forgitten in contrast with the studi depend on the idea & concept
