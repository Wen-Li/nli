in my opinion succesful peopl ca n't be mesur by the quantiti of risk they take , becaus a man that doe not take ani risk and focus on do what he know he doe veri well , can be as succes as a man that focus onli in take risk and tri to experi with new thing everyday . but use my person knowledg i can say that each risk you take is an oportun to win , while each risk you avoid is an oportun that goe away from you hadn . as an exampl i can say about a friend that own a pizza store , he wa alway tri new way of mix ingredi to produc the best pizza hi custom could have ever eaten . thank to hi persever , thi friend invent the best pizza in my citi , and after that , with the money he made with the pizza he invent , he tri to invent a snack everybodi would buy , and now he is known as luigi , the father of the hawaian pizza and the french fri which ha help him to open hi own pizza compani . anoth good exampl is my father 's life . he , as far as i know , wa the owner of a great compani that use to produc the most comfort tenni shoe arond the world . until the day he went bankrupt . hi compani broke up becaus , one day my father had to take a veri import desicion , unfortun he chose the easi road and he did n't want to risk a lot . the desicion he had to take wa n't dificult at all , but becaus he wa a person that hate get out of the road he know , and dislik get into unknown road , he took the wrong desicion and it led him to the bankropt . after that he ha chang hi behavior a lot . so , as a conclus i can say that take risk is the best way to live thi life .
