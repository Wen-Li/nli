i disagre with the follow statement which is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the reason are been shown next paragragh . the first of all , lean fact can halp student understand easili about what do they know the idea and concept . becaus whatev how mach they understand idea and concept , but if they can not ue thoe in the fact . the konwleag which is what do they get will be uesless . the most inport is how to ue the idea . the second , lean fact derectli effect stendent to be success easili when thay graduat from their school . the raeson is more fact which they learn can help student to think a lot about the situat . from the fact which they learn , they could get the great idea about how to conturl or hand out the fact which they encount . final , lear fact can get more ues idea than the idea which they understand and concept from other . becau the idea which the student understand and concept from other are still other . i mean the idea are not the student ' experi just idea . but the fact which are all from the real situat are been uesd in the socirti . in the conlus , i think the student learn fact are more ues than understand idea and concept from other .
