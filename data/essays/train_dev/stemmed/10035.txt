the issu at hand is whether or not young peopl give enough time to help their commun . thi is an import topic becaus it relat to the commun develop . in my opinion young peopl help their commun in mani way which certainli consum their time . a main reason for view is that young peopl often come out to help their commun in the time of disast . for exampl if an earthquak hit a particular area then youn one come out in that area to collect the money from all over the world . they advertis it in the paper , on internet , in tv and everywher other possibl place . not onli that the earn young peopl give their salari to help their commun . to organis and collect money for such nobl caus , it certainli demand time . thu the young peopl are give their valuabl time to help their commun . anoth reason for my point of view is that young peopl devot lot of time in reasearch and for carri out innov . for exampl if the old person doesnot hear properli then young one right from the day of their cihildhood think of invent someth that can help the older peopl hear more properli . mani of them carri out such invent also . it 's also a sort of devot time toward the commun help . in thi way also , they devot time toward help their commun . lastli , young peopl manytim carri out demonstr in case some epedem spread in an area . they , in the even or some other suitabl time , go and tell their peopl of the commun what precaut should be taken to avoid the spread of such epedim . mani young peopl just volunt to the govern aid servic in such case on their own . such kind of act from the young one show that they care their commun and they devot their preciou time for help their commun . in sum young peopl care their commun a lot . they help their commun in one way or other . all such activ certainli demand time . on the whole young peopl apart form carri out their duti devot their preciou time toward help their commun .
