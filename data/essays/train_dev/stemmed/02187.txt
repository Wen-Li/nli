i disagre the statement `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . i would like to present few reason and exampl to justifi my opinion . in present scenario the use of car ha been increas day by day . the first and one of the import reason for the increas use of car is urban . with the increas of the urban the use of car ha been increas proport . i guess the scope for urban increas by a good extent within the next twenti year which further increas the use of car . secondli , peopl got use to the luxuri of travel in a car and also the advantag of it . car with more featur and util are be introduc competit . these car increas the comfort level and also save their time . there are a few car which can even prevent accid by their sensor , which can also give the detail of the locat that you are in . so peopl get attract by these addit featur of the car and thu lead to the increas use of the car , there may be an argument that twenti year later most of the activ of the peopl may be complet through the use of internet . but peopl never stop themselv from go out and have faun travel distanc , meet their friend person etc . one more fact is that there are veri few reason for the decreas in the use car like to control air pollut , to diminish the traffic on the road etc. , which would be of less import to peopl when compar to the need of the car by them for their person activ . if we consid a decreas in the use of car then what are the mean of transport ? the use of motorbik , buse , railway , airway must be the altern which my not be as comfort as use car . so i conclud that there is a veri less scope for the decreas in the number of car in twenti year from today .
