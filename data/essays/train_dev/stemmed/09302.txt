`` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do. '' , is that kind of phrase one can often hear in modern , western countri , where enjoy seem to be one of life biggest goal . wheather thi is true or not it will all come down to the point of defin and measur `` joy '' . but let me approach thi matter step by step . it might seem natur and obviou to believ in thi simpl sentenc becaus of the physic and mental abil of young peopl . they are healthi , strong , flexibl and abiti to conquer the world , make invent , found famili and mani more import faktor of life . but is thi realli a joy ani time ? they are often fight their hectic and fast environ and get quickli older , visibl in burnout , psycholog problem , affect for drug usag and crime . i would agre that young peopl have an higher interest in their environ in gener , but it doe not say if thi interest to creat , explain and domin is joyou or a need , meybe genet predetermin . how about older peopl ? when we hear thi we might think of those tie into bed , unabl to eat and care for themselv . but if you think twice you can find a lot of older peopl , who are happi with a slower live . my grandpar still travel more foreign countri a year i could even afford . other write book and give their experi to the younger gener . we should not be mislead by the idea of `` maxim joy '' in term of spend more money , do more extrem activ and so on is alway desir . to summar it i might be allow to refenc to kant , a german philosoph . more than 200 year ago he wrote , it is never possibl to defin a overwhelm good wich account for everybodi but everybodi shall have the right within certain border to find hi own satisfact ( quot rater freeli ) . therefor i am tempt to say thi question is to be answer indivu . of cours we can discuss it , but the answear tranfer into real polit will quickli show veri unpleas result i assum .
