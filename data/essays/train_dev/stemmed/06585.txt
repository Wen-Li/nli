undoutedli i would say that i agre with the statement given here that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . my first reason is , as we go to a new place , we may not be know how the place is , how will the behaviour of the peopl look , what their cultur is , what their custom are , what their tradit is etc . if we go to some latin american countri , we may find some difficulti in understand their languag and also we ca n't understand their accent even though they speak english . for exampl , suppos that you plan to go to franc , the languag the peopl speak there is french , you may not understand french where you need a guid . second reason is , if the place you plan to tour a histor place with out a guid , you finnali end up with the rocki structer you see there . as each histor place ha a histori behind it , the main purpos of visit is to know it histori , a guid is right person to explain it for you . for exampl when you go on a tour to egyptian pyramid , you may not know who build them , how they are build , but if you have a guid with you he can help you explain all these detail . after all you deriv a lot of thrill and in turn a great happi by know all these detail . on the contrari when you tour alon or with you kith and kin who do n't know anyth about either the place or the histori you can not enjoy the place just becauc you do n't know the detail and there will be everi possibl of get detour . when you encount a mysteri inscript scribbl on stone you alon on your own can not decod them in order to enjoy the trip to the fullest extent . have consid all the reason given about i would say that i strongli agre with the given statement .
