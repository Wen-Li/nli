i completli disagre with thi statment . i truli beliv life can be enjoy by a person of ani age . first of all i beliv that just like their are allway differ view of life their are also differ way of enjoy life . for exampl for a kid , a life full of joy may be deffin bye the abil to run and play . for a teenag joy may be in the art of be in love or take risk and learn . then again an elder may expiri the same ammount of joy than a young person just bye lay down on a hamac on a sunni afternoon to rememb beutiful time , or to read hi favorit novel . for exampl if i wa an elder i would love to recal my past expiri whith woman and tell them to my grandson . and the stori of grandma and i to my grandought . and then again as i am young their is the beuti of learn and expirienc what i will later tell my grandchildren . their is a time for everyth and in these time you may enjoy life in manni differ way .
