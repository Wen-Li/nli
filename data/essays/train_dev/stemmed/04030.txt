now i know that i 'm young and i think thi life stage is the most joy , interest , and excit than other . such as stage , twenty-year-old piriod , i think there is a lot of stimul thing . also young peopl have much more energit than older peopl . do older peopl go clube ? i do n't think so . but in each life stage , there is a lot of suitabl thing to pepl . in thi time , my opiniom is young peopl enjoy life than older peopl do . i think most of pepl think older peopl have alreadi done ani enjouy thing but my opinion is not like that . of cours , some older pepl are enjoy their life with much more energit power than young peopl . but what i want to say is the amount of time that young peopl spend more than older peopl do . now we have realli a lot of time . and also older peopl sometim say do whatev you want as earlyer as you can do . that is , i think , one of answer in thi discuss . i think in each stage there is also desir , but they ca n't afford to do what they actual want becaus of no time . i think if older peopl who are marrig , it is more difficult than they are not . on the other hand , in my countri , japan , the popul of older peopl is increas . it is kind of seriou problem in the societi . but real older peopl , eighty-year-old , have their free time and relux place in the public . we have to care about middl of older peopl . they are live just work . it is the biggest proglam .
