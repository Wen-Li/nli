as per my point of view it veri difficult to say that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alredi know how to do well . but , ye i can explain in a proper manner that whi it is difficult to say anyth . accord to the abov given part of the statement i must say that it total depend on the natur , think , experi . so , now whatev the term i am use it that is a standard term through which you can scrutin the follow thing of an individu person . let start with a natur of a person and for thi we can take an exampl like . suppos you are a market manag of a compani and there are 40 pepol under your observ and as we know that it a cut throat competit , and moreov , you have an immedi boss , to whom you report everyday . now , the question aris if your natur is to make out the work in a abras manner from your employe , becaus you know that you have a big resposibilti to make your busi at the top level then you ca n't even do that as per the current scenario . what you can do you should tri to sit with your employe to feel them that they have not come here to work onli in fact , they are the part of the famili . second , if we talk about think then we can say it is bit similar with a natur part to some extent . the way you think it realli matter not onli as a market manag , appar , to see the propectu for employe also . now , we come to the last part that is an experi of a person , as we know that `` practis make a man perfect '' the same rule impli here , becaus if a person ha a lot of experi in a particular field then obvious he would not hesit to take ani type of risk in our futur , becaus he know veri well that if someth happen wrong then he know to handl it and to just modifi or rectifi an error so that he will not face dilemma on hi way . at last , i would like to say onli few thing or to conclud the whole part that `` success pepol tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' ye some peplo do thi or some may be not . but , if ye if i would be on that posit i 'll do take a risk and even we should take it becaus no one can surviv or can stick with one posit . .. make your life happi or enjoy we should take risk , becaus it a part of life without risk i do n't think so life ha such a mean .
