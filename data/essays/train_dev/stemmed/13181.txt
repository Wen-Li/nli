the question say that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than now . i agre with thi afferm and i consid the pollut the main caus . in our day there is more pollut than in the past that is caus by industr . for thi reason the ozono whole grow up day for day and with it the ultraviolet light that are nociv fot our health . to resolv thi issu , we must decrement air pollut and the car with other mean of trasport , for exempl train , are the main caus . if we wont clean air we must use other mean of travel that respect the environ such as bycycl . anoth way to reduc pollut is the minor use of train and expeci car that can be use by less peopl than train and for thi reason are less effici than other mean and more noumeros . for thi reason i think that thi great number of car , must be decrement if we wont resolv the problem of pollut . in mani citi the car can be use onli for few day at week , thi is an import thing that bring me to believ that in the futur i will can use onli train or other mean as train that can be transport more than one parson for time . onli in thi way we will can have a clean air , a clean environ , a clean sea but not onli becaus onli in thi way we will be more healti and so expeci less ill becaus mani sick are caus by pollut of car train and so on . by
