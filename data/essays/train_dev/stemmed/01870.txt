i agre with the statement for a sever reason : 1. one may not success at the first tri , but eventu if one keep tri , one will encount success . unsuccess peopl do n't realiz that success take time and effort . they want it to be done at the first time , and that doe not alway happen ! there are sever stori about inventor who did not give up and tri sever time , even thousand of time ! the inventor of the light bulb is one that come to my mind . imagin what would have happen if he would have given up after all those tri ! but he kept tri and tri until he did it ! of cours , that doe n't mean to get stuck with someth that doe not work , which take me to the second reason whi agre with the statement . 2. i think success peopl know when to chang , or tri a differ approach . if someth is not work , then know when to quit and tri it in anoth way ! do n't give up but do n't obsess either . mayb take a break and look it at a differ angl . like the chemist who could not figur out the chemic composit of an element , and discov it dure a dream , when he dream of a snake bite it tail . 3. life is constantli chang , and one can not stay the same without chang . new technolog are develop on a daili basi , and you can not lock yourself in a shell and pretend chang is not happen outsid . whether you like it or not , you have to tri new thing , or you 'll stay behind . that 's what success peopl do . 4. peopl fear that if they take risk they will loos the few thing they have now . but they fail to realiz that they are have a major loss with the cost of opportun for not use your resourc and take a risk . they would gain much more if they were will to risk what they have or their time . 5. also , in addit to these reason , success peopl know when to ask for help , and work in a team . one can acomplish more if one ha support from other peopl .
