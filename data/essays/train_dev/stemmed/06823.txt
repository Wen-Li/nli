when peopl visit unknown place for them , they like to know import thing of the place , obtain relev inform about it , etc . that is whi they join a group led by a tour guid , and that way they are sure they will not miss anyth of the place they are visit . but it is not the onli way to travel to unknown place . that is whi there are backpack , rambler and day trip . i am nor a bakcpack nor a rambler but i think that when you travel with a tour guid your option are consider limit . i do not agre with the statement becaus i think peopl should have the freedom of find some more thig about the place they are travel to , but on their own . for exampl , a tour guid will take you to the most popular place of the citi but on the same rout he or she take everybodi . that is , in my opinion , what the problem is : you are be taken to the same place everybodi doe and then the guid describ it for you in the same way he or she describ it to everi singl person . that is where your option begin to decreas in number . accord to that , i think it would be better to visit some place on your own , see what you want to see , know what you want to know and admir what you want to admir . it is an excel option sinc everyon is differ and some place may be more worth to visit than some other and so on . for exampl when i went to cartagena thi year ( without a guid ) , i did not want to visit the same place everyon visit ; i want to go through the `` old citi '' by myself and on foot and in the process i saw some thing that can not be seen with a tour guid becaus they are not found in well-known place of the citi ; one exampl of it is the contrast between some of the most luxuri restaur of the citi and the poberti just in front of the restaur 's door . . even though i have not experi what a trip is with a guid , i am happi visit what i want in the place i travel to . to conclud i would like to say that travel with a tour guid is a monotonu way of travel , special if you are look forward to know not common or unusu but still interest thing of a citi . i think plan your own trip is a way to break that cycl , and everyth that break the cycl for the better , must be good .
