mani peopl complanain that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in my opinion thi is thrue becaus thi is the way compani use to incit peopl buy their product , and thi is how peopl can onli know about new product . first of all , when compani make the advertis for it product , it want to make sure that the product look perfect on the eye of the puplic . for exempl , if the compani make differ type of product , it will make the advertis of the perfect one . compani ca n't show their weak for their own product becaus there will no one who will buy . second , advertis is the onli one way that peopl will know about new product . for exempl , when the compani want to send the new product on the market , it use advertis . appear the compani want to incit peopl for buy it product that is whi it will make it unbelievab on the advertis in order to make peopl think that thi product is so good . from thi you can understand that most of the time the present of mani product on advertis is realli differ from how they realli are . the compani are so clever when they make these advertis becaus they want to incit peopl .
