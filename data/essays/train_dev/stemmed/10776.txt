it is true that nowday young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . i think that thi is an effect of a lot chang of the world . in fact in the past young peopl help their famili in some work , such as to clean their room , to do their bed and so on . in thi way a young boy could develop your sens of respons and so he also learn to help their commun . perhap thi is imposs today , becaus young peopl have mani thing to do and they are involv in mani activ . if we think that today young peopl spend the major part of their time at school or that they spend their time play videogam or watch tv , it is simpl to understand thi chang . i think that for young peopl is not import play or studi onli . they should learn to love the natur and should spend more time out . in thi way they could help their commun clean the wood or organ some event to involv the children or old peolp of their commun for exampl . to do thi , it is import that the govern give the structur to creat and to develop thi type of societi . for me thi aspect of societi is veri import becaus if we want a societi in that all peopl can be to help for anoth peopl , it is import to develop thi sens of respons in all young peopl . in fact for me it is not nice a societi in that everyon think onli himself .
