when i wa 16 year old i travel with my mother all around europ . she paid to a travel agenc to have a guid in our trip . that adventur wa amaz ! if i would have the chanc to experi the same situat , i would not have second thoght about pay a tour guid again . so i am complet agre with the idea of travel in a group led by a tour guid . first of all , i am agre with pay someon to show me around becaus it is the best way to visit everyth in a citi , in which i do not know anyth about it . furthermor , thi guid can show me the histori , the monument , the anegdot , tradit restaur and place to parti , and all of these for the same price ! for instanc , in the trip that i mencion at the begin , the one that i did with my mother , thi guid show us everi singl place of franc ; actual my mother went by her self three year befor we did and thank thi guid she learnt new more thing about pari . second of all , if i travel with a guid tour i am go to be save becaus thi person suppos to know the right way at the best time to visit the citi so i do not have to worri about which rout should i take to not surpris my self with ani problem . to summar i prefer to travel with a tour guid becaus i think that it is the best way to learn thing about a new place . in addit , a person is better than a book , becaus ani question you have she or he can answer it at the moment and also the person experi of a tour guid are more interest that the onc that you can find in a book .
