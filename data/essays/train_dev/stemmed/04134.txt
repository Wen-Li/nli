for the most student it is most import to understand concept and idea . to learn fact is not so import for them . i think if they understand what the concept and idea are about it can be more use for them . becaus if they understand the main idea of someth they can also use it on other topic . for exampl if they understand how the human mechan work they mayb also compar thi with anim mechan which are in some kind like the human . so if they onli learn fact about the human mechan they can not compar it with other mechan . and if student onli learn the fact they may not understand them . thi is a disadvantag if they for exampl need to compar the fact with anoth situat . so someth like thi would be more easili if the person realli understand the topic . therefor i can understand the student who say that it is more import to understand the concept than learn fact . anoth point is that the student need not learn so much if they understand the main idea of someth and mayb have learnt to compar thi with other theme or situat . but it is also import to know differ fact about the concept and not onli understand their mean . becaus the more fact someon know the more can thi person explain the idea and the more easili he can compar it with other thing . so i agre with the student but alsoi think it is veri complic to say what is more import mayb it is the solut of ani singl person . the one are better in learn fact becaus they find it veri diffecult to understand an idea without the whole fact about it . the other person for exampl can understand everi concept without problem . the third person may not understand the idea at first but think understandig it is more import than know everyth about it .
