in my openion success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than go in the old fashion or method . there are a number of peopl who use new way and help them to succeed in their life . if they go with the old fashion as they alreadi familiar with in their life , they may go in same way in the career which may not help in the challeng environ . dheerubhai ambani , a great busi person in india use to go in the new unconvent way in hi life aswel as career . it work alot so as a result of it he becam a great person from school teacher son . let we take about googl founder , they didnot gone in a old fashion . even though they are softwar profession , they didnot tri as normal employ . they want to go in a new way and want to take risk . they start with a new idea and now we can see the differ . if all the person go in the tradit way which alreadi excist no new invent will occur . so peopl are go in new way and succeed in their life and in their career . hollywood director also come under thi same group . most of the success director use to present their movi in a differ manner with new idea and some peopl tri to present their movi in the old fashion which alreadi work . `` juras park '' came with thi polici onli . the produc and direcor know that they are do risk but they want prefer to go in the new way and they succeed . eventhough some movi with sori is come now , we rememb onli sephen speilberg , who start the way . eventhough some peopl go in the same rout and succed , we can call them as follow not the initiat . so i strongli agre with the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
