in my opinion , to learn fact is more import to understand idea and concept . becaus learn fact would be practic and memor for student . to understand concept and idea would be the base of learn fact . howev , without learn fact , idea and concept which student understood are noth but their knowledg . first , to learn fact is veri practic . for instanc , when a child wa go to touch a veri hot kettl . hi or her mother would say `` stop ! do not touch ! it is hot and danger '' the child might understand the mean of `` hot '' and `` danger '' as the ida or the concept . he or she might stop their action , although their curios would never disappear . we can say the same thing for the student . when they understood concept and idea about karat , they would think `` karat is not that difficult . '' is that true ? when they onli understand idea and concept in class . they would think that they know everyth about that , but that is not true . second , student could learn fact and they would not forget about that . in japan , we have old word about learn fact and understand idea and concept ; hyakubun ha ikken ni shikazu '' that mean `` when you see it , you will learn everyth in no time and never disappear '' . for exampl , the child who were tri to touch the hot kettl , would reach the kettl and got burnt , he or she would never forget about that . on the contrari , after student learn fact , to understand idea and concept would be easi for them . when they lost at karat match , they would learn the concept and idea about karat veri quickli . even when they won , they would understand the concept and idea whi they won in conclus , understand idea and concept is veri import for student . yet , without learn fact , their knowledg can not be practic and memor .
