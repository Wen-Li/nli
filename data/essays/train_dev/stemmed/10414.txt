everi peopl want to get as much enjoy as he can get from hi life . one of the main factor that affect the level of thi enjoy is the age of the person . i think young peopl enjoy life more than older one sinc there are more facil for them and they are less directli concern with mani problem that come with age level . to begin with , there are mani entertain facil in today 's world for young peopl such as night club , sport club , danc club and so on . the primari reason behind thi fact is the market ' concern about the young peopl that they are more energet and more attract for entertain product and servic . secondli , young peopl tend to be more individualist . they have a tendenc to think of themselv rather than their famili . they go to parti , enjoy their colleg educ etc . they have littl concern for money , sinc their parent pay for their expens or they are grant scholarship . on the other hand when peopl becom older , sever differ concern aris . older peopl should think of the financi situat of the famili member , educ of their sibl , hous expens and surviv after retir . some peopl may argu that age doe not matter in term of enjoy life by claim there are mani opportun suitabl for everi age group . although i agre to thi claim to a certain extent , i think there are some physiolog and psycholog constraint that prevent them from do what they want to do . ill and be tire of life can be given as an exampl . to sum up , i can easili say that young peopl 's have much more facil for entertain and be confront with less problem make them enjoy their live more .
