i must total disagre with the given statement . in my opinion , in twenti year we will still be use car as our main way of transport . i will tri to summar the differ argument that i think are essenti for support my postur . first of all , evid show that countri and cultur of the second and third world are begin to be a relev parti in the car market , as we may see in countri like china or india , which are even develop their own industri , produc cheap car for the popul of their countri . thi will evid result in a relev rise in the number of car , as most of these countri have larg popul . secondli , even if some may say that public transport in western countri ha been tri for year to be a subsitut for car , the truth show that famili spend more money than ever in the purchas of car , and mani of them own more than one , or even two car . in addit , and as a consequ of the recent rise in oil price , mani car-industri are launch model call `` hybrid '' , whose main characterist is that they do not depend total on petrol , but combin fuel with other altern sourc of energi , like water , electr batteri or even litter . as thi model begin to spread all around the world , the problem of the oil price will be partial solv , and the pollut that is today affect our environ will diminish . last but not least , fliy ha turn over the past year into a more than unconfort way of travel . due to current world instabl and to intern terror , mani peopl prefer not to take a plane if possibl , not onli becaus the fear of an attack , but becaus the secur control and the more and more frequent baggag loss . thi mean that mani peopl would travel by car when possibl , even if thi result in longer hour . as we can see , there are strong argument that support thi opinion , and even if some may hope that car , and therefor traffic and stress , may someday disappear , it doe not seem to bother most of us .
