in thi topic , it point out that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , in my opinion , i partili agre with the topic , travel by myself or travel in a small group without a guid is also good way although it is perfict to travel with a group led by a tour guid . first , travel in a group led by a tour guid is a good way . when we travel with someon els , we can commun with them , and share what we have seen and the thought we have . anoth reason is that we can be safe when we go to a forest which ha wolf or other anim . a guid can tell us some detail we do n't know if we have littl knowledg of the place where we go , and also , the guid can tell us which is more worthi play while some are not so worthi . so the group travel with a guid can be a good way in travel . nevertheless , sometim we do not need to travel in a group , it may limt my chois . take climb mountain as an exampl , when i go to the mountain by myself , i can climb as fast as i can , howev , if i go with my mother or girlfriend , i must wait for her and go with her in order that she is not too tire , when time is limit , it is better to climb by myself . furthermor , tour guid is not alway have benefit to my travel , mayb the guid tell you someth that you are visit , it will limit your imagin , such as what the stone look like , what the pool look like . and mayb the guid will led you to a hotel much more expens than other so that he can take some backward . so , when i go to travel , my choos depend on the situatin , mayb travel alon , mayb travel with a group ormay be travel with a group led by a tour guid , just choos the best way .
