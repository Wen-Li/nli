actual , recentlli , young peop realli to help their commun . howev , i disagre with the idea that the young peopl nowaday do not give enough to help their commun . i have some follow reason for that . first , it seem that the young peopl dose not have enough time for that and it seem unecessari for them to help the commun . recentlli , from peopl are realli young , their parent and the societi around them requir to studi hard for their futur . some peopl go to cram school and go to public school far from their commun . also , they do not have ani friend in their communti . for them , it is not a good thing to help thier commun becaus there is no merit for them . in my opinion even adoult do not spend time for ther commun . nowaday , there are mani peopl who do not have ani rerationship with their neighborfood . if adoult do not have relat with other in the comunitti , it is unfair to requir to do that kind of thing for children , becaus adoult alway should show the good way to live and the children are the tend to imit what adoult do . thu , if peopl want children to help thier commun , they have to showw how and whi it is import and it is need . also , it seem that the situat around the commun itself are cheng . i do not know there is a group work for my commun , so that i do not know how to spend time for my commun and what to do . past time , there are group that work for the commun by correct trash or so on . howev , recentlli these group disapp and i can not find the place work for my commun . so , it is difficult to find someth good for commun that peopl can do . these are the reason that i disagre with the idea that the young peopl nowaday do not give enough to help their commun . in thi way , i do not think children di not giveiv enough to help their commun .
