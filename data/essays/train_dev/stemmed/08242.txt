i do n't realli agre with the statement which say that learn idea and concept is more import than learn fact , becaus i believ both of them are import skill student need to learn to possess dure their learn period , and they both are crucial for those who wish to becom a person who can think critic and creativ . first , i believ that learn idea and concept from previou scholar and great thinker is import for student who have n't possess a fix think style yet . sinc they are still young and changeabl , they can learn thing from other ' idea and belief and find out what kind of idea they would prefer more in and tri to adopt those idea in their own daili experinc . for exampl , a student can tri to examin whether the idea that cooper with other is alway better than work on one 's own is true or not , while he or she use differ techniqu work on a preject . if thi student find out that work togeth is more effici , he or she might want to tri thi method again in the futur . secondli , i think that there are a lot of differ angl we can look at one thing or even an object , which mean that there are a lot of aspect for us to examin a fact when use differ idea and concept . when student learn a fact , they can tri to use their previosly-learn differ idea and concept to look at it . after examin thing from numor aspect , through differ idea and concept , student will start to understand the divers of everi singl fact , and eventu , learn to think critic and flexibl . for eampl , s tudent might find out that work with other is sometim more effici , but there are also a lot of risk he or she might encount . final , it is alway import for everyon of us to have our own set of idea and concept toward thi great univers ; we need to tri to come up with our own think system and develop our uniqu way to examin differ fact . we learn from other ' idea and concept ; we examin these through our daili experi ; we match them with fact to see if they are correct ; and final , we will develop our own way of think . there are the reason which make me believ that both learn idea and fact
