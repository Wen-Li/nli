although there are sever debat about how peopl bacom success , i am realli support that success peopl alway prefer tri new idea to do what they know exactli . there is noth to do with someon who insist on be what he or she is and do n't take risk in order to improv herself or himself . first of all , although peopl do a job veri well , thay can not be success becaus of their lack of imagin . they usual make same thing in same way everi day . on the other hand , peopl use their imagin and invent differ method for do a job are usual the best posit in the compani . for exampl , there are sever peopl work in a compani but there is onli one major and thi major ha alreadi make a differ with other employe . in addit , peopl continu do someth in the same way ' they can not recagnis other facil . for instanc , if sakip sabanc who wa the most sucessful businesman in turkey did not realis peopl need oil rather than sock , he would not be the most success businesman in turkey . he start to work by sell sock but he did not continu the work becaus he realis a good work which he could earn more money . thi wa a risk for him but he did not hesit about take risk and he becam the most sucess businesman in turkey . accord to the aforement , in essanc , sucess peopl are alway make someth in differ way becaus if they insist on go old-fashion way they can not recognis other facil . even thougi they realiz facil , if they can not take risk , they can not be sucess and also it is not possibl that they improv themselv .
