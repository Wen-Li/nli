i would total agre that most advertis make item appear much attract than they realli are . the most impart reason is that market make use of or subconci feel and desir . anoth reason is that product show just conveni aspect of a product rather than a natur mix of disadvatag and advandateg . first of all the success of a product is determin bz it advertis . initi the product is just a product , an object which ha mani similar competitor . but when the market section begin the product develop to a subject which incorpor a specif feel or soul . let me explain thi examplatorili . when for instanc nike tri to sell some new shoe thez are firstlz noth than shoe . and what make them differ from other shoe ? and how are peopl abl to distinguish them from other ? the companz which advertis the product tri to arous a awar of a specif group in societi like e.g. young basketbal player . the advertis tri to give their product a soul or feel which automat rise in a person who see thi product in the media . thu the adveertis attemp to render their custom an opportun for identif with theri product . in thi case we can imagin a young boz sit in front of hi tv and watch thi new ad and feel the same as the peopl in the ad feel . so , it is possibl that whenev he get thi feel he rememeb those nike shoe he saw last time on tv . base on thi exampl i would saz that product seller make to a certain extant use of the feel and thought of their custom . the custom watch these kind of ad and absorb the messag behind it unconsci , which can lead them to buy a product without know whi . i think that thi depict that we are somehow control by the ad and the media . and thi is realli scare me that i 'm unconci do thing i would n't do under normal circumst . anoth exampl which show that ad make product seem better than they are , is the success market of alcohol and cigarett . we all know that these product are heyard to our health and can caus death but especi young peopl are capabl of be seduc by these kind of ad . the do n't show the inconveni of smoke like it smell or unsoci but more import is that thez do n't show the hayard effect thi item could ahv on our health . besid the inscript on the cigarett packet there is no inform given about impact . in mz oppnion ad just trick custom to buz product which are wors than thez seem .
