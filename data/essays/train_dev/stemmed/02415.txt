when we go outsid we see lot of car around and we easili observ that the number is still increas in a veri rapid rate . we usual think that thi increas will not stop or slow down but i think there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year . to start with ; one thing is veri clear : technolog is improv continu . if we had live 50 year ago , we would not have imagin the level of improv in the life style of peopl nowaday . i do not think that my grandmoth would have thought that i can commun with my friend in unit state by simpli sit in front of a screen and write . everyth is replac by a better thing day by day , even second by second . i have to admit that car are the major way of transport ; but for now . in twenti year , by develop in sever area ; they will be replac by other mean of transport like travel by light or by small plane-lik vehicl . some may think that these idea are extrem and will not happen in twenti year . thi can also be possibl , in twenti year car may still be the major transport vehicl but again there will be fewer car in use than there are today . even if the technolog will not chang our live that much , we can chang it by ourselv . if public transport becom easier and more avail , i think most of the peopl will use public transport instead of their own car which will reduc the number of car significantli . thi is also about someth with the improv of peopl . when peopl stop think individu and think more gener , they will certainli use public transport more and therebi they will reduc the car in the road . as a consequ ; in twenti year fewer car will exist in the road . of cours , we can not predict the futur or say certain thing about certain topic but i think i have reason to believ it . the most import of all , i want to believ it .
