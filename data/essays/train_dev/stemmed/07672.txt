now a day it ha becom a popular belief that the young gener is not help their commun and are rather much more interest in themselv . but i do not agre with thi statement . i beleiv that still there are younger peopl nowday who are help their commun and i am myself involv in that process . let me illustr thi with the help of the exampl , in my colleg we have a societi call nss ( nation social servic ) . as the name suggest thi societi is involv in the social servic . let me explain more about thi societi . it is a societi that is fulli run by the student of the colleg , sometim professor are also interest but they do n't bind or forc ani student to work for that . so thi societi onli ha peopl who are not paid for ani sort of servic . the student are take class and dentot free book to the poor section of the societi who can not sent their children to school and that also free of cost and in their colleg work day . the next exampl is that last month a student of our colleg suffer from the cancer but as the cancer wa in the initi stage it wa beleiv to be cure but due to poor background hi famili wa not abl to afford the expens as they were too big . so what these nss peopl did is , they display notic , went to the room of each and everi student and collect the donat and made donat as much as they can do . the result wa that the student wa success oper and is now recov from the cancer . in addit to all these servic they organis voluntri blood donat camp with the help of red cross societi and in addit to make regular donat they also encourag other student by give some talk and thu help in have the suffici blood in the blood bank so that it can be use in the case of emerg . in order to help poor peopl of the societi , as they themselv do n't have ani fund , they montli go to the student room and collect some old newpap and some other stuff so that that can be sold and can be use to help poor peopl . they also collect some other stuff like old cloth from both professor and student who are will to donat ani . all these servic are just be done by the undergradu of my colleg and it is not onli in our colleg there are sever other school , colleg and organ who are help the commun . all these servic demand time as well as effort and the now more and more youngster day by day are activ involv themselv in serv the societi . although there are some youngster who are not the member of these organ but still they are help by make blood donat and other veri use donat to the societi period .
