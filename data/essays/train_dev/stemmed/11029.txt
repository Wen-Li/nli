i complet agre with the statement , i alway stood by the say that `` varieti is the spice of life '' . thing have to be dynam to be interest . what would you want to watch ? a thunder waterfal or a pool of stagnant water . the peopl who meet success realis thi veri well , even boredom ha to be credit partial becaus gener when you 're bore you tri to find a new sourc for inspir and chanc of an idea turn into innov aris here . sinc money ha been a long time scale to measur success let me use that scale , i say busi . the men who have ventur into new field have excel and have been credit for both their money and idea . that 's one of the major reason that we see that the forb 's list is gener domin by the peopl who have invest and work in new age busi arena rather than traition one . innov doe n't alway call for drastic chang , it not onli about the end product but also about the way in which the product is manufactur ( oper , logist , strategi , tactic etc ) . the gener percept that adventur into unknown territori is more riski than move around your own hous doe n't alway hold . the first person to start a new ventur will have the maximun potenti and the the word exclus play a big part here . a known field is alway full of competit and rivalri - which doe compens the comfort of familiar . so risk as a matter of fact is never absolut and should alway be judg by the magnitud of the outcom that it can trigger . we have to rememb that had the risk taken by peopl have help us advanc . a sailor 's risk result in a great countri , a soldier 's risk result in the end of tyranni and a doctor 's risk result in a save a life .
