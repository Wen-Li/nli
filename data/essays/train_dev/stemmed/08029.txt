lear is a complex process . it includ understand idea , concept , lear process , and get the fact . there are discuss about which is more import dure the lear process . i think it 's more import for student to understand idea and concept than just to know the fact . as is known to all , dure learn , we should not just care about the result , we should also care about the import idea and concept underli the result . we should make clear that we know how we can get the result , that 's how we can go through the understand idea , integr concept , and make derivarit to get the result . nowaday , becaus of the studi competit , student care much about the grade they can get . dure studi , sometim , they just want to get the right answer without know whi it come to thi not anoth . sometim , they even just memor the result as to get the right mark in the test . thi is contradictori with the real goal of lear . fact are import , but the idea and concept we should learn through the process of get fact are more import . so the student should not just satisfi with the right fact , they had better pursu the right process through which we can get the right answer . lear prepar us the background , knowledg and technolog for our futur work . thi includ the idea and concept those are strongli confirm . the fact are just one kind of method to help us understand idea and conept better . the fact for differ situat are differ . even we know the right fact at thi time , if we ca n't master the method and technolog gain from the basic idea and concept which are use to get the fact , we wo n't get success in our futur work . in futur practic condit , everyth is new , everi problem is like a stranger to us . we ca n't use the fact we memor befor to get the conclus , we should tri our best to use the idea and concept we have master to get the new conclus . in conclus , i think it 's more import for student to understand idea and concept than it 's for them to learn fact .
