i am deepli sorri to have to disagre with the statement , special becaus my idea of a better world includ the reduct of privat transport in benefit of public transport . the truth is that i do n't see that happen anytim soon. : ( let 's do the math > first of all , the degre of develop that countri like china , india and other are achiev , will bring access to a huge portion of their citizen to privat transport . even if the rest of the world still would use the same number of car that is current use , that would make the differ . so we can add some hundr of million to the current number of car . .. in the meanwhil , the popul in develop countri keep grow , what lead us to discard the idea of a possibl reduct of vehicl on these develop countri . so we keep ad some million . . the result of the research of altern sourc of energi , if possit , will probabl boost the car sale in the futur . ye , we can still consid them '' car '' even when they do n't run on ga anymor . at that point , have a car will probabl make more sens than ever . the idea of make 500 mile for onli 2 dollar sound definit veri appeal . ttraffic jam could be the onli reason to use public transport by then . our citi will becom more and more overpopul and hard to move through , prove the use of public transport as the most effect way to move around . ye , that probabl will happen , but still we will probabl like to have our own car in the garag to use it dure the weekend . we wo n't resign to that feel of independec and of cours the rest of member of our famili wo n't do as well . so my opinion is that the reduct in that respect wont be veri signif . all that said , my opinion is that the number of car in 20 year will be higher than is now .
