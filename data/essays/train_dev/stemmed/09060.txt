the given statement that `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' is a disput topic . but i would like to disagre with the statement . thi is becaus i believ that in twenti year from now , there will be an increas in the number of car use as compar to what we see today . the most import factor which support my view is the kind of advanc in technolog that we have . i am sure that with develop in the abov feild we will soon have better and improv version of car model . with the grow concern in term of environment pollut caus by car , we will have better fuel save , natur friendli model which will be welcom by all . also it will attract more an more number of peopl to buy such eco friendli car . anoth reason whi i disagre with the statement is that , i feel car are much more convini than other public transport facil avail . and therefor they serv as a better option for convey . henc , as man is more convin orient , in the futur more and more peopl will be encourag to buy car . also , now a day peopl are becom more and more awar of their statu and respect in the societi . and in order to match up with the norm of the societi domin by rich peopl , they follow what other do . so thi attract will to buy car for themselv and therefor contribut to increas in the number . final , i also believ that peopl are becom richer day by day . the class i am discuss is upper middlecalss an d the rich peopl . middl class and otherwis poor peopl can anyway not afford such a luxuri . so with more and more popul have extra money will drive them into look onto for previlig and luxuri . it is veri much possibl that differ member of the same famili will own differ car for their own conveni . so to sum up , i think that newer an improv model of car , their conveni , their statu valu and extra money with the rich peopl will ultim lead to a societi with a greater number of car in use in the come year .
