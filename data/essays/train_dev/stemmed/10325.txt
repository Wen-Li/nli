i agre that student have to understand the idea and concept than to learn fact . if they learn fact they can not properli understand the complet matter they have learn , they just learn about it . by learn fact the student ca n't make a note that where should we use these fact and so . student are now veri effect and when they know the idea and the concept they can clearli understand where these should be use and which concept we use at a proper idea . for exampl we take the topic of the histor event and place . in the text book it will be written about the histor event and the fact about it but the student can not understand the complet concept of the topic . if the student tri to understand complet about the topic by go through the idea and the concept the student can easili understand the topic in hi view . so , in gener view mani concept the student understand by the idea and concept but not by learn the fact . student now easili tri to know the idea and concept they can clearli understand and by learn fact they can onli know about it . but when the student abl to understand about the idea and the concept then the student can properli use the idea what he learnt and improv hi idea in day life . it is more import for the student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . student instead of learn about the fact it better to understand about the idea and the concept . so they can understand all matter what the topic is and can easili follow through the procedur what he learnt by the idea and the concept . lastli i agre the student to understand idea and concept than for learn fact .
