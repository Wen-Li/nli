i am not quit sure about my oppinion on that topic . there are sever advantag and disadvantag on both side . first be a specialist is like a goal you can acchiev , fullfil the dream of be `` the best '' that everyon ha . it is like a motor for work harder . and of cours it need expert for innov . you have to have the time and power to think about new way and to be abl to make experi . specialis ha alway play a veri import role in evolut in gener and moreov in the human evolut . peopl becam expert and share the work . so they got faster and had the knowledg , understand and skill all togeth were n't abl to have . in fact special is the key to our cultur , without it there would be no kind of art . on the other hand one might say that expert are veri good in one singl topic but quit stupid in everyday life . they are depend on other - so there could never be a world full of expert it alway need peopl who work togeth with them , have to share their skill . an other import point is `` have an overview '' . if you have knowledg in variou area you can see the conect , how one thing influenc the other . and you can draw your conclus . you than have the possibl to find surpris answer for problem becaus you don ' t think in the `` ordinari '' way . last not everyon is interest in all the differ academ subject and/or the skill and therefor is n't motiv . in context of educ - as i understand thi question - i would say best way is a combin of both . you first have to know some basic inform and gain skill that are fundament in everi field of academ subject . but when you find out than one topic arrous your special interrest and you have the gift to work in thi field and be good than you should ahv the possibl to spezial . in my opinion you should never stop learn . and in these time you alway have the chanc to ask someon if you do n't understand or do n't know someth . it is veri import to be a `` good ' expert - concentr on what you can do best but do n't forget to look around from time to time .
