i have been to a lot of differ countri in the world becaus of my parent . everi year , we must go to two or three other place for vacat . travel with a group of peopl to other countri is a lot of fun than travel by our own , so that i agre the best way to travel is a group led by a tour guid . i think you do n't realli know what place are valuabl to see , if you are the first time to that place . i think you would get lost so easili . i rememb when i wa a child ( around six or seven year old ) , my parent brough my younger sister and i went to singapor for a trip and it wa the first time we went to travel by ourselv . my parent ask a person that who work in an inform center in the airport for some inform of singapor and where can we visit in there . a few second later , he told us some place we can go and which hotel we can stay in . afterward , we leav the airport and went to the hotel and check-in . in these coupl day , we went a lot of place in singapor , of cous , we took a veri long time to those place becaus we did n't rent a car ; we use transport , such as bu and taxi . at night , it wa so hard to look for a cap , we wait a long time on the street for a cap and go back to the hotel . after thi trip , my parent decid wherev we go to travel , we must join a tour guid becaus it is more convin for us . we do n't have to plan where to go and where to stay , they will schelud for us . in conclus , i will suggest that join in a group led by a tour guid is the best way of travel . i wo n't be travel again without join a tour guid ; they realli help us a lot and save our time .
