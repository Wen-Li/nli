the issu of the reliabl of advertis is controversi due to the impact it ha on consum and author . on the one hand , compani need to advertis their product and creat awar in their target audienc consum 's mind . but on the other hand , the actual market is constantli under pressur , as well as it worker who have oblig regard the compani they belong to . howev , sometim we could argu that enhanc the realiti of a product in order to achiev good result and sell more of it remain strongli uneth . the first reason whi advertis should not make the product they are sell seem much better than it realli is , is simpli becaus they will not attract consum on the long run . inde consum might tri the product onc but if their expect are not fulli satisfi accord to what they saw in the advertis , they will not repeat the buy process . in the same way , by do so , consum will lose faith in the brand which is advertis . as a result they will turn toward more reliabl compani and product . thi could have a veri neg impact on the compani 's result . for instanc , a compani which would claim the efficienti of it wash machin amoung the other on the market without the actual benefit would certainli lose u increas number of it target audienc . as a conclus , i firmli believ that advertis should not allow themselv to lie to their custom so that they will gain consum attent and trial .
