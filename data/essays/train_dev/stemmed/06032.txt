it is more import for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . my reason is memoraz a bunch of fact about a topic will not abl to indentifi and clearli understand the concept of the subject would be aw for the student . on the other hand onli learn the fact about the subject the student onli know about the coclus . they alway spend their time for memoraz the inform becaus of thi mani import hour for human life spend for noth . the most import thing is understand the idea and the concept . in my hometown , mani of high school ' student have to pass an exam which is call oss which is for appli the univers . the stundent respons of the four yerar high school educ . the problem is you have to memor lot of fact and detail about the question . the detail which she or he will forget after some decad day later . thi situat show that fact of student take the exam and they spend a lot of money and hour for noth it wa onlli about the pass the exam and a result of thi prepar cours do not give a chenc improv the your knowledg . in my opinion the student must be aduc in a trane which enabl them to use their potentioanl about the subject . thi kid of work give a chanc them to understand the idea and concept of work . in addit to thi in an effect learn sytem for exampl learn with activ , diagram , and trane use for the student . the student could choos their cours to understand the idea of the subject and concet , becaus if the student want to studi abour for hi or her master learniong fact doesnt help him or her .
