teach , learn , studi : it 's all a method ! dure our school and colleg year , we have all had the chanc to experi mani teach method throughout our professor . when some teacher believ that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept , other believ that what matter is learn the fact . dure lectur , professor tri to pass along a certain idea or concept to hi student . undoubtedli , lectur are too theorat and not too excit , but remain essenti . what will the student rememb on the day of hi exam from hi lectur ? what is he suppos to rememb ? i believ that part of make studi an enjoy experi , is understand the materi we are studi . onc we have understood the materi , it is print logic in our head . understand a lesson begin with understand the idea and concept , as they form the essenc of the materi . but to understand the idea and concept , especi when it come to complex idea and concept , it seem use to start by learn the fact . learn the fact make you understand the idea and concept more easili . for exampl , if a student want to understand einsten 's concept of rel , a revolutionari concept in physic , it would better to start with the fact . onc the student would have understood the fact about the rel concept , he could be more capabl of understand the concept as a whole . therefor , i believ that it is as import to understand idea and concept , as it is to learn fact : the two be link to one anoth , lead to a better understand of the materi .
