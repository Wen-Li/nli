it is a common think that in few year there will be fewer car in use then there are today ; it is not known if it will happen in twenti year or in a longer time but i definet think that it will happen . there are a lot of explan and a lot of reason about the inevit of the problem but the main reason is to be found in the veri differ condit which charchter differ part of the world . we live in a world were a littl part of the popul is rich , healthi and with an high standard of life . but thi part of the world live pretend that their condit is the major one and ignor ( or pretend to ignor becaus they do n't want to face the truth ) that there is all the rest of the world which live in a desper situat of poor , deas and death . that 's whi the occident tradit allow itself to do n't care about thi dramat situat and to exploit the resourc of the third world in order to get benefit , money and interest . thi horribl situat is reflect veri well in the problem of the petroul . all the resourc of the black gold are in these poor area of the world and they could be a good chanc of develop for the peopl of thi area but the problem is that they are in the hand of the multin compani which abus of the countri , which exploit the resours and which have no respect for the inhabit ' human right . the problem is so spread that it includ mani problem which are for istanc the polit envolv in the matter petroul . thi is a veri import problem and it can be quantifi that the most part of the war of nowaday and of the war to be have common point in the interest gener by the petroul . the last point which is import to anal is the fact that the petroul , in the way it is produc and in the way it is use as gasolin , produc a huge and uncontrol pollut which is the caus of enorm problem like the most known is theglob warm . consid all these aspect and mani other as import as the one analyz it is obviou that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use then there are today . it remain to decid if there will be fewer car becaus we respons decid to stop to caus problem to the earth and to the whole humanan or if there will be fewer car becaus we use all the petroul avail which mean that we will live in a world destroy by the pollut and the wor and conseguet near to it end .
