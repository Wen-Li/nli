knowledg is like a sea . it is so vast that there is no end to it . even if you feel you have expertis in the subject there will alway be someth relat to that subject which you are not awar of becaus in everi subject there is alway some advanc be brought . in my opinion it is alway good to have knowledg about differ subject rather than a specif subject . these are the follow reason for which i support thi opinion . firstli , knowledg of differ academ subject will alway give a person better job opportun when he step out into the compet world . he will have differ choic avail with him from which he can choos the better one for him . howev if he is equip with just a singl subject he ha no choic but to go for job avail in that field which might not be as appeal as he thought it would be . i had one of my friend who studi geographi but then later she end up realis that she wa not in the right place and she wolud rather enjoy better if she wa in the field of comput . secondli , it avoid boredom . we becom letharg studi someth for a long time . if we are studi more than one subject we can switch over to the next and get a chang . for instanc , if we are studi histori for five hour and we have music as our altern subject switch over to it will alway be refresh . thirdli , we obtain an understand in differ area of studi . by special in a singl subject we will have knowledg about onli that particular field . howev , world is fill with varieti of thing and if we are to encount anyth els other than our subject we might feel as if lost in a forest . thi is not good becaus it can keep us away from mingl with other and thi can also lead to frustrat in life . henc , i feel it is better to obtain bit of knowledg in variou subject becaus thi will help us widen our horizon . it will help us to find a place in societi and also help remain happi .
