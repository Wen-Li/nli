i do not agre with the topic . i think in twenti year there will be more car in use than there are today . one of the reason for my disagr with the statement is that twenti year ago there were fewer car than today . i can rememb go arround the citi i live twenti year ago and there were not as mani car as there are today . so , if the world still grow the same way , in twenti year we will have plenti of car in use . although i think car are veri useful , i find the traffic veri annoy for the day life , but i have to learn to live with it as i think the number of car is go to rise even more than we have today . moreov , anoth reason to think that we will have more car in the futur is that the price will get lower and peopl would be abl to buy a car . age ago a televis wa so expens that onli a few could buy it , but throughout the year the televis ha becom so popular and common that the price have low down . that is what i think it is go to happen with car . i also think more second hand car will be in sale , so peopl will be abl to get them and as a result we will have more car in use . in conclus , i do not think in twenti year there will be fewer car than there are today as the world is expand so quickli and it is overcrowd over the year .
