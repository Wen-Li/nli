i think that a gener knowledg of mani academ subject is the best way to understand which will be my futur work . i believ in thi becaus of my last and still come on the surfac doubt about `` what i will be in the futur '' . infact if you would be listen to my telephon call or discuss with my mother in the last time , for estanc , you would discov me speak rightli about thi . i think in thi period of the life , almost everybodi ha alreadi decid what to do so thi is whi peopl decid to attend special cours , and to take part to lesson on specif subject . if your interest is so specif and you are sure about what are your passion and love , you should n't wast your time and pick up special subject studi . but not for all the peopl , thing are clear . .. thi is my case , i have n't nearli a clue of i sure will be , or in which envoiron i would like to work in , mayb turism busi ? mayb in the armi ? is work in a bank the right choic ? ... ... i realli do n't think so ! an thi is whi i realli trust in what i state . an other problem is that the decis , appli the question on which the essay is base , on colleg choos period of our life , an other factor come insid : time goe on . have the possibl to have more life i would sure tri both approach , attend special cours and lesson on a subject or few of them , then tri to find my way through , also have a broad knowledg of mani acadam subject . my answer , so my solut to the question , could not be so clear after what i 'm go to state right now , but , read what i have just wrote abov thi final line , you will be abl to understand my vision : if we have alreadi decid what we are go to do in the futur we must `` carpediem '' ( so take time by the hair ) , and pick a special academ path . but if we are not sure or we think our idea will chang , take part to the studi of mani academ knowledg is the better decis . refer to the question `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' the first will be a more flexibl choic then the second one .
