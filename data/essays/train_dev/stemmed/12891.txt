the educ process ha evolv dure recent decad . in the past decad , student were tought in a way that would onli permit them to memor fact . the import of educ reli on accept fact rather than understand them . thing have chang , and nowaday student should understand idea and concept rather than learn onli fact . the world demand well prepar peopl capabl of analyz situat , solv problem and propos idea . when student understand idea and concept rather than learn fact they are abl to develop a process of constant and connect learn . they are abl to appli idea and concept at differ field and they can find relat within differ subject . they have a broader spectrum of idea that they can develop into compet throughout their student life . thi make the knowledg process smooth at all level of educ . student are encourag to understan rather than simpli accept idea . the problem with learn onli fact is that it partial the knowledg . a student would onli memor fact for a certain subject and it would not be abl to find it aplic in other field . fact onli respond to specif detail and eventough they are use , they can not constitut the pure basi for educ . fact do n't permit discuss . as an exampl of what i have present befor we can analyz a histori class . it is differ to learn histori learn onli date and fact that took place at a certain time , than to undestand idea and concept that lay behind the fact . if a student is abl to see the connect between event and to undestand the condit that gave birth to a certain fact they would undestand mani of the thing that take place today . as a conclus i would say that the educ process need fact as well as undestand idea and concept but the last one , is more import for develop a well construct and support knowledg . in my opinion , the earli you give a student the possibl to do thi , the better he/sh wil perform in academ life .
