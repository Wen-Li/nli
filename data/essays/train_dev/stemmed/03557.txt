i do not agre with the opinion that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are three reason whi i think it is bad . first , travel with group mean we can not decid where to go by ourselv . we have to follow a tour guid and we have to see sightsd in limit time . howev , i believ that one of the best thing in travel is to visit place where most tourist do not go . by do that , we can experi differ cultur that commun with local peopl or exprienc their live . to give an exampl , i have been to thailand and visit a karen villag where tourist have never visit . that experi made me broaden my knowledg and so on . secod reason is that we can not spend a benefici time in the place wherer we visit . my swiss friend onc told me that japanes travel often come to the sight onli for take pictur but not for walk or see the sight care and have a good time . thi come from the limit time that we are allow to see one sight . in thi sithat , we defen can not spend a nice time eventhough we travel to enjoy our live . third , it is not comfort to travel with group member . sinc we can not decid which peopl to go with , there mayb some peopl that we i do not like . i think travel with a person who i do not like is the worst thing to do . we should have confort time dure a travel . as you can see there are sever de-merit of travel with a group led by a tour guid . i prefer to trave alon or with friend , to enjoy my travel and experiec differ cultur .
