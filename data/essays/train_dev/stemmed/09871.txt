ye , i would agre with the statement , becaus it is more import that the student should understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . becaus student could notnot have suffici knowledg and exprienc to go with their veiw , so they dont know what they are do and is thi is correct or wrong . one student get in to the that part they can know what they did is wrong , so that they can clarifi thi is the wrong method , they can not get in to that method again . mani student think about what they are do is alway correct , becaus they are in dilema which they can not get out , onc they know about that thn they will choos anoth one . if one concept can get in to a student mind by tell the idea of that can be dip in to hi mind practic no one can eras from hi mind . so that the fact and idea can not get the student mind by oral they can reach them practic veri effect . if student learn about fact ten he can visual what they are and what they are meant for . so we may teach them fact they do not take veri effect so that if explain real situat we can correct fact through their mind . so the idea and concept are meant for learn by them onli ii dont say strictl ; y becaus the person learn can not get the all the fact and concept , so we may co opear to them to learn about the realiti and fact . so that they can have bouth side co oper so that can think about their idea . so by practic are oral they can get their concept and idea . so that the abov are the my opinion on the given statement and the main idea of mamin is they should understand idea and concept their own with our co oper
