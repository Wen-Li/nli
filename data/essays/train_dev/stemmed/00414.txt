in my oppinion i agre with the idea of understand the idea and concept than learn the fact and thi is becaus in order for a student to appli what he ha seen in class to real work , is better to understand the concept and idea so he can convert to the best for the work . some of the reason , first if a student can understand and idea he will be abl to appli what he just notic ( learn ) in anoth way or situat , like when a `` paint student '' just learn that the color could be mix to form some other new color , and the profesor explain so well which type of tone can be mix with other , and he will experi all what he understand of thi class . but in the other hand , if the student had learn the fact that color could be mix , like red with blue give the result of purpl , we identifi that the person will have the idea and absollutli the knowlegd of everi color , but he did n't understand the real mean of the object of the class . the second reason is sinc everi person can transform the informacion in difer way and for some peopl can be easi to understand new subject in the class , like the `` histori of mexico '' all the concept , what happen in the past , but definitli that understand it , get the main idea with their own word , will be abl to rememb it in the futur year . and on the contrast a person who learn the `` histori '' , is not a veri good resourc for teach some other classmat , becaus is close to explaind with their own word what they learn , as an exampl it me , i can not rememb the histori complet , due a memor moment in order to learn by that time . so , basic it is import in ani school to encourag the student to understand veri good the main point of everi lesson learn , so the will be abl to appli thi in a futur with their own understand of the concept the teacher want to explain .
