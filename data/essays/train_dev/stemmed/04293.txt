i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact , as in the futur carreer work on concept is need . onli know some fact of a special theori doe not help to resolv a problem , for exampl ! exampl : in my interneship at the compani lavazza i receveid a task , name to resolv a problem in the market departur . therefor i did need special fact about the problem topic , but the fact were not requir from the compani . i had the possibl to look the fact up in the internet if i need them . but the import point wa to know how it is the best way to form the concept and how to develop the suitabl idea of thi problem . the companz requir these factor : 1. understand the problem task 2. work on the problem task 3. find solut for the problem task moreov i think that fact are the base for work on special topic or better an advantag for work on a topic . one should learn fact , but the most import point for student is to learn to understand special idea and concept in order to use them in the futur . otherwis , onli know the fact , without know how to work with them , is not help for futur task . sure , there will be peopl who would be impress , when they hear that you know variou fact about o topic by heart , but onli fact will not fulfil the requir of a compani one work in . as a resum it can be said , that fact are basic import to learn , but not as much import as understand idea and concept , as it is not enough onli known fact without have the capab to work with them , for exampl to make a concept . the combin of learn fact and on the same time understand the idea or the concept would be perfect !
