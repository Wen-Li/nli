some peopl argu as if it is a gener truth that most advertis do n't make product seem better than they realli are . howev , to be frank , i ca n't agre with them . as far as i am concern , i think that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . among countless factor whi i hold no confid on them , there are three conpicu aspect as follow . the primari problem with the statement is that it is ignor to the basic fact that advertis is use to sell product . therefor , the advertis will make the product becom what the custom hope and like in order to sell them , which is the purpos and the most common method of most advertis . for instanc , nobodi would like to eat a hamburg which is tini and over-cook , instead custom want to have some big and godlook one . that 's whi peopl alway find that the hamburg they eat in the restuar seem smallerthan those in the commerci . anoth reason whi i disagre with the abov argument is that the advertis will onli mention the advantag of the product . thi is also a kind of mislead custom . take some medicin as an exampl , the advertis never tell you what the bad effect of the medicin will happen after you use it . the word you can hear are onli `` use xxx , use it , make you feel total comfort . .. about your ill . '' final , what is also worthi notic is that some word in the advertis may have differ mean . thi make the consum may easili misunderstand those word . such as some promot advertis , you can get one free product without mantion u have to buy someth els first . all in all , i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . some make the product much better look , some onli mention the good aspect , and other use some trick word to make peopl misunderstand . take into account of all these factor , we may reach the conclus that most advertis make product much better than they realli are .
