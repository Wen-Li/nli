i complet agre with that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to special in one specif subcject . i have allway been someon who interest into on sever academ subject such as polit , astronomi , byolog and phsycolog . it wa not possibl in my uniovers to studi all of these subject art the same time therefor , i choos the polit as a major . i believ in that i would be abl to be quit succesful on all of them at the same time . choos of major at univ. depend on person individu interest besid other less influent reason . howev , it can not be restrict by onli one subject . a person can be succesful on sever subject rather than one spesif one , such as most of the scientist in histori . da vinci wa not onli a paint but also an inventor of hi age . on both of these field hi succ can not be ignor . special in onli one spesif sucject allway sound me bore . sometim work on a person have phsycolog problem can be more enjoy than studi a physic promblem . likewis , studi for polit can be bore than work on a person 's phsycolog problem . therefor it can be said that we can rest while work on a differ subject than the subject we had to work on much . busi life in my countri doesnt shape with the scienc inde . you can be a good phsyc resarch but that doesnt help you to make your life easili . in order to earn money knowledg on sever subject is more use , especi in my countri . that whi most of the student tri to make mba in all around the world besid their own major . consequ it can be said that knowldg of sever academ subject is definet better than special on onli one specif subject . even though mani other of the reason to work on sever subject can be ad so , onli three of them describ abov . we can gain more benefit with the broad knowledg on mani subject rather than one academ subject .
