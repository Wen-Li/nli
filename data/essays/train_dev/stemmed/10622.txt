it is more imort for student to unerstand idea and concept rather than concept it for them to learn fact . acord to my opinion it is more import for student to understand idea and concept , becaus idea to help the student to improv hi skill and more knowledg about the subject , and it is more import to student to achiev hi goal . the concept of reason subject is help the student to reach their goal . first of all i would like to give one exampl of thi . when i am in the tenth class i did not well in the mathemat subject and i did not concentr on the class veri well , becaus of thi lack of idea i did not well in the mathemat subject . one day my mathemat techer ask me do the problem , but i did not done that problem properli . then she wil teach subject veri easili and give the idea to me , and gave concept of the basic subject , then i easli understand the mathemat subject and i did veri well in the exam . secondli i would like to tell you that is basic idea and concept veri import to student , becaus if they did not know about the basic idea of the subject , they defin low knowledg about that subject . we did not understand the concept of the subject then we lose the knowledg of that subject , exampl poor student did not veri well in their subject . final , intellig peopl ha alway give the import to the idea and concept , and they veri well known about the subject , those student whose idea are good they go to be goodperson . special student are engin they must includ thi idea . that way i am interest in thi , and i also say that idea and concept are veri import to the student .
