i guess a lot of peopl had the same problem : you are read an articl about an impress build ( like the pyramid ) and you do not understand how it wa build and hot it wa abl to resist all the time . in case you understand the idea or concept of the build , you can transfer thi knowledg to other build . in addit to that you are abl to improv the concept for exambl by build higher and better build . also you keep the fact better in your mind . in thi essay i want to discuss whi it is so import to understand concept and idea . firstli , you can transfer the concept when you understand an idea . in case you understand whi a boot in the water made of wood swim you are also abl to understand whi a boat made of steal is still abl to swim . just think of these big super tanker in the atlant ocean which are cross the sea . secondli , you are abl to improv the concept . in case you are an architect you can build higher build when you have understood whi high build are stabl . just think of the eiffel tower which had for the first time an iron scelleton . peopl transfer thi knowledg to other build and increas the size step by step ! lastli , by understand the concept it is easier to keep in mind the fact . you are then abl to understand whi diesel engin need less fuel than engin with ga becaus they use differ technic . from my point of view it is realli import to understand the concept of someth . with thi understand you are abl to transfer the knowledg to other product or to improv the concept for exampl by build better product . also you can easier remind on the fact by understand the concept .
