be a member of the young peopl myself , i agre with the idea that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . it is sad that i have to admit it , but thi word sound unfamiliar to me , and i must imagin someth that the older peopl do . it seem to me that young peopl are not even care about the commun , or do not think about themselv belong to it . i often hear that the connect between neighbor are veri weak in japan , and i agre with that as i see mani peopl not even exchang greet when they see a neighbor around their hous . i live in an apart , and sometim see young peopl like me , but they do not tri to greet me from them , so i alway speak out first . i think thi connect between peopl ha someth to do with young peopl not help their commun so much . for exampl , whenev there is an event held by the apart that i live , the peopl who take part in it are small kid and their famili , and then the old peopl . the middle-ag peopl organ the event . young peopl could also take part in these event , but they , or we , tend to spend time on other thing for our own fun . if we becom more interest in the commun , i am sure we could affect the commun in a good way that can make the commun more activ . howev , i also think there is a problem or a point that can be improv in the commun itself in order to get young peopl more interest in the it . perhap some young peopl think that they want to help the commun in some way , but they do not know how , and think of it as someth not easi to access to . if the commun can make an atmospher that the young peopl can feel comfort , mayb they would show interest . in addit , i think the older gener should tell the younger one what the commun is , and how they could help in order to make follow of their work . i want to start from pay more attent to the commin and then help in some way .
