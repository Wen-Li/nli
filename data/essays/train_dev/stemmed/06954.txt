the statement that the success peopl take risk is by itself confus . on my one hand are the peopl who donot want to take the risk and want to grow in the area in which they are the best and on the other hand there are peopl who want to take the risk and chang with the time to excel and suc in life . i want to go with the risk taker as in my opinion if you are not take challeng then you are not progress and if you becom stagnant after some time you will be a looser . the world is an ever chang place everyday there is some new technolog in market over the old technolog and the old technolog vanish with time . take the exampl of comput scienc industri if the pioneer such as bill gate , steve ballmer have n't taken the risk of step in thi new area of technolog right from the begin of step into it by take the risk of creat the first graphic base os to a high graphic resolut comput what we have now although , they might have studi someth els in life and could have secur a good job and life . but no they had to take the risk on do someth new in life and do what someon ha ever done befor and show a new way of thinkingto the world and societi . if we follow the footstep of the technolog tychoon of india mr. naryan murthi we will see that the risk can result in the biggest success of one life . right from the begin when he wa just an employe in a softwar compani in india to the foundat of infosi . we will see that he ha taken risk sever time in life . he wa have a success job in a reput compani but he had a vision and to follow it he along with hi group of friend start a compani . which struggl in the slow down of econonmi in end of 1980 's . he put all hi save in the compani to save it and now as we see it is a $ 3 billion organis . thi is exampl of one of the risk taker in life who have succed in life . although , there is alway lot of risk involv , we might loos also . but that should n't stop us from follow our dream and take as much risk as possibl in life to achiev it henc , on the basi of the reason explain abov i want to conclud that a success preson ha to take risk in life .
