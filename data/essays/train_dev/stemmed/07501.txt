i would have to say that the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guid but with more immedi friend and contact . although , if one wa plan a trip to go to a foreign countri that is famou for it 's site , it would n't be a bad idea . travel with peopl most like from the same countri with a guid that speak your nativ languag would perhap provid a comfort and eas away the shyness some tend to have when leav their comfort zone . but i do n't think that would be enough . my purpos to travel would be abl to experi and understand the differ and not just to be abl to say `` i 've been there . '' if you onli want to learn about a certain place , you could just buy a book or even go onlin and use the internet as a sourc to see pictur and obtain inform . you 'll be abl to know how big it is , whi it 's call that and everyth a tour guid could tell you just by read . and i 'd have to say blatantli that that would seem a littl bore , listen to a lectur on vacat . anoth , cultur is a veri import element . with a tour guid , they 'd be abl to introduc you to import restaur and store market for tourist that sell souvenir . with a littl bit of research you could enjoy and plan all thi yourself . so , i would prefer travel with friend and/or famili . if not , then alon . hope then , i will be abl to make new friend there and also have the opportun to hear the stori from them , which is an experi that would be difficult to achiev in a pre-design cours .
