the statement at issu is whether in a period of twenti year there will be less car in use than today . i disagre thi statement and i 'll tri to give some reason and exampl that will show whi , for me , thi is a wrong predict . if we look at our world today , at our everyday 's life , we can see that peopl do not use buse or other kind of method to move . they prefer to use car . i give a person exampl . when i 'm drive my car i often take a look to the other car to see how much peopl are in one car . the veri fact is that in most of the case in one car there 's onli one person drive ot . i mean , what a wast of energi , time and money ! give thi exampl i want to state that nowadi peopl use their car as the principl way of move . and thi , relat to the question ask to me , it mean that i do n't think that onli in twenti year person will learn to use buse or other way of move that citi and administr often offer to they to prevent pollut , traffic and other problem creat by the wrong use of car . i want to give anoth reason to my disagr with the statement at stake . if we consid how much money doe the factori that make car spend in the make of spot and other commun 's channel to make peopl buy their car we can say that is imposs to consid the fact that onli in twenti year ther wiil be less car in use . i give thi opinion to say that thi method of move difficultli will chang in a short period . becaus it impli that person should learn to proctect his/her own enviroment , it impli that peopl should apprehend to ride a car carri more than one person a time , so that we can learn to creat less pollut and traffic . a final argument . i want to state also that industri and echonom should stop provok peopl to buy such a lot of car and give and tri to find other way to let the peopl move without creat pollut and traffic . i t
