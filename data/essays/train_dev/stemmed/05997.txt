i 'm in complet agreement with thi sentenc , becaus i can experi thi problem in the citi where i live . nowaday young peopl are too busi in school and afternoon activ like sport and music , so that they have n't time ( and sometim no desir ) to help their commun ; it wa differ not so mani year ago , when boy had n't the same opportun to keep their life busi with entertein activ ; for thi reason , although mani of them had to work hard sinc their childhood , they tri to spend their time with some friend in activ which help thier commun . as i said befor , i can experi the lack of children 's partecip in the life of the commun in my own citi . for exampl , in occas of the annual festiv for the saint protector of the citi , each year the inhabit of my citi organ a big festiv ; actual it 's a good one , well organ and joyful , but the problem is that sinc i could rememb it ha alway been the same , each year the same kind of festiv as the previou one ; well , i address the caus of thi `` routin '' to the fact that no young peopl join in the organ of the festiv , so that a great sourc of idea and renew are n't use . but it 's onli a small exampl belong to my own space of life . anyway i could find more signific one ; i mean a bigger problem of distrust that young peopl feel toward societi and a consequ absenc from it life . more and more peopl are n't interest in polit life of commun anymor ; and a proof is that the polit class of today ha an averag age veri high ; there are no young boy who ha the fervour to enter the polit life and bring a new young fresh air of renew .
