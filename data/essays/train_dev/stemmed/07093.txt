is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid ? there are go to be million of place that you may have not seen or never heard befor , new cultur to explor , new way of learn of do someth that probabl you did n't even thought it exist . travel with a tour guid it 's probabl a good choic if your idea is go and see the citi , to know waht it 's the histori behind it , but if your thing it 's not that than it 's not a good choic travel with a tour guid . in my person experi i had alway want to see the citi for myself , but in my case i 'm also more interst in the nightlif too , so i think that i will not be take the tour guid to a night out in the citi which i prefer spend it with my friend out . anoth thing would depend on what it 's your perspect of view thing and on your own person way o think and also in the point of life that you are live , me as a student would prefer go with a group of friend and that 's it , but probabl in 10 more year i would rather see the citi , the histori , what it consist of , than just anoth night out with the guy . so what i 'm say it 's that there are certain point of life were you want to do certain thing or you do n't , travel with a tour guid it 's great to see the citi for what it is and not onli an structur , for what peopl had live befor in there , so take a tour guid will depend after all on what your main idea of the trip is , and what the whole point would be after everyth !
