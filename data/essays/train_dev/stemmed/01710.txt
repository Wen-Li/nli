some peopl say that in their opinion it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i mainli disagre to that opinion . as a child and dure the time of educ at school to gain a broad knowledg is import . that is becaus for the life after school a child must find out in what it is interest . thi is on the one hand import for the choic of profess and on the other for it own developmet . but later it is as well as import to special in a specif subject , becaus specif knowledg is veri worthi . so for exampl a compani is will to pay a lot of money for employe who have special in a subject where onli less peopl are special in . that is becaus their knowledg is rare . anoth point is that today the sum of academ knowledg is so big , that it is imposs for one person to special in everi subject . but everzbodi feel much better and is much prouder of himself , if he is specialis in a specif subject , than if he know a bit of everyth . third peopl are more interest in some thing than in other . and if somebodi is interest in someth he will be abl to learn more and faster than if he is not . accord to that it is more effici to special than to do not . last , base on the second point , there could no more scientif research been carri out if everybodi would tri to special on everyth , becaus everybodi would die befor he would get to the point where he could start research . so basic you must disagre with that statement .
