i am not complet sure about the agreement with the statement . the idea and the concep are at the base of fact . the fact begin when a man decid to put in pratic an idea or a concept , make it real . so if you want to know someth you have to ask whi ha he do thi , what are the caus that are been on the bottom of the decis that make real someth . on the other hand fact are necessari to know the condsequ of the action of someon who decid to follow hi idea . have to make a choic i think that the keyword is the verb understand . if someon realli understand a concept , he is more aknowledg , he is more capaebl to make hi choic . the other who know onli the fact can say : the thing went in that way , the thing are there , but in realiti he doe n't know how and whi . i can take some exampl . in histori i know that in that precis moment appen a precis thing . if i onli know the fact i ca n't understand the real reason at the base . at in the end i can learn veri littl and have a veri minim person improv . but if i know the caus , what make peopl to behav in that way , i can understand a lot ond mayb learn from their error . anoth exampl that it cuold be made is not quit directli rapport but is veri similar . studi for exampl physic or other kind of similar matter if you know onli the result you are not capaebl to understand the real mean of the thing you are analys . but if you can understand what the result is made with , what are the principl that are in game , you can organ them and put them toghet be capaebl to know what could happen next .
