i agre with the follow statement that `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it id for them to learn fact . '' it is veri easi for student to understand idea and concept rather than learn them . if they understand onc they will never forget it and will be abl to recal all the idea and concept . for exampl , in a classroom teacher is teach someth valuabl and help student in understand the idea or concept with the help of some exampl or experi and due to thi student will catch everyth veri fast whatev teacher ha taught them and will recal it easili in futur . student understand easili with the idea and concept rather than make them learn the fact . they will not rememb the idea or concept or fact if they are made to learn it forc . learn never help in understand the idea or concept . idea and concept are alway clear to student by understand becaus understand make it clear to them and they pay attent to it and show their interest also . on other hand their interest keep on reduc and caus lack of attent if they are made to learn fact forc . idea or concept about anyth help student to picturis or visualis the situat and doubt are clear . it not necessari that student should alway learn . there are otherway also of teach student . now day time ha chang teach should be made by see the student interest and capac of learn . studi should be made easier to student by make them understand the idea and concept . gain knowledg about someth is easier by understand it the process of learn ha chang or replac by understand idea and concept . at end i would like tosay that if we realli want student to improv then i suggest that the process of understand idea and concepst is better than learn fact .
