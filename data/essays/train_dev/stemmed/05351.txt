dure my studi i learn a lot about advertis . our professor alway said that advertis should convinc peopl to buy a product - but not just one time ! thi mean that if the advertis promis someth the product doe not have the custom will not buy the product again . moreov he will tell hi friend about the neg experi with thi product so that hi friend also will not buy it . year ago i would have total agre with the statement , but with thi backround inform i have to say that i have a differ point of view . i think that most ad tri persuad the custom to buy their product by show them how the product can satisfi their need . it is for sure that they do not show the neg point of the product - but i am of the opinion that nobodi realli would expect that . i believ that today custom know how to handl with advertis . they know that they have to compar the product-specif to make a proper deciss . furthermor i think that not a singl custom believ everyth which is mention in an advertis , becaus they know that everybodi want to sell their product . to sum it up in a nutshel > advertis is to persuad custom and so they will just show the positiv point of their product - but i am convinc that those are nearli like the product is in realiti . in addit to thi all custom knew that they should not beliv all the thing they see on televis , read in newspap or hear on radio , becaus no product is perfect - even if they promis it . and , as i mention at the begin > when an advertis realli promis someth , that the product can not fulfil , custom will buy it just one time . and no one can afford to loos all custom after such a short time .
