i believ that success peopl tri new thing & take risk rather than onli do what they know how to do well . if u keep do same thing over & over again no one is go to impress what u did but if u do someth new everi one is go to surpris how u did thi & they will becom curiou to know about it . without take risk it not possibl to do someth new , ex.if u want to gain more knowledg u have to learn new thing to learn it but u are not sure that that knowledg is go to help u somewher in ur life . but if do not take risk & do not start to learn new thing u r never ever in ur life is go to find out that knowledg will be use for you or not ? it will be mysteri for ur whole life u live . so i think that if want to be suc in your life start learn new thing instead of follow same old thing that u alreadi know . the 1 reason i believ thi becoz , especi at thi time world is boom , each & everi second some one is invest someth new that no one know . so to keep track with present world we have to tri someth new instead of stick with same old thing u alreadi know . ex.each & everi day cell phone compani , comput compani , actual all eloctron compani introduc their total differ & brand new model . the anoth reason i believ thi becoz if u tri someth new u will make more money than with the same old thing . ex.if u make new dese for cloth that no one invent yet , u r definateley go to make money.2nd ex.if u build the hous , which is total differ than the usual hous arond u go to make more money & u go to be more popular too . in other world it not limit for onli electron or builer buis but it true for ani thing u can imagin in ur mind , in today 's world everi one want latest facil , design , equip , etc . so , in conclus success peopl tri new thing & take risk instead of stick with same old thing that some one alreadi invent . but rememb 1 thing , success is not possibl without take risk .
