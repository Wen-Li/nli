that 's sure a good issu . it is imposs to me to look deep into the futur to find an answer but , for now , i would certanli hope it . everyon understand how it is import to limit the pollut today , everyon know that in some hour it 's almost impossibil to walk around . so , from a moral and ecolog point of view , we have no other choic but to reduc car . doe thi will happen ? that 's completli differ . we know that altern vehicl are grow faster ( think at the ecolog bu ) .. and that 's sure a good hint on how the futur may look like . a lot of peopl today prefer to use tram and bu to reach offic and other work station . becaus car doe cost too much . and that 's anoth issu . as long as oil base product will move car , peopl will look to cheaper way to go around . there are plenti of citi all of over the world say no to the car , in itali , just to give you an exampl , you can use your car depend on the number of you car and on the day . that 's a good start . anoth option i have to consid is a restyl of the concept behind a car : everyon would love a car with low pollut rate , free from the oil , cheap to use and whi not . .. with a new look . we know that reaserch are work night and day to creat someth that look like that . the issu read `` twenti year '' , well i 'm sure that in twenti year we 'll see the birth of a new car gener and so the old car will get fewer and fewer . and do n't forget the develop of altern vehicl . mix up togeth the the two thing and you 'll have a pictur of our futur and so ye , there will be fewer car in the next twenti year .
