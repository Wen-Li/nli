special in one specif subject is alway better than have a broad knowledg of a larg varieti of academ subject . howev , to have some knowledg about other relat subject would n't be bad either . i 've been studi photographi and video in a univers for three year . the system of thi program i studi is base on give educ about sever subject rang from video art to documentari photograpi . from what i experi from thi system , i can say that get to know each subject a littl bit but not be abl to special on one academ subject is what you can do to ruin a student futur . i am tell thi becaus i know when i graduat i will find out that it is difficult to find a place for myself in ani environ . for instanc , when you are appli to a colleg for master degre they would like to see the subject you special in , or when you get in to a job you need to have a special on someth to be succes . on the other hand , when someon who ha a spacial on a spesif subject but doe n't know anyth els other than that it will also be consid as a bad situat . for exampl , if you are studi fashion photographi , it would be an advantag for you to have some knowledg about other subject relat to fashion photographi , like art histori . get to know how the figur were paint by which techniqu , what colour were use in order to express which emot , what the basic principl of art at certain period were , improv the qualiti of the photograph work . in conclus to special in one subject is necessari to maintain success both in work and academ environ , but as an addit to that extra knowledg on other subject that will add to your special will be a remark advantag .
