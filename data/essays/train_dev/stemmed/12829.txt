i agre somewhat and also disagre somewhat with the statement that success peopletri new thing rather than onli do waht they alreadi know how to do well . in the world , there are succes peopi who are succeed beacaus they are not tri new thing , but also there are peopl whpo are succeed becaus they did start someth new . i disagre becaus not everi peopl who are sucess ha done new thing so they can becom sucess . for exampl , there may be some compani that ha succed in the past with the current boss . if the current boss die , hi son may take in hi posit . hi son ha been live with hi father for year , and so he know how and what to do in the compani to keep the compani sucess . i agre becaus of the unsucess peopl that are tri to becom succes . unsucess peopl will tri more new thing . the unsucess peopl will tri more new thing , becaus he want to succeed . if he keep what he is do now that is n't give him success , he will come up with more new idea that could lead hiom into a success life . also , there are peopl who want to start someth new but they ca n't . like the son in the first exampl , he may want to start a new compani , but he will not be abl to , becaus he will have to start a new compani while still keep the current compani succes aswel . if he make the current compani unsucces , he ha caus thousand of worker to lose there job , caus them to find new job . thi make the boss of a compani think twice about start a new busi while current have a success compani in progress . becaus he hold the live of thousand of other worker , he can not just go off and start whatev he feel like start . that is whi i think that not everi success person tri new thing rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
