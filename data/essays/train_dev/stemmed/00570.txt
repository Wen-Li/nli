when i see the commerci on televis , i see mani good which look so facin and use . howev , are they realli use like the commerci 's explan ? i do not think so , sinc i believ that the advertis is a way to lure the cumstom to buy and to maxim the profit . thu , seller will onli show the benefici and use side of the commod . thu , i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem more use than they realli are . first , the natur of advertis is not to show peopl how bad the product are , but to convinc them that these product are so benefici to peopl 's live that they should buy . as a result , peopl who make the commerci have to make product seem much better than the realiti . for exampl , my friend onc bought a physic train machin which wa advertis for it quick result . they said that it will decreas peopl 's weight by ten pound in a week if they work out an hour with it . howev , when my friend tri it out , it did not show such result even when she exercis with it for mani hour . anoth reason for most advertis to show onli good part of the product is that if the advertis show the realiti of the product , custom are not go to buy it , and produc will not be abl to make a profit . to be specif , tyrenol , which is a famou medicin for cold and fever , is also infam for it side effect . i onc heard that it can increas the possibl of get cancer . if the advertis for tyrenol say ` thi medicin can caus cancer , ' who will risk the chanc of get more seriou diseas to cure cold ? i believ that human are easili convinc by what is good , but more easili drawn away by what is bad for them . therefor , if produc make a advertis which show everi facet of the product , includ the bad one , peopl are not go to buy the product sinc they mostli see the demerit they will have on them rather than the good effect . produc know well about such a natur of human ; thu , they will make advertis which make their product look better than the realiti so they could sell more .
