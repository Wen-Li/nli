i agre to the opinion that it is more imoort for student to understand idea and concept than ot os for them to learn fact . understand in the idea and concept are the base to know the fact more deepli . for instanc , if a histori professor teach the fact of the art in ancient egypt like peopl made pyramid and buri king 's mummi in the tomb which wall were paint with nar stori . it is difficult to understand whi ancient egyptian made pyramid and burri king 's mammi , and the wall insid the room are paint with nar draw . if the processor give student the concept and idea of whi they made pyramid and burri king 's mummi in there , it is more fun to learn the fact . for instanc , the pyramid are use as king 's tomb , and it wa the symbol of power at that time . insid of the pyramid are construct to protect the king 's tomb . the nar paint on the wall are paint about the life of the king and god they worship which is for amus for the king 's life after the death . if the student understand the concept and idea , they will understand deepli . also , it is easi to make them interest in the topic becaus they know the basic inform ( idea and concept ) of the fact . in addit , they can learn fact independ becaus they know the concept of the fact like how it is made or what it is for . understand concept and idea give student variou way to learn the fact , and they can have own opinion about te topic . therefor , it is better to forcu on understand concept and idea that learn onli fact .
