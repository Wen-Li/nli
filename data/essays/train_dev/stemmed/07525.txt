i agre with the statement , mainli becaus i think that it is imper for student to understand idea and concept and know how to act upon them is more import than just know fact . from my experi in highschool , i think student in gener find it much easier to just learn fact rather than understand concept and idea . one simpl exampl is when i use to love `` label the heart diagram '' in biolog class but just despis explan newton 's first principl law of motion in physic class . on the contrari when there is a written respons question on a test it would be much easier for student to respond when they actual understand what they are talk about rather than just know the fact . anoth broader exampl is when we had to make a student commite with the job of sprede out the word in school of aid with recycl and clean up . mani of us did it but i highli doubt that everyon understood whi they where do . so in the end i believ for a student to get through hi life experi as be a student with a degre of some sort , he ha to understand ida and concept and act upon them .
