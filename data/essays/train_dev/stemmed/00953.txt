i disagre with thi statement becaus even if old peopl are n't healthi anymor they can do a lot of thing and have as much fun as younger peopl have in their life . the first reason for my opinion is that not all old peopl are so weak and ill that they onli can lie in bed . and even if they ca n't to sport anymor or mayb ca n't walk at all they can do other thing that bring a lot of fun to them . for exampl they can learn someth in cours especi offer for older one or they can read amaz book or look good film . anoth reason whi i think that old peopl can have a lot of fun is that they have much more time than young peopl have , becaus of not bee forc to go to work eight or ten hour everi day . becaus of that they onli have freetim , and can spend it with their famili , or travel in foreign countri for exampl . final old peopl can have mayb even more fun than younger one becaus of their increas level of experi . the long time old peopl have alreadi been on earth caus they have a lot more knowlegd about how thing work in life . they connect a wide rang of differ charakt , solv a lot of problem and so learn much about themselv . so old peopl know enough what kind of activ they enjoy and what kind of peopl they like . with that knowledg most thing are easier and caus less troubl . for exampl a weekend trip make more fun if you 're in a group you fit in . in conclus experi and a lot of free time let have old peopl have a lot of fun , even if their ill . they just have to visit group or cours for old peopl or spend their time togeth with friend or their famili by do thing they enjoy .
