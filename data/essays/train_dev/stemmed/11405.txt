i do not think there will be fewer car than today in twenti year , although i think it would be a posit thing for the environ . there are mani way to discourag peopl to use their car , but these way are not veri often put into practic . some countri , like the scandinavian countri , have been veri success in reduc the use of car . the method they use are well-known : tax incent , avail and cheap public transport , ban on car in citi center , educ and sensibilis to environment issu . .. by reduc significantli the use of car , the standard of live is also enhanc : less pollut , less nois , less trafic jam , less stress . .. all of these are posit consequ of an environment-friendli polici . unfortun , mani countri are not follow denmark , sweden or norway 's exampl . the united-st for instanc are the biggest car-us in the world . one reason is that it is a veri larg countri , with huge distanc to cover . anoth reason is that oil is cheap . moreov , the public transport servic is disastr . conveni is also a reason for the intempest use of car : it is easier to take your car than to do a five-minut walk or to catch a bu . there might also be a cultur element in the american tast for car . given the governments'polici concern car , i doubt the use will significantli diminish in twenti year ' time . an altern method to escap car pollut might be the search for non pollut devic that would allow to use environment-friendli car . hybrid car , use partli oil and partli electr or non-pollut oil , alreadi exist . but there is also an econom aspect to the question . huge econom interest are at stake . the oil market deal with enorm amount of money , and big oil corpor do not want to see their profit declin . they tri to discourag the search for new technolog to replac oil . but , as the stock of oil will diminish more and more , those technolog will have to be develop anyway . but , first of all , the intern commun will have to becom awar of thi problem . to conclud , i would like to say that there will probabl not be fewer car in use in twenti year . but , hope , these car will be environment-friendli car .
