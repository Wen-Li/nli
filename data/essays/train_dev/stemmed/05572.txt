nowaday peopl are discuss that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i think most peopl , includ myself , do n't agre that claim . becaus it is superfici knowledg , does't help you for your job , you do take poor grade in the test which is relat to your major . also i can count sever disadvantag about the broad knowledg of mani academ subject . although you learn a lot of knowledg . they are all superfici . for exampl , you are engin and you took art class when you were in univers . one day perhap you will meet a painter and start to talk about artm . what will you say about art that attract the painter . noth , onli you count the name of the artist . also thi knowledg doe n't help you when you appli for a job or dure your job . if you focu on your major more , you will be more succes in your job . static show that peopl special in one specif subject are more happi becaus they are more success in their job . also success work life mean that a good profit for you , becaus success men earn a lot of money from their job . if you focu on your major 's lesson , you will be success not onli in your work life , but also in student life . that mean you are kill two bird with one stone . you will be more success in your lesson becaus you can make relationship among the knowledg . take everyt into consider , i can clearli state that special in one specif subject is better . special person make special in their subject . that my motto
