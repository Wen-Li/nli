i do not agre with thi statement . in my opinion it is much more import to be good in one specif subject then to know a litt about mani subject . so i think you do not need ani peopl who know a littl about everyth . they are not valuabl to the academ issu . for exampl it need to find a solut on a problem that is much specif , like improv social condit . there you need no knowledg about global warm or the differ planet on the milkyway . on the other hand you need no knowledg of the social structur if you want to find a solut of global warm . so in my opinion our societi need specialist and no allround without a deeper knowledg of a specif subject . of cours it would be nice if you are a specialist on a subject but also know someth about the other topic . but firstli you need to get the special knowledg of one thing befor you may care about other issu . there is no goal in know a littl about everyth . the peopl who know a litt about everyth can particip on convers about certain topic but they are not valuabl to solv problem which need a higher level of knowledg . everi part of societi need specialist . even our chancellor ha her specialist who are involv in the problem which belong to their field of knowledg . so specialist are the most import peopl in everi govern , compani and even famili . so for me it is import to becom similar with one subject what mean becom a specialist . thi is the reason whi i disagre with thi statement . specialist on academ topic keep the world spin around . withouth those guy there could not be found ani solut for problem which requir a high level of knowledg .
