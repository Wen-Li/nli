as far as it concern me it 's true that young peopl enjoy more the older peopl . as young peopl have the strong sprit in them to achiev anyth under the sun , be it ragard the sport , extra curricular activit and the hill climb ( mountain ) . in the modern world young peopl are readi to perform ani difficult task brave becaus they have the strong will power in them to achiev . when we consid the sport , young peopl enjoy a lot by play outdoor game like footbal ,, basket ball , base ball and also in the athelit . and thi keep the young peopl physic and mental strong inord perform ani riski oper . .. and the older peopl may not possess equal strength as perform by the young peopl to play outdoor game ... and merli the older peopl as onli one chanc to encourag the young childern . . in thi modern world each ani everi young peopl want to be differ from other youngest , so he doe thing differ from the rest . and he doe thi becaus so show that he is more talent , and also he want to `` gain appreset '' from other . .. [ to be rewared for hi braveri ] and also he want to be recognis as the uniqu person . .. and so i person feel that all that activ perform by the youngster cannnot be equal perform by the older peopl . . so youngest enjoy a lot than the older peopl . ..
