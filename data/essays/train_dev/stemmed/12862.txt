know about the place you are plan to visit is an import thing to do . have enough inform allow you to be more confid when the time for you to travel is come . i usual do thi that whi i 'm not so sure about travel with a tourist guid as the best option for me . it can be a hard situat for me to adjust my time to a schedul plan , be under pressur make me feel unconfort and with not energi to be part of a group even if that group is great and nice . i love be with peopl i love in a pleasur trip for exampl , and if i have to be with the time on my back the whole time , i would feel horribl for not enjoy the trip as i wish . i know that a tourist guid give you a lot of knowledg and experi but i 'd rather make the travel by my own and be abl to know about the thing i 'm interest in . make everyth i want and go wherev i want . step by step , not in a rush . that 's what i mean by say that know everyth i can about the place i 'm go to visit is so import . also , it feel like a bore situat to me be with a group i do n't even know , i do n't have ani idea of how they are and that could be a problem when it come to share situat and happi moment dure the trip . i admit that it can be excit if i do the trip onli by myself but not if i 'm travel with the famili or a larg group of friend . be in a travel with a group is not an option for me in most of the time , but i can say i wo n't do it in the futur .
