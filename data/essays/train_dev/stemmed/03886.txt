today , our communit and citi suffer under a larg varieti of problem . often thi problem are money base problem , but they are also suffer under the lack of activi of yopung peopl . i think the youth of today take less care about hepl their commun . so , ask your self , whi are our ccommun so dirti , or whi there are less socuial activ of young peopl in our citi , and whi it seem so that nowaday youth is more selfish . when you take a look to some public playground , you will find them in veri bad condit . they are so dirti that they can not be use by toddler or tini tot . in most case these place are dirti becaus young peopl misus thi place for hang around and distroy them . thi is an evid , for mine , that they don not appreci the communiti 's playground . so , they do n't help the communiti . also , the youth ha got less social activ . they do n't help older peopl or do other import social work in ther neighborhood . and , when they do n't to such import mention task , they scarc care about the need of a communiti . and final , today youth ha becom more selfish , the rest of societi as well , but especi young peopl want to reap their benefit . they take all benfit and good from other they are abl to get , but do n't want it to pay someth back . for them , the communiti count much , often the communiti is indiffernt to them . also the do n't build up ani identif with their home town . by and larg , it seem to that everi thing goe down the drain . there are server problem in our societi , and they are difficult to solv . but i am quit sure that we will mang thi problem and that thi will chang .
