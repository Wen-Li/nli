i do not agre with the idea that it is better to travel with a group led by a tour guid . howev , i like to travel alon or with my own friend . and , i actual have three reason for that . first of all , it is more enjoy for a tourist to discov the countri he/sh is visit by him/her self . the tour guid doe not allow you to have the pleasur of explor the new area you are in . actual , that is the opposit of my advant person . second of all , you can not be free enough with a tour guid . whithout a tour guid , i can wake up whenev i want and i can go wherev i like at ani time . howev , if i am led by a tour guid i can not do that becaus i will have appoint and i will have to be on time for them . third of all , the onli advantag a tour guid can give me is to show me the best place to visit or let me awar of the nieghborhood in the citi i am visit . howev , i can complet my trip with need to thi advantag . and , there is no reason besid that to have a tour guid . base on those three reason , i make my prefer to have a trip without a tour guid .
