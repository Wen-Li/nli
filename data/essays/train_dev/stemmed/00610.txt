the issu at hand is '' do advertis make product seem much better than what they realli are ? `` . ye , i strongli agre with the abov point . in today 's develop world media and advertis do play in major role in enhanc the product . firstli the gener public or the custom who are buy or go to buy a particular product are attract by the advertis of that product rather than the qualiti and the perform . advertis are done with famou peopl which attract mani of their fan 's and they start use that particular product . for exampl if a actor is use a particular brand of perfum then his/her fan do follow him without actual consid the qualiti . in thi way i feel most advertis make product seem much better than what they realli are . secondli most of the advertis contain graphic and high resolut video and imag . they are visual more appeal and attract to look at . due to the use of multimedia technolog more and more client get attract and buy the product instead go for their properti and long last natur . for exampl in an advertis it shown that a bicyl ( product ) collid with a bu and noth happen to the bicycl which is not at all possibl . so again advertis seem to make product much better than what they realli are in real life . thirdli advertis lead to the increas in the sale of a particular product whether it is realli good or not . mani compani use advertis to increas their sale of product . their main aim behind is to earn maximum profit . furthermor mani of the firm use advertis as an intellig weapon to show superior featur in their product when compar to the product of differ firm , so that the custom is tempt to buy their product . so i strongli feel that advertis enhanc the product than what realli it is .
