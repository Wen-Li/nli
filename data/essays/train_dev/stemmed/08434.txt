i believ strongli that the question seem to be controversi in one way and veri rel becaus i can see that , it depend on person ' view and therebi the condit also under wich the travel is made . in one hand , a tour guid is not bad , if i will tri to pictur the whi of a tour guid or it purpos actual , i can realli go further to illustr that . as i guess we all know nobodi want to be unsecur or not well protect , or not well guid . whi am i led to talk about peopl ? , for the simpl reason that , travel is made mention and basic is ha to do a lot with peopl . for instanc , if i have to talk more about the secur aspect of the thing . when we see today , in the most technologicali advanc centuri or age , the way peopl want to be secur ; tbe it polit leader are guid or secur even countri . it realli show the long or the desir at the maximun of anyon want to be be secur . so from thi point of view , i can realli see that travel in a group led by a tour guid is one of the good way of travel in connect with some of the reason that i have announc previous . but i can also say that is not alway necessari the onli best way to travel . as i said form , it can be rel i mean by also depend on peopl point of view of what is the best way of travel . becaus for some peopl , dure their travel , they use mean of transport wich do not have a tour guid and all the same they qualifi their travel alway as be the best . so from thi angl we realli see the restrict of what is call best way of travel wich is connect to be led by a tour guid .
