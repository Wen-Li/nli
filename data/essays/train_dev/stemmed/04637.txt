to evalu what will happen in twenti year is a difficult task . one question is to know if there will be more car or not . first we will consid the argument given to predict a reduct in the number of car , then the evolut that indic a rise in thi number . nowaday the price of petroleum is in a constant rise . as the oil reserv are get smaller and smaller , a oil crisi is predict in less than twenti year . so use a car will becom more and more expens . mayb peopl will tri to use it less , which mean a reduct in the number of car . moreov as the center of citi are now overcrowd , the polici is to reduc the number of car in citi . law are enforc to limit thi number , as for instanc in london where you have to pay to use your car insid the citi , or in pari where new public transport are be built . in twenti year we can assum there will be new and more effici public transport wich will make car no longer a necess for peopl . nevertheless i do n't believ in that evolut . even if there will be no enought oil to sustain the developp of car , other sourc of energi now exist and will be develop . use biolog made oil , or electr we will still be abl to run car . moreov , if we focu on the developp of citi , we observ that car is a nessec if you live in the suburb of a big citi . as ore peopl will live in suburb than now , we can guess public transport , even if they evolv , will not be suffici . last point is the developp of china and india . even if there a proportionn less pepl who will buy a car in develop countri , when thi two countri will be develop there will be a new market of more than two billiard peopl ! in conclus even if argumet can be given to justifi there will be less car than today , i think there will be ; ore car .
