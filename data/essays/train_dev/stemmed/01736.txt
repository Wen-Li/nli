the issu of whether is better to travel in a group led by a tour guid is a controversi one . on the one hand travel in such way appear safer and well organ . on the other hand travel alon without anybodi to direct you and expos yourself to everi thing seem to be more exit and fun . i agre with the second statement becaus i am convinc that it can be veri pleasant and enjoy to travel alon . those who prefer to travel in a secur group where everi thing is done respect a program have a point . it 's clear that in those condit it 's almost imposs to put your self into troubl and experi bad surpris . howev i believ that all the fun of a trip is in discov thing by your own even the most strang . in additionn is practic imposs to discov for exampl a countri when you travel in a group follow a program . i think it 's better to go alon around the place and meet local peopl who will help you to discov the place in all aspect by show you what tour guid often hide . i have experienc that onc by go twice in a foreign countri . the first time i wa in a group with a tour guid . he show us onli what for him wa the best aspect of the countri . the second time , i went alon and met local peopl issu of differ social group . they show me two differ vision of the same countri and i had the opportun to make my own judgement about the countri just becaus i did n't have one way of look at the countri but sever . in conclus , i think that it ' s much better to travel without ani tour guid and let the place and it popul led you .
