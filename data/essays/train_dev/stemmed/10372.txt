when we are ask if it 's better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject then to special in one specif subject we reach a great problem . first of all we must be awar that know everyth about everi subject in the world is definit imposs , so , if the choic is to have a limit knowledg in a larg number of subject or a good knowledg in one subject onli , we are tempt to take the second choic . nowaday we can find so mani special class in univers that consequ the request for job is becom more and more special . so we understand that a special in one subject is actual inevit , but it is more like for worker to have a broad knowledg about differ subject becaus thi knowledg is veri import in the format of a man 's experi as an individu . therefor , have a good gener knowledg is import in peopl work life , where differ abil are often requir in addit to a great abil in your own special . in addit to it , it is true that a high knowledg of one subject make easier for peopl to be hire for specif job , but it is also true that thi will limit a lot your chanc to get a work a littl differ from the one you have been so specificli train for . have a good gener knowledg help also in social context , becaus if a parson with a grat specif knowledg is high consid in the strict environ of hi subject , a person with a good broad knowledg will be kept in high consider among common peopl in common context of situat . to conclud , in my opinion , though nowaday a higher and higher specif knowledg is requir in our modern work context , it is basicli import to have a good broad knowledg , to succeed in the whole of the context of our live .
