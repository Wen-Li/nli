i can not agre with thi statement for the follow reason . first , the need for commun action should be assess take into account the evolut of societi in gener . for instanc , a few decad ago , provid ressourc to older peopl wa a major part of commun action . nowaday , older peopl have less need for thi kind of materi support ( develop of pension plan in the ` 50 and 60 ' ) . they tend to be more independ then in the past . older peopl are more in need of social contact and activ . i believ young peopl do their best to respond to these need . second , the concept of commun invest ha chang . in the past , commun action wa view as some kind of oblig . peopl were help the commun onli , or mainli , becaus of the moral pressur to do so . nowaday , of cours the moral aspect of commun action still exist , but it is not the main motiv for peopl to get involv into such action . commun invest ha develop as an activ of it own , more like a social activ or a hobbi . a good exampl of the way young peopl approach commun action nowaday would be the project develop on the campu of the univers of louvain , where i studi : student would group themselv around a particular commun action and live togeth in a flat . the help provid by these organ typic includ help to peopl with disabl , amnesti intern support , provid free basic legal advic etc . student involv in these project basic spend most of the academ year to make sure the project is effici and achiev it goal . but they never see it as some burden . as a conclusionm i would say that young peopl do spend a great part of their time in helpimg their commun , but that the need for help and the concept of help ha chang .
