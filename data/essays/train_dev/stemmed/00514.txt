i agre with thi statement that said `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreari know how to do well . '' the reason becaus i agre with thi statement is thi . if success peopl onli do whatev they know veri well , we will have around the world the same thing . for exampl , car , if the peopl who are encharg to biuld new model of car , and they do not tri to do someth new , how bore , we do not have a lot of option , but becaus they take risk we have a numer option when we are look for a car , you , me , everybodi can buy all kind such as : a bmw , a jaguard , a camri , a jeep , etc . as well peopl who want to start a new restaur , the want to oppend someth new . if in the area where they are go to biuld thi new restaur are some chiness , greek , or text mexican food , but they do not have a real mexican food , i think that the best thing they can do is start a restauran that it is not in thi area . anoth exampl is fashion , women love fashion , they do not use the same clouth , they chang almost the 365 day dure the year . the new disain are fight each other in order to have the best disign , they are risk , but if he or she disign is the best , they will get a good incom . if you do not risk , i almost sure , you wo n't win . take a risk and you will be success in life . in life we need to risk most of the time . you make risk when you want to chang to anoth job becaus you can get better salari , but who know that you will be there for a long time , or when you move to anoth citi , it is riski but do not be afraid , you will be fine , the onli thing you need is trust in yourself .
