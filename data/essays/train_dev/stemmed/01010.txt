some idea and concept there is no fact but lot of idea and concept prove as a fact . fact are littl import for student to understand idea and concept for that he just have an understand power . for exampl , if we take a physic class that most of the physic subject is ani imaginari part of the scienc . they first get the idea and after that they tri to prove that idea into concept after that prove into fact . if we take newton under the appl tree . when he sat under the appl tree one appl fall down then he got an idea `` whi thi appl fallen down ? whi it is not gon up ? '' with thi idea he found gravit . with thi extent there is no use of the fact to under stand the idea or concept . one more exampl , if we take a math theram , student do not understand the idea and concept just explain that theram , similarli ani problem in the mathamat have some fact to understand the idea or concept . if we take a formula ( a+b ) ^ 2 there is some proof is there that is the fact . anoth exampl , one lectur say that mahathma gandhi is a freedom fighter there the concept is clear but if the student ask 's the lectur is it write lectur , then the he give some to fact about he did in the freedom fight . fact are not import in some place . but if we have to show that it is true then it is import to explain the fact . the-end
