sinc i am attend the final year of secondari school in germani right now i am about to choos my major for colleg . there are mani thing that i am veri interest in . i like polit and economi . but i would also like to studi histori or law and i absolut love to learn languag . now , i could decid to studi onli one of the subject i mention abov . but sinc it is more import and more interest to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to be an expert in one subject i choos to enrol in the major call intern relat . it is a combin of all the subject i mention abov . firstli , i strongli believ that one should follow as mani of one 's interest as possibl . the human mind is abl to connect differ subject area which , combin with broad knowledg , result in a better abil to understand complex concept of the world . addit it is alway hard to sacrific one passion for anoth . secondli , there 's a differ approach : what if you suddenli loos interest in what you are do at your job ? is n't it wise to have access to a `` second door '' ? thi way there 's a much better chanc of find a differ job which will still provid you with enough incom to feed your famili . or suppos you loos your job ? if you have a broader educ there 's much more job that you can appli for . it make it easier to find a new job . thirdli , studi mani subject at onc is more interest than just one . thi way you do someth differ everi day . even if it might be more challeng to concentr on so mani thing at onc , it will be much more fun . it make it possibl to combin you 're knowledg from the differ area . what is more , everi subject show you a differ view on the world .
