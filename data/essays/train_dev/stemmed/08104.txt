be ask , the question , whether there would be less car in twenti year in use than today , my answer would be a strong `` no '' . firstli a rais in popul and wealth can be seen all over the planet . more and more peopl from the asian countri are abl to buy a car and they do so . and thi is just today . probabl in twenti year peol from africa will be also abl to buy car , so a greater need will be there on the market . secondli the automot industri develop new car each year . thi tendenc to creat nicer and fancier model from year to year probabl will contiun . public resond exit to it . just have a look at the crowd exhibit like iaa or genfer salon . peopl from all class come there to watch the car and they are fascin . so in spite of not have enough money to buy a certain car , peopl tend to do so anyway . thi is shown in statist of car dealer , which show , that more and more car are not paid when bought , but on a monthli base afterward . there might be some critic voic , state , that there will be some law in futur day , to cut the use of car extremli in order to protect the environ . be an engin in the automot industri i do not believ that might occur . team of expert spend hour day by day to improv the car , to make them more effect and to reduc the amount of poisson , that come out of the exhaust . for be prepar for the day , when oil will becom a rare good , the engin alreadi today think about method of build new engin , that work without oil . so to summar my statement it can not be said , that there will be less car in twenti year than today . for reason such as gener welth develop , no polit restricion due to better technic and mainli becaus peopl will be just as fascin as today by the new car , develop from the automot industri .
