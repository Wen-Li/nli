it is realli import to have a broad knowledg , but it ' s true that in thi age we also need person who are specialis in one specif subject . thi problem begin to appear when you finsh the hight school and , i think , t it never disappear . i sad that is import to have a broad knowledg becaus oni if you have tast a lot of differ thingh you can realli chose one of thi thingh . you have to decid and fell wath is the subject that you prefer , that you like and onli when you have realli understand it you can go on and special in it . to special is the secon step . thi is realli import becaus in thi period the word move quikli and we need that peopl organ themself in sector . we need that peopl do their work at the best level and , for thi reason , peopl need to specialis themself . for exampl , an economist must kow mat and economi histori ec . . veri well , so he ha to studi a lot thi specif subject . at the same time he also have to know other knowledg , not becaus our sistem want it , but becaus i think that if we want to becam a complet person we must have an open mind and to have broad knowledg is a way to open our mind . in my opinion thi is an instrument whit wich we can chang the futur .
