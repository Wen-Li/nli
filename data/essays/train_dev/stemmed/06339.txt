i beliv that it is much more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i feel that it is useless if student reli on memor fact onli , thi is becaus as life goe on , what stick to our mind is what we understand and comprehend , and not what we sipli memor . gener speak , it is veri difficault to memor a fact without first understand it . take the process of photosynthesi in plant as an exampl , i rememb veri well tri to memor all the complic step and stage involv in thi process without first understand them , and what did i get ? noth . it wa a complet wast of time and energi . yet when i went back to my biolog teacher , and after explain it to me , i found it much easier to memor and comprehend . henc to me person , undersatnd the idea and concept is a must-do befor even think of start to `` learn the fact '' as we go through everi experinc in life , whether it is a learn experi , or just an everi day experi , we make sure to understand what is go on around us , henc we tri as hard as we can to get involv . when we simpli learn fact , we are not involv in the actual process of learn , and we can not therefor enjoy that feel of pride that a person get when understand a challeng task or peic of knowledg . for exapml , if a student memoris a mathemet question , it would be a complet wate of energi and time , yet when that student truli understand that task , he/sh will never forget it and will posit benifit from that true learn experi . even when we talk about the regular day-to-day task that one alway goe through , we see , again , that it is a veri import to understand a task befor memor it . take the simpl process of tie a shoe ! it is veri import that the child know the basic idea of that simpl process and watch it sever time analys it , befor actual learn those simpl fact . final , we conclud that it both understand the concept and learn the fact are way of learn that at mani time can not be separ . i believ that understand the idea and concept are still more import as they are the first step in the process of learn .
