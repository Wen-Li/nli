at the begin of the 21st centuri , the increas number of car in use worldwid is a key environment issu . it doe not onli affect the level of pollut in the air but it also amplifi the green hous effect and it serious endang the sustain of the earth 's energi ressourc . although some import sign show a gener willig to reduc the number of car in use , i believ the current trend is veri difficult to chang . on the one hand , it is visibl that there are clear forc tri to influenc the increas in the number of car . the environment conscious of the public is more import than ever and could be a good driver for the reduct of the number of car as citizen themselv decid to not use or use less frequent their car to protect the environ . there are also sever polici put in place by givern , mostli in western countri , to tri to reduc the usag of car . these polici includ for instanc , the develop of public transport , the closur of some road or citi center to car or incent given to driver to share btheir car to go to work . howev , i beliv other factor will hamper the reduct of the number of car in use . in fact , one import realiti onc ha to face is that the environ concern is more widespread in western countri , which do not repres the major of the earth populi . in parallel to the environment movement that are grow in develop countri , there are mani develop countri that are grow veri fast . and peopl in those countri seem to be veri eager to achiev the same standard of live as we have in western countri , and thi includ access to car . for all those reson , i do n't beliv the number of car in use will decreas in the next twenti year although it is necessari to achiev a sustain develop of the planet .
