i disagre with the statement that `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help thier commun '' . i person give alot of time to take care of my commun and ensur the well be of everyon in it . i live in a commun that ha around one hundr famili that live togeth in a societi . in my commun all the children get togeth everi friday and make sure that the societi is kept clean and ensur that all the facil are oper and the elder children also teach the younger children variou sport and help them with thier school work . everi altern sunday the elder children of the commun meet and spend time with the old peopl of the commun , they involv them selv in activ such as chess and take the old peopl for walk and talk to them and ask them how their week wa , the old peopl enjoy thi attent veri much and in the bargain the elder children learn alot . i myself am invol in mani social activ in the commun and an activ member in the board of the societi , while grow up i have alway been told to be a part of the place you live in sinc thi increas your social skill and you get to make friend . apart from my own commun i have also notic in the other area where my friend live that the younger gener is veri involv in activ in the commun and are veri close to all the peopl that resid in it . at school children are taught to be a part of thier commun and it is also compulsari in some countri to have complet a certain number of hour of commun servic to graduat , becaus of thi mani student are involv them selv in thier commun . from what i have experienc and seen i personli think that young peopl are make a great effort to help their commun and are also benefit from it .
