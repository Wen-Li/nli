doe young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ? by : oscar acevedo when a peopl grow and start develop the senc of joy in their life , is the moment when we start think about it and we start to wonder . is thi go to be better whe i 'm older ? am i too old for thi and i want to go back to my earli youth ? dure our youth and childhood we play , we run , we scream and we walk the world without ani worri in our life , but thi is not the top of it and that 's not the end of the road some more experi come to us and they make us grow as person and they make us happi in certain moment . young peopl ha the chanc to go out with friend , practic sport , more chanc to meet peopl and more time to live . but is in thi moment when i beliv that older peopl ha an advantag over young peopl , and thi advantag come when older peopl is abl to rememb all those fun time and all that adventur that they have had , is in that moment when peopl can start enjoy life and make a compil of all the pat moment and also be abl to share it with some other person , some friend that they have made dure their youth . when we see a kid play in the palyground we think of how much thi littl person is enjoy time and how much thi thi person ha to enjoy in the futur , even when young peopl ha no debt , ha less problem and ha no big respons , an older person can take the best of all that and make it a good experi and a good memori . joy is not how much we are do now and how mani fun moment we are have , joy is how good we can feel with ourselv by the past thing we have done , by the good thing we have live and whi not to mantion it for the bad experi that have left a lesson in our life . i beliv that a person ha to realic of what could be a possibl futur , how is thi person go to get it , and when a person can reach that goal and is abl to accomplish it . there we can call the real joy of life and the real moment of happin . is for that reason that i disagre with the statement and i support the idea that older peopl ejoy more their life than young peopl .
