'' `` no , it is enjoy !! '' she said . i wa surpris to hear that . she continu . `` onc i retir . but then i wa at a loss what should i do . and i had a bore life . after that i determin i work again !! '' gener speak i think a lot of peopl assum `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . but strictri speak , it is nonsens . think `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' is neglect to older peopl , i think !! now i 'm second grade univers student and major in english literatur . when i wa a freshman , i major in gerrman literatur . it wa bore for me.so theni did n't enjoy life . but i decid chang my major and could achiev thi desir . so now i am enjoy my daili life !! conclus state that `` enjoy life '' doe n't matter age !! thank you !! that 's all !!
