first i am go to examin , whi peopl are success . from my point of view peopl are often success , sinc they first tri to do new thing and took certain risk and , second , they did one thing for a long time . if peopl do one thing for a long time , they should get better and should know how to do it well after a time . for thi reason peopl often do what they alreadi know how to do well , when they are successful . but they often also tri new thing and took risk . therefor i can not realli agre with the statement , but i also can not realli disagre . in contrari to the statement there are peopl who even do both of the altern . for instanc , my teacher of martial art tri alway to do new thing , but also stay do thing he alreadi know veri well . that is whi i think that success peopl neither tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi nor do what they alreadi know rather than tri new thing . anoth reason for not be abl to directli answer the question is that there are also peopl who are success , but neither ever tri new thing nor realli know what they are do . for exampl , a friend of mine onli had to take over the compani of hi parent to succeed . he make increasingli much earn with hi firm without realli know what he doe . and moreov he never had to tri new thing and he did not even take risk . to put it all into a nutshel you are not abl to make such gener claim on success peopl like in the statement . nonetheless if i had to choos whether the statement is right or not , i would final agre , sinc success peopl could tend to tri new thing rather than do what they alreadi know . but that can not be gener .
