i agre with the statement , that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept rather than memor fact . in the follow paragraph i will give you reason and an exampl whi i am convinc of the correct of the statement . first of all , it 's true , that in ani field of studi there is alway some kind of `` must know '' fact , that a student ha to know . apart form thi one can alway look up detail inform in a book , on the internet or ani other reliabl sourc of inform . thu , learn fact is a practic to train your memori but it wo n't allow you to solv complex problem where you need a structur and a concept to follow . that whi learn or even memor fact doe n't make sens from an econom point of view : you wast your energi , time and `` storag '' with learn thing that you can look up anytim you need them . as an exampl you could take histor date : what if a student could tell you everi date of battl on european territori between the 15th and the 19th centuri but ca n't conclud ani connect with intern relat in that time from these fact . it would certainli help him win an award in memor , but he would never be abl to understand or tell other whi european territori wa subject to so mani chang in the last centuri . instead , a student should take care to captur all the gener idea , concept and method taught in class . concept and idea are easier to reus if you understand them correctli . as a student of busi administr i can tell that fact can be veri import , and if thi is the case you should be veri accur . but in gener i would agre , that it is more import to understand the idea and concept behind the fact , than mere fact that you will forget the second you learn them .
