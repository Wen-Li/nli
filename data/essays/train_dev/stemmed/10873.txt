i complet agre with the statement which say that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to well '' . those peopl , who are well known , they often want to be more popular and to attract more and more attent . we can talk about politician as an exampl . like bill clinton , former presid of the unit state of america , or nelson mandela , ex-presid of south-africa , who are help the poor contri in africa and asia , a lot of thi categori of peopl work in organ which have the same purpos . anoth exampl is the entertain artist . mani singer after bee veri success and popular as singer tri to move to hollywood where they have the opportun to start act . and they even take a lot of risk like invest in a lot of busi all over the world . the benefit for them is that they are known and they use their name to attract peopl ; and even their invest doe not suc as they want , they alway abl o tri other thing becaus they have the money they need . in the unit state a lot of artist , singer and sport-play have their own compani or team . consequ , month after month , year after year , they becom more and more success and popular and tri news thing . consequ , they seem like handl the world in the pame of their hand . in conclus , peopl who are success definit tri new thing and risk ; they rare just do what they alreadi know how to do well and most of the time , tey do it to get more money than what they own . as a result , that creat in my view the problem poverti becaus the rich are becom more rich , exploit the second part of the popul which is the class of the poor .
