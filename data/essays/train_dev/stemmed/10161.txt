i support thi opinion that to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to special in one specif subject . to learn one special subject sometim might lead to bright futur , for exampl in term of invent in scienc . if someon who do n't devot oneself into one special subject , most of amaz invent wa not creat . but in gener we need to have broad knowledg . one reason is focu on one particular subject make predjud , and such kind of person can not make flat decis in proper manner . i 've learn a lot of thing thoroughout learn for exampl moral studi , world histori , asian histori , japanes histori , math , chemistri , physic , art , art histori , japanes civil low , internatio low or what ever . to learn broadli is import to realiz `` truth '' between broad rang of knoledg . thi is just a veri simpl exampl , but we can learn ton of thing from the world histori , for exampl , but if we do n't have ani hi-level background in literatur , we can not understand the way of think that we see on the text book of histori . also , from lean moral studi and biolog , somebodi can find out heart of affect . to learn mani thing would be veri good opportun to find our own tarent out . needless to say , if everybodi can find out their own talent without seeng mani thing , but it is not realist . some scientist found out their talent or their way to live in the futur , but it is too rare case . in gener we human be should know a lot of thing to reach their own princip . thi is not onli for person issu , but also for all peopl in the world . so i agre thi opinion .
