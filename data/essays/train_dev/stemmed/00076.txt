in life we see and fall down in al lot situat that show us that the world is move and chang . thi is becaus of peopl that can feel when is the moment to do or to tri to do someth new and unknown . there are n't a lot of corag peopl but we can see and we have to admit that these peopl exist and improv our societi take risk . if they had n't been exist , we probabl would n't have had what we have right now so , i think that a good exampl might be leonardo davinci . he live a long time ago and he wa consid a mad man with a lot of strang idea . nowaday we have the possibl of use hi idea and to adfirm that he wa and he continu to be a geniou . he continu to be a geniou becaus we are alreadi follow hi knowledg to do useful and import thing , but when he wa aliv he took a lot of risk becaus all that he want to do , all that he said , all that he wrote wa new and consid by normal peopl strang , crazi or even stupid . anoth exampl might be dant alighieri . he is the father of the italian languag and he start to write in italian languag when other peopl were use the old one . probabl he wa consid mad too , but if he had n't written the `` divina commedia '' , we would n't have spoken how we are do today . he wa realli corag and tri to explor other way to do someth and to improv hi work and he final did it . he wrote one of the most import book of the italian literatur . at the end of the day , to achiev the success we have to take risk and to tri new thing . in my opinion , we could n't and must n't continu to use and do what we alreadi know how to do well and we have to follow the exampl of our master .
