person i agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl do . there are three amin reason for say so . first , becuas they are young , they are physicali tough and healtheir than older peopl . they can enjoy physic sport such as soccer , futbal , etc . on the other hand old peopl have less stamina and they will have to stop even if thi want to go on . their joint , bone and musl are weaker , caus injuri . thi will stop them from most of the sport that they like and enjoy when they were young . so they wil think back to the day when they were young and feel that they would like to go back to that day . secondli , younger peopl have better look than older peopl . as we get old , our skin will be not smooth , there will be less hair , etc . so they even enjoy thereselv , their own look , but onc they are old they will not be satifi by their own look . their wife or husband will look hansom or beauti when they are young . thi might not be true for everyon , but partner will look at each other and think he/sh are not good look as he/sh wa / thi now-day lead to a devors of coupl . the number coupl devors when they get to middl age is increas . that question whether they marri to each other becuas they love the partner of love the look of partner . final , there will be more friend when peopl are young . i might sound too realist , but as peopl get old they pass away and there will be less peopl that you know of . my grandparet are say that in everi class union , there will be less peopl . either they are physic unabl to attend or they had pass away . thi is similar to the fact that there will be less friend , but also there will be less famili member or rel . so they will feel lone and left out when all the famili member and close rel are gone . i might be abl to come up with more reason , but i will stop here . it sound just too sad to talk about it . i will be old some day and i am get older everi year , although i am still young . i heard from some peopl that they want to die befor they get realli old , becuas they can not `` live '' with the situat that they would be in when they are old . i hope that thi is not teh way i should be . i hope i will be abl to enjoy my life as much as i am enjoy now . as long as god keep me aliv , i will thank him and live my life follow hi word . i think that not enjoy the life or even feel like want to die , is an act of curs god . i am a christian , so i want to be abl to thank god and enjoy anytim . but i have to admit that i would enjoy better if i am young . i realli love sport , so i would realli miss play soccer , tenni , tabl tenni , badminton , etc . well i got a bit off the road but thi is how i think about the topic . so from these reason , i agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopld do .
