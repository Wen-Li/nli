if peopl have to tri new thing , in order to becom success , depend on the kind of success of those peopl . for me it is clear that peopl have to take risk , in order to achiv there goal , if they start a new busi . push the own compani to success , is not just relat with hard work , but also with the abil to take risk . go new way ha mani advantag . for instanc , the compani ha less competit . in addit , the costum 's are usual open for new idea and product 's . thu , go new way in combin with hard work , could lead to the desir goal . moreov , one imagin an enterprenu who is will to achiv success in a busine , just by hard work and an old idea . it is clear tha he will stand against a huge competi on the other hand , if the person is employ , it could be more effici to just consentr on the thing which he can do well and what is requier in hi posit . in fact , person 's who consentr on there abil and push them furthermor , are more like to becom promot then employe who are often tri new thing . howev , sinc promot is the most import thing in an employe life , i disagre with the abov mention statment . in addit , peopl who wa n't to get in power , even in a multin compani , would go better , if they learn the structur of the compani well , instead of great it new . in summ , it could be said that success is for differ peopl differ . nevertheless , to be success , peopl have to be awar of mani aspect . in addit they must have a variti of abil , but for each busi there are other rule .
