a guid travel group seem attract to mani peopl , and for obviou reason . you will , if all goe well , travel with likemind peopl , you know ahead of time what you will be see and that your hotel will be reason clean , you often pay less for group travel than if you plan individu , and you have fewer safeti concern . final , you expect to have a knowledg guid who will not onli know the local languag and provid extens inform about the area you will be visit but will also help navig the gritti organiz detail that crucial affect whether you will have a good travel experi . howev , travel group have their problem . there may be clash between group member , and if you are not extrem lucki , you will have a lot of forc social . there will be littl discoveri or surpris to your trip , most like you will learn noth of the foreign languag , and it will be virtual imposs to chang your itinerari onc you have start out . often , group travel will limit your exposur to foreign cultur becaus packag deal are streamlin , usual not for authent but for profit . mayb the most critic issu is the guid . you do not know what kind of person you will get ; if you are unlucki , he or she will be insensit , ill-inform , and gener badli organ . tour guid are not well paid , so the chanc to get one with a passion for good guid is rare . i think the decis which to choos depend veri much on the person of the travel . if you enjoy meet new peopl and do n't mind the streamlin , then group travel is a nice way to keep your budget low . on the other hand , if you 're a hardcor individualist , you will not want to consid it . that is more or less where i stand : i love wander off into side street and be face to face with the unfamiliar . i also like explor new languag , even if i have to improvis . i would travel in a group onli if i want to go to a countri where safeti , for me as a woman or gener , would be a seriou concern for an individu travel .
