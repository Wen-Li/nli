accord to the statement , the number of car in use will decreas in the next twenti year . three reason for that decreas can be state . first of all , it is state that most of the peopl in franc live in or nearbi big citi , and work everyday in the citi . these peopl choos to go to work by car . becaus the traffic is veri high everi morn and everi evenig , some of them start to be fed up with their car and think of other possibl to go to work , such as use the metro or even bike . additionali , the govern insist on the necess to decreas pollut . sinc the car is the most pollut travel mean , the govern encourag peopl not to use it by widen the open time of the metro . inde , mani peopl use their car becaus the metro close at midnight , and they are conseauent not abl to come back home without use a taxi after that time . becaus taxi are too expens , they prefer to use their car . thi decis will convinc peopl not to use their car anymor . final , anoth reason whi peopl will not use their car as much as they use to is that the averag age of the popul is increas . in twenti year from now , most baby-boom will not be abl to drive a car anymor . thi will consequ reduc the number of driver and the number of car in use will decreas . as a conclus , it is obviou that peopl will still need their car , to travel for exampl . howev , mani effort are made by the govern and the peopl to decreas the pollut level , and the easiest way to do so is to reduc the use of car . it seem to me that , in twenti year , fewer car will be in use than there are today .
