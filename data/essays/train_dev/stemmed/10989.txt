in germani the educ is base on a fast variati of subject you can learn . in the so call `` gymnasium '' it is veri import to teach the student as mani subject and topic as possibl . so that everi student reciev a broad knowledg and gener knowledg . but is it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special on one specif subject ? in my opinion a mistur of both is the best solut . on the one hand it is veri import for well educ peopl to have a veri good gener knowlegd concern everi topic and subject . it help you in everyday life to understand certain thing better and to improv the situat within the societi . for exampl there are news on the the iraqu war on tv . to understand the situat you have to have background inform on the situat in iraqu and the reason for the war . on the other hand it is not alway possibl to know everyth . mayb you have good qualiti in languag and social studi but you are not veri intrest in scienc or mathemat . you can share your knowledg in certain topic with other and you can profit from the other . in class for exampl , my friend is veri good in mathemat and i am not . so i can learn from her and she can profit from knowledg in histori . i think you should concentr on one certain topic that you are veri familliar with but should not leav other topic out . then your knowledg get to one sit and you may loos track of other import thing and happen . all in all i think it is good to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than just to special on one but in addit you can specifi on one so that you can share your person knowledg with other .
