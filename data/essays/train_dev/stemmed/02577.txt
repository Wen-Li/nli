there is long point and short point about take special knwoledg . but i think that it is better to have specizl subject than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . today , societi is more and more complex and technolog develop more faster than past . thu , everi area is more and more specil . student will compet with other in complex societi , they need superior competiton power than other peopl . that 's whi they must special their knowledg . if there are two group ; one group is consist of ten generalist , the other group is consist of ten specialist . if i have to choos one group , i will take specialist . i think that group of specialist can afford more deep inform thatn group of generalist becaus depth of knowledg of generalist is short . although they know mani academ subject , they know littl about everi subject . that is the limit of generalist . the person who learn about narrow rang of subject can also have a problem . when begin of learn , person can need broad knowledg . but in elmentari and middl school and high school , student learn broad academ subject . common sens is suffici to univers student and adult becaus they alreadi have broad academ knowledg in elementari , middl school and high school . after take special knowledg that is essenti to surviv in societi , you can broaden your knowledg in extra time . that 's not late . societi need power specialist who can alway suppli specif knowledg about area of specialist .
