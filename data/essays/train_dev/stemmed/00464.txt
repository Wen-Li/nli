`` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . ' i agre and i desagre with thi statement . first , i desagre becaus we can not generalis so quickli what young peopl do or not nowaday to help their commun . instead , no everybodi ha the same difinit of `` young peopl '' and furtherward we have to make differ in `` young peopl ' : some of them are veri interest in what happen in their commun and invest time in it and other young peopl do n't worri about it ! second , i desagre becaus not onli young peopl do not give enough time help their commun , adult too . actual , i assum that young peopl are the most concern with thi problem but i will speak about thi later . i agre for a larg part with thi statement . in my opinion , a lot of young peopl just do n't matter about what happen around them . they enjoy their life but they do n't think further than their own life in their littl town ! we have to inform peopl about their commun and encourag them to invest time to help them ! instead , you can do both be happi in your own life and have interest in the other member of your commun . and , in my point of view peopl do n't open their mind enough to the world . a lot of peopl thing about the best way to gain a lot of money and are veri individu what i can understand too . but the world can not keep turnig if it is onli an addit of individu peopl who do n't understand the import of their commun . an individu person is noth without commun around him . an other import point is that young peopl are the most concern with thi becaus they are the futur member of our commun . but what is the best way to senbilis young peopl to spend time to help their commun ? i think that could be a good subject for an other essay . ..
