in teach of studend , there is alway doubt and discuss about the teach manner . somebodi think that for a student , it is more import to understand idea and concept than it is tor them to learn fact . my person idea is that both side should be learn by student . firstli , the fact are the base for the idea and concept . idea and concept should be support by fact , so that fact have to be learn as well . for exampl , a teacher should tell the stori of euclid in find euclid theorem to the stuent . by thi way , the student can think and imagin the condit of the time that euclid live , and he can rememb euclid 's situat while he is work on a new concept or what did he work on while find the theorem . unless know these sittuat , it is so har to use euclid theorem in anywher . thu , tell the stori of euclid make the lesson much enjoy and funni to listen . secondli , fact and idea , concept can not be separ each other by the mean of completit . these three element are complet each other . an airplan design can not design a new wing concept unless know how the factor will be when the plane fli , in a snowi weather or cloudi weather etc . it is veri hard to understad a subject without the fact is veri hard for student . if you want to teach the result of world war ii , you should tell the situat again . know onli where did franc captur , where did britain captur or which new countri are form are all inform to be forgotten . you should tell where did these countri fight , or whi they are fight for that , with fact , could be better to teach . as you can see , there is a lot of connect between idea , concept and fact . fact can not be separ by the other two . teach is a complet job and fact are support for idea , concept .
