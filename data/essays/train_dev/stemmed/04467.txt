in my opinion , i total agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . there are main three reason : basic , creation , knowledg . first reason is that when i do someth in school , job an so on , understand idea and concept alway can be base for do it . for exampl , when i am work in my job , i got complic problem , so i am tri to solv by use mani way . howev it is not work , what do i do ? i need to look over again veri care and i should understand that problem clearli . and then i would think about it basic idea and concept . i must tri to understand that . after that i might solv that problem by understand it idea and concept . therefor , when i do whatev , understand idea and concept is realli import . second reason is that understand idea and concept can improv my creation abil and think . if i just do someth without think or understand , it can be mix up and i can not get good achiv . mayb i just would work , such as machin . therefor , if i allway tri to understand idea and concept , it can improv my creation abliti and think , so i would do greatli . final reason is that i can get mani background knowledg by understand idea and concept . to live in societi , all peopl need varieti background knowledg as well as mani experi . to understand idea and concept of someth what i want to get , i should tri to studi it basic idea and concept , also i need to look for mani thing , such as book , articl to understand . as i studi like thi , i can get mani knowledg more and more . therefor , understand idea and concept is realli good to get background knowledg . in conclus , accord to these reason , i total agre with that understand idea and concept is veri import to improv myself by these reason abov list .
