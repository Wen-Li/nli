some peopl may believ thi is true , but i total disagre with thi statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . from my point of view , i think that young peopl do not enjoy their life more than the older peopl do . first of all , young peopl have less spare time than the older peopl , becaus they are young , they have a lot of work pressur and long work hour . they must strive for their futur by hard work therefor , they do not have much spare time on what they are interest about . howev , older peopl have less work respons and they have less work hour than the young peopl do , and mani of them are retir form their work . they can spend more time to stay with famili and do mani hobbi that they are interst about . secondli . older peopl have more friend than the young peopl do . as time past , older peopl have been in societi for so mani year , so they have met a lot of peopl , they can have fun with so mani friend . it is realli a happi thing to stay with mani friend , and there must be a pleasant atmospher . final , they older peopl have less live pressur than the young peopl do . mani older peopl have alreadi retir from their work . they did n't think much about how to keep their work and how to make more money . they have alreadi done thi when they were yong . now the onli thing that they need to think about is that how they sepnd rest of their life to enjoy the wonder thing in the world . they can travel to mani beuti place in their spare time , moreov they can visit their friend and have fun with them . they do not think much about work , and just play for fun . howev , the young peopl will still face the heavi work and the pressur from the societi . so , they can not enjoy themself as much as the older peopl do . make my father and my grandmoth as an exampl , my father work more than 40 hour a week to earn money to afford my studi fee abroad , and he doe not have much time to have fun . howev , my grandmoth have a lot of spare time and less work pressur , so she can play a lot of funni staff with her friend . therefor , from the reason i list below , i think that older peopl enjoy their life more than thhen young peopl do , becaus they have more spare time , more firend and less work pressur .
