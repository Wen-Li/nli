nowaday the number of car is increas day by day . for instanc , traffic jam are becom more and more usual not onli in big citi , such as new york or london , but also in small one , such as lyon or bilbao . it is known that the car is the most use way of transport and all of us use it to go everi where , although ga price is get higher and despit the polut that it creat . that 's the reason whi i believ that the amount of car in twenti year wont decreas and , actual , i think it will increas for sever reason . firstli , the amount of peopl who belong to the labor forc is increas and the unemploy , on contrast , is go down . so more peopl work mean an increas of fund in that peopl and more peopl who need to go to work . mayb not all of them will buy a new car but mani of them defin will do it . secondli , live standar are becom higher as time goe by in the develop countri . then , although some year ago there wa just one car for each famili , nowaday there are usual two at least . and as live standard are go up the number of car will go up too , as parent will start buy car for each of their son and daughter . last but not least , we are live the econom explos of some develop countri as china , for instanc . the econom growth in china is huge , and the increas in car sell is huge too . all the intern compani are go to china for both , sell and produc car , as their past product are not enough to cover the actual demand . attend to the opinion of the most famou economist , they that thi econom period is expect to last mani year more . moreov , thi phenomena doe not affect onli to china but also to the other develop countri as south america and so on . in conclus , i sincer believ that all of these factor to explain clearli that the number of car is go to increas , and it will be biger in twenti year then .
