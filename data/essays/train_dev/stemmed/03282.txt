i agre with the statement that idea and concept are more import than learn fact . in the follow paragraph i will tri to defend my stand use variou reason and argument . ani learn process is use onli when it ha some real world applic and make a signific contribut to the life and person of the learner . just take an exampl of ani engin or scienc subject . you know that an induct motor produc electr in such and such way , and that thi type of combust may give thi result . but what is the use of these fact learn ? the learn is complet onli when you see that motor instal anywher and do someth that is veri use for the individu or commun , like draw water from a deep bore and when you go to ani smelt unit and see the same combust process be use to process metal and make alloy . so , we can say that to understand concept and idea is actual applic base learn wherea learn fact is just theorat learn . unless theorat learn is complement with applic base learn , the entir learn process remain incomplet for an individu . thi doe not appli onli to scienc and technolog subject . consid a student of dramat , studi a subject , say `` shakspear 's play '' . he can veri well learn the entir plot and scene , stori of ani play , but how will that do ani good to him ? onli when he is abl to understand the messag and implic , like what is the emot aspect of the play , whi is a particular charact behav in a particular manner , what were the circumst in writer 's life under which he wrote the play , that hi learn can be said to be complet . so we can safe conclud that understand idea and concept are more import than learn fact .
