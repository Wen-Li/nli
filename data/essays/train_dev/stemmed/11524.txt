first of all , i thing thi statement is someth veri common to listen nowaday , but i think it is n't true . each new year it is true than the young peopl is more busi in a lot of thing , but it 's a social problem , bacaus they have to studi , to work , to learn other languag , and more to can find a good job . i think thi is the main reason to say that the young peopl do not give enouth time to help their commun , but do n't they studi to improv their knowledg and with them help their commun ? i think so ! for exampl , lot of young peopl use their summer holiday to go to place where they can rebuild old build , or help old peopl , ... on the other hand , i suppos that is veri import the educ that they have receiv in their hous , if their parent were wori about teach them the import of the enviro , help old peopl or mantein the place clean , i think they tri to have enough time to do that . howev , i can understand the statement bacaus nowaday everybodi live veri fast , i mean , you have to do one thousand of think dure the day and frecuent you have n't time to think about all that isuu , nevertherless not onli young peopl , but also everybodi . final , i wish everybodi had a littl time a week to think about thi and do someth to solv thi problem .
