the question whether it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than to be special in one subject is a veri interest question becaus a good educ is one of the most import thing in our life . from my point of view , it is prefer to be special in one subject than have a broad knowledg in mani academ subject . i am on thi opinion becaus of a few reason . first of all , i think you have to be focuss on one specif subject in our societi . if you are not good in your subject you would not earn much money . so you have to be veri good in some kind of thing to get in a high posit in a compani . for exampl you have to be good in manag to get a job as a lead manag in a big compani . so the more specif your knowledg the more money you will earn . furthermor , i think that you should have one specif subject that you are keen in or which is your desir . to my mind , that is a natur thing . everi person ha a desir in someth . some peopl like do mathemat , wherea other peopl like do biolog research or like do sport . so everi student ha a subject that he like and that he is fascin about . therefor you should concentr and focu on thi specif subject . lastli , what job will you enter if you have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject but you have not got ani detail knowledg ? what compani is go to hire a student who ha not got ani special educ ? what job titl would be the best for thi situat ? therefor , it is better to have a specif educ . to sum up , becaus of the mention aspect i think it is better to have one specif subject where you are an expert in rather than to have a broad knowledg of mani subject .
