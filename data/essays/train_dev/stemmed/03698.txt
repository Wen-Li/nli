i agre with the staement that , most advertis make prodcut seem much better than they realli are . i feel that most of the advertis either in electron or in print or ani other media is nowaday , concentr more on look rather than the usabl or featur of the product . for exampl a cloth compani tri to spend a lot on the model and presnet rather than the comfort while wear it product . creat the hype and fuss is the onli motiv of such advertis , although public may not like the product at all after few use of it , e.g. a big multistarr movi might be open with a big lavish event , but after few day of show onli , public come to know whether it 's a hit or a flop . thi is one case where extra hype is creat for a product by advertis . in other case , the side effect of the product are tri to make hidden behind the attract advertis . for exampl , aerat drink , cosmet etc , which are not good for health . in few case , cosmet have been prove veri danger , when use frequent . case have been found that after use cosmet from a reput compani , the custom have gener allerg and skin problem due to toxic materi present in it . although the advertisemnt doesnt mention ani appropri frequenc of usag , it effect is visibl after long usag onli . in such case it is all upto the public which ha to find out the consequ after sometim . anoth exampl is alcohol dink and tobacco product , which are pretti much danger to health are advertis in such a way that it appeal to the mass popul . as we can see , in most of the advertis , which come out newaday focu more on packag and make the product more attract , rather than project there attribut relat to gener use .
