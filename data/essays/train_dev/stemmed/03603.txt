i think that the number of car in thi time will be fewer than that in tenti year later . i think abov becau of air pollut problem , improv of other transpot system and expenx land . first of all , air pollut will be more seriou . car pollut a lot of duti gu . even now , air pollut is seriou social problem . peopl will notic that we must not leav the duti environ for thier son nad daughter . so , they will escap to drive car . other peopl will think that they want to lung cancer . so they will not buy car . final , mani peopl think that drive car is bad thing for earth and all live . secondi , other transpot system will be more improv . now govern and transport compani spend money to improv public transport system , such as lrt and buse , in part of softwar and hardwr . the more usu public transport becom , the more poeol use thi system and the less number of use car is . final , govern can not get land cheepli . we have construct enouma road for car . but there is no land that govern can get cheepli . now , in the citi , land are fill with hous , factori , and road . so goven can not construct the road that peopl wont to in low construct cost . in conclud , i disagre that in twenti year there will be fewew car in use than there are today . i will be comfort by reduc the number of car .
