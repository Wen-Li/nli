as far as i am concern , i take side for the idea that it is more essenti and use to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . first and foremost , it is worth mention that a strong aquaint is base on the abil to classifi fact and event . inde , for instanc , in order to understand histor event , it is uneffici to accumul fact in a chronolog order . what is realli thought-provok is to be abl to identifi whi it ha occur . to identifi that , you must be awar of philosoph theori or polit movement . thu , i personnali believ you have to learn concept and idea to have a clear idea of histori and to understand better fact . furthermor , know an accumul of fact is useless . as a matter of fact , it doe not allow student to face all situat . there is a strike issu ; student who studi economi need to know what is liber or keynesian but not the littl event that aros in an unknown compani . eventu , student have to prepar them to be effici and dynam on the labor market . broadli speak , i think that learn idea and concept build your abil to face predica or dilemna . in a compani , when you take a decis , it is not onli import but also , to me , mandatori to refer yourself to a concept in order to defend your viewpoint and your action . a wellknown idea or concept may lead your boss to trust you about the effici of your action . to conclud , i personnali believ that idea and concept are crucial for a strong and logic knowledg in univers . moreov , i think that it is essenti to adapt to the labor market .
