in my opinion , understand idea and concept is more import than learn just the fact . thi is becaus student may not understand the idea from the fact , but student may learn the fact from understand the idea . for instanc , imagin you are in the high level math class , and instructor give you an assign paper . the instructor say just `` do it '' , to you . if you have a knowledg about that question on the assign , you may do it . howev , if you do not have knowledg , you never do it . therefor , you will ask instructor how to solv these question , and the instructor give you an answer-list paper . so you can write answer now . thi is what i think about learn just the fact . in thi situat , you never studi math . on the other hand , if you are in the same math class , but instructor exchang . the instructor give you the same assign paper , and he say `` let 's start a lectur use that paper '' . next , the instructor bigin the lectur to tell you how to solv the question on the assign paper , and he also recommend you and give a few time to consid the solv method or formula . after that time , instructor give you the answer or correct your idea about these question , and he also explain whi thi method is use . at the end of the class , you have studi math , and if some question remain on the assign papr , you can tri to answer them from the knowledg of what you studi while hte class . final , you can say that you studi math .
