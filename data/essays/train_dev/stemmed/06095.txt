i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know . today world of comfort and happi we are enjoy is , becaus of the effort of mani success peopl . i can mention the follow point to support of my argument . firstli , each and evri person ha their own success , in their own term . peopl who have urg to get a good life keepasid the thing what they achiev , and tri to do thing what they have n't achiev . if we take the school go children , success for them is to complet primari school , and after that undergradu , and then graduat and then get a job , then they will start think about the familli and their children . though they rememb about their past at the back of mind , they will concentr more on the futur and be a sucess person at that instanc of life secondli , success may vari from person to person . for me success is more like a get a good job . for my parent success is have abett educ for their children , eventhough it is difficult for them to invest for the studi and take the risk . if my parent just stop invest on my educ think that they can not risk it , we will not have a better futur . each and everyperson tri to be success by tri newth and take risk . final , each and everi countri have their own success leader and buisi peopl and peopl of varieti of field who took the risk and invent new thing . we must be thank for them for what we are today . they are respons for happi and comfort of life that we are enjoy today , and we must put our effort and be a sucees person rather than stick and do the same thing . in conclus each and everi person can be success , if they work hard and give more better life for the futur gener
