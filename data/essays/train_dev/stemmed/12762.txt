i think that is better to have broad knowlendg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . in my opinion when we have knowledg of mani subject we , in the futur , will work on the differ kind of job . i actuali studi market but not onli thi subject becous i know that is import to know anoth type of subject ( for exampl math , italian exetera ) to will arriv at the top of the manag . in fact for the total knowledg in my school teach a differ kind of subject to prepar a futur busi manag , not onli one subject but a lot of differ subject . my friend , in the colleg , studi onli maccan subject and actuali he doe n't find a good job for thi prepar . howev if you special in one specif subject you have not a possibl to choos a differ kind of work but , if you is the better in your special , you will arriv quikli at the top of the your futur job becous you have the total knowledg of thi specificali job . in conclus i can say that the veri import in the futur life of ani student is not how much academ subject is know but how can we studi it .
