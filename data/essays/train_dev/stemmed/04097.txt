everi person came on thi world by think that he or she will enjoy entir life more than ani person in thi world world had enjoy . it is well said that `` chang is law of natur '' . everi person chang when he get older . in my view younger peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl do . it is a natur process that when a person get older hi everyth becom older like hi way of think , how he mang hi further life and mani more thing . older peopl ca n't do everyth what the youth can do . to hold my opinion i would conclud some point . first , old person had enjoy their entir life but after mani year of hi life he had not left ani power in hi bone or in vein to do ani physic enjoy while a young person have hi bone like iron and vein like steel so he can do ani physic enjoy like go to parti have danc etc. secondli , old person had alreadi done all the work which the youth is do and so their all feel of enjoy had lost from whole of their heart . while youth have fresh and warm blood so they have each and everi emot in their mind . thirdli , old perston get more religi when they reach sixti or more so they have no more plan in their mind to enjoy . howev , some peopl have beleif that older person can enjoy the life more than the younger peopl but they should take in mind thaht there are mani challang situat in front of enjoy of of older peopl like physic and mental condit . we know that we cant acheiv more than what is written in our luck we cant also obtain less than what we have to acheiv . final , i conclud that it travel gener to gener and it the time for youth to enjopi their life .
