i strongli agre with the statement say that the young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl , ye ; becaus they have the time , the energi and the abil to do that . young peopl look for the life from deffer view , they have clear mind and not that much responsabl and concern . the young peopl look for some thing make them happi and they tri to find out what is the ejoy thing on the life and they will do it , when they have as exampl a brand new car you find them spend a long time drive thi car and go trip with the friend and they will satisfi with the complement about have like thi car . on the other hand when you look for the older peopl you will find them busi with the life concer and famili issu if they have a famili , also they do n't have a lot of time to spend in fun , mainli you find them concern about deffer issu like polit or build up good futur for their kid , but some of older peopl whom think about the vacat is import as much as the work and moni import , so they alway have the time to enjoy their live and ivest some time for entertain and recreat . as a conclus i think the young peopl more abl to enjoy their live becaus they are still young and they are look for the come day with a bright futur but as i said befor the older peopl can enjoy the live as if the young do becaus they have experi and they can organ their life obvious better than the young peopl .
