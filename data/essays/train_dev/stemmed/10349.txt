i agre with thi statement that young peopl do not spend enough time to help their commun base on my experi . first of all , for a period of time , educat or parent do not give enough ecourag to young peopl of the import of contribut to communit . for exampl , high school or junior high school student are onli pressur by school work such as homework . therefor , they do not have an opportun to learn the import of give other like do a volunt work for the poor or old citizen in our societi . thi phenomenon continu when they grow up and becom a univers student . dure thi period , they are apt to feel much pressur caus by their futur career . thi concern result in that student becom selfish and onli pursu their own interest for their sake . they learn onli how to compet each other and seek for the method how they can be success as soon as possibl . they do not have chanc to think about what they gain from commun they are live . furthermor , there is anoth seriou problem that caus thi phenomenon . for a decad , there are increas number of peopl who go abroad to studi or immigr to a foreingn countri . it mean that the commun is threatend by decreas number of peopl who would forget to contribut to their societi . lastli , there are a divers of entertain activ that would attract young peopl . there exist a ton of movi theater , shop mall , restaur and bar for young peopl to enjoy and spend their time . they are just hectic to spend their free time in enjoy their hobbi with friend with variou fun activ . who would want to do a volunt work for other peopl or be concou of how their commun is go in their busi live ? these three reason make me think that young peopl are not contribut to their societi enough and appreci their commun .
