i agre with the idea that it is essenti for success peopl to challeng new thing and difficulti rather than onli do what they repeat same thing which they know how to do . i have two reason for my idea : growth and gain more knowledg . it might be quit difficult for peopl to succeed some challeng becaus all success is surround by dificulti . when we can deal with difficulti , we can succeed . for exampl , when i wa a high school student and i studi so hard everi day beaus i want to enter the famou univers for my studi and for my futur . at that time , it wa so hard for me to do both go to the high school and do to the secondari school for more studi at night . i thought i might give up enter the high level of univers mani time . howev , final , i could pass the exam and enter the famou univers which my parent and i also long for . along side , i realiz that there are alway difficulti for the success . wnen we achiev the goal and challeng , we can grow ourselv as well as get the best result . moreov , there are mani risk for challeng such as whether i can pass the exam or not . additin , we need to gain more knowledg for the success . if the person want to be a doctor , he or she need to studi harder than usual student which go to common univers . to becom a doctor , it is necesarri to studi hard and gain the special knowledg beaus they have a respons for all live of patient . therefor , they alway face with take risk as well as the success as a doctor . in conclus , it is clear that success peopl alway tri to challeng new thing , to grow themselv and seek for more difficulti . at the same time , they also take risk . it might seem to be hard , howev , i think it is essenti for peopl who want to succeed to challeng new thing and take risk .
