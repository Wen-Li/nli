some peopl think that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun while some other think that they do . for those who think they doe give the reason that lot of young peopl would go out and do free survic for orphanag as well as other non profit survic in educ commiti and etc . for exampl we can see that lot of student enter club or team that goe out around the neighborhood to help out those who are in need . thi can be seen much more clearli at us and north america . howev for those who think that the young peopl doe n't do enough survic point out that most young peopl just focu on their own leisur activ when they have free time or just go and get more work to earn more money instead of pay attent to the commun . for exampl they give out the fact that young peopl nowaday spend more and more time on surf the internet as well as do sport instead of free commun survic sinc that they do n't actual get ani benifit from it . as for me , i person agre to the idea that young peopl nowaday do n't spend enough time to help out for their commun , on the condit that they are live in asia or non english speak countri . the fact is that in non speak countri such as asia young peopl tend to focu more on school work and how to get better degre such as master degre or phd . howev in north america , the school requir the student to help out the commun at least 2 ~ 5 hour a semest , which mean while those young peopl goe to school they receiv the idea of help out the commun instead of just focu on the academ . in conclus , i onli agre to the condit of that the young peopl are not spend enough time to help out the commun when they are live in the non english speak countri such as europ or north america
