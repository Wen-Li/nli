in my opinion , young peopl alreadi do spend enough time help their commun . there are at least two kind of commun they current can be involv in , one is the parent commun , consist of the famili member and the closer friend of the famili , sometim up to the whole villag some peopl live in . the other commun is the one where the famili usual is not involv in , thi can be the colleagu from work , but also commun found on the internet or by creat or simpli apprais work of art . some young peopl nowaday tend to spend more time in the latter , thu leav the first commun behind with a kind of ungrat feel . thi feel is a remnant of former day , where peopl where forc to live togeth in order to surviv and support themselv . nowaday these task that use to be distribut among all gener in a famili can be transfer to public organ or privat institut . thi reliev other part of the famili off their burden , give them more time to do and produc what they realli like . even more , our modern societi practic forc peopl to leav home . peopl are requir to be abl to travel for work , or to move to differ citi in order to obtain a proper educ . the possibl and the need to leav the commun in which peopl grew up in of cours weaken thi link back home . these young peopl pay back their former duti to their famili or commun by differ mean . some of them are tax , which in turn - at least in most of the european countri - are put back into commun project , or specif dwell for retir peopl . anoth , equal import way , is to pay back their duti by creat work of art which can support the whole societi . i think by give the peopl a choic of what to do with their time is have the biggest impact on the societi , and also commun . the commun profit indirectli from thi freedom . i think the impact is a good one , the peopl who are critic thi simpli have to accomod to the fact that the way of feedback are chang .
