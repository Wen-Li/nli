nowaday , purchas behavior is more and more influenc by the advertis . there are advertis on tv , newspap , radio , internet and street . these advertis may guid us on how to buy a product . it is hard to imagin a life without advertis . doe these advertis alway play a posit role on us ? i am afraid that i can not agre . there are too mani advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the advertis will make the product veri attract , so peopl will buy more and more product under thi motiv ; howev after purchas , peopl find that the product is not as effect as it is advertis . the reason is that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . for exampl , there are mani medicin advertis state that the medicin will sooth pain and cure diseas veri quickli . peopl suffer from pain and diseas will buy the medicin becuas they believ what is promot in the advertis . these medicin advertis have exagger the fact . even though you follow the rule , the medicin will not solv your problem as easili as it is state . further more , in order to attract more and more audienc to buy the product , the advertis may even provid fals inform to make product seem better . i have heard too mani stori from my friend that they purchas high price cosmet after see advertis . when they tri on the cosmet , it doe not improv the situat at all , some may even harm their skin . i have to say that these advertis are not respons at all . they onli show us the best exampl , but do not explain the product in a moder and correct way . i do not deni the fact that there may be some advertis truli show and promot the product , but i think the number is pretti less . most of the advertis appear not as good as they realli are .
