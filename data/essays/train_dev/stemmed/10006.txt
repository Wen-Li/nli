i disagre with the statement , nowaday , young peopl seem they do not give enough time to help their commun . but it is becaus the way of particip their commun is chang through time . in the past , commun are so small that everyon in the commun can know almost everyth about other member in commun , and they spent most of their time in the commun . but nowaday , commun are get bigger and bigger , one member in commun can hardli know about other member in commun , and peopl spend more time at work than in commun . so , it may appear thi statement is true . but the willing to help other peopl is not less than that of past time . some young peopl help other peopl by internet , donat disabl men 's committe and the other spend more time to help their commun at work . ( work place can be a commun . ) so , as time goe by , the way of particip commun activ is just chang , not the willing of particip commun activ .
