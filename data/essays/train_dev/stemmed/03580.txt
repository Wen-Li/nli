although student are veri differ from each other - so what is true and valid for one may not be true and valid for an anoth - i gener agre with the statement , but i think one element can not be separ from the other : thi mean that there are no idea and concept without fact , and there are no fact without idea and concept . from my point of view fact are not so import if you don ' t have the instrument for analys them , and the instrument are given by idea and concept : understand the `` abstract '' idea give student the tool for face realiti and learn fact , otherwis they would not get anyth of what they are read , for exampl on histori book , which are the place where you can mostli find `` fact '' . histori is to me the best exampl of thi mutual relationship between concept and fact becaus it is made of fact , but the studi of histori can not exist without idea and concept . i can mention my person case : when i wa a student i realli enjoy studi histori , but when i grew up i realiz thi wa becaus i consid histori more as a collect of interest and pictoresqu event than as real action done by peopl who have live befor me , and whose action ha had an effect on our present ( latin use to say `` historia magistra vita '' ) ; thi mean at the time i miss the connect , i did n't appli those marvel stori to the present , in other word i did not understand idea and concept . now that i am more matur i see thing from a differ perspect , and i tri to approach fact alway keep in my mind some gener principl . thisi whi i think student in school , even if veri young , should tri to do the same , of cours with the help and assist of their teacher .
