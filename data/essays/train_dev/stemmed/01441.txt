i agre with the follow statment becaus the person would have more gener knowledg than know onli about one specif subject and have other subject are for extra credit and lead to a more smart and inform student . special in one specif subject is good becaus it concentart on what the student would be will to do int he futur and what he want he be , that whi he want to be special in one specif topic but it also ha a neg effect on the person becaus then he wont know ani other inform but onli about hi specif subject . for instanc a student want to special in buis and he take subject that onli deal with busi and noth more , and when he want to chang hi mind it would be veri hard for him to chang hi subject in the futur becaus he onli took for a specif subject . have other academ subject would help the student to have seek more knowledg and have more inform and he would actual be better in hi special subject from the help of other subject . special in onli one subject will then be bore becaus the student would be work and studi the same subject over and over again in which he wont have other subject or elect that would be differ and give him differ inform . if a student specila in one specif subject and then in the end fail that subject then that would be a big loss and after all the student have been through he fail , so if he had differ subject and the subject he want to take , atleast if he fail in hi special subject he ha other subject to turn to incas failur occur . have other academ subject is better than special in one subject for alot of reason which are neg and posit .
