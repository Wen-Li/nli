in my opinion it is better and give you more advantag have broad knowledg of sever academ subject than special in onli one subject . thi can also be seen in daili life : it 's alway good to have common knowledg . to have a wide inform pool can connect the singl knowledg of each subject . thi give a good way how to manag problem and solut in a certain subject . for exampl in my studi electr engin and inform technolgi , if you have knowledg in a subject imag process you gain more advantag in master the other subject comput vision sinc the two subject share paral and almost same inform . that mean by a broad knowledg the singl inform of each subject complet each other . that way you , the knowledg holder , have differ aspect and view how to solv a problem as an engin . nowaday it is realli essenti to have an interdisciplin knowledg as a research . the classic thought of have one product in onli a specialzis subject region is not up to date . as a research or engin you might have to provid a solid interdisciplin knowledg basi in order to do work out your research or do your job . take medic engin for instanc , thi subject for it own consist of sever other subject : you need to have knowledg about medic part and engin aspect as well . e.g. in order to proced minimal-invas oper as a doctor you must not onli know the way how a human bodi work , you also need the knowledg how to manag those surgic instrument like a laparoscop , endostitch etc . last but not least by have a wide knowledg inform pool you can work out problem as well in a team build up of differ research . for exampl , the team with peopl have wider inform on differ topic and subject can better commun with each other sinc the interfac between them is provid by have a broad knowledg . that way commun problem concern stuff from differ natur can be handl easier than not have those interfac . for me as a result of those mention fact i think to have a broad knowledg is veri crucial nowaday in order to competet with other research and mostli to interact with them easier .
