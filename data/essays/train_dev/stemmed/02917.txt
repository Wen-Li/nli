the statement say that in the next twenti year , we can observ onli few number of car , compar to the number we have today . i complet disagre with the idea given in the statement . becaus , i feel that car is the most basic and effect way of travel between ani two place . thi number will keep on increas to satisfi thi basic need . of cours , rais in petrol price and other minor drawback will affect thi number to a consider amount . inde , car is the most use automobil for travel , becaus it is easi and faster . consid the technolog advanc and speed in the live each and everi human-b , we can confid say that thi number will ever increas all the time . it is simpli becaus peopl will alway look for better way of transport that allow them to move quickli to their respect task , especi in thi modern soceiti . also , it is quickli reach to a state of be a basic neccess , rather than a luxuri . henc , i dont think peopl will give up them so easili as one think . rel , the design and technolog aspect of these automobil manufactur are keep on chang rapidli to meet new and advanc custom need and also to compet with the problem like petrol price . for instanc , the research on use other altern fuel insta of petrol is go on a rapid pace , to nullifi the effect of hike in petrol amd diesel price . also , the automobil which have the compatibilti to adapt to diffrent kind of fuel are launch the market , let say , dual engin which work with both petrol and electr . on the other hand , the increas demand and hike in the oil price will affect the number of car sale in futur . these problem can be overcom by technolog innov as discuss in previou passag . but , still these innov are nascent stage and as we can not predict the futur , it is not the right time to say that these advanc technolog will serv the pusrpos at maitain cost . in case if they fail to offer the solut at momin price , peopl may reli to public transport system to reduc their cost and eventu lead to decreas in number of car as on now . final , i conclud that the statement , in the next twenti year , we can observ onli few number of car , compar to the number we have today , is pointless and is onli base onli few factor . henc , i strongli disagre with the idea .
