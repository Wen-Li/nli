i agre to the statement `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' . in an advertis such as commerci on tv 's and ad 's in magazin , it seem like it is a veri attr product and tri to get peopl 's attent by their first look . the compani will use backgroung and surround , unreal featur and famou peopl to apeal their product . when i wa a littl , i use to see commerci advertis of barbi doll all the time . the commerici show how you could do so mani thing with the doll and how much fun you can have with them . there were music on the background and a perfect set that the girl play in . i wa absolutley attract by the commer and alway ask for a new barbi doll . but when i baught them , it might not move the way it move in the tv and some of the featur show in the commerci did not come with the product . anoth way they are make the product look better , is by use special featur . for exampl , i onc saw as tv show that show how they creat commerci for food product . usual they will not show the real food . there are proffesion who make food from clay and plastic to show more textur and better in look . they will use spray to show cold of drink and steam to show how hot they are . they can also creat their commerci use comput graphic so that it can look better . the usag of celebr ha an influenc on the viewer also . even if the product is not as good as it look , when it is held or present by a famou celebr , you might think that the product is attract be convin in buy the product . in an commerci or an advertis , they will use the background , special featur that is unreal , and celebr to make the product to be apeal . from these reason i beliv that most of the advertis are make the pruduct look more attract than it realli is .
