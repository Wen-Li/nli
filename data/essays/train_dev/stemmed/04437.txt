in the past , the educ system wa design so that student would learn the `` truth '' . thi mean they would have to learn by heart all the capit of the world and know all the import histor date perfectli . with thi methodolog , it wa common for a student to get hit in a classroom for not be abl to do exactli what the teacher want . thi concept of educ is now day been reevalu . the new way of teach is much more product . now the teacher tri to make the student understand the idea behind the fact and not to repeat them like a parrot . for exampl , is doe not make sens for someon to know exactli on what day and what time did all the import battl in world war ii took place , but to understand the histor situat that led them to occur . also , the teacher instead of hit the student for not know , he encourag him to speak hi mind on everi subject . that way the discuss on the classroom are a lot more product . the new system is more use , in the sens that the person learn how to understand idea , discus them and take a posit toward them . the student 's opinion is given a lot of import and so he will learn to think on it own and not believ everyth he is told . in the futur , when the student face real life and will have to get a job , most inform learn by heart will be unus . on the other hand , if he know how to handl difficult situat and ha an appropri mental structur he will be abl to do hi job a lot better . thi doe not mean that the student will not have to learn certain fact . everi theori is , in some way , support by fact and thi should not be forgotten . person i like the better system better . not onli becaus thi way is nicer attend to school , but beacus it will help us prepar a lot better for life . although , as alway , i think that we should not believ complet in a model or system , becaus there is not such thing as the perfect methodolog . we should continu to learn and reevalu our system whenev is necessari .
