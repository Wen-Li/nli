first of all we have to defin what a success person is . in my opinion a success person is a person who is abl to find hi perfect role in the societi within he live . that is , hi work and hi famili accord to thi definit , it sound quit logic that a person ha to tri differ role befor settl down and stop search . infact success peopl are usual open mind and readi to tri differ experi , becaus the convinct that who dare , win is realli strong , although you should alway think about what you 're get involv in . if a person is not satisfi of hi job , he can carri it on without ani satisfact or tri anoth one . sure it sound like a bet , but the choic of chang can radic modifi hi life , and abov all at the and he could say : i 've tri it . a clear exampl of thi theori can be found in a casino . infact a player must alway bet great amount of money to win a lot . that 's the risk . but if the most import target of the player is to get rich , than he ha no choic : he 's to bet , and if he win he 's a successful person becaus he ha reach hi purpos . nowaday our societi is print with thi convinct becaus after second world war peopl didnt'hav anyth , and so they had to bet on someth to get rich . here in itali thi convinct is realli strong . the self made man is alway admir and respect everywher . for exampl the rapper 50 cent gave the titl `` get rich or die tryin ' '' to hi first record . he made a bet , invest all hi money on himself and hi voic . no doubt that it ha been a won bet . sure the other side of the coin is realli strong , becaus if you fail , noon will admir you : on the contrari , you 'll be judg as a failur . but if someon want to success , he 's to dare . the much you dare , the much you 'll success .
