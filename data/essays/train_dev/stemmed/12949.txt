there are a lot of thing that a good student have to do ; inde , i think that to studi in the right way ia a veri difficult thing to do . it 's import for student to understand idea and concept . it 's import , in other word , to learn a lot of inform about all the subject that a student is stude . for exampl a math student have to know , and to learn , and in particular way , to understand veri well all the rule of hi subject . if i think to my person experi , it 's veri import for me to studi care , for a lot of reason , but two are the most import . fist of all for my person knoledg , becaus onli studi , in my opinion , i can know a lot of differ thing and i can open my mind . second , onli studi care , i can learn differ and often difficult inform . on the other hand , it 's import to learn fact too . it 's import to verifi all the topic studi , in realiti . it 's import to do practic about all the topic that a student have studi . the math student , after have studi a rule , have to do a lot of exercis about it to understand it , and at the same time it 's import to know what mathemat have done in their life , for exampl what they had studi . it 's import to read newspap and to have inform from the realiti . an economi student have to know how busi are go now in the world , and have n't onli studi economi from book . in conclus i disagre with the statement becaus i think that both of these concept are import . if you studi someth and do n't do practic on the same topic or you have no notic about fact , you ca n't undertand in the right way thi topic . in the same way if you know fact , but you have n't studi befor , you are n't studi in the right way .
