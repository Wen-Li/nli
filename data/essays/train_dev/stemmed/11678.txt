i 'm disagre with thi statement . there are veri differ in young and older peopl enjoy . the energi in young peopl can influenc in their enjoy for exampl the young could to danc everi night , but it is n't to older peopl , so they are not enjoy in a parti everi night . the health is other factor to peopl enjoy . if i 'm sick and i wanna to drink beer with some friend , i could not . the mode of enjoy life is determin how it see the life . if i like the parti but i 'm older for it , is obviu that i 'm not enjoy life . but if i like swim in the ecean and i can do it , then i could enjoy life in everi moment . the young have their own enjoy , so the older have their own enjoy . i could n't to say thi enjoy life more than thi other , becaus their like are veri differ . i think the peopl that do the thing as like them , they enjoy life , it would be young or older , anybodi would be veri happi . final , the energi , the health , the like or dislik influenc in our enjoy . the young peopl or the older peopl can enjoy life alround their like . anybodi could enjoy life . when i do the want , then i enjoy life . whatev , wherev and whenev i can enjoy life , but it have to like me , i have to can do it , young or older i enjoy life , it is not determin for the age or for the time . it could be alway when you want to do it !
