life is a jorney ! to measur enjoy , one realli must look deeper into the live of peopl and determin what actual enjoy to peopl . i do not believ in the statement , ` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl ' , as differ peopl have differ way of enjoy life . just becaus one is old and doe not have the strength and energi level as those of young peopl doe not mean that enjoy in their life is over . my grandfath wa a veri happi man until i knew him . he had live life to it fullest and alway wore a smile . he alway enjoy sit read a book on that old antiqu arm chair of hi . i do not believ that is much of a way to enjoy oneself but it wa for him . he may be depriv of hear but that did not stop him from watch the televis . he simpli look at the move pictur , drew hi own conclus and had a good time . he took enorm pride in smoke the best cigar and tobacco pipe avail in hi era and enjoy the fact that he could afford to do so . what is there in it to be so happi about ? but that made him happi and he appreci it . young peopl may well be abl to do a lot of sport activ such as raft , treck among other thrill task . they may be abl to attend disco-tech all night and play sport they enjoy at higher level but that doe not mean all the happi and enjoy in the world . old folk may listen to old classic and enjoy themselv more than be at a disco even in their prime age . they may enjoy the extra relax time they get after retir and do a lot of thing they had in mind that could not have been done while they were young . they may be abl to enjoy their famili life more than ever befor , especi play with their grandchildren and see them grow up . one doe not get to do all thi in hi younger age . imagin all the excit and memori they are miss out on . thi doe not mean that all of a sudden older peopl enjoy themselv more . old peopl may look bore and weari but they accord to me are enjoy life the most . my grandfath actual told me of all hi childhood experi and wa so happi in do so . even the littl thing mean so much to them and it these litll thing , that we fail to notic , that bring unimagin joy to them ! at the end of the day it all come down to , ` differ peopl , differ live and differ way of enjoy ' !
