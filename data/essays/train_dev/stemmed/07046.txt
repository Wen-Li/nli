there is a famou say which read : `` give a hungri man a fish and he will be full for the day , give him a fish rod and he will be full for the rest of hi day . '' i strongli agre with what the proverb say and furthermor i believ the same logic appli in thi case , as well . the understand of the idea and concept is just like the rod , wherea the fact are the fish that last onli a day . i believ that an ideal educ should equip student with the necessari techniqu and concept to tackl ani problem as oppos to the specif solut for the problem onli cover in class . thi enabl student to deal with a much wider array of problem as they learn a gener recip of problem solv compar to a case specif approach . one great exampl from contemporari educ would be histori class . if fact were more import , then all a student would need to learn would be the year of certain event . howev , i believ , and the statement assert , that the motiv and consequ in a specif histor event should be studi more than the fact and date . rather than memor the year of a battl , an ideal histori cours should concentr on the success of the event that lead to the war . thi , in turn , would enabl student to reflect upon themselv and overcom similar challeng in their live . afteral life is a seri of clash interest , and it ha been that way throughout histori . anoth proverb goe : `` histori repeat itself '' . it is true onli if we valu the fact more than the idea behind the event . similarli , in math , a student should be learn how to solv all problem of a certain type , as oppos to one specif set . onc a student learn the fundement approach to solv , then s/he may resolv ani question of the similar type . have studi math , i believ i have a greater first hand experi with the latter exampl . the comprehens of concept rather than pure learn of the fact is the mathemat philosophi . in ani type of problem that math deal with , the main aim is to deduc an overal solut for all problem of the same kind . lastli , to conclud i would like to reestablish the import of understand idea and concept . actual in school thi inde is the nuanc . learn at school is more about the concept than about the fact . when thi occur , the student realiz the statement itself , and go back to my initi analog , you make their life an ocean full of fish . they tri to learn someth and anyth , anywher and anytim , becaus they have their rod .
