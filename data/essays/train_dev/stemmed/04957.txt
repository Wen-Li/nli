today , there are mani advertis all around in our live , and the purpos of them are attract custom to buy product which advertis are about . but it also caus mani problem in thi societi , such as some custom do not believ that advertis are tell them truth of product . i person disagre with the statement , `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . '' the reason i doubt it are list below . first , as the tochnolog get better nowaday , advertis can be made with mani techniqu , such as made by comput with mani fantasi stuff . while custom think that thi advertis is fantasi , it realli doesn not mean that it doesn not tell them the truth of the product that the advertis is about . and the most import thing is that advertis is just a advertis , it doe not forc custom to buy product . second , the peopl who think that most advertis make product seem much better then they realli are probabl just make misunderstand befor they buy product . and it realli should not be compani ' fault becaus they do thi is just for sell their product . custom have right not to believ what advertis say , buy they should not say everi advertis is not real . it would be realli unfair to the peopl who have spent a lot of time work on how to make good advertis . whether advertis make product seem much better than they realli are or not , it depend on differ peopl and everyon ha differ think about it .
