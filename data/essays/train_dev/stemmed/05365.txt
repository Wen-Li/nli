in japan , where i live , mani peopl think that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guid . howev , i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid for the follow reason . first of all , there is quit littl time to take a free time , if travel in a group with a tour guid . for exampl , when my wife and i went to haneymoon to hawaii in 2004 , we travel there in a group with a tour guid for seven day . we went to a lot of interest place , but we could not stay one place where we want to stay longer becaus of restrict time schedul . if we had been there by ourselv , we would have stay at our favorit place longer . as the abov experi , i definit think that travel by ourselv is the best . second , travel in a group with a tour guid is expens . for instanc , when i travel to kyusyu , which is locat in southern part of japan , for three day , i stay a excel hotel and rent a four-door car , which made reserv by myself . the total cost of thi trip wa less than a handr thousand yen . it wa a reason price . on the other hand , when i travel to the same place in kyusyu for three day with a tour guid packag , the cost of thi trip wa twice as much as that of travel by myself . thi clearli show that travel in a group with a tour guid is not econom . in conclus , in japan , where i live , most of peopl think that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guid . howev , i definit disagre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
