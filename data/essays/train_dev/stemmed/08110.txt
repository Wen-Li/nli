the current era is the era of develop and ever grow inform . the amount of knowledg avail in almost everi field is increas . i think it is import that a person is special and ha all the requir skill and knowledg of one particular disciplin . as the old say goe , `` jack of all trade and master of none '' somebodi who know too mani subject may not be abl to master ani particular subject thi is the age of special . special requir constant effort in one direct . so if a person want to special in a particular subject , they will be requir to regard that particular subject as prioriti and other subject as subsidiari also to be abl to contribut in a particular fireld , one need to put in more effort and time in know that particualr field , leav less or littl time to gain knowledg about other subject . special in particular subject would help in complet knowledg of that paricular matter . there would be less of confus and more scope for expriment with the detail and exist knowledg . thi is extrem imporatnt for scientist or other profession involv in the field of advanc of knowldg in the current time of cut throat knowledg , complet inform of particular subject is requir to gain an edg over other in the same field i dont intend to say that have inform about other fierld would do ani harm . on the other hand , the inform from other subject but relat subject might prove use . for instanc a politician would benefit greatli from know the histori of the region or teh technolog aspect of a particular powerpl in hi region is work . howev he doe not need detail and technic knowledg . he need to know enough that would help him with hi role as a politician . i think special in one specif subject is more imporatnt than tri to learn too mani subject . but onc the person ha special in hi or her field , they can alway look at enhanc their inform about other subject matter also .
