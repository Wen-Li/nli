i would disagre with the given statement i.e. `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . i strongli feel that the best way to travel would be alon or with a bunch of peopl share similar interest . the reason for thi would be for the simpl fact that the tour guid would take you to a set of place which is the citi is famou for and these place might not necessarili interest me in particular . i would like to cite a simpl exampl . last year for the new year i had to gone to goa ( which happen to be a major tourist destin in india ) . goa is known for a lot of thing . great beach , brilliant church ( goa wa under the portuges control for over 200 year , so lot of european influenc in the architechtur ) and a pretti rock night life . i and my friend decid against have a tour guid as `` goan music '' , in other word `` psi tranc '' , interest us more than the church or the beauti beach out there . the tour guid would have charg us a bomb for show the church , talk a bit about the local cultur and walk us down the beach ! we went to goa for the simpl fact that it happen to be the hub for some great electron music and sinc everi one in my group wa inclin to the same object , all of us start explor the citi all by ourselv ! we bought some local map , hire a coupl of bike , bug peopl for direct and it all ad to the experi ! i wouldnt have enjoy it to thi extent had i gone for a tour oper . guid are onli out there to make money and in today world , guid arent a neccess while go on a trip becaus you have enough inform avail in the form of book , internet etc . so i would strongli recommend to go alon and do away with a tour guid just beacuas it would add to the whole expereinc of travel .
