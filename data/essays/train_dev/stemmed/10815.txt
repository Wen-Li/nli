i think it true that most of the young peopl in an age of 20 bi 21 enjoy there live more than wsome old peopl in an age of 70 bi 75 . young poepl have all there power and do n't have to thin about there health an death . old poepl have not so much pwer and some are rearli frightend about their death , so they life with thought all around there death and so they are not so happi like young peopl . but if somon is old but still hase enough power to do sport and if he will be happi too . when the person hase an religion and believ in an life after death , it would help him or her much not to think alway about there death . so i think that young and old poepl could both be unhappi or happi in there life . when i think about it i 'm com to the result that yuo ca n't say that old peopl do n't enjoy their lif as much as young peopl do , it differ from person to person . young peopl have more power than old poepl have but old peopl have seen more in their lif than young peopl , learn more and know more . young poepl have more problem with love , school and selfconved and old peopl have more problem with death and staieng alon . young peopl and old peopl enjoy there life otherwi . young peopl make more sport or go to the disco and danc , but old peopl can read and learn and have no work to do who say that they ca n't enjoy that . i think you ca n't say that young peopl enjoy ther lif more than old peopl do it i think if you enjoy your lif or not is onli on evryon himself . so if i want to enjoy my lif i 'll do it and when i 'm old i 'm the same person like now
