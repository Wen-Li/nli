ye i agre with the topic that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . well , i agre with thi topic becaus young peopl are veri energyt , enthusiast and can enjoy to the fullest where as old peopl can not do that as their bodi is not as activ as a young person , perhap it can not be as activ as a young person . it can not be as activ as a young person becaus it is now that that old person bodi need to take rest becaus he ha been enjoy allmost all the time when he wa young . for exampl : young person : a , old person : b ; a is age between 20 to 25 year and he ha gone to a disco tech to parti with all is friend an he ha enjoy continuosli for 4 full hour . and then b also goe to that same disco tech and he could not even danc for 1 hour . well , the differ between the 2 is that a is still a young person and he is veri enthusiast and energyt to danc and parti all night where as speak about the old person that is b is an old man and he can not strain hi bodi . if he doe he will get exaust . hi bodi will run out of energi . if he want to danc like a did then he should be have lot of energi and enthusiasm . there fore i conclud by say that young peopl enjoy life more that old peopl .
