i do not agre with thi statement even fi i would like thi forcast wa true . in the next year our citi will be crowd with much more car that today . fir of all peopl realli need their car in everyth they do especi if they work far form their home . public trasport are not good enough to make peopl chang their habit . they are alway late and dirti , thi is becaus the state doe not invest enough in improv public servic . if it take 30 minut to go from home to my offic by car and it take 50 minut by train becaus it is alway late i will never chang my routin and i will alway keep use my car everi morn . secondli the increas number of car in use is also due to the widespread wealth that there is in our citi . for instanc in italian famili there is a mean of 3 car everi 2 person . mani peopl buy car not becaus they need them but becaus they have a lot of money to spend and so they buy stuff they do not realli need . sinc in mani citi the wealth is increas if think that in 20 year we will have much more car than today in our citi . thi will be a huge problem for the environment stanpoint , i think that there are two possibl solut , the first one is an agress solut while the second one is a proactiv solut aim at make peopl collabor . a first potenti solut is to forbid the use of car in downtown dure work day so that peopl would be forc to use public trasport . a second potenti solut could be about invest some money , rais with tax , in improv the effici of public trasport . i think that in thi way poepl would decid voluntarli to use subway and train instead of their own car . instead i think that there is no solut concern the habit of buy too mani car compar with need . in conclus i think that even if some action will be undetaken to reduc the number of car in use , the result will be anyway an increas car in the next year .
