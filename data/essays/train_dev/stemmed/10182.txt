parent alway say that you have to work veri hard at your younger age , so as to enjoy your older age . i do n't think that thi is a valid deal caus i dont think that i will be abl to enjoy more in my older day than when i am young . caus at older age you would like to settl down in a calm villag and enjoy the peac and pleasant climat rather than live in a crowd citi , with lot of thing happen around you and that interest you . at your younger age , you will have the energi to go around differ place and view some of the beauti creation in the world . but when you becom old , mayb your health will not allow you to do adventur . at your younger age , you have mani thing to enjoy becaus of less respons and more energi . at young age you can also have a great enjoy with your romant life too . enjoy to the highest at your younger age and also work hard to get settl in the futur is my moto of life . normal peopl think that they will enjoy there life after they are old and they onli work . but thi can be harmful if they dont get a chanc to enjoy at thier older stage after so mani year of hardwork . normal youngster do enjoy a lot by arrang disco parti and trip to differ locat with friend . they get in touch with the latest technolog and gadget like ipod , mobil phone , game and mani more . they do spend a luxuri life . youngster also enjoy sport and have a abilitiy to take part in it . so final i can say that , young peopl enjoy more than older peopl with respect to health , responsibilti , technolog and much more . so , i prefer enjoy my younger age and get settl in my older age .
