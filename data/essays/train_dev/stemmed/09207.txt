i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact . i believ that for mani reason . one of the most import reason i believ that is more import for student to understand concept and idea is that , by understand concept , they could develop a critic attitud to the interpret of fact . student should encourag to understand idea that motiv peopl behaviour , rather than simpli learn fact . i think that should be the professor 's respons to discuss in class concept rather than fact , sinc it is much more challeng for student to understand concept on their own . at the same time , if student are interest in learn fact , they can do that by themselv , accord to their specif interest . the second reason i think it is more import to learn concept rather than fact is that thi way of learn last longer in time and it is less superfici . for instanc , i rememb that when i wa at school i had to learn and memoris a lot of `` fact '' that after two day from the exam i had alreadi forgotten . on the contrari , if you understand concept and idea , it is much harder to forget what you have learnt . student should be consciou of perpetu a more `` durabl '' way of learn and i think that learn concept is a much more use way to learn . be more motiv to learn concept introduc the third reason whi i believ it is more import for student to understand idea . student are more interest in learn about abstract concept , rather than fact becaus they could find that idea and concept are more applic to the realiti , without be compel to a certa period of time for instanc . if you have studi . for exampl , the militari techniqu that have been use in a particular battl , they can not certainli appli to the real world in which we leav . on the contrari , if you have studi the concept of war and understand what issu it implii , it could also be appli to the real world . i think that student would be much more fascin by the concept of war . in conclus , i believ that it should be given prioriti to student to understand idea , by promot discuss and debat . thi is a much less steril way to learn and promot educ than learn fact .
