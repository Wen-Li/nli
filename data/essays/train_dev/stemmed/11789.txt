i think that what is state in thi question is correct . it is true that peopl who decid to special on a specif topic could perform in a particular field , allow him to reach import goal in it profession life . on the other side a person who do not ha a wide knowledg on differ subject , could face some problem in hi daili life . a knowledg of differ argument could help someon to face a speach on multipl subject show it huge backgroung . i think that univers shoud avoid to focu their cous on a limit number of subject and allow student to choos among differ cous . when i choos my univeristi cour i had the possibl choos a person exam 's plan . in that occas i avoid to focalis my studi plan on relat subject . even if it should be easier to studi two similar exam , ( for exampl intern market and intern busi ) i prefer to base my plan on differ subject in order to let me the possibl to analis the differ subject and tho choos , in a second time , the argument on which i prefer to focu . thank to thi method i 've been abl to improv my knowledg on certain subject that i ignor befor . thi help me in my post univers environ let me to chose a profession carrer not strcli relat to the one i intendet to take at the begin of my univers cour . for these reson i think that a special knowledj could be interest for someon who ha strong passion on specif subject , but it should be alway support with a wider knowledg in differ topic .
