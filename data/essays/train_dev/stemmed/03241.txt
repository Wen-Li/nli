i think that it is more import for student to understand idea than to mechan learn fact , especi for student that have to learn scientif concept ( as for exampl math 's formula or physic 's concept ) . while just learn fact might be good if you to have to prepar for a class test that will take place in a short period of time , you will probabl not rememb much of what you have studi on the long run . thi becaus if you realli understand whi someth happen or how doe that happen you would know how to solv a particular problem also if you forgot the specif formula . anoth good reason to understand idea other than just learn fact is that do so they would be abl to use their knowledg also outsid the contest they learn it from . from exampl a mathemat formula or theori could be appli in other area as chemistri , biolog or even medicin . such an advantag would not be possibl by just learn a process and mindlessli appli it . understand fact is veri import but there are some field where i think learn fact is not the main necess . thi is the case of histori or literatur , although understand fact can also be use in some case to understand , for exampl , whi one nation invad anoth or whi one author ha written one way instead of anoth and how he ha been influenc by extern factor . probabl the best way to learn is to first understand the idea and then to learn fact . do so you will be abl to rememb what you have learn for much longer than either just understand idea or just learn fact .
