it is controverti whether in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . some peopl disagre with the idea that it is imposs to reduc use car becaus today we are so depend on car . howev , in my opinion , i agre with the idea that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use that there are today . first , in realiti , now , we are face with the lach of oil or ani fuel . second , by develop the techniqu of scienc , we may invent more innov transport to go to all around the world . to begin with , now , there is state of lack the ani fuel . we effort steadili to find new fuel like hydrogen dioxid fuel , nuclear energi and wind power energi . howev , these could not be replac of oil fuel . also , in the world , there were still war to have the fuel prioriti . accord to the korean broadcast in seoul , in the 50 year , there were no fuel resourc in the world . in thi sens , car which depend on fuel could not be use in 20 year . next , get develop in scienc , our scientist would invent a lot of innov transport . mayb , as we seen in `` matrix - which deal with the futur - , that situat would be come . peopl could move in just second as the girl in matrix and could move use machin like rocket . in addit , we could be fli in the sky . if the scientist can make up the circumst which doe not have gravit forc , we could move freeli the side to anoth side . thi is not familiar with me , now , howev , in 20 year , we do n't know what happen are occur . thi clearli show that in 20 year we could use anoth transportaion . in conclus . i agre with the idea that in 20 year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for the reason that i mention abov . first is lack of fuel and second is our scientist could invent more conveni transport machin .
