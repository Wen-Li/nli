in see how the total consumpt of ga is consequ nowaday and regard the fact that it will increas with the rise of china 's consumpt , the car issu must be debat . howev more the disparit of the use of car , i think an evolut of them is go to happen . even if the ga issu may rais question about slow the use of car for differ reason - for instanc becaus it entail environnement problem such as the ozon layer deplet , and also becaus while ressourc are decreas the ga consumpt is still rise - in my opinion it wo n't happen . inde car are a fundament part of civilian everyday life , it ha been one the most sold item sinc the 1950 's . today in most case it ha becom veri difficult to live without a car when you are not live in a veri big citi . although price are lower , the other way of travel are still much more expans than car . for instanc most of the popul who can afford it is go to work drive a car . it is true that other way of travel have been enhanc in citi such as the underground or buse , howev car remain the easier and more common way to travel . nevetheless , i think there will be some chang but concern how car work . today some peopl are alreadi work on how make car pollut less through foster research on other type of fuel made from plant for instanc . to conclud we can say that chang are obvious need but as far as i am concern i think it will not be a decreas of the use of car but an evolut of car themselv .
