the question ask me if i agre or disagre with the idea that if young peopl , nowaday have not much time for help their comun . in my opinion i think that young peopl is abl to do that but lat gener of young peopl are less careful with their environ , their famili etc . .. i think that if you propos it you can make it happen . it is true that young peopl is actual more bussi than becaus they have to studi a lot at the high school or at the univers . but they do that probabl six hour a day or eight . so they have a lot of free hour to hepl their comun . the main problem now is the boom of the internet and the poor show put on the televis that onli make the young peopl keep in front of it . the children are mani hour a day chate or play with the playstat or watch horribl show with level of educ zero . new gener have chang a lot . anoth big big problem now are drug . veri young peopl star in the world of grug sinc they are veri littl mayb becaus of social problem or problem in their famili . they can not adapt well to the societi , they have bad companion and then they left a healthi life . they wast much time in all these activ and mayb it is the problem for what they are not abl to help their comun to have a better aspect , to have a good grow . . and is due to that for what mani comun becom bad for the societi eye . i think that anoth problem for what they can not help their comun is not the ammount of time they have , but their educ sinc they were born and the lack of sens and sensiblil they have , not onli for help their comun but also for help other peopl . i am sure that televis and internet are the first caus for thi . young peopl are late veri egoist and they onli look for their own benefit . long befor children were veri differ becaus tv and internet did no exit and they have more time for share their life with their famili , for play more time and for help their comun . peopl then were more unit . now young peopl onli think on next ; to studi veri littl for have more free time and go by the citi to parti , etc . final , i think it ha to be more inform about educ for young peopl and bring them more oportun with more activ .
