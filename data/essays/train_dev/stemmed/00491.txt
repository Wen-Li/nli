advertis are usual a particular kind of product develop form mani peopl work togeth , each one with a differ role and each one with differ skill . those peopl are pai from compani and they have a great interest in improv compani ' profit just becaus if they don-t they risk to loos their job . i think thi is enough for show how advertis present product in better way then the one tey realli are . first when a compani decid to spend money in advertis it ' s usual wait a reward from that . an advertis campaign is costli . for thi reason they expect more peopl will buy the product in order to achiev an higher profict . thi is whi peopl who produc advertis ha to attract more buyer that their competitor and so will tri to present their product as the best product peopl can desir to buy . they must convinc peopl if they buy that they are do the right choois . second peopl who are pay to produc advertis have a lot of differ skill , they usual know a lot about market and they know who they are go to refear to sell the product . for exampl some day ago i wa in the librari and i wa realli surpris when some boy and girl near me began to talk about a market research project they were develop . they did n't care at all about the qualiti of the product , they care just about how to sell it . they tri to find the best way of convinc peopl and did n't care at all about bee honest in the way they had to do that . moreov i can sure add some person experi . for exampl , i 've got an eleven year hold sister alway ask my mom for mani product she see in advertis . sometim my mother buy her the product she want and even if she spend a lot of money do that often they are not hight qualiti product . i notic thi can happend easili for product they sell to kid or teen-ag just becaus thi public usual care less about qualiti and more of how the product itself appear . in conclus my opinion is that advertis is often a way of earn more profict for compani or a way of creat a brand name . the market itself is cometit . how can they reveal the weak of their product ?
