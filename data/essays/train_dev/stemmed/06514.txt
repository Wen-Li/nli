in my opinion there is a need for specialist and generalist . with generalist i refeer to peopl who have a broad knowledg . if everyon is special on hi topic no one ha an overview of the total problem and on the other hand if all student focu on mani academ subject there wo n't be ani specialist to do special work . for student there sould be a chois wether to get a broad knowledg or specialiy on one subjet . it is import that one can figur out what suit him or her best . for me it is special on a specif subject , but i still want to have knowledg of the surround field of studi . if there is quit a broad interest in subject and a specialis in one topic at the same time , it is possibl to link one thing from one field to the specialis field and eventu come up with someth new and inov . i think there are also some slight differ between the field of studi . for busi student it is neccesari to know a lot of a huge varyiti of topic , but the need to go into detail is not that big . thi is differ for student from engin . to bring the research or product forward it is vital to know all detail of exist solut . so an engin student must focu on one topic if he like to contribut to that subject . but still with special on one specif topic he sould not forget about the view of the total . if the statement is taken as a gener statement i have to say that i do not agre with it , but it is correct in specif field of academ . dure my work expiri i saw that sometim it ha to mani specialist and ofthen they forget about what the whole pictur is . in there case the statement could lead some peopl to be a generalist . these generalist then could help the specialist to work to gether and direct them to a good solut . the statement ha some truth with but i ca n't agre with it totali .
