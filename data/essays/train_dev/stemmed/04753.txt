i agre with the statment , advertis make the product seem way much better thay they realli are , acctual mani time one feal cheat , as you realic the real characterist of a product you just bought . i think there are three main kind of fals statement that are usssuali done about product . they make you think you need them , as far as i know we do n't acctual need all the thing thay they promot , thi is easi to observ on tv comerci , ussual it tourn out than they have just invent someth that make a work that you never do , reali easi to do , well great but i never do that ani way . the second common statment is , that their porduct is abl to do some incred thing , needless to say that most of the time they do n't do anyth outstandinglli differnt from what their lest expens subtitut do , i have a perffect exapl for thi one , ther wa a tv sale show , like ten year ago , that claim they have develop glass that can help you see as an eagl , i mean it is good enough to be abl to see as a normal human , and by the way that is a stament that we will never be abl to prove ether right or wrong , therefor mani peopl found themselv disapoint by their new sunglass , becaus at least they did n't do what they expect , i am not say that anyon like them anyway . an other typic disguis is to make you beliv that you might acctual becom a better person , in mani senc , by consum their product . let say they are tring to sell you a car , they display a pictur of a young , athlet , good look guy , sorround by a group of beautiful women , i can assur you that buy the car will not make you look like him or make you sudent irresit for women . or how about the mp3 player advertis > they make young guy think thay they will fit better on their social group if they own one . final i have to recogn anyway that there are some exept , but not mani .
