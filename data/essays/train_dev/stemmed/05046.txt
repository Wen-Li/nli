the use of car ha increas rapidli over the last few year . almost everybodi use hi car daili for exampl to go to work . the question whether in twenti year less car will be use than nowaday is fairli hard to answer . on the one hand i think thi statement will becom true for sever reason . first of all ga price are rise constantli for the last few year and thi trend seem to continu . therefor mani peopl will not be abl to keep their car or at least reduc the distanc they dirv to a minimum . instead they will tri to find altern such as take the train or the bu . furthermor the reach level of pollut caus by car is alreadi veri high nowaday . the govern will probabl tri to find solut for thi problem , which could be either higher tax or to forbid drive to some kind of car or even complet on some day in the year . if the first thing happen , have a car will again be more expens and like thi a lot of peopl will not be abl to keep their car . on the other hand there are also reason that support the idea that in the futur the number of car will not declin . allthough there will be more altern in the futur to travel comfort , made possibl by for exampl new invent like the transrapid , these invent are still to expens for most of the peopl . therefor it will still be cheaper to go by car . the effect of the rice price in the energi sector on public transport media ha to be consid as well . price for use a bu or a train might becom higher and the car could eventu still be the cheapest way to travel . apart from that mani peopl reject go by train or bu becaus they want to maintain their independ . if you go by car you have no fix time for leav . you can just stay as long as you wish and do not have to care about the time moreov there are not direct connect avail for all place to go . you might have to spend some extra time to reach your goal through chang the train or have to take rout for which you need more time . take all thi into consider i think that there will not be fewer car in the futur , becaus most peopl prefer go by car instead of use other transport media .
