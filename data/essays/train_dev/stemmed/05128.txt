youth and health allow peopl to perform task that older peopl ca n't , it doe n't mean that old peopl is confin and limit about the thing they may do . at the earli begin of life you 're not much concern or worri about what you have to do to make a live , you do n't even think that life may have an end , that way of think perphap encourag to make thing without consid the consecu they may have . it ha to be defin first what enjoy is , it may differ from person to person , we can not compar a muslim and a mormon , they way they see the world doe n't necessarili agre . get back to the point , young peopl have not live what , perphap , old peopl have , that lack of knowledg an experi is a good reason to explor life . old peopl live their youth in a differ time , with differ manner and accostum to thing that can be consid as old-fashion . valu missconcept have made old peopl beliv that the young peopl doe n't know how to get the most out of life in a decent way , they treat , sometim , young peopl like crimin becaus they do n't share some point of view about life , about the fast-chang life that we have to live nowday . we 're actual live in a world without commun frontier , it allow to share the way we live with other and to compar , we may like what is done in other countri and we could like to behav like that . young peopl enjoy more life beacus they can hardli see the differ between what is right and wrong , and sometim the feel they get from break the rule make them `` enjoy '' more . in my opinion , you need health to enjoy the life but enjoy is a state of the mind , you have to find joy in your heart no matter how old you are . i hope i will have thi way of think when i 'm 80 .
