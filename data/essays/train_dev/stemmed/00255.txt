as i 'm do engin studi , the question of take my cours on one specif subject or on mani variou thema occur to me sever time . my choic follow the way of a broad knowledg , except the last year : i prefer to special myself in onli one subject dure one year . so whi ? the first reason is that studi in divers academ subject give you a larg view of how take a problem when it occur . you can have mani way to develop a solut which could respond to your problem . if you studi onli one subject , your mind is focus on one method which could finish in a dead end . for exampl in microelectron , a friend of mine propos a solut use hi knowledg in mechan ! anoth reason for learn about divers thema could be to understand the world we are live in . histori , geographi , economi , physic , mathemat , and languag are essenti to see follow our chang environ everi day , not onli at home , but also when we 're work . for instanc , social scienc could help you to understand whi your boss is in a bad mood today , and mayb learn you not to ask him some thing which could be desastr . .. my last argument for broad knowledg would be your abil you can have to chang of job , or decreas your time of adapt when you enter a new firm . nevertheless , the special is - i think - also veri import . it will be the first thing a manag will notic when you will present him your resum , when you appli for your first job . moreov it is interest when you studi to keep time to make a deep analysi on subject you prefer . it will be give you the qualif of expert on the matter . eventu , as i want to have some manageri respons , i choos to diversifi my studi .
