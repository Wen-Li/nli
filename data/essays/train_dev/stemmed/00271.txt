the issu at hand is about the broad knowledg of mani acamed subject than to special in one specif subject . thi issu is import for the versatil in ani field of interest . in today 's world we need to explor ourselv in a complet manner in our academ career . but on the other hand we need to special in one particular area also . becaus educ demand broad knowledg of everyth but the career job demand special in one field . i think both are equal import in a balanc way so , i disagre with the statement . first , i think my option is prefer becaus of lack of expert . for exampl if someon want to becom a manag then he/sh need to have knowledg of subject like financ , market , hr oper , it , etc.but if that person is not have special knowledg in one area then he/sh will face problem in get a good job becaus of lack of expertis knowledg . second , i think my choic is better becaus of lack of problem solv abil . for exampl a person ha learnt a lot of program languag like c , c++ , java , . net , etc. but he ha learnt onli the basic or in other word we can say that he had not practic or given attent to one particular langaug , then he/sh is go to face lot of problem in a softwar develop of one langaug . third , i believ that my choic is appropri becaus of decis make skill . for instanc one person ha learnt lot of fundament about the mba but he ha not special in one area like financ . then he / she can not take adequ decis in favour of the organ becaus of insuffici skill in that area . final , i would like to say that a mba person or manag is `` jack of all but master of one '' . it mean that in today 's world he need have broad knowledg of all area but expert in one so that he can take certain decis in favour of him and the oragn fianlli , i conclud my choic is correct .
