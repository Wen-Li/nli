well , my over all precept about advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i disagre with thi statement for sever reason . firstli , i think that mani advertis compani advertis for the matter of money not more . secondli , i know that mani product do not deserv a veri big advertis through a person experi . mani famou compani advertis for their product to attract peopl to buy it or to love it in some way . what i mean that is advertis compani look for a someth which all peopl love it and tri to put it in the advertis . as we know pepsi is one of the most compani that advertis for it product . and all peopl know that pepsi is veri harmful after if we drink it for a long time . well peopl didnt say that . scientist said that and due to mani experi on pepsi . peopl also can discov by them selv that pepsi is not good . a veri simpl test , bring a broken teeth and put it in a pepsi cup . you will soon discov after a coupl of hour that their is no teeth . in addit to my first exampl which prove to peopl that pepsi is veri harmful and they alway advertis for it on tv . i would like to talk on anoth exampl which is junk food . i watch tv for around 4 to 6 hour each day and i can see alot of advertis for macdonald and burgerk . if a normal person see these advertis , he think that jumk food is good , while it also veri bad . junk food may lead to cancer diseas and block in heart artri . it full of harmful oil which is use sever time . some peopl are also overwait from junk food . all doctor advic to stay away of junk food . in fact adverts peopl are profession and they know how to affect peopl through these advertis . and as far as i know and i think it not fair and also it not legal to tri to cheat on peopl . i take thi as a cheat method becaus when they are advertis you think it a good product and it suit you .
