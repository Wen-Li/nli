i agre with the idea that most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are . advertis itself is the way the compani tell the peopl what they are make for them , the main propus of make a advertis is to convey peopl to buy their product . it is the same as you are appli for colleg . you do want the admiss offic to see the advantag you have , and avoid the disadvantag as possibl as you can . by do so , you are tring to perswad the admiss offic to let you enter the colleg . these is just as same as what compani do to their coustmer by make advertis . think about it , if there are two appl on the tabl , one is big and red while anoth is small and green , which one would you prefer by just look at them ? of cours the one that look better ! when we are watch an advertis , the product are often look realli good , or even better than they realli are . howev , that not becaus the advertis maker is cheat us , they just want us to feel better by the first look at the product sinc we had never seen it befor . for exampl , when a profession photographor is take pictur of a new product , say , wine , for a compani , he may use the mixtur of red ink and water instead of use the real wine . becasus when he put the mixtur under the light , it look more clear than wine and peopl would like these kind of thing . when peopl have a good first visual impress of the product , they would possibl go to buy it , and befor they realli hold the product in their hand , it have noth to do wheater the product is good or not . sinc then , advertis have finish their job .
