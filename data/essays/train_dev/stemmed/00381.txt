gener speak a success person is someon who succeed in all hi attempt , is good in hi job and earn a lot of monnay . and all of thi aspect are often seen in the area of a job . so a success person must have a good job and ha to do hi job as no one els , what can lead us to say that he tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what he alreadi know how to do well . to my mind , it 's right that to be success somebodi must have some nerv to appli some theori or to launch a new product on the market . i think that without ani qualiti so as to stay undisturb or the abil to forse what will have some success , we ca n't have ani success . the two qualiti , enonc in the subject , are also not enough . sometim these success peopl take risk , just becaus these risk extist , they do n't care about there success , but they like the game that it impli ; it 's not a question of do well or not . but i must say that there are other peopl , who one day also tri new thing with nerv and good idea , but were unsuccess . so the fact to tri new thing and to take risk is not an insur that our project will succeed . there is a part of luck that we ca n't forget . we can say that success peopl are kind of lucki peopl . and to be careful is not so bad , i think ; becaus to do well is not someth that anybodi can do . it requir qualiti , which are not the same as to tri someth new , and it can appear as more difficult to do well as to be an aventur . i ca n't forget to say that there is a third class of peopl , those who do well , who analys the situat and take advantag of it and so are success . and we can take exampl on these one , becaus they are a good melt of a raison mind and of an aventur spirit .
