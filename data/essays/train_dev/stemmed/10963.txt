i disgre with the given statement becaus i think it depend on individu and not on the time avail . a person who realli want to help hi commun can sure take out time for the same wherea a person who is not that interest will use hi time for other purpos rather than serv hi commun . no doubt that in the present gener the competit ha increas and inord to lead a resonablli good life peopl we realli need to work hard . so in run after make penni peopl are overlook the need for spare time for work for the commun . but still it not true that peopl dont give enough timefor commun . for exampl , recent mumbai encount a bomblast where thousand of peopl were injur . then immedi peopl react and start help the govern in move the injur peopl to the hospit and gete their treatment done . a group of student took shift for whole night and serv the injur with bread and tea . i think thi showsw the concern left in peopl . donat money for develop of poor peopl is also one way of serv the comun . becaus of the vast destruct of psunami mani peopl were left with starv stomach . in mani colleg peopl collect money food , cloth and gave it to the govern for send them to the requir place . serv commun not onli mean that you have to take fix amount of time separ for it . i think help the peopl where ever you find them is also serv . for exapml , when we are on the way to offic and come across a blind person struggl to cross the road help him will also serv the purpos . in short for serv commun we need not be the activ particip . see the peopl reaction in such case like psunami and the bomb blast i think young spirit are still burn .
