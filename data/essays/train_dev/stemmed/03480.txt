some peopl say that the number of automobil will decreas in a coupl of decad . howev , i disagre with the statement for the follow reason . fisrt of all , car are most use tool for peopl to move . for exampl , in 2001 , when i wa sophomor in univers , i live in tokyo and i had a travel to hokkaido , the most northen island in japan . i want to visit mani place with beauti forest and preciou plant , becaus my major wa biolog and i wa veri interest in the divers of plant in hokkado , most cold realm in our countori . a problem wa that there were no mean to reach the forest becaus few peopl want to visit there . then i determin to use a car and i enjoy my trip with variou type of plant . if i could not use car , i would not have visit the excit forest . as thi exampl show , car satisfi our individu requir , suggest use of car will be inevit in near futur . second , there are possibl that scientist creat new type of car move without petroleum . one of major problem about car is that they use petroleum . use petroleum caus natur environ to be pollut . also , shortag of petroleum in the earth is annoy problem . to address these issu , for exampl , scientist now develop car whose fuel is ethanol , a kind of alcohol . we can easili creat ethanol from crop , especi cone becaus of a larg amount of cone 's suppli . scientist are also develop car move with electr from solar energi . thi is complet clean and not harm . although there is mani problem to realiz these next gener of car , mani countri promot these studi and the applic will be realiz soon . therefor , i disagre with the statement that the number of automobil will decreas within next two decad .
