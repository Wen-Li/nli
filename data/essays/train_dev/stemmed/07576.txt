i total agre with thi statement , although it is rather simplist . i think in fact that it is true that most advertis make product seem much better than they are , but mayb thi is just due to the locat of the advertis ( for exampl a beach or a wonder hous ) or becaus of the short time they have to present the product , so sometim a thing is shown realli fast , when it is actual not . nevertheless i think that these are the onli aspect that could be justifi , but they are margin aspect , not the core one . it is a shame to make someth seem fabol when it is absolut not or when it doe not function at all . i believ that the media compani should avoid thi kind of `` fals advertis '' . mani surround the product or the brand with fantast characterist , impli that the peopl who wear it or buy it are cool and special . i strongli believ that thi is extrem danger for the young spectat , who are particularli sensit to these aspect and have not a defin person yet , so they are easili convinc . moreov some could be danger even for adult : for exampl the advertis on diet product , which are provid with fals wit and interview , which explain how mani weight they have lost in so littl time . i am person particularli against thi type of advertis , becaus it is no more a matter of buy a televis or a fridg which doe not function , but rather a matter of health , which is much more import and ha to be avoid . in conclus i think that the onli function of advertis should be that of make the consum awar of the creation of a new product and not to overwhelm him with fals and useless inform , although the consum should be howev critic .
