twenti year is not a realli long time for chang thing in the histori . i think that in twenti year there will be more car in use than there are today . car chang peopl life , i can not imagin how our life will be without have car , car help a lot for the human . the reason whi i think car will not be fewer is that peopl need it . we need car to get to work , school , and other place . well , some peopl will think about other transport . that is ture , for a short distanc we can walk or ride a bike , and for long distanc we have airplan and train . howev i think car is much faster than walk or ride a bike , and also car are realli flexabl , we can go anywher ani time without a airplan or train ticket . we will have so much troubl without car , they made our life easier . car are realli convinc . the other reason is as popul grow . the number of the peopl need car will also increas . for exampl . in beij everi day there will be thousand of new car go to the street . thi also happen to ani other big citi in china . in shanghai , the number of car increas to fast , and the gover rais the price for the liscen plate . from these exampl show that car will not stop grow in a short time such as twenti year . there will be a problem for the ga , becaus the earth is lack of oil now . i beliv at that time there will be other kind of car for us to drive . the car will use batteri , we do have some car use batteri now , in twenti year these kind of car will be absalutali advanc . we also can use sun energi for the car . these are my point that car will not be fewer in twenti year , car are our friend !
