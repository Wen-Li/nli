car have been a topic of concern to all of us . who doe n't own a car nowaday in the modern world . they serv as a mean of transport , they 're fun to collect , ride and even take care of . so will they be there for us in the futur ? everyon dream in at least one stage of hi life be that of a kid , teenag or adut to own a car or drive a car . it seem that car are more of a cultur than a just a vechil . person , i 've been ask sever time about my favourit car . in contrast , more peopl are tend to use car . it 's a fast method of transport , faster than convent method like bike . it is also person which differenti it from public transport . it come in all size , color and shape and model , so it 's fun to collect and ride . all these factor combin may make it difficult for peopl to accept the idea of not use car and head to other method of transport . on the other end , there are also some factor that may have some influenc on decreas the number of car . more attent is be place on the effect of car , especi when we mention all the pollut that it produc , be it aucost or environment and safeti issu . some citi ( one of them in turkey ) which i visit have rule against use car . it 's a small villag of cours but it 's realli wonder to live in a nois free , non-pollut environ where the onli nois you can hear is hors carraig , walk peopl and bike . today , lot of environment restrict have been place on car compani to address pollut and help develop `` clean car '' , one exampl is in california where they have strict rule agianst pollut . safeti is also a main concern and differ measur are be appli to help develop `` safe car '' like the deploy of safeti pillow , ab system and anti-slip system . in my opinion , the onli way that car are go to be reduc in number is the invent of some new vehicl that can replac car ( small jet , like the one view in the jetson cartoon which i saw onc . ) i think that the number of car will remain on in a steadi increas as newer model are produc that minim the con of such automobil which includ the reduct of pollut emit and that that address safeti issu of the driver and pedastrian .
