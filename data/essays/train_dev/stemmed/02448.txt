everybodi is ask to himself : will the number of car reduc in the next twenti year ? nobodi can know and forecast how life in gener will be in the next 20 year , but all of us can and must hope that it will happen . the use of car creat a lot of problem like pollut , traffic jam , but on the aother side use car allow economi to run . the biggest problem the use of car creat is pollut , pollut that is produc by the smoke , the oil , and the gase that come out from our car . everyday our citi are becom more and more grey and black , dirti and not healthi at all to live in . a direct caus of pollut is traffic jam . traffic is get more and more terribl becaus everybodi need and use car not onli to work but to live in gener . whi doe thi happen ? thi happen becaus there a lot of citi nowaday that have n't provid yet to improv with effici system of transport like undergroung that cover not onli the space under the citi , but longer distanc . actual the bu system it 's not realli develop and it cant be effici develop becaus there are too mani car around the citi , and anyway everybodi prefer to use their own car than go with buse . on the other side we know that car make the economi run , actual to move car need gasolin , and gasolin deriv from petroleum , thu there is a long wire that connect societi that live on car . anoth exampl are the industri that produc car , if we do not use car anymor there would be an econom crisi and may be a period of grate depress , becaus not thousand but million of worker would lose their job . probabl if we are abl in the next futur to understand that we are destroy our planet not onli pollut but also suck all the sourc , and that we will reach a term in which it will not be possibl anymor to go on with thi situat , the number of car will reduc , a solut will certainli come from technolog research : we could use mean of tranport that do not pollut { like sun , wind , or hydrogen } but at the same time allow the economi to run .
