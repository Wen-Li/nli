i would like to start by state an old idiom ` noth succe like success` ! which impli that if one suce in one field he is more like to succeed in other field also . and i think it 's true and success peopl do have better chanc in in succeed in new field . firstli switch to ani fild requir financ and fund at dispos . and if one ha succeed in a particular field he would definit be have save or earn to take risk . and even if they loos they have cushion behind them as they can again go back to the field in which their name ha alreadi been establishj . and to add to thi when one ha earn fame or goodwil in one field they can easili util that goodwil in other type of field too . we have mani exampl of well known actor switch to model and endors commerci brand . the most import factor accord to me is confid . success bring confid togeath with it and is the main factor that encourag the person to take risk and succeed . moreov a success person is have experi which he can veri well util to gain and reduc the probabl of failiur . thi is true that one should not gambl in a field he is have less knowledg of but also one should not be advers to risk , as risk and success are directli relat . one who is take risk may or may not succeed , but one who doe not tri and take risk can never succeed . and it quit obviou that a sucess person can take risk with much less fear . in the end i would like to conclud by say ` risk is not everyman 's game ' and a'a success person is the one who tri new thing rather than stick to one !
