enjo life ` `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . '' in my openion i think it 's not true that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . happi doe n't come by age it come by satesfact you may find a young man who can do everi thing he want but at the end he is not happi . or you may also find a young man who he is not happi becaus he doe n't have the aportun to get mari and to creat a familli . enjo life is not about do thing that will make you feel younger . you may find an old person who he enjoy eech second he spend in thi world by see hi grandchildren . it depend through the person intrest . for exampl my father is an old man who have grandchildren but he is enjo hi life by spend time with hi famili and take care of hi hous . hi happi when he see hi children and espesciali me becaus i am the youngest get high grade in school . thi is what happi mean .
