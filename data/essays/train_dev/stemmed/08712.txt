it ha been a long time disput issu for which one is more import among student should understand idea and student should learn fact . for my view , i think it will depend . you need use differ method to studi in differ time accord to differ requir . take stude mathmat and phisic as an exampl . as all of you know , mathmat and phisic are veri logic subject and learn them need veri deep understand of their fact . onli after that , you might be abl to begin find out some essenti of those subject . for exampl , if you just have remenb sping formular , not veri understand the theori and fact of the spring formular , it might be , perhap , when you face some relev problem veri easi , you might be abl to solv the problem just use the spring formular you have rememb . howev , if the problem you are go to face is the combin of differ mechan . you need to figur out effect of combin of mechan which includ spring mechan area . you could solv the probl onli if you know the thorough fact about sping includ the reason of spring mechan , process of spring mechan , some special circumst of spring mechan , etc . nevertheless , if you want to learn cmputer program languag and want to just use it for applic . you do not need to learn mani detail which sustain the higher applic . onli some idear and concept are enough , sinc nowaday , some lower level detail and fact are integr to a higher method of comput languag . and those integr are the job of anoth comput expert , who need know fact from how memori comsum to how to locat the memori , etc . you can just think the higher method as a black box , just use it will be ok . so , it will be import to use fiffer
