i partial disagre with the statement that is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject becaus i think that both the idea express in the statement are import and that one idea doe n't exclud the other one . in fact my opinion is that is veri import to have an idea and a minimum knowledg about mani academ subject . that 's an import thing becaus everyon should know almost the basi of gener cultur . i think that is n't a good thing when someon do n't know anyth about one or sever aspect of cultur , for exampl about histori , geographi or scienc , also if the same person know veri well one aspect in which he is realli interest . it 's normal to focu our attent , energi and mayb also all of our life about the thing that we realli consid import , but at the same time we should mind that these thing are fundament onli for us . for thi reason it 's import to be inform , at least a littl , about all the aspect of human worldwid societi . but at the same time it 's imposs for someon to have a veri deep knowledg about all the subject that could be studi . for thi reason it 's also import the exist of peopl who are special in onli one subject . for exampl i think that peopl who studi someth like scienc could n't make new theori if they should studi with the same attent they use for scienc all the other subject ( like histori , languag and philosophi for exampl ) . i think that unfortun it 's imposs to know everyth . for thi reason we should focu our attenct about what is realli import for us but at the same time be interest to all the other thing that appear everyday in the world .
