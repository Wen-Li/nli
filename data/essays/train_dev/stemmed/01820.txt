it is not better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . it may caus a huge problem becaus if a lot of person know a littl about mani subject , how do they teach someth in detail about a sepecif subject to anoth ? also how do peopl becom a teacher with thi littl inform ? how do knowledg can improv with a littl inform about a subject ? that is whi it is better to special in one specif subject than to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . let consid that there is a littl popul in a small land and they know a littl inform about everi academ subject like geographi , biolog , histori , physic . .. etc . with thi littl knowledg it would be hard to determin geograph characterist of the land , or speci that live in the land and their differ or similr . even it will be hard to now what is a speci or it would be hard to know about their histori and it will be hard to put thing on a road in the futur . so , that will help to the popul to destroy themselv more quickli . on the other hand , imagin a land which is full of peopl who have a well knowledg about their one proffecion area . with thi proffecion they can teach their knowledg to their children or the one who want to learn about the subject . the differ between thi exampl from the previou one is they will know much more inform on a subject and that will help to develop themselv more quickli . in conclus , as i said and support the idea with the exampl befor , i believ that it would be more effect when peopl have one proffecion area than to know a littl about a lot of subject becaus it will help them to improv themselv and also to have a well educ popul in the land .
