it is often said that there will be no more traffic-jam in the futur . scientist have been develop a fli car and bigger and faster public transport vehicl will be develop . however , i formli disagre with the statement that there will be fewer car in next twenti year . there will be more popul than today and there will be mani barrier to use those technolog actual . to begin with , grow the number of popul will make the world more complic and complex and each person will have own car . compar with the past , it is true that we have a lot more car nowaday than the past . for exampl , in seoul , korea , three of ten had a own car even ten yea ago . how about now ? the percentag of posses is almost same with the past . howev , the number of car is five time more than 1990 ' . in addit , twenti year are not enough time to develop some new technolog and actuallli use it . the govern have tri to make new subway system and monorail system within ten year , but the thing wa alreadi twenti year ago . there is no ani chang and they have still been plan . for exampl , one of the expert from the govern said last week , they were plan to adapt new system for aircraft within five year . the essay for the next day , howev , critic that the govern should finish the airforce-militari system chang plan which had not been finish for age . also , it said , `` no more peopl in thi countri believ the govern ! '' in conclus , we all hope that a fewer car is in the world in the futur . it should be replac by the great public transport , such as subway and buse . also , govern should make the cost of flight much cheaper than now . howev , i do not agre with that there will be a fewer car in use than now in the next twenti year with all these reason .
