in order to give a complet respons , could be use to distinguish between two categori of teach : train and format . we can call train everi kind of teach that want to make you learn how to do someth . good exampl of train could be the drive school . the format is use to provid to the student gener idea , that can influenc their way of thine and approach to a problem . of cous exapl of format are in the school and in univers . accord to thi distinct i think that for a student that is do a train , is more use to learn fact , mean with fact previou experi made by someonels or a specif way to do someth . for the student that go in a school or in an univers , is more import to understand idea , that are the basi of a coher way of think . the differ import that i give to the idea and to the fact , in the two differ kind of learn is strongli connect to the target of the learn . infact if we , for exampl , want to learn how to drive a car or a truck , and the get of the target is obviusli shown by the the grade of abil that we get in drive , the experi of someon or a specif seri of action is more use than an abstract concept . of cours the opposit appen with a subject in tha school or in the univers . final i could say that becaus of there are a lot of target in what we want to teach , is not correct to speak about one best way to teach , and what are the main concept that we have to learn , but we have to fit our person interest to what we need from a class or a seminari .
