i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i think most of the advertis are to trick peopl . first of all , advertis are made to appeal their product to peopl . when the compani make advertis , it must appeal what is so good about their product and attract peopl to buy it . so they emphas , sometim exager , good part of the product so that peopl will know what is cool about the product . of cours , they do n't highlight ani bad part of the product . as a result , when custom buy the product and find out that there are some bad part , which were never mention in the advertis . when thi happen peopl find that advertis made product seem much better than they realli are . for exampl , let 's say that there are two advertis about two eras . one say `` thi is the best eras ever invent . '' and the other one say `` thi eras is better than normal eras . '' i think most of the peopl will buy the eras that wa advertis as the best eras . probabl there is not much differ in those two . but it is better than buy `` littl abov averag '' eras . but in thi case , appar the advertis made the eras seem much better than they realli are . i bought a mechan pen , that wa advertis that they wo n't get my hand tire . but when i use the pen , i did n't feel ani differ from use the other pen . it made my hand tire . i did n't have a high-expect for the product , so i wa fine about it . but thi wa a good exampl of product be not what they were suppos to be accord to the advertis . even though that advertis do n't give veri accur idea of the product , peopl know that most advertis exager their product as a common sens . so i do n't think there is a major problem to overadvertis their product .
