in the next twenti yeara there will fewer car than at present . i dont agre with thi notionbecaus the demand and the import of the car is ever increas day by day . with the advanc in techonolog and the statist produc by the car manufactur are anyth to go by then in the next few year there will be a major incresas in the number of consum for car . i think that there could be a increas in the number of car use depend on the polici issu . i say so becau e with the ever increas develop in technolog there is reduct in price of the previou model and certain addit featur are be ad int he new car which would onli be a dream a few year earlier . moreov the notion of a car be a necess than a luxuri thing is chang as even member of not so affluent famili or well to do famili also own car . thi chang could be attribut due to variou factor such as easi payment option given by the car manufactur or the instal given by them . the other reason could also be that the willing of the bank author to give variou loan for the purchas of car or for the cgang to be made in car . anoth reason could be that the compani 's exchang offer which say that you can exchang your old car for a new one for an additiona payment which keep on increas the sale of the car . plu there are addit benefit of use a car which make it hard to resist object or abandon it . the benefit of the car are you can go with your famili whereev you want and at whatev time plu use in case of emerg . more than the benefit car are usual associ with social statu . that there is ever an increas for the demand for a new car with certain ad featur that it preced is not have . then there are car which hold special statu as be the royal car or have your own vintag collect . basic you can reach to differ destin accord to your own schedul at your own speed . now-a-day there is a whole lot of varieti be offer wherein special addit featur are buiklt in it like confer room set or bedroom set . with such offer it ha lot of benefit for the peopl who are realli busi and cant afford to wast time . well with so mani benefit it realli hard to think that there will be a declin in the number of car in the near futur . with the benefit there are also certain disadvantag like the ga emit from the exhaust of the car is pollut the environ and that the fuel use for the function of the car is deplet the natur resourc . well for the fact that car are increas the air pollut with the develop in technolog variou model are be develop which donot emit ani danger gase in the atmosphereand for the second disadvantag that they are use the energi resours new car are be develop and some have alreadi be develop which use solar energi as fuel or run on electr energi . thu with so mani advantag i think the demand for the increas in cara will outnumb it decreas or there wont be ani drastic chang in the numb rof car in the near futur . thu i think that in the near futur there will be an addit number of car than there are today .
