the question of whether it is more import for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact is one of the veri import issu which teacher , no matter the grade they teach is , should take into thier consider . person , i think that understand concept is a more fruit process than learn fact . the process of understand concept guarante the applic of understood concept and idea to vari life-circumst and situat . it also gurante a prolong usag of the learn concept contrari to learn fact which may just disappear from our memori . learn concept , in my point of view , make a fruit learnign process where learner can make use of the learnt concept to reach great number of fact . if i teach you the concept of how and whi peopl need to mix with each other and social , you can take out from thi concept differ fact about peopl , such as make friendship , get marri . .. etc . prolong usag of knowledg is attain more , in my opinion , through learn concept rather than fact . concept stick in our mind and do not vanish easili from our memori . so , if i teach a student a number of fact , i am sure that he/sh will forget some of them just as the class is over . howev , although teach concept take much more time than teach fact , thier avail in student ' mind last much longer . by the end , i strongli support the teach of concept rather than the teach of fact as teach concept , in my standpoint , have much more effect on student ' achiev and develop . teach concept and idea open the door foor student to think activ and respond genious to the event they encount in their life . if we are success enough in teach concept a more prosper futur is guarante for our syudent
