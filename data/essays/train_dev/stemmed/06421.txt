student usual have mani kind of differ caratherist . someon can memor a poetri in few minut and play it without fail a singl word , someon els can understand veri easili difficoult concept of math or phisic . i am one of the last cathegori and i think that understand an idea or a concept is more importatnt than learn fact . first of all , whenev i have learnt a fact without understand the logic mean of it , i have forgotten it after some week becaus memor detail is useless . i think student can rememb idea and concept longer then fact and , for thi reason , they can maintain inform even after long time and thi is the main porpous of shool educ . anoth import reason is that brain develop much more think about an idea or a concept than memor someth . in fact , tri to figur out a problem , collect thougth and make choic for reach the best solut is more stimoul for a student who learn to use hi or her brain . instead , learn just fact memor detail , brain work in other way , develop not the most import and useful part of it . thu , i support a teach method base on understand concept and idea , much more that a method base on memoraz inform and fact which i think they can not last long time .
