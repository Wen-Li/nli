for me the problem is not the titl of thi question but the problem is becaus in the futur there will be fewer car in use than there are today ? for me for answer at thi question we look at the past infact for a lot of year we produc pollut and now the enviro is destruct . the water is pollut , the wood are destroy , in the atmosfpher there are a lot of type of chemic element and there are n't a lot of ice on the mountain . the temperatur on earth is increas a veri spped and if we will to left on thi planet for a lot of year now we start to control and save the enviro for exampl make a lot of natur reserv on the land an under the see becaus if the healt of uor planet is n't good we will not life amoung on thi earth . for thi question now we think at the metod for save our futur life . for exampl when we watch tv or listen the radio or write at the pc we use the electryc current but for produc thi we fire the petroil or fire the ga or oil or we break the natur skylin of the mountain with electryc central . and when we actuat that procedi we produc pollut and we break the natur ecosystem and we increas the anidrid ccarbonica in the atmospher and the consequ is veri danger for our life and for anim life . for elimin thi problem we can produc current to anoth method for exampl with sun-panel or with system to convert strong of wind in current . that method are n't produc pollut and are n't destroy the enviro but they are more expens and in thi world for the politician the money are the first interest . i'wil not made in the futur and i do n't know if in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today but i know if we do n't today at the futur for our the futur will'not be good .
