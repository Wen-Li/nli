my instant reaction on read the statement wa to get defens and write about how there are sever shine exampl of youngster help their commun . howev , i wa forc to chang my mind as the more i ponder over statement , the more i realis that it is sad , but true . young peopl are often so caught up in their own live that it ha becom increasingli difficult to pull them away from their own agenda and tri and get them interest in activ which they do not consid ` fun ' or ` cool ' . thi can be cleari seen even by the amount of time that young peopl spend with their own famili . we find ourselv resort to use fast but imperson mode of commun like e-mail and instant messag even with our parent and sibl . the amount of human interact ha sure decreas . so where 's the question of help out one 's commun ? howev , i think that the main problem is that most young peopl do not realli know how to help their commun . they might also be hesit as they feel they have noth special which they can contribut to the commun . onc thi myth is dispel , i think that more youngster might find joy and pride in be part of someth bigger than themselv , their commun . young peopl , with their natur energi and enthusiasm can come up with bright and innov way of help their commun , thi can be done in simpl but use way , such as tutor some of the younger kid in the neighbourhood , or make a littl old ladi 's day by visit her in the old-ag home , or even go all out and organis an event for the whole commun to take part in . therefor , while i do agre with the statement , i also have faith in younger peopl that they can and they will put their i-pod down for a while , and devot enough time to help their commun . sinc no amount of compel or nag young peopl to help out will work , it would be more effect to teach by do . i feel thi can be achiev by get the whole commun involv in a project which everyon find interest and can take pride in .
