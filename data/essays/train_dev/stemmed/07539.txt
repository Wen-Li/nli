i have onc read a book talk about differ stress situat peopl would encount in their live and some solut to these tough problem . one of the unfavor issu highlight in the book is how to deal with a heavi traffic jam . undoubtedli , those traffic problem , no matter in which part of the world , ha been remain as a big headach for an extrem long period of time . it seem the govern have tri everi possibl way to figur it out . thu , here is our concern : are these polici and strategi be put into effect ? in other word , are we go to see fewer car on the road in , say , twenti year ? from my point of view , i assum the dream would becom true one day in futur , though , i 'm not good at forecast thing ahead . firstli , it is now strongli advoc by polici maker to take public transport system rather than drive privat car when travel outsid . as a matter of fact , thi plan is work well steadili . peopl gradual have notic that it is more conveni to take buse or subway to go to work and school than to drive privat car . take the subway as a strike exampl , if you take it to go to work dure the rush hour in the morn , you wo n't be face with traffic problem at all . you do n't have to wait in an endless line and see no hope of move your car , in thi sens , you can total guarante your arriv time at offic and have noth to worri about in term of be late . i believ there is nobodi who would like to be blame by hi boss everi day mere for not be on time . consequ , i found no reason for peopl to ignor the posit altern and still stick to hi tradit and impract way . in thi case , there will be fewer and fewer peopl who purchas car , or at least drive their car dure rush hour on weekday . furthermor , the price of gasolin is increas rapidli in recent time , which caus more and more peopl to complain that they bare could afford the cost . thu , in light of be more econom , the major of peopl would not inclin to buy more car .
