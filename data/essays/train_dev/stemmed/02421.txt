i agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well becaus when peopl just focus on what they have learn from school , and think it is right , they do not open their mind to new experi wich can not be good for the thing they are work on . for exampl , when it come to technolog , peopl must chang or improv the way of do thing realli fast , so there can be better develop ; without tri new stuff there would not be advanc . tri new thing is import for success becaus it improv the experi of the person in some fact . take risk is also import for success . for some peopl , take risk might be bad due to the possibl neg outcom their work can get , but take risk is the onli way peopl can livet new experi and improv in both work and person life . take risk is the onli way peopl can prove if what they are do is right or wrong , if it is right they can keep it , if it is wrong they learn from it and can improv it . when combin tri with risk , success is more like to happen , but befor realli do someth with thi two factor peopl should learn a bit a bout the situat they will work on , thi way they can plan better what they will do . a good exampl of success peopl are leader , they must alway hear and anal the idea of the peopl surround them . all those new idea becom thing to tri that might be posit and improv the work they are do . leader review the idea , pick one or combin them , and then tri it . also , when decid what to do , they must take risk so the they can realli achiev their goal . without risk they would not know what to do and just stick to the normal paramet that might not be good for their work . all the peopl should open their mind to the new stuff , tri differ idea and risk a lot to achiev their goal . stick to just one learn thing is not alway posit becaus not everyth work the same .
