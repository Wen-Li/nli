nowaday it is said that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . is it true or not ? to come up with that question we should make a comparison with the past and today . at the past befor the technolog improv there were lot of thing which a humanb wa not abl to do alon . for exampl think about not have ani washingmachin . when we think about the time that the femal humanb must be do all the housework . at these time famili are much more crowd and as a result peopl have to wash much more cloth . wash all the cloth by herself is not possibl for a women , all the other young peopl ha to help their mother to have clean cloth . but now almost all of us have washingmachin in our hous . when somebodi in the famili have dirti cloth he \ she do n't have to call anybodi . he \ she put cloth in the machin and in an hour they are clean and readi . year by year the popul of the world is increas . there not too much place to work and earn money . at the sum peopl prefer have small famili such as parent and one child to have good life condit accord to their money . at the old time peopl were usual make farm work . when you are a farmer the more peopl you have in your famili to help you , the more product you will have . becaus of that peopl use to prefer have crowd famili . and when a child ha brother and sister it ha to be social and help the other to have someth to eat , to earn money or to have cloth to wear . final by the improv of technolog , life is much more easier but technolog make youngster selfish . young peopl choos play comput game or surf on the internet inspit of help their mother in the kitchen and give enough time to help their commutini .
