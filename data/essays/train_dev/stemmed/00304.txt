everybodi could tell you thi : young peopl enjoy life wherea older peopl do n't . to me , it ca n't be absolut , for sever reason . first , we know that young peopl know how to have fun . they alway go out with friend , they alway laugh ( most of time for noth ) ... older peopl do n't know it . they use to know but now they are adult and adult have a lot of respons , adult alway think about their work , adult alway worri about everyth ,,, and when they are older , they worri about death and alway talk about when they were young , when they knew how to enjoy life ! we also could say that young peopl enjoy life becaus they do n't think about the futur , they seiz the day . . that 's true but older peopl , if they like to plan everyth can seiz the day too . do n't we say that the better time of your life is when you do n't work anymor ? what about these grandfath and these grandmoth who travel a lot and begin to live the life they want ? that 's whi i think middl age peopl are the one who enjoy life the least . they have too much thing not to forget , too much thing to do , too much thing to care about . . young peol enjoy life becaus they have noth to think about ! they go to school , go out with their friend , have complic relationship with their boyfriend and girlfriend and that 's all . . ok , they have to do some homework , but that 's not a horribl life . they enjoy life becaus their life is perfect ! to finish , i would say that although they have a perfect life most of young peopl do n't realli enjoy life . adolesc are alway in a bad mood , they complain everytim , they alway disagre with you , but what they do the best is `` to not care '' . but older peopl , even if they have a quit more difficult life , know the valu of life .
