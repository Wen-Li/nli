i do n't consid myself as a success person . howev my brother do rather well in a specif field that is gymnat . and i have notic that he ha recent start play tenni . so i have had the opportun to figur out that when peopl are fairli good at pratic an activ , they often tri to do differ thing . there are two main reason that support my viewpoint . one of the reason which support thi statement is that when one is success , he often want to explor other fiel to figur out what he is worth . take risk , have an other kind of experi prove to be benefici in that it enabl you to know what you can do , what your skill are . tri news thing is a kind of challeng to yourself . for instanc , i am quiet sure that my brother decid to start play tenni becaus it wa a way to push out hi limit . he probabl though that sinc he wa veri good at gym , what he wo n't be as good at play tenni ! howev , tri to make differ thing to those that you alreadi know how to do is not onli motiv by person reason . take risk is both a person and a public achiev . as a matter of fact , i imagin that success person are also tempt to impress peopl around them . friend , famili are conduc to improv their skill and to be even more talent . success person are probabl prone to increas the public recognit they alreadi have . tri new thing is one opportun to do that and to be even more acclaim .
