about fifti year ago , one the greatest presid of the unit state point out the main problem of modern societi . john f. kennedi said , do not ask what the countri can do for you , ask what you can do for the countri . we live in a societi that promot individu . individu can be defini as way of project problem onli through you own scope and to pay less attent at your environ . i think individu is more and more develop and peopl tend to give less time to their commun . thi subject is the great battl between the ancient and the modern . accord to the modern , peopl are more and more focus on their person environ , that is to say their famili , friend , work environ and themselv . in our modern societi , thi phenomenon reach young peopl even more that parent and grandpar . they use to be rais with a veri high sens of valu , focus on work and religion . even if each famili , accord to it histori , need , wealth , had it own prioriti , these were the main valu . and there wa a sens of commun work and commun need . young peopl who live in modern societi tend to be more focus on themselv and to be more selfish . in develop countri , they do not fear hunger , thirst , problem of wealth . i think that most of them are self center . we must believ that thi kind of attitud will chang and that young peopl with give more time to help their commun . on the one hand , there is alway the role of religion . they can be use to make peopl understand the import of give , share and receiv . on the other hand , we can hope that intellectu and politician will rais these question in the futur . not onli is the idea of help the commun relev , but it is also more and more import in a time of great incertainti .
