as far as my view is concern i am disagre with statement . as the old say goe `` jack of all trade is master of none '' , i believ on the follow proverb . what i feel is you should concentr on the one traget rather than tri your hand on too mani target without ponder on it prose and con . if you do so it would onli lend you in a big troubl in the long run , so it is better to play safe . my father alway taught me that if you would abl to concentr on your main aim , you would sure get success . for example-if we take the exampl of shoot ani target , if you concentr on that target while shoot then there would be higher chanc of accur shoot but if your concentr loos and it divert from the main target then that would have sure neg result . although , innov is main key to success but you can also tri your skill in the thing you alreadi know as that would be better ( in the sens of posit result ) and safe . if you are not expertis ani work then how would you get success to the fullest , it would be better to enjoy the posit result then a neg result . everi human be want to becom perfect at everi front of life-profession , social and educ , but he or she would be abl to do so by give hundr persent to each work . for exampl if a person who alreadi ha busi of hi own which is run well-off but that busi is older and he want to establish a new busi that is not familiar to him and which is the fastest and innov in the market , so the main essenc is that how could he establish that busi . in thi certain situat i would onli recommend him to rennov the establish busi . if we look at anoth exampl a student ha a interest in engin say electron and telecommun and at that time the field of medic ha immens opportun so he can not abl to adapt the medic field all he can do is just pursu the field which relat hi field with the medic take subject like medic imagindg system an
