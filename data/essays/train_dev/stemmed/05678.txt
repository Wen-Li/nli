i agre with the sentenc that most advertis and most neg spot make product seem much better than they realli are . thi is real for lot of reason . firstli , a compani which product a good or a servic want alway show the best in it busi expeci when it want to compet with anoth group wich sell to peopl the same articl . for thi reason they often tell peopl lie about their good through televis , citi poster or magazin and peopl trust it , but when someon buy their famou thing , is not realli how they describ to us ! for exampl , one day my mother had decid to buy an hair-phon which should resist to water and repar you from electr wave but when it fall in the ground with some water drop she broke it . she wa so scare ! secondli , for new object we have not the idea of the name of who product it . if i buy a valentino 's dress i think it would be better then an h & m 's one becaus the name is veri import and show you the past of a work group . the compani which obtain the fame with their good and their servic have a best expect in the consum and the satisfact of an expect creat fedelti in the buyer . in conclus , i think advertis are often a lie or an enlarg of the real use of an object but i think also that someon with their work have increas their fame in peopl in a good way .
