thi statement is quit extrem . of cours there 's peopl meant to be inventor like edison or da vinci . but those great person were live in anoth time . the last centuri have wit a larg part of the most brilliant invent that can be made . now we 're live in a reproduct era . as we can creat we upgrad thing from the past centuri in order to give them an other util or aspect . make it thinner , stronger , more attract or afford but not revolutionnari . for instanc , cinema wa n't invent by one person . it wa a hundr year of effort which gave it it actual shape , which , i think , is far from be the final one . in it first year peopl find it absurd and reserv to sideshow but dare director made it a real art . from da vinci 's '' camera oscura '' to lumier 's cinematograph there 's a whole world of experiment . we need thi kind of dare person . how can we know that an object have reach it final shape ? how can we put frontier to creation ? thirti year ago , it seem unbeliev to imagin have a phone call outsid . now it 's essenti , peopl ca n't live without cell phone . that 's the evolut process of creation which is a perman process . it 's not given to anyon to succeed in make new thing . it requir courag but also lot of imagin and self-confid . it 's a huge work on yourself and who you ( think you ) are . invent reliabl thing occur onc in a lifetim but upgrad is possibl . we need both kind of peopl to go on evolv . some are meant to invent , so to upgrad of transform but both are import for our mankind . men ca n't live without creat of he 's give up the greatest qualiti he had been given , the qualiti of dream of someth els and make thi dream come true .
