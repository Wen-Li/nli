the young peopl of today are veri commonli reffer to as the leader and the great mind of tomorrow , yet we find ourselv ask wether the youth help it commun . my responc to thi would be that the young peopl are just as conciou as the elder and they fell just as respons for the welfar of the commun . to ensur that the young adult feel respons toward their commun , they are inculc with these valu as children by make the children feel more respons toward their sround world . thi is done by incorpor a commun servic section into their school curriculim and allow the children to discov the satisfact of share . these young influenc are carri along with the youth and as they grow , so doe their sens of respons to societi . then these young peopl do infact spend time from their busi schedul to serv the commun . nowaday we continu see student-run organ and event that are held for the benifit of the commun and also function as awar program to show the adult of the commun what the problem within their own sorround are . the profit from these type of fund are then put into good use to benifit societi . one such exampl in my life that we , as the student of my school achiev for the intern organ , the red cross wa that we had a fund rais event that wa in the form of a parti to the young childr . we had ortganz game and other such event that fascin the kid and earn us enough money to make a consider donat to the foundat for earthquak relief in gujrat , india . i would like to draw attent to the fact that the young peopl of today are just as concern for the precciou comun that we live in as are the adult . after all , what is the point of be a leader tommorrow if we can not preserv our commun and hertag today ?
