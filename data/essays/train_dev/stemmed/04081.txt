the best way of travel with a group of peopl is veri funni and i realli enjoy that trip . actual we do n't know the place we are go to visit at that time we realli need a person who guid us . but we are go in a group at that time we do n't want a guid . in our group some peopl knew about the place , and someon in the group have some inform about the place then no need to worri . for exampl , i went to hawaii with my friend , in my friend group one girl alreadi visit the hawaii and she knew the place which is more beauti and which place we can realli enjoy and she also know some restur . at that time we went to hawaii and we realli enjoy the trip . we do n't need ani guid . if iam go alon at that time i realli do n't know the place then i need a guid . if i can not take a guid then i wo n't enjoy the trip . but in my opinon i enjoy the trip when i went with my friend in group . group trip with friend is realli enjoyableand i could still rememb those trip . for exampl my home twon is in india , one time i went to agra to see the tajmah . that is realli a beauti place i do n't know anybodi in that place at that time i paid to a person who is guid me . and that person is veri nice he show me all the place around the tajmah and he is also state tell stori about the tajmah and i like that inform he gave me . that is also a nice thing about a guid . that time i did not realiz that i came alon . either of the way we go with friend or we go alon what is most import is we realli enjoy or not .
