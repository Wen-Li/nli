the mass product of car start in the past centuri and ha n't stop ever sinc , caus a great deal of problem in term of environment and social issu . these problem were almost immedi discuss sinc the earli time of the car industri adfirm . the fordian assembl line model ha been depict by charli chaplin in hi notori movi `` modern time '' , and mani american pop artist start give a represent of the american love for car , thing that ha been determin mainli by a social transform occur sinc the fifti : middl class peopl start move to the suburb and need a car to be connect to the citi , where their job were usual locat , and often also their kid ' school as well . nowaday thi kind of sociolog and geograph transform may be wit in mani differ part of the world . urban sprawl and the presenc of strip mall are common in mani part of itali , germani , franc and mani other european and asian countri as well as in the unit state . at the same time civic author are not alway abl to address transport problem , with the result that most of the peopl in rich and develop countri end up consid their car the princip and favourit of all mean of transport . in big citi and suburb the top user of public transport are alway recent immigr that do n't own a car yet , and young student . if there 's someth that would be abl to invert thi trend and motiv more peopl to use their car less , that is the fuel cost that 's get higher and higher everi year . but in my opinion even thi would rather lead to a transform in the kind of fuel use in the futur , hope sustain and recycl , than to a reduct of car user in the world .
