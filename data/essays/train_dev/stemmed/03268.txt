in my point of view , i disagre the follow statement for sever good reason . befor mention my reason for disagr thi statement , let us think about what the world would be like in 20 year time . would you think that the world 's popul would increas or decreas ? the answer of thi question would make the differ of the number of car in the next 20 year from today . first of all , i would like to answer my own question , and i actual think that inde the popul all around the world would increas . for a start , let us discuss thi relat to my place of living/countri . if the number of peopl increas , then the number of peopl who need live would increas , therefor the number of peopl who need money will increas and nearli everybodi need transport . either to work , home , offic or ani other place around the countri . so that would increas the number of car need for transport . secondli , these day the technolog is get better and better . nearli everi month a new car is gettig publish or produc in market . which mean mani peopl would like to get a new 2006 car , but actual mayb 50 % of the car 's product get sold , im not tri to be accur with my number but im just give an exampl . last but not least , the car compani these day are everywher , i mean exactli everywher . where ever you go there are these adverstis about thi new 2006 car , or your citi bank give you discount if you want to get thi type of car . so mani factor may help you in get a new car . lastli , i would like to say that whi could n't we combin technolog with saftey togeth ? i mean larg number of car mean high pollut , which mean environment damag , so i wish that one day i could use a car that work on h2o ( water ) instead of petrol !
