i agre with the statement that say : `` succesful peapl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' for more differ thing : at first , if you do n't tri to do someth differ from what you alreadi know how to do you are not abl to chang you 're condit of life . for exempl , if the men never tri do somethin new or better than befor , the civilit never go on or chang . we ca n't imag how could be our life if peapl like leonardo da vinci , volta , newton , einstain and a lot of other peapl like them never tri to find someth differt from what they alreadi knew . all the scientif resourc are base on thi way of think , tri to find someth better from what still exist . for exempl we need to find new medicin for make the life better . in 2020 we hope that the expect of life becom higher , and it will be onli for medicin and doctor who are search new medicin . also in the person financi mean take risk is veri import , becaus if you do what you alreadi know how to do , probabl like other peapl , you can earn enouth money for live , but you will never be rich . for exempl , if bill gate never tri find a new way for use the comput , now he could n't be who he is , and also all the peapl who use the comput have to say thank to him . anoth import point is that a men , for live an happi life , have to chang someth sometim , if he doe n't do that , hi life will be so bore . i
