it is better to special in one specif subject . i have a some rason for my opinion . first , to specializd in one specif subject is veri useful to get a job . for exampl , when you want to be a carpent , if you learn about carpent specifficali , you can be a carpent easier than you learn broad knowledg , becaus you learn deepli about carpent , and also corpent doe not need too much broad knowledg . second , to have broad knowledg let you take more time to learn than to special in one specif subject . so it is veri seriou problem for peopl , becaus thier graduat will be late , and time to get a job becom more late . third , to special in one specif subject save cost to learn . for exampl , if you have broad knowledg , you have to take much money for mani textbook to lean all of them . in contrast , if you want to special in one subject , you can get few textbook about just the subject . so you do not have to much money to get staff for learn . in conclus , it is good to special in one specif subject becaus of get job and save time and cost . it is vey import reason .
