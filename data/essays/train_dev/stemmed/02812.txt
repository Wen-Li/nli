is it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , or to have a more specif subject special ? first , i think that thi question is quit difficult . in fact , in franc we use to have plenti of differ cours , therefor as we come at the age of about twenti , it appear to be a good thing . that is to say , i got a basic knowledg on a lot of differ thing , and i am capabl to understand basic problem or discus , for instanc on radio . and i feel glad of it . but , of cours , a broad knowledg ha also got drawback . actual when i wa a child , i thought it wa a wast of time learn how human be descov fire , how dna function . it is hard to interest somebodi in a subject that is not it cup of tea . therea a specif learn can realli be a good way of catch attent . thu student , that just focus on a specif problem , are realli awar of it , and when time come for them to work , they are effici . i think that a reason of the american power , and the fact that often american search reciev the nobel price . howev , i believ that a good balanc between a specif topic and a broad cultur is the best . in franc we generali agre that american do not even know where europ stand . i think it certainli is a prejudic , but it reviel may be that we can not just consid a singl subject whitout consider the world in which we all are . to conclud , i would say that a balanc polici in teach is almost imposs to find , but i do trust that both a broad view of the world suround us and a specif cultur are a wounder utopia .
