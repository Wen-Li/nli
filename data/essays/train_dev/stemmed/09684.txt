on my own opinion , i do agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what thay alreadi know how to do well . first , i think they can success is becaus they have alreadi take their risk , it is all risk out side the world , each thing ha a risk but seem to big or small . for exampl , if you walk on the street you have to take a risk that there will be a accid on you . take risk is a must . the mean of success is they know how to do thing well , human be ha a think to learn more to find out new thing . of cours , by the way peopl is learn they will have mani problem to solv . success peopl know that if they do n't find a new way or new thing to do , other peopl can catch up them . they want to lead , so they have to seek , to seek what that the world need so they can do it . although mani peopl think success peopl are selfish , just do thing they like or they want , wo n't share with other , but i think it is onli other peopl do n't understand what they are think . they have a differ thought than other so they success , they wo n't just stop where they success . they want more success , everyon want more success but not everyon can do it , so they know they can do it they wo n't care about the risk , even the risk is big but if they can pass it they success . they fail , they keep on go to find anoth thing . for conclus , i agre that success peopl tyr new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
