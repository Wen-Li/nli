it is a controvers problem about whether peopl should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or not . differnet peopl may make differ disscion acrod to their backgroud . some friend of mine think that it is better for them to special in one specif subject such as math or music . but acrod to my own person and backgroud , i can not agre with them . i think man should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . reason and evid are list as follow . the world now , unlik 100 year befor , need man who onli know one subject . it need peopl can have a broad knowledg . for exampl , the engin now ont onli need to know about engin , but also need to have the abliti to use comput . becaus most of their work are complet on the comput . so if he is onli a specialist about engin , he will not finish hi work prefectli . forthemor , have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is to make the student get use to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choos for the futur . it is hard to say that a student major engin will becom an engin after hi graduat . it is common to see student in colleg chang their major . but a man onli good at one subjuect will not have the free to do so . as the most morden build are the mixtur of music and paint . a specialist is the man who soecial in more than one subject . the famou english detect in the noverl are good at detect and music . such exampl can be seen dure everi day life . a man should have a wide knowledg of mani subject becaus the world need him to do so . though some peopl may think that too much interest will make the man good at noth . but i think a capabl man can benifit from hi wide interest , for hi interest will final help hi to do achiev in hi major
