some peopl think hat in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , while other do n't have thi point of view , and i agre with the latter for three reason : varieti of function of the car , difficulti to reach a lot of place , and amus of drive . first of all peopl use car for a lot of purpos : for exampl the drive their own car to go to work , to reach big store , to meet friend , and to enjoy theirselv . as a result they need a trasport servic and in my opinion they prefer a car becaus it is more confort than bu and train . in fact peopl do n't like to stay veri close to other , like they have to do in a bu or a plane ; on the other hand they feel more comfort insid their car , where they can stay alon or with few other person . next , there are a lot of place that can be reach onli by car , for instanc big store that are veri far from citi . also supermarket , sport and medic center , theatr and shop can be veri far . therefor , it is necessari to own or rent a car in order to go these place . final peopl usual think that drive a car is veri funni : for examl there are a lot of peopl who drive not onli in order to reach a specif place , but also to enjoy theirselv . they think that drive a car is pleasant and they can have relax when they are go by car . in addit they are veri interest in car brand , like bmw and merced , and thi prove thay the statement is no toru
