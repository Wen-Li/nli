i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the reason that i agre with it are that they can chang the color of product to look better and they hide the bad point of their product . first , when the compani advertis their product , they alway monitor and edit the advertis to make them nice . they also design the advertis so that the product color and shape look better . howev , if we see the good in store without fanci effect , they are less attract than in advertis . for exampl , in i-pod advertis , they use fanci color to make it cool , but it is just comput graphic . second , the compani know that what are the bad point of their product , so they hide it . in televis , we ca n't figur out if they do n't show to us . we can do to the store and figur out that what is error of the product but still we can miss it . for exampl , some food restaur put some chemic materi , but they do n't tell the peopl that they put bad portion in food . they alway say these are chuici and juci , not fatti or harm . thu , mani compani make their good look great to make money . they want to hire the person like as advertis design in order to make their product fanci . they also want creativ person to creat new strateg of their busi . we know that they want to make money , so we must think and choos care when we buy our product .
