it is thought that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agre with thi idea . despiteif student studi hard , they can not memor a long time ; if student learn just fact , they will not memor what they learn . when a student read a book about their studi , if the student just read all text with out understand , the student can not explain how wa the book is . if a student have excel memor abil , a student can rememb everyth without understand ; not onli is it hard for student to have , but also everi peopl can not do . to understand idea and concept are provid student with an opportun to use inform atpproci that they lene in studi . onli student learn fact , they can use inform . but without understand ha limit to use . student learn more easili if they undertand idea and conceot then if they learn onli fact . when a student learn a vocabulari , a which way is more easi to use and memor ?
