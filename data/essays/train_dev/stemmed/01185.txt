some peopl think that yonug peopl can act more than older peopl , and yong peopl can spent more enjoy time than older peopl . for the follow reason , howev , i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . first , older peopl have more free time . for exampl , older peopl can retir hi job when the peopl got enough money to spent their least life . mani older peopl can spent both money and time for what they want to do . some older peopl can travel all over the world . some peopl can gather antiqu jew all over the world . some peopl spend hi life treat their gearden . by contrast , young peopl have to go school . yong peopl do not have enough time and money to do all what they want . second , older peopl have a great deal of knowledg and experi to spent time . for exampl , older peopl can enjoy even in five minut , if they know writ poem . when the older peopl doe not know about write poem , they would hit on other idea , ssuch as read book , talk with other , and think about their offspr ' futur . they know variou choic , becaus they have experienc variou past time in their own past . but , young peopl doe n't . thi is adventag for older peopl . so , i strongli disagre that older peopl enjoy their life less than young peopl .
