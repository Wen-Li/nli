nowaday a lot of peopl like to take rik and test their own limit . everybod tri to hone their abil . some argu that thi way of life is just limit to success peopl , becaus they achiev nearli everyth els . on the one hand , the success peopl explor new thing and have less concern about risk . but on the other hand , i think , that these featur are not just trait of success peopl , rather a typic human behavior like eat . the need for certain risk , new expieri and to be good at someth is part of everyon way of life . first , risk is often connect to the hormon adrenalin . if a person is in a danger situat hi or her adrenalin level increas . thi is often assici with a drug or the feel to be aliv . success peopl may have a greater need , becaus of their prior accomplish , but thi feel and the hormon is common to everi human be . second , the desir to tri out new thing and gain new expieri is common to everyon . for exampl , young children explor their surround and they find mostli great joy in it . thi behaviour ha obvious noth to do with success . third , we live in a highli special world and nobodi is abl to be good at everyth . success peopl , to my mind , have special in one trait to be success . to learn anoth skill may lessen their abil to be good at their prime skill or at work . i studi electr engin and i have to special to reciev an adequ educ . without the proper educ i will not be abl to find a job and becaus of thi i will not be success . in conclus , you can say that there may be a stronger appeal for success peopl to experi with new thing , but the main idea are mere human . the success will not experi extens , becaus they will use the etch that made them success .
