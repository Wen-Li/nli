young peopl clearli do not help their commun as much as they onc did . but their chang is mostli due to the chang of the whole world and the societi we live in . the last centuri ha seen mani technolog revolut such as televis and comput and a consequ chang wa more than expect . now that studi are get so long for young the free time they could potenti spend for their commun ha been drastic reduc . big citi that have been grow all over the world late have also somehow reduc young activ in a comun so big that sometim does't make them feel at home . now that the world is access to anyon and the young travel everywher they loos the sens of home that someon that ha alway live in onli one villag could feel . that 's whi who live in small citi know everyon insid them and stay there for their whole life ha a much bigger sens of belong at hi town and is much more keen to help out anyon . but that is not the onli reason . someth that play a major part is the educ peopl get from school and most of all from their famili . the new famili model in the occident world complit degrad . almost half of the over 30 year old peopl ha been divorc at least onc . their support to the children can onli be drastic wors than it onc wa . peopl who grow in a solid famili close to their brother , their parent but also to their grand-par and their old tradit valu will without ani doubt stay closer to their commun . i 've person got a lot of doubt about how thi new condit can improv . i think a moral chang is almost imposs and peopl will have to adapt . and yet famili more reason are probabl the clue to make a differ .
