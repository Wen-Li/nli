in my opinion , i agre with that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact sinc it offer lot of advantag to student . among diver reason i support thi opinion , there are two reason in that . first , throught understand idea , student may becom more logic than befor . for exampl , when i wa a high school student , i would attend the experi of sienc class in laboratori . it make me solv the teacher 's prompt which make me get a complic theori in the scienc . in addit , the cours of experi in the scienc class help me learn about new harm phenomenon such as global warm , soil eros , and so on which make me more sophist understand the phenomenon . there for , i agre with that student must focu on understand than learn fact sinc they would be logic . secondli , as student under stand idea , they can becom a specialist in the specif scholarship which make all around the world thrive than befor . for exampl , when i wa a middl school student , i would like to studi geographi sinc it provid exot amus and happi . back then , particularli , my geographi teacher had a special characterist which expalin to understand idea until a number of student perfectli grap the content of geographi . as a result , i could be a specialist in the geographi and at the same time i had a major geographi in the univers . therefor , i prefer to understand idea than to concept . as it is discuss abov , i 'd like to understand idea than to concept sinc it provid lot of benefit to studen
