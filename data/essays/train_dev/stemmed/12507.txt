it would be beauti to believ that twenti year from now fewer car would be circul on our street ; but the sad truth seem to be that , in that period of time , mani more vehicl will fill our street and contribut to pollut our world . on one hand , it is true that technolog is rapidli evolv and that what today is `` brand new '' , tomorrow will be complet obsolet . the perfect exampl of thi is comput . pc becom obsolet almost as soon as they are finish . the same thing appli to car . it could be that the great love that mani have for car today , die tomorrow due to a guilti conscienc or environment awar . peopl could start use other mean of transport that pollut less . or the automot industri could creat a new way of collect transport that would lead to less car on the street . on the other hand , it is difficult , in a such global environ , to believ that the main mean of transport : the car , will , in such littl time as twenti year , be less use . the fact of the matter is that car are all around the world . everybodi need one to go everywher . even young adult tri to prove who they realli are to other thank to the car they own . in new york , for exampl , not everybodi own a car , but taxi are avail for those who need them which is , basic , the same thing . how doe someon from a small town go to work in a big citi ? by car , even when there are buse or train avail . one could walk or go by bicycl to mani place in hi or her town : grocceri store , post offic , etc. , but mani still prefer drive . we have to face the truth . i disagre complet with the statement becaus i do not believ that our world is move in that direct . we are still not awar of the great stress car are caus on the environ and i do not think that we will be in twenti year . it is not that i am not hope , i am , and i realli hope that i am wrong in not believ in human , it is just that i look out into our live and i see what is there , not what i wish to see .
