some peopl think that cours taught in univers are too theoret and should be more base on fact instead of gener idea and concept . i strongri disage with thi opinion for sever reason . the first reason whi i think that idea and concept are more import for student than simpli learn fact is that you can alway learn fact by yourself . actual , you do n't even need to be a student in a classroom to learn them . inde , most fact are just data that can be memor with no or littl understand . but what realli matter is the the underli caus of a fact , even if it is veri gener . for exampl , a fact in financ is : `` you should diversifi your portfolio in order to lower your risk '' . but what is realli import behind thi fact is to understand how the risk can be evalu , and what are the main factor that make diversif an effici invest strategi . if you do n't understand the concept , you might still be abl to learn the fact , but it alway will be a limit basic understand . secondli , idea and concept will eventu help you to understand the fact and therefor are more import . for exampl , you may be abl to memor the list of all the presid of the unit state , but is n't the idea of creat a democraci in america more import than a list of name ? student do n't have to becom factbook or encyclopedia but should be abl to understand the fact base on the concept and idea that they have understood in class . it is a deeper knowledg and probabl more gener but it is also a key to deal with new situat . in conclus , the role of a univers is to make student becom respons person abl to think by themselv and to give them key to better learn and understand fact : idea and concept .
