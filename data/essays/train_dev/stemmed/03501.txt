i agre with the statement i think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than today becaus the scientist will discov or project new kind of tranport way and all the countri will improv the public transport to defend the environ against the increas level of pollut . have you ever seen a cartoon call `` futurama '' ? it show the potenti kind of life of the fourti centuri . it show a big half pipe that look like a big slide with some pillow at the end and it should repres an altern kind of tranport that avoid the graviti forc . moreov , today a lot of scientist and expert are woork to creat more ecolog and confort bu and subway , and a lot of countri and citi are work to get peopl most familiar with public transport or with new kind of transport . so , if the public tranport will be the futur , there will be fewer car in use and also if some lover of them will remain , the averag number of car will decreas in a remark way . if it will happen , there will be a lot of improv in natur condit of the heart and our life could becom better . the decreas of car s number impli better condit , less pollut in the air and less danger street , and the park place could becom green area . i reckon that a lot of peopl would be happi if the number of car decreas . in fact a lot of peopl hate the traffic jam and the crowd street but they have not anoth possibl to travel or to go to work . as i said , a lot of countri are work and a lot of step have been done but in my opinion there are still certain aspect that should be improv . in our countri , for exampl , also if the polit class promot the use of railway , a lot of peopl do not follow thi suggest becaus the train are alway dirti , crowd and they smell not veri good , moreov they era alway late . so , i think that to have a look at the futur is a good idea but there are also a lot of thing that can be done dure the present .
