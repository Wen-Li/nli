nowaday , there are some kind of way to learn someth which have never taken befor in person . i disagre with the statement which is more effect to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . peopl should face to the fact what would have more import thing . first of all , it is no doubt about that fact are compos by real thing . most of them have record or certif in sever way , write , take photo , paint , or exist substanc itself like a fossil . there are obviou no assumpt and person opinion in the fact . besid , fact would not chang the their form becaus they can not be made by human thought . for exampl , earth is exist on solar system , it is fact . but some peopl had idea earth is just exist own , no system , in ancient world . second , idea and concept are base on fact . if there are no fact , idea and concept can not be born . peopl tend to add to some thought in their own way on the fundament , fact . in the other word , fact bring the human thought , idea and concept . in conclus , fact have some more advantag for the studi than idea and concept that i have shown the abov . there is no possibl the existens idea and concept without fact .
