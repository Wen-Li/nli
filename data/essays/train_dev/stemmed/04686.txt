while it might seem like , have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than special in one specif subject , i , for myself , would choos the latter . on first glanc , have idea about lot of area seem like a good thing . you can talk about everyth and you can reflect your opinion about everyth . howev , you do n't realli know ani of the area you talk about . the knowledg on all these area would be limit and do n't reflect what that acedem subject is all about . as an industri engin i can give that as an exampl . when we graduat from colleg , we all have the basic idea about suppli chain , inventori manag , product plan , qualiti manag , schedul etc . howev , dure our graduat work , we end up choos one of the sub-top that industri engin work on . while a student work on schedul may still know all other sub-divis , he ha the most knowledg about hi own topic thu he can talk the most certainli about hi own topic as well . consid that we expect peopl to take certain respons in daili social life , and expect that to carri out these activti to masterhood , i would think the same is true for academ life as well . sinc do n't expect a butcher to do garden , and a dentist to be an engin , we should n't expect , say an industri engin , to be compet in both suppli chain area and in qualiti manag . a dentist is good at what he is do beacus he spent hi time on master that , while an engin spent hi time on engin subject and so is good at that . follow with the same line of reason , an industri engin work on suppli chain spent hi time read articl about that particular topic , write hi thesi on that particular topic and neglect the other part of the disciplin . time constaraint and social constraint limit one 's opportun to know everyth about anyth . peopl know a broad rang of academ subject tend to look and know the superfici stuff about them , while other focus on a certain topic , by limit their concentr , know that particular subject in depth and so are more valuabl to the develop of the particular subject .
