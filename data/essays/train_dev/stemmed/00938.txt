the concept is the base of life . inde , our world and our way of think are built on idea or concept . we often associ school as a place where pupil have to learn fact by heart . but where should we place the limit between a wisdom acquierd by learn the fact and a knowledg base on concept ? a histori class would be the best exampl to answer thi question . inde , while pupil are studi a certain period of histori , the most import for them is to understand the way of think of the peopl live at that time , their idea , the circumpst , what happen befor , the consequ i.e. , the whole context . howev , i think that it is also veri import for them to be abl to structur everi thing . therefor student should have to learn precis date and event in order to illustr by concreat exampl their idea . the concept is the first thing that we should learn , becaus it is what we keep in mind after a lesson . but if thi concept is not associ to a date or illustr by a fact , the concept doe not worth anyth anylong . on top of that , how could we explain a concept without give ani exampl ? it 's just imposs . phylosophi , which is the scienc of concept is base on exampl and thu on fact . thi lead me to say that it is realli import for a student to have a good memori and that is whi children have to learn poem by heart . as far as i am concern , idea and fact are deepli link . we could even go further by say that veri often we start by learn the fact and then we understand the idea which is behind thi fact . in mathemat for exampl we learn the formul of the sinu and the cosinu befor even know what they repres . it follow then that even if idea are more import when we take a step back , we do not understand them right away without ani fact or date . to sum up i would say that after have learnt and understood someth , the idea is more import , but while lear thi particular thing , we can not separ the idea and the fact .
