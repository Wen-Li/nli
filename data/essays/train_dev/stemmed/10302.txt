as far as concern , i disagre that in twenti year there will be fewer car than today . mayb it could happen in far futur but in twenti year there will be more car that are more develop . there are sever reason of my thought . first of all , car are comfort and fast tranform . it enabl you to get ani place that ha ground . when i wa a high-school student i often late in class becaus there were lot of homework to do and the class start earli in the morn . so my mother gave me ride to school so that i would not late in class . next , car are use to move havey thing better than a person . my parent did not have a car just after our famili move to us from south korea . we had to go shoop to buy some food and furnitur and other thing . we had so mani thing to buy but we did n't have ani transporm to get to the mall and bring those all stuff . there wa no other transporm except individu car to get to the store . so we had to borrow a car from the next door that we never met . it wa realli a embarass experi . in my oppinion , there will be car just as it is today .
