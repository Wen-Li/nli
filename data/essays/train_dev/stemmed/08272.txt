i strongli agre that advertis make product seem better . one should not be supris by that becaus that is the goal of advertis . in short , adverstis want the consum to buy the product whether or not he ha a health benefit . what alway come to mind is the advertis for cigarett . in much of these adverstis , you see either a beauti woman or hansom man and immedi you want identifi with them . therefor you want to imit their act , i.e. smoke . the other point about cigarett advertis is the `` element of freedom '' . most adverstis show vast piec of land or sea to suggest somekind of escap or adventur but it actual an illus . the other type of advertis that i would like to talk about is children snack . on televis the snack look veri delici and appet but in fact they have no nutriti valu . advertis use bright color , with catchi rythm to entic children to buy their product . when you look at the nutrit valu of the product , you realis that it 's full of satur fat or even tran fat . kid love it becaus it tast good . some parent may like it becaus it 's conveni to prepar it . the last point that i would like to make is commerci for car . everyday that you turn the televis on , there is a new advertis about a new car or the new model of an old car . you are constanli remind to chang you car even if you do n't have too . what most peopl seem to ignor is that car run on gasolin and we all know that car are the biggest emitt of carbon dioxid ( co2 ) . most car compani advertis will not promot the use of public transport to cut the emiss of carbon dioxid in order to save mother natur .
