`` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . '' i disagre with thi statement becasu thi is a statist base statement . thi is just a gener idea that somebodi ha put forth which doe not necessarili need to be true . my opinion is that peopl can be sucess onli when they work hard and do what they are good at . peopl who know their work are better abl to succeed that the peopl who do not know the materi . peopl who have a univers or colleg degre on a particular area of expertis have a better chanc to succeed in life than the peopl who have not obtain that certain degre . of cours , there will be few peopl who want to tri the materi , but becasu they are just tri new thing doe not mean that they will becom better than the peopl who alreadi know the materi . take risk and tri new thing doe not mean that they are go to turn out better than what you are alreadi do . suppos there is an art major who want to `` tri new thing '' in buis . due to the fact that she is an art major , he or she would have to start from the bottom and work their way up . it would be harder for them to cope in the buis career . they may be abl to succeed , but they will not be abl to give their maximum potenti . they would give their maximum potenti in art . therefor , the person would have a greater chanc of have a career in art rather than buis . you can tri new thing and if you are abl to cope up with the work load and if you are abl to understand the materi , you may becom success . the chanc are , howev , that you would be abl to succeed in what you do best . tri new thing is not a bad idea , but it would not take place of what you origin do best .
