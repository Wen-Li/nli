the way , professor should teach student ha alway been a heat debat . the question of the best academ system is not solv yet , and mani scholar continu to propos altern way to teach . if we take a close look at the way educ is organis in franc , in germani or in the unit state , we immedi realis that mani differ approach are possibl . how the professor should act in front of hi student is not an easi question to answer . to claim whether a solut is better than anoth may seem , i acknowledg , a bit pretenti . but i am deepli convinc that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . learn fact and figur are , in my opinion , the worst thing you can do in a univers what we are ask to a student nowaday , is to understand and to analys immedi the situat he/sh face . thi is what we call , the abil to react in front of an unexpect situat . thi skill doe not appear alon ; it must be work and practis . the student must be abl to think on hi proper way , but he ha also have to master some import theori which are the basi of our common and recognis societi . for exampl , you can not speak about the evolut of the speci without refer to darwin . but , onc thi gener basi of common knowledg is acquir , then the student is perfectli abl to evolv by himself . our societi should not be made of peopl onli good at repeat what they have heard , but of peopl who are creativ , imagin , origin . the possibl offer by an univers to learn and discov a whole rang of new knowledg , is certainli one of the most import thing ever . it would be a shame to spoil thi uniqu opportun by be occupi with the learn of figur that would be forgotten almost immedi . anyway , recent , the prioriti ha been given to the free will of the student . the curios and the knowledg of everi student must be aim at the improv of our societi . understand idea and concept may be compar to the key which lead to the achiev of such a goal .
