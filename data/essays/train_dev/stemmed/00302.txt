all over the world , the import of the advertis to convey the inform about product is not neglig . the reason for thi import is stem from the fact that the advertisemetn givc the detail inform about the product of some compani . howev , there is a discuss about whether these argument make these product seem much better than they realli are or peopl can trust in these advertis about the inform about the product . in my opinion , most advertis demonstr the product not as they realli are becaus of the some reason such as econom , social and polit reason . one of the crucial reason in the unreli of most advertis in convey inform about the product is caus by the econom aspect . for instanc , if there is a compani who need money and support to develop themselv , to trade with anoth compani in order to improv their skill in their own sector , they may show their own product much better than they realli are . in addit to privat compani , the public compani may desir to benefit from the peopl 's interest in their advertis product to make money from their sell to increas their prestig in a govern . consequ , the econom purpos of the produc of the advertis about their product may result in illustr these product much more better than they realli are . anoth signific reason in agre with the idea of not trust most advertis in repres the product can be prove by social reason . the reason for thi that gener peopl alway believ in advertis and they do not tri to know more about the advertis product in order to collect more detail daat about them , becaus thi kind of peopl choos the easiest way to get inform about new method , new innov and they tri these product without ani advic from profession peopl . therefor , the exist of lazi in social life in do research in order to learn more inform about product is a factor in the creation of unreli advertis . in addit to econom and social reason in make the advertis to show product much better than they are , the polit reason can be demonstr as a proof . the reason for present polit reason to prove my argument is that in some countri , for exampl in turkey , there are some distinct rule in make the product avail to use for peopl ; becaus these product shoud be reliabl , test in order to avoid the devast result after use them . therefor , most advertis tri to show the product much better at the begin to have the gover approv in distribut them . as a consequ of give the situat in polit side of the advertis , it can be claim that the desir to have approv from the polit power in order to introduc the product led to the increas number of the advertis which make the product much better than they realli are . as a result of give detail inform about the reason in econom , social and polit field , it is oviou to see that most advertis tri to present the product in order to develop their econom structur , prestig in govern and benefit from the the support of peopl , who are lazi and so not capabl in do research about the advertis product befor use them .
