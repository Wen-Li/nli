in the follow i 'd like to explain my opinion to the statement : `` it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . '' when you talk to peopl about famou person like e.g. about the german inventor albert einstein , you often get to hear that he wa good in what he did , but he total fail in other thing . for instanc he did develop a great theori in math , but he had difficulti in get a diploma becaus he wa realli bad in all the other subject when he went to school . thi is one exampl for someon who did special in one specif subject and therefor did not have a broad knowledg of mani other academ subject . in my opinion the statement at the top is both , half right and half wrong . on the one hand i think that the statement is right . for exampl it 's much more interest when you know a lot of thing about a lot of differ subject . it 's easier for you to have a convers with other peopl or to be accept in societi . as you can see with most nobel-pr winner ; they all are veri clever in what they do , but sinc they are so special in what they do , they most of the time do n't have a lot of friend to share their knowledg with ( becaus it 's way too difficult for `` normal '' peopl to understand what they are talk about ) or even wors do n't even have their own famili . the specif knowledg of a subject make them outsid , and often outsid are outlaw until they make a new invent or win ani prize . on the other hand i do n't agre with the statement that it 's better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif one , becaus without person who special in one specif subject there would not be progress in the world . we would still be live in cave and use stone to light a fire if there had n't been someon who special in the subject of how to light a fire without first search for fireston , and then hope for good luck to make the fireston work properli to final cook a meal . there also would not be ani help for peopl with a danger diseas if there had n't been clever peopl who special in medicin and found out how to heal a bad diseas like cancer . they would not have been as success as they are if they had n't just special in thi one specif subject .
