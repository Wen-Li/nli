i strongli agre with thi statement . it is more import to understand idea and concept than to just know certain fact by heart . first of all , i think that it is more challeng to come to understand a certain idea or concept , e.g. a philosoph problem . one first of all ha to understand the problem and whi it occur . base on thi , one can then tri to follow the philosoph 's effort and argument how to solv thi problem ( or whi it can not be solv ) . thi come to understand a certain logic stream of thought is a process of learn in itself and stand in contrast to `` simpli '' memor fact , like the name of the problem and the name of the philosoph . i put the word `` simpli '' in quotat mark sinc i do not want to dimiss the know of fact complet . i just think that a knowledg of fact should accompani the understand of a concept ; onli fact do not suffic . have fulli understood an idea also help when it come to explain thing to other peopl , such as friend , classmat , or , in case one want to becom a teacher , student . when one ha fulli understood an idea , it is easier to explain the respect concept to other . onli relat mere fact would not help other to throughli understand an idea . furthermor , a fact , like a date or a year , can , when in doubt , alway be look up in an encyclopedia . thi doe not hold for concept . furthermor , concept and idea can , and often need , to be critic and/or challeng . to be abl to question a concept , one ha to know and have understood what one is critic , to also justifi one 's critiqu . fact can , of cours , not be challeng . in gener it can be said that fact are not unimport , but the knowledg and understand of a concept or an idea is definit more vital in regard to the process of learn and the usag and appli of knowledg in everyday life .
