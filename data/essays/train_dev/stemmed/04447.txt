i agre with the idea that most advertis is better than the product itself . for exampl , when i read fashion magazin i find mani attract page which appeal variou product such as cosm , dress , watch , and perfum . whenev i look at these kind of page , actual i feel like buy them immedi . the one reason whi peopl have interset with advertis when look it is that it usual use femal model whose style is good and it alway look veri enjyoabl to use the product . it attract peopl and urg them to buy and wear them . sometim peopl tend to forget that they do n't have same face , style and atmospher with the model . it 's a fault . after obtain product , peopl feel it 's not better than expect becaus peopl do n't realli need it . the anoth reason whi most advertis is nice-look for peopl is it 's qualiti . to compet with other compani and get a big share of market , compani make effort with variou way , in particular for advertis . a recent reserch show that 90 percent compani in fashion field consid they should spend money and time to produc an advertis . for exampl , to hire famou design cost 10 time higher than salari of one employe month . consequ the qualiti of advertis sometim win the real product itself . for these reason , i support the posit of consid that most advertis seem much better than the product itself .
