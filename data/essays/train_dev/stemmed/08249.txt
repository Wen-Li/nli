i would have to say that i agre with the statement : `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' and here is whi : when you are young ( i would say under 35 ) you have more energi to go around , you definit have less commit and responsabilit ( famili or work ) , than when you are old , ( over 35 ) you are more of a free spirit . pleas allow me to explain my idea with some exampl . when i mean you have more energi to go aroung , i am talk about vital and be in shape , it would not be as easi or comfort to climb a mountain and camp outdoor when you are in your twenti , when your bodi is tone and strong . than when your are in your fifti even if you stay in shape , there is alway the risk of a heart attack or other condit that normal appear with age . and thing that seem okey befor may be uncomfort or even danger now . as for the commit and responsabilit , i gravit toward famili and work . to me these two are the center of my life . i could not do the thing i did in my twenti now that i have a famili to support and i am tie with a mortgag and credit card bill . so i guess i would call thi the `` settl life factor '' , which could be pretti tight in both sphere but more manag when young . final , i beliv that when you are young , you are more will to take risk , go for adventur and take chanc as you go . as peopl matur they some how chang their way , and settl for someth secur which i would translat into a calm life , with much of the enjoy use alreadi or wait to be `` use '' dure vacat time , mayb onc a year . and as i have heard peopl say : if i did n't do that when i wa young i do n't think i could do it now .
