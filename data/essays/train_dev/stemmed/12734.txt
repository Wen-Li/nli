for student , to understand idea and concept which repres the theori , and to learn fact which is the practic ; are both import . the practic is necessari in field such as scienc . to make a theori , you have to practic first . a basic exampl will be the graviti discoveri by newton : when an appl fell on hi head . all experi bring to a conclus which is the theori . but befor arriv to the theori , scientist have to defin the problem , make hypothesi , practic , find a solut and draw an hypothesi . nowaday , in scienc class such as chemistri , physic , or biolog , student have to follow the same pattern : problem , hypothesi , practic and solut which lead to the theori . thu the theori is the result of the practic . for educ and everyday life , it is veri import . it repres a base , a fundement part to understand a topic . befor do an applic , you have to know the applic in the entir . the theori is veri import becaus , it explain how someth work . for exampl , you will not use a technolog product without read the instruct book . also , in mathemat with complic formula , the practic can be veri hard , that is whi it is easier to give directli the theori to student . but we could say that theori can be easier than the practc , becaus theori demand onli to speak . on the contrari , practic is to get involv in a project and make thing to achiev , which is much more difficult . i disagre with thi statement , becaus , to my mind , for student , it is not more import to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact . for them , both are import . to receiv the best instruct , it is necessari to undersand idea and learn fact as well , if not the educ will not be complet .
