i agre with success peopl tri new thing and risk . i have some reason whi i think when success peopl tri to new thing thoe are not profession , weak experi and knowleg about new thing . from thoes point , peopl have to take risk when they tri to new thing eventhough they are alreadi success befor . first , he is not a profession about new thing . for exampl , a man who is a realli success restaur owner . everi bodi want to open restaur , like him . he probabl ha some success idea and action . also , he is sure about hi restaur food and style . it make him profession owner . howev , if he want to get anoth shop , such as flower . he like flower , but it is not enough to open the flower shop . even if he is a success restaur , it doe n't have a grante of success flower shop . second , person who want to tri to new thing doe n't have enough experi . as i wrote about the man who is the success restaur owen . he ca n't open flower shop easili becaus he doe n't have lot experi about it . everyth is differ . for exampl , when you eat some food , you can realiz that everi food ha differ tast . it come from experi . last , person who want to tri to new thing doe n't have enouth experi . the man who i wrote an exampl is a success man from hi own busi . mayb , the he ha enough knowleg about it , but he is not get easili . some of knowldg from book , specif person , and so on . but , most import knowleg from own experiec . i mention in conclus , thoes reason which are not profession , weak experi , and knowldeg . in my opinion , whereth success peopl or not success peopl have take risk when they tri to new thing . also , we do n't know that success peopl can possibl to have fail experi . that 's whi i agre with successfil peopl tri new thing and take risk tather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
