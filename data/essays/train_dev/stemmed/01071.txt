gener for all the student it veri import to understand a lot of thing . it can be infer that are a lot of way of how a student can understand , that are learn from idea and concept , or understand by fact . there are a lot of disadvantag of the three kind of situat alreadi mention . for exampl understand by idea it mean that they do n't have the main experi to make straight the definiton and it 's more usual , difficult to understand it by thi way . for the other hand student can also understand by concept , thi mean that the student are go to learn from a definit , someth more concret . and also there is anoth way of how a student can learn , and thi way is understand by fact , it mean that the student is not go to learn a concept or have the main idea , it 's that the student is go to experi and learn from someth that he live . these type of how a student can understand thing can be someth unclear , but it doe n't mean that each student use the three option to learn someth , but eventhough there are some of them who realli use the three . for the other hand there a some student that onli prefer one option , becaus they think that it the best way for them to understand thing . for my conclut i would say that it 's more import to all the student learn by fact , becaus it 's not the same thing to say that each person understood by read and have the main concept of thing , or that have just the idea . also , i think that it would be more clearful to understand thing by fact , becaus the student will not onli get a good understand , they also are go experi about a lot of thing and that is go to be somenth useful for their life .
