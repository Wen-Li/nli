i want to go to mani place which i do not know yet becaus the travel is fun for me . howev i sometim have bad experi and time by a group tour and a guid . therefor i disagre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid for these reason as follow . firstli , the group tour do not fit for me . everyth such as shightse place or food is alreadi deci in a group tour . then there are anoth ploblem . for exampl , i have been to germani in a group tour led by a tour guid . howev it wa the worst trip for me . when i went there , i wa onli ten year old , but all member of my group were over sixti year old . therefor i could not speak anyon . also the guid wa an english woman , so i did not understand her talk becaus i am japanes . i could not know ani english word . i knew that i could not do freeli . secondli , i want to research some plece that i visit to by myself . in a group tuor , the guid tell me much inform such as the name of citi or build . howev i want to look for these thing becaus i love histori in the world and the citi , tokyo which i live in . if i travel alon and reaserch mani thing , i enjoy it veri much . also i believ that i have the best experi . all in all , the trip which is in a group led by a tour guid is not the best . if i travel with pnli person peopl such as my best friend , parent or sister , it fit for me becaus i can do everyth freeli . also i can enjoy to know a great number of informationabout tha citi which i go to becaus my hobbi . for these reason , i disagre that the group tour led by a tour guid is the best to travel .
