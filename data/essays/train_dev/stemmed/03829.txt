last night while i wa prepar for my histori of econom analysi exam , i realli spent a lot of time in learn idea and concept rather than the fact . i think it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are mani reason of thi situat . first of all , idea and concept are more import than fact in the exam . in gener , the question are about idea and concept . the teacher place them too much import , they spent too much time about them in the class and moreov they want too much knowledg from student about idea and concept in the exam . for exampl , in my exam the question are gener relat with the idea and concept rather than fact . therefor , i work for the idea and concept much . anoth reason is that in educ system in my countri , it is not veri necessari to know the fact . on the other hand , the educ system encourag the student to learn and understand idea and concept . idea and concept have more page than the fact in cours textbook and they are discuss in more detail than the concept . therefor , the student place a bigger import on idea and concept than fact . understand idea and concept is more import than understand the fact for the student . to learn about the idea and concept can help student more in the exam and the educ system also encourag student to learn them rather than learn the fact .
