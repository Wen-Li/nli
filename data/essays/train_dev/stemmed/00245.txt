i agre with the statement say that it is more import to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . it is more interest to understand concept , becaus it will be a base you can use , modifi or widen , wherea if you learn fact , you ca n't go further . let 's take exampl . to a student studi histori it is veri import to learn the fact , which is part of hi knowledg . on the other sid , if he understand the logic connexion between variou histor event : what led to them , which are the consequ and how they got resolv ? he will be more consciou of the subject , and thu will be abl to explain it . in architectur for exampl , it is import to know some fact , that are mileston in the histori of architectur , but what is more convinc , is not the applic of fact , but the accur of you concept when you will present your project . to me , there is a big differ between `` understand '' and `` learn '' . if you learn someth , you are onli a `` recipi '' that is abl to contain and to restitut inform . you will not be abl to talk about the subject , onc you have quit the sphere of your knowledg . wherea if you understand a topic , you do not have a mental and intellectu limit anymor which are consequ of ignor . nevertheless you can widen your knowledg and go beyond the limit onc you have understood the idea and concept . in my opinion , both of them are complementari . you ca n't have a solid base if you do n't know fact , but in the same time , if you undestand idea and concept , it will help you to learn fact . but it i had to choos , i would rather understand concept than be limit by what i have learn .
