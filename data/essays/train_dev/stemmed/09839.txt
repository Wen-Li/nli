peopl have differ opinion on whether it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . some peopl say that spacial in one specif subject is better than have broad knowledg of mani academ . howev , i oppos the idea for two reason . first , it allow student to have divers job 's opportun . second , it is benefici to choos the major . to begin with , it enabl student to get variou job 's opportuni . it is known that when student in univers have diverst inform about other field exept for their own major , they can get a good job easili . let me give my friend for an exampl . one of the my best friend ha built broad knowledg for a long time at an earli age . so , he got better job than me . that is becaus he can have mani option on job . if he would not have broad knowledg of mani academ , he could not get a job that he want to . on top of that , it is benefici to select the major . today 's mani student in high school have a cercorn about their major in the univers . that is due to the fact that they should have chosen the univers . for exampl , my brother is in high school student . he ha a worri about hi major that he do in the univers . so , hi professor give mani advis for hi major . fortunitli , he can dicid hi major that is art . in conclus , i agre that student have broad knowledg of mani academ as i mention avof
