the statement state that broad knowledg in mani academ subject is better then in depth knowledg in one specif subject . on the one hand the broad knowledg give a larg pictur on the issu , on the other hand specil in one subject give an edg in the area specif to it . howev broad knowledg is better but be a specialist doe n't lessen it import . firstli , have knowledg about more then one academ subject or in fact mani academ subject help a student or teacher to get a more larger view and the abil to see the thing from more broader perspect . for ex. a person know chemistri and biolog can definit tell better about the detail of chemic reaction take place insid the bodi and it effect on it as well . secondli , have broad knowledg help in correl the inform from variou subject and thu enabl onself to give a more holist view of differ subject relat to each other . for instanc , physic and mathemat are subject which are relat with each other . instead of mere state the law , if it can be prove mathemat also then it will help the audienc to have better understand of the law and thu can be easili grasp . final , have broad knowledg give an edg in make thing interest instead of just plain load of inform from a specif subject . for ex a lectur know scienc , math and histori can definit deliv a better and interest lectur then a specialist of one field . have said about broad knowledg , it should not be overlook the import of specialist knowledg which is necessari when it requir to have indepth knowledg rather than just a good knowledg about mani subject . for ex. a zeolog professor explain intricasi about the nervou system of an anim will be expect to deliv in depth knowledg about the minutia detail which obvious requir specif knowledg and not broad knowledg . in the conclus it can be said that it is true that broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better but that doesnt lessen the import of special knowledg in one specif subject by ani factor .
