thi is veri difficult question for me , becaus i am a one of the young peopl who do not have a relat with my commun , so i coplet agre with thi opinion that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . there are sever reson i think for thi question . first , almost young peopl do not know their neighbour , becaus there is no opportun to contuct with them . in the past of japan , peopl did anyth with the commun member , becaus the peopl who belong to same communitiy were famili , so peopl decid the import thing , like a rebuild the hous or chang the job , with the commun . peopl do help the other in their commun . howev , peopl nowaday are not interest in other , and they do not want to have a relat with the neighbour , becaus the horribl actid occur recent . second , older famili and younger famili have a gener gap . if there is a chanc to do someth togeth in their commun , but both famili have a differ opinion . it is a natur thing for the peopl , becaus they tend not to have a complex problem , so they do not give enough time to help the commun and not have a relat . when i wa a child , i had to clean up the park where i alway play with my friend for the commun 's event . thi wa a task for the children . mani adult observ us , but anoth day , mani adult taught sport for the communitiy club . i agre with thi opinion that mani young peopl do not give the time for their commun , but we should chang thi custom to improv the relationship between the neighbour and me , becaus if the accid happen in daili life , other near us help first . peopl help each other and get a good relationship in the commun .
