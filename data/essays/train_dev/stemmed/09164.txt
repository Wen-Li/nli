i agress with the statment made here . advertis are a tool that busi use to promot a product . it is ofcours quit obviuo then that they will onli show the posit side of a product in an an attempt to get a custom to buy it . it is not in their best interest to be honest . busi live by the fact that they are legal allow to lie . ani advertis ha the purpos of sell . if busi were truthful about what they were sell product sale would decreas significantli . let take for exampl ciggeratt advertis . cigger are bad for your health . in today world you will not find anyon to argu with thi statment and be abl prove their oppinion . so how do you advertis for a product like cigger ? how do you convinc peopl to buy someth that kill them ? clearli cigger manufactur have thought about thi greatli and have come up with the best answer . psycholog . advertis capitilis on human psycholog understand . an honest cigger commerci would caus peopl to avoid the product . so therfor advertis learn about human psycholog and how to attract peopl to someth they know is bad . they highlight the packag that come with smoke rather than the cigger itself . there is'nt a cigger commer out there that convinc you to buy their product becaus of it tast or it feel . they get you buy it by show you the social and statu reward of smoke their brand . like davidoff and it eleg . so when peopl see advertis they sometim rememb onli it social effect rather than the product itself . to me that how advertis can make a product seem better than it acut is .
