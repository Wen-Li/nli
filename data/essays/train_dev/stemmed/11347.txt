although a good argument can be made that old peopl enjoy life more than young peopl do , i think that the contrari is true . there are two reason whi i have thi opinion . first , when you are young , you tend to have more money to spend than when you are older or even retir . with the age come the duti and the sorrow . when build a famili , there are a lot of thing such as a hous and the educ for the children that cost a lot . altough it may be true that young peopl may dispos of rel less money , they have more to spend . so they give it out for vacat , car , parti and other thing that are fun . they sometim even buy thing that they can not realli afford . without say thi is better , young peopl think short-term and therefor enjoy everi singl day . when i use to work as a traine when i wa 21 year old , i had money but no duti . so i just enjoy go out with friend everi night and spend the whole money . i do not think that i will show the same behavior by the time i get 30 . i will hope have save some money to be abl to plan a famili . in addit to that , young peopl want to enjoy now and today . from my point of view , i think it is better to enjoy your life as long as you can . knowbodi know what tomorrow will be . i heard about a lot of peopl who were postpon their trip they want to take or their car they want to buy , but due to sever factor , suddenli it wa not possibl anymor . not onli is it more fun to do a trip with your friend when you are young , but it is someth you have done and will alway think back and smile . therefor , young peopl travel around more when they are young just becaus it ha more advantag than if you travel when you get older . in conclus , despit the fact that older peopl have fun as well , i think that young peopl enjoy their live more becaus they do it with less reason and more joy .
