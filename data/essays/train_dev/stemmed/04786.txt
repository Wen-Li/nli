i disagre with the statement , becaus everi age ha it own oportun to enjoy the life . motiv should be the keyword instead of motion to understand what realli lie under enjoy life . against the undeni power of the energi of young peopl older peopl have experi to defeat the badli result that life carri . thi can help the older peopl to immedietli convert the neg into posit . they onli need to motiv themselv and feel confid . enjoy life doe not mean have a sportiv life , a person can enjoy the life by read , write or just by watch and comment about the thing that take place around him . everyon like to watch the concept that they creat befor . young peopl have the abil of be more healthi but they do n't have free time and money to achiv the activ that they realli want . howev , older peopl have the financi power to enjoy these activ if they do n't need to spend so much phyisic effort . the enjoy can differ in differ age . the thing which are veri fantast in the young hood can be veri bore when you are old . final everi age contain it own way of life and in everi age the person can creat some motiv to enjoy tye life .
