student around the world have differ method of learn , it highli depend on the subject in hand . some subject depend more on learn fact , other subject are more toward understand the idea . i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , and i think that thi statement should be appli to all subject . as a start , by understand the idea and concept , student will end up understand the subject in hand , not just learn it by heart . understand the idea and concept will make it much easier for them to learn the detail by heart . for instanc , in biolog , if you understand the exact rout of blood from the heart to the organ , you will find it easier to later on learn the name of the organ that the blood pass through . moreov , some subject such as mathemat , need clear understand of the concept so that you could appli them to the question . after understand the concept , you can learn the rule , and then appli them . in addit , it is more easi to forget a subject that you simpli learnt , but not quiet understood . in my junior high school year , my worst subject ever wa histori . i use to learn the fact , write them up in the final exam , leav the exam room alreadi forget everyth i had just wrote down . that is becaus i never bother actual understand the cours . thu by understand a cours , you can rememb it for a long time , and appli it in anoth cours afterward . final , you can understand more about a cours by read more knowledg than requir about it . it might not be in the syllabu of the cours , but it will help the student to expand hi mind more and learn more than requir about it , thi would make the cours seem more interest . to sum up , by understand the idea and concept rather than simpli learn fact , it would be easier to learn and appli , it would be more interest and you 'll end up rememb the cours for a long time . therefor , i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
