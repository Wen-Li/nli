the idea that student should learn idea and concept rather than fact neither look logic nor ration . i would complet disagre with that idea for a lot of reason . i do think that in order for young grow peopl to learn fact of life and scienc in differ special in order to be abl to have the idea of their own , otherwis they will just come with mix out idea and concept . so it is sort of chronolog process . i do not think for exampl how would a student could come up with certain invent or innov in certain machin or subject without clearli take in all the basic fact of how thi machin is work and the basic scientic factor contol it function or he may end up with catastrophi . anoth reason , is that studi of fact broaden the horizon of the student vision , then he would be quit capabl of find out the concept and basic idea by himself , by studi how everi thing in life would correctli work . it is onli after pass that stage of basic learnig that hi abil to investig and relat new concept and theori . young student tend to be arrog if they believ that they know concept and idea , that would be use onli after ensur they realli learn the fact and be abl use them in the proper context . and last but not least , educ is an activ process , and unless the student forc from their younghood to learn hard and given fact and certain assign they would be reluct to offer ani thing use to the world or be aid in world 's progress . it is that young age that student could be taught all the human scienc and knowleg and if we start by the idea of come off teach them the fact and basic scienc we will end up with ignor gener . in conclus , i belief student should be taught fact and basic of scienc rather than mere give them idea and concept as it would not help them enough to proceed in their career .
