success peopl tend to tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . whi i use `` tend '' abov is that that is a possiblil , not an absolut solut for the success peopl , otherwis the answer should depend on how to defin `` success peopl '' and how do success peopl success ? if success mean money , and someon who are call success peopl compar , but not a real money bag like bill gate , there is no absolut answer for success . howev , even in that case , the possibl for the success is consist chang up to definit of success or how much are they success . appar , the possibl for success are given to the peopl who are will to tri someth new . becaus in the field that have been well-known benefit maker . mani peopl have alreadi taken their benefit from that , not much thing other peopl can gain and it could be call as monopoli . it 's like fossil fuel deplet . small part of the world are still take big gain from the fossil fuel , there is no chanc to get enter in that industri , becaus that file are alreadi full with prior properti . in a given situat like their dna , such as their look or how they are smart , like how much money do they get from their parent , the possi ble way to improv their possibl for success is to challeng to uncov world . even though they are have the riski busi which is origin from itself ( becuas it 's new ! ) the peopl who onli do what they alreadi know how to do well can not easili catch up with those peopl who tri to do someth new and their great-great success rather than great or just success . i am aim great-great success like i wrote abov , what i requir to get the goal is to improv my cred , to be enough creativ to find someth new and explor it . there is a word in my countri `` if the water is stuck in one place , those will be decay .
