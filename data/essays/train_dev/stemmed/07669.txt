in the modern capitalist life , market and imag are becom sort of equival thing . the audio-visu media gener and move huge amount of money , and what is more , in an exponenti way . for exampl , let 's think in the tv . on one hand , tv move load of money so enterpris want to invert in it the more and more . on the other hand tv produc and strang decreas effect on peopl 's criter and abil to judg . so the more and more there is peopl who just beliv in whatev they can see in a tv commerci , and what is more , if your favorit tv star is wear thi amaz product you alway want to belong , then there is definit no reason to doubt about the fact you have to buy that product . unfortun , enterpris now that , so they invert in market . for thi reason i absolutli believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . but , what happen when the consum realiz the trick ? well in thi case , what happen it is noth . when consum realiz they have been trap by the market technic , they just keep the product and go to buy anoth one in the way they thought the first product they bought wa . i think it is untoler that thi kind of thing can happen . the consum associ appar do noth , and when some upset consum tri to denunc the situat it is just like if you talk to a wall . so in conclus , from my point of view the gover should make ani intervent and should promot consum associ to let them be more effect . on the other hand peopl should spent time in carri out activ to develop their judgement skill , for instanc read book and not watch tv . unfortun it seem that it is hard to happen . in my opinion , not onli product seem much better that they realli are ; it will be an incres trend in thi fact that will lead to the dicreas of the qualiti of product the more and more , and will make peopl spent money more frequent and major amount of money each time .
