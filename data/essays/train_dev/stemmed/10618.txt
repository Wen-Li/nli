in my opinion , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus fact make student bore while the idea and concept seem as interest . first , from the begin of my educ in my school teacher alway gave me some fact and everytim i ask myself what would i do with them . i think learn fact would not improv student becaus we can not chang these fact we can not deni them or we can not develop them . the reason for thi is that they are all about the past . they have alreadi prove and the last thing we can do is admit them and live accord to these fact . on the other hand , bring some idea and understand concept is veri import sinc you are think and creat your own valu . second , when make a career , it is necessari to defin what is happen around the world . you can not defend yourself accord the fact but idea or concept . you should make logic comment about global event not onli about their obviou featur but also what is hidden so that you should understand idea and concept to make sensibl sentenc . final , i agre that it is import to understand idea and concept to be creativ and sensibl .
