when peopl imagin about young peopl 's live , they think activ and joy live , so i agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . young peopl usual tend to tri someth new . in other word , they feel excit about an event that they have never experienc befor no matter how hard it is . howev , major of older peopl do not want to tri someth fresh becaus they alreadi feel comfort with their ordinari life . even though they are bore with their circumst , they normal do not have desir for more interest life . last christma , i met my grandmoth . when i suggest go on a trip to wherev she want to go , she seem she wa not enthusiast about the plan , obvious contrari to me , so i ask her the reason for her feel . then , she said that she felt exhaust enough and all she want to stay at home rather than travel . at that moment , i could realiz all the senior like my grandmoth desir more comfort and rest . the other reason is that young peopl are provid much more experi from the societi . for exampl , when teenag graduat from their high school , they eventu enter the univers . and , in the univers , there are plenti of club that they can get involv . thu , through varieti of club they experi , they can find their interst and feel pleas . older peopl , on the other hand , do not receiv mani opportun from their circumst becaus they usual stay at home or go onli sever place where they use to go daili . although these place can provid them conveni , they can not give them a chanc to tri variou kind of activ . therefor , the older peopl undergo much less experi than young peopl . as a result , the young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus young peopl tri to find someth new and they experi varieti of opportun more than older peopl do .
