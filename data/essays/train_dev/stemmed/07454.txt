thi quetino remind me of my father who pass away two year ago becaus he said befor about thi topic . thi question give me what worth life is for me . i think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do for sever reason . first of all , you peopl have more opportun to get somet . for exapl , young adulthood can tri somet new such as new field of studi in colleg or univers for their purpos . they can studi abroad for a better life . also , young peopl can join a lot of activit with mani peopl even if some activ are danger they can do . in other word , they can be satisfi with their life . howev , most old peopl can not stand for a long time to do someth such as studi new field or join club with new peopl . in addit , i think young peopl 's health is better than older peopl 's , so young gener can tri more than older peopl for their happi time . for exampl , young adulthood can go a long distanc for a long time for travel or challeng , they can easili endur some risk and hardship . therefor , they can enjoy more to spend time for travel in the world . in contrast , old peopl usual have diseas and show weak to do somet . also , they alway need someon who help them to live without think about lesir time becaus it is difficult to do somet as a patient . final , young peopl can meet mani peopl such close friend relaltv job or colleg . becaus most of young peopl have mani friend who still live near surround them . they can share their emot and idea for a their enjoy life . meet peopl make them more energet and dynam . on the other hand , old peopl can not share their time with close friend like young adulthood becau most of friend pass away or live far away from them . they often feel longli and stay alon without have a enjoy time . i know a few old peopl have opportun and a time like young peopl for enjoy life , but it is not mani . it is true . my father said to me , befor he pass away , it wa difficult to enjoy travel and do somet , i know whi he memtiond like thi . therefor , i beliv that young peopl enjoy life more than the old .
