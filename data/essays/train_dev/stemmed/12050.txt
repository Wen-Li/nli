in recent year , the educ system are diffrent . some peopl perfer the student should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , howev other perfer to have special in one specif subject . for me , i would agre with first oppinion . the reason are as follow . first and formost reason is that in thi sociati we need compehens person . nowaday , the competit is veri drastic , everi bodi ha ambit to be the first , if i just have special in one specif subject , i could not allow to have variou job oppotun , and also i will lose some good chanc . for exampl , if i special in histori , i just can find some job reli on histori , but there are not have mani job in histori , but if i studi borad subject i can afford mani diffrent job , even it not intrest , but i can get job and money . i can serviv . second factor is that it can improv my organizet skill . for exampl , if i stduy broad knowledg of mani academ suject i will organ the time , and my work ethic . also it enlarg my view , also in diffrent calss , i will meet diffrent peopl , it also can improv my commun skill and interperson skill . thid lie in fact is that it pave my way for furtur . if i have abroad knowledg of mani academ subject , i can have good job oppotun and also if i meet diffrent peopl , i can easi to talk with them and easi to find intrest object to talk , becaus i have larg knowledg . also it improv my socal commun . in brief , even special in one specif subject , you might save time and save money , but you will loss more . accord to what i have disscuss about , if you want to give them good impress and if you want to surviv in thi sociati , you should have broad knowledg if mani academ subject than special in one specif subject . weigh the pro and con of these argument , i agre that it is better to habe broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
