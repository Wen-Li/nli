in the past year , we have seen a grow conflict between older and younger peopl . in mani countri , the gap between gener is grow , due to demograph as well as sociolog develop . unemploy of young peopl is a hugh problem in mani european countri . in mani case , young peopl are not abl to get a good educ becaus of their immigration-background or their social environ . also , mani young peopl are not abl to find proper job although they have good educ becaus after massiv job cut in mani multinatin compani , no youngster are hire at the moment due to slow econom growth and the consequ of globalis , which often caus outsorc and transfer of job from expens first world countri to area , where product is cheaper . on the other hand , also older peopl are affect by these job cut . at the same time , european welfare-st have to rais the retir age in order to keep their social system function and financ . of cours , thi develop sometim caus frustrat on both side . when older peopl who either have the will to work but do n't find a job or who have work for decad and are now retir see young peopl in the street , hang out , do noth ( except skateboard , listen to music , play comput game and shop ) they might get the impress , that young peopl enjoy life more than they do or than they did when they were their age . and that impress , in my opinion , is probabl correct . when today old gener were young , in the fourti and fifti , there wa not a lot of fun stuff to do in europ . they experienc the cruelti of the world war ii and the hard work that wa necessari to rebuild the countri afterward . young peopl in europ are lucki , to grow up in a safe and often wealthi environ . they have the chanc to do thing , older peopl were not abl to : they can travel , they can commun with stranger and friend around the world , they can get to know the world in a total differ way their parent , grand parent and grand grand parent were abl to . they have the time and possibl to do sport and ofther fun activ and to enjoy their life - mayb more , or at least in a differ way , than mani older peopl do . mayb thi way of lifestyl mani young peopl have , contain travel , extrem sport and other way to test their person limit , are a way to cope with their `` zukunftsangst '' , with the scari feel mani youngster have , that they have to be flexibl all the time , they often do n't know , what tomorrow bring them and they are not sure , if and how long they will have a job ( and if they are lucki to have a job , they have to pay for the older peopl 's retir , probalbi without bee ever abl to profit from thi system themselv ) . i think , young peopl have all right to enjoy their live as long as they can - sooner or later it will get tough anyway . older peopl should n't complain about thi but rather tri to understand the situat , teenag and twen are in . and sometim they should even talk to their grand children and tell them : `` it 's alright , enjoy your life . go and have some fun !
