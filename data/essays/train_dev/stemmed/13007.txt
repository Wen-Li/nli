actual i do agre with the statment , i mean it 's pretti true if we read some articl or if we wach the news on tv or just if we are a littl bit involv with the commun . i think that young peopl as me ( i 'm 23 yera old and so i 'm put myself in the exampl ) realli do n't help their commun but i wanna figur out what are the reason of thi behaviour . i do n't want to defend or go against my categori but i would like to consid the motiv : first of all i think that nowaday we actual do n't have enough time also for other thing , i 'm refer at the famili 's problem or just famili 's life . probabl with the school or univers , with the exam , with the homework and with other million of activ outsid the school we want do or in which we want to join ( or our parent want we do ) our young peopl have to organ our day as better as possibl . sometim i have the impress that 24 hour a day are not enough to do all even if you are a realli organ person ( lesson in the morn , studi in the afternoon , extra class in the even , gym after class ... new meet with the new school or the new organ or . .. ) you can see that is gonna be so hard to find time for someth els . on the other hand i think that if you want to find time for someth you realli care you are abl to do that ! i mean if you have a new boyfriend ( in my case ) i 'm sure i will take some free time to stay with ! probabl the problem is not find the time to help your communit but just think about thi opportun , it will be a great advantag for everybodi also for yourself . help peopl that realli need your hand i think it 's one of the most import and satisf experi in your life . in conclus there is not a good responc to thi statment , it 's just up to you . it depend on your prioriti in life . in my person opinion find more time to help peopl make sens abov all becaus you are help somebodi or you are do someth realli preciou for other peopl and also for the improv of your person life !
