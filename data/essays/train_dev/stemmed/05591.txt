as to the option that wether to travel in a group led by a tour guid , mani peopl believ that a singl tour will be better becaus there are more freedom dure the tour . i am , howev , most like among the one who think that there are far more advangtag to travel in a group with a tour guid . the reason are as follow . the most obviou reason is that we can make more friend in a group . take myself as an exampl . onc i visit beij in a group , i made a lot of frirend . we are still keep in contact now and have alreadi decid sever trip after that and realli enjoy the time we spare togath . it is undoubt that take a trip with friend make the trip happier and of greater valuebl . further more , it is better to have a guid with us dure the trip so that we can know the background of the place . if i visit a new place , i would like to know the cultur of the place , how the peolp live , what is the famou featur of the place , what ha happend in the past on thi land . .. all of these seem attract me a lot . therefor , a guid who can describ all the thing abov is extrem necessoy . final , the disadvantag of a singl trip is indisput . for a stranger to a total new place , it alway to take a long time to get familiar with the site . it is a wast of time as well as a watst of money for a travel to stay in a place just linger to find where to go . in addit the instanc of a singl travel get lost can be found anywher . from what ha been discuss abov , we can safe draw a conclut that travel in a group led by a guid is far better than a individul trip .
