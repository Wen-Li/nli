usual , when we think about global and it consequ , we often focu on econom implic or technolog one . one major chang that thi controversi process ha brought - but that is too frequent omit - concern the way peopl are travel . as a matter of fact , sinc the internet ha start to be avail almost everywher , a lot of destin that use to be unacces for the common travel are now safe and cheaper . thi whole new environ led mani travel to quit the traditionn way of travel abroad - in a group with a tour guid - for a wilder type of trip : alon without anybodi to guid you - no matter what your destin is . as far as i am concern , i truli think that thi new wave in the travel industri is a good thing sinc it is way more interest and excit than the oldfashion one . first , travel alon give you more liberti to visit what realli you are realli interest in . if you do not like art museum then you wo n't be oblig to spend hour of your limit amount of time in a specif citi admir the work of picasso . travel on your own allow you to make up your person itineari accord to your tast and not on the tour guid one . in the same order of idea , travel in a group can impli a lot of other constraint that may make your trip less enjoy . for instanc , you often have to be at a specif place realli earli in the morn so you do n't realli have the `` right '' to sleep in the morn , go the bed late etc . howev , the main disadvantag of travel in a group with a tour guid is that it doe not give you the opportun to fulli `` live '' and understand the cultur of the countri you are visit . usual , tour guid bring you to the tourist hot spot where everyon speak english , have a camera and is abl to act in a western way . consequ , you do n't realli experi the real way of live of the local as you do not get the chanc to share their everyday live . on the opposit , travel on your own - either with your backpack or in a more luxiou way - allow you to explor hidden place , to get in touch with ordinari peopl from the street and to take the time to learn about the other . i could go on with mani other reason that support my idea that the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guid but ultim , i think than choos the way you want to travel is more a matter of person , of budget and of interest . there is bad way of travel . but there is certainli one that suit you better .
