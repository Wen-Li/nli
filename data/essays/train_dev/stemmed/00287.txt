everi day we face decis that make us do someth better tri a new way . but we usual forget them and focus onli on the big one decis becaus those can complet chang our life . success peopl usual are more lucki with those great decis , but i do believ that success peopl are not onli those who take risk , but those who can understand when take a risk tri someth new , and also if their decis affect neg other peopl . mani situat in life could determin if a risk is worth take , and are relat to the field in wich the decis are taken and the fallout of thi decis . for exampl a basketbal coach could face the situat in wich he ha to decid to tri someth new and unusu to win a game , such chang the defens scheme that help him win mani game in the past . in thi case the risk could pay off and give him success . on the other hand if someon is a veri good medic doctor , he ha mani patient and ha a larg famili , but suddent he decid to becam a profession painter that risk would onli hurt hi patient , leav them without a cure , and hi famili , leav them without financi support . for them he wa alreadi success by do what he learn and wa train to do . i think that one major mistak that we usual commit is to measur success with creativ . of cours a person can be success if he do someth in a new way , but there can be success also in attain excel in a field . i do believ that the abil to take ration risk is veri valuabl , but otherwis it is more easi to be the better one do someth if you alreadi are do thi particular thing .
