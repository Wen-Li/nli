although mani peopl believ that young peopl enjoy life more than older pepol do , i disagre with thi statement . in the follow , i will give three argument for have thi opinion . first of all , i want to mention that mani older peopl are retir . that mean that they can organ their pastim as they like to . they are abl to do a lot of activ for which they probabl did n't have enough time while work . usual , mani older peopl spend their time travel around the world , learn a new languag or an instrument , or are just relax . my grandmoth , for instanc , enjoy her life in the summer by go to a lake everi day . she love to be in the natur , to watch the bird and to swim in the lake . anoth point is that mani older peopl alreadi made a lot of experi in their life . they will probabl not have the feel like younger peopl do that they could miss someth in daili life . they are surround by kind of a quiet mood and can total concentr on enjoy life . younger peopl , by contrast , alway feel the pressur and stress that should becom success to be abl to enjoy their life later on . the pressur might be caus by the expect of the educ system or by the comparison to the older peopl , often parent or grand-par , who were alreadi success in the past . final , older peopl are often happi abouth small thing in life . they often do n't need a lot of materi comfort . they rather appreci that they can still walk around , that they are of good health or that they have a famili they can talk to . my grand-par , for exampl , do n't have a car . thu , they do n't have to worri about higher ga price . in conclus , i want to stress that older peopl are definit abl to enjoy life the same as younger peopl do . they just do it in anoth way which might be hard for younger peopl to accept .
