some might argu that understand idea and concept is more import than understand fact . i think thi statement can be true in some way , but i definit reject it and for the follow reason . although it is easi to support the theori that student tend to be fascin by and thu learn idea better than fact and give them more import , thi can be argueabl . literatur or philosophi , which are basic base on the studi of idea , ideolog , theori , are usual easier to studi and even more pleasant than , for exampl , solv chemic form . they impli less effort and abstract concept can be seen as more essenti in an educ than number or fact . howev , subject as literatur , philosophi , histori , can be on one side as difficult as scientif subject and on the other side often have to be support by fact . firstli , idea , for the reason that their substanc is base on abstract , can be veri hard to formul , share and understand . mani philosophi , like kantism , are base on notion of knowledg that are mainli intuit and can not be understood neither by an experienc and open mind , thu it can be hard to consid more solid and import than fact . secondli , fact are idea and viceversa . as popper state , fact do not exist befor idea becaus it is the idea that bring the mind to explor the fact . also , mani idea have to be support by number to be valid and feasibl , i.e. econom theori or polit statement usual reli on statist data and method . in conclus , i would say that the statement is a half truth and could be complet say that idea and fact are essenti element in everi mindset in ani studi area , depend on each other and share the same import . student are usal enough flexibl to appreci both idea and fact , as mani old thinker and philosoph , who were at the same time mathemat and philosophi scholar .
