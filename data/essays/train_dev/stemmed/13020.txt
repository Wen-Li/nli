accord to me have a broad knowledg is import at the bigin stage of your knowledg build . it serv as the base or foundat for your knowledg . for me have the abil to contribut in everi possibl field in acadam subject is the great thing . the main reason for thi is my excit and quick grasp power which attract me to the everi new and differ thing around me . i prefer to have everi possibl knowledg of all the subject . thi develop interest and also help to experi more number of field rather than mani thing in same field . by have broad knowledg of mani subject make averag level of knowledg veri high . but by speciallis in one subject restrict the growth of knowledg in other subject and also it ha a specif limit . what after that limit ? , when you know everyth in the same subject . for me it import to know more about mani thing than know everyth about one thing . for exampl in ani industri , the main work consist of mani small work such as machin handl , actual work on that machin , it maimtain , repair ant mani thing like thi in mani region . here it not possibl to solv everi problem by onli one specialist . becaus he ha the knowledg about one thing onli . so he cant help for the other problem . here the role of generlist is import . he ha answer for mani thing and in mani field . we can say manag . manag is call so becaus he can manag all thing . so i prefer to have broad knowledg of mani acadam subject and that whi the are be introduc , that whi they are be teach . otherwis peopl will have one subject onli . which can not work . in today world you cant live with knowledg of onli one field . more the knowledg more you can grow . for me be a jack of everyth is the best way to grow in knowledg .
