nowadasi the rythm of life is becom more and more frantic , and thi is quit evid and clear to all of us . anyway i 'm not of the opinion that today we are lose valu and dedic our time to unus or trivial thing . i strongli desagre with the statement propos and defenit do n't want to believ that young peopl do n't spend time help the commun they live in . first of all , i want to notic that the chanc , offer by societi , to join voluntari activ and project , are much more public today than befor . thank to technolog progress , our wide and fast way of commun make it easier to know the great varieti of opportun for help someon and somewher that everyday come out : from workcamp to sport event , from work with children to bring help to old peopl who live alon , and so on . the environ a young volunt can find himself in , is never the same so he/sh doe n't get bore . moreov , the sever opportun are avail for all the age , there are not volunt too young or to old , just volunt that want to get on their bike and work a bit for the other . i had a person experi that gave me an import teach and that i hope my children will desir to do too . last year i join a group of 23 intern volunt in kenya and the aim of the project wa to build a road ( or may i should say a way ) in the middl of a forest to make children abl to go to school . it ha been an experi unforgett from mani point of view : we were help that african commun and they were veri kind with us , we live in strict contact , so i got the chanc to know a differ cultur in a deep way . conclud , i believ that today young peopl have in mind that everi opportun to help the commun and to join a voluntari project , can be an extrem signific tool to matur and also a cultur exchang as much import as unexpect .
