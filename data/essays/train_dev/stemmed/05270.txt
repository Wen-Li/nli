today the most challeng area in the busi sector is ` marketing` , which is how to advertis your product so that it will flourish among the competit product and then be sold , as the challeng increas , the main actor in the sector tri to come up with innov idea in order to surviv in thi cruel world of busi . these main actor are advertis , who actual present the product to the comment of the buyer , through a consider amount of time , eneri and money spent on the analysi of the sector eventu ha begin to creat it ` own ' market strategi , the most tricki and throuhli success strategi is to introduc an advertis that make product seem much better than they realli are , thi method of ` diguis ' bring one of the hottest issu in the sector : violat of the ethic consider , some advertis and the compani who hire them think that there can not be ani rule for thi game , they claim that they do not insist on the custom to buy the product that is advertis with have told that it ha the best feauter compar to similar product , so it is up to the custom whether to choos buy the product or not , on the other hand , some compani emphas the import of the some set of ethic valu that set the sector in a balanc so that it will last , among these two differ perspect , i think the exclus of ethic consider would not harm the sector or the so-cal balanc , now , it would be benefici to grasp an exampl and see how the two differ approach handl the case . soap is an import product in the fcgm ( food and consupt good market ) and probabl we are encount dozen of advertis on how well ` their ' soap are , befor go ani further , it is incredib crucial to state the goal of each compani regardless of it scale , sector , privat or public statu : to make profit ; make more money , rememb thi goal , it would be easili conclud that ani depart in the compani seek to contribut to thi profit in a way that depart perform , for the market depart , the way is to advertis the product best so that it will be sold and compani will get a profit in return , if you target to make more money , back to exampl , you have no chois other than sell your soap brand , and if you lack of some qualiti or price specif , the onli choic to follow is wait for you : to lie to the buyer ; or in a more kindli way , to exaggreg the featur of the product , ani market depart and advertis have not the luxuri of betray the ultim goal of the compani . so it is extrem logic to exaggreg the featur of the product in order to make your product seem much better than they realli are when you can not meet some crucial specif such as qualiti which is one of the trait of the prduct custom are seek to buy , on the other hand , the ethic dimens of the issu is still a big question mark for those who see the ethic and moral valu much more prior and import to make profit , in conclus , it depend on your conscienc to lie to your custom or not , i agre that most advertis make prodcut seem mcuh better than they realli are ; howev , due to the reason i state abov , thi kind of a market strategi just serv to what it is suppos to , if i would be an advertis and meet a case like thi one , i total go with ` lie to the custom and do the best for my company` , besid , i would not be offend as a mere custom and not feel betray by the compani i trust .
