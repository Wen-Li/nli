to answer if i agre or disagre with thi statement , i have to make some distinct . there are some profess that need a broad knowledg of mani academ subject and some that do not . profess like scientist in specif region , let say microbiologist , need a special . that mean that they will start to studi gener biolog and later special for microbiolog . they might need gener knowledg about staticti , mathemat and mayb some term in the latin lannguag , but they do not need to studi economi or philosophi . on the other hand there are some profess where a broad knowledg is need . a director of a movi will need complex understand of mani differ subject . he will have to deal with actor , so he will need probabl some knowledg about psycholog . he will need to understand the financ of thi project , have knowleadg about technic issu to commun with the camera , light and edit team . further he will need to outweight the import of everi upcom problem , where he will need manag skill like timemanag . on the other hand , if you have enough time to studi what you like and what you are passion for , it will alway be of help . nowaday we live in a fast chang world with upcom challeng . no job will replac ohter and to have diffrent knowledg and skill will alway help to increas the amount of possibilit where to work . i think that one ha to see the opportun cost and listen to one 's heart what is realli import for
