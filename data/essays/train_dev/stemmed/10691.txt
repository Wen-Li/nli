i agre with thi statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . thi seem to make sensen to comerci , becaus they tri to persu better profit from do it , i am go to make some point to anal it . first , the better advertis can deliv a good perspect to consum , make them believ that thi is the right product for them , and to have thi item will benifit either thire everyday life or promot thire health , for the compani know that peopl seek better by natur . addit , by over describ the item , make the custum can not resist the merit of the product , in turn they can sell thire item high in quantiti and can make more profir from it . forethemor , in th way the compani may rais thire reput by tell peopl that they are the best one who can provid the public the best thing which are the one that the custom need , and onc the compani suceess gain the reput , it is more easi for them to do the comerci in the futur , for examlp , the ford automabil compani is not recogn by consum , by do advertis , to introduc thire car charastist which are veri function which meet the need that peopl expect , such as the entertain founction , the power of the engin , as thire statment been recogn by public , they reach thire goal : to make profit . all in all , i would say that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are are understand , the question is that how the consum to distiguish the real qualiti with what the inform they get from the comani , the consum need make desis that what stuff is they realli need .
