i agre the idea that most advertis make product seem much better than realli are . let me talk about two reason . one reason is that product in magagin advertis seem more beauti than they realli are . for exampl when the beauti woman wore a dress in the magagin advertis the dress seem so beautih becaus of the beauti of thi woman . but when i wore the same dress the dress did not seem beauti . becaus i am not beauti . also the shape of the dress chang becaus i wa fat and the dress wa realli tini . i could not realiz that the dress wa tini becaus the beauti woman in magagin wa realli thick and beauti bodi . second reason is that product in tv advertis seem more use than they realli are . for exampl when the famou cook use the knife in tv advertis thi knife will seem more use . becaus the famou cook can realli can cook veri well . but if i or my father buy thi knife we will not use knife veri well . becaus we do not like cook and we hardli use the knife . therefor i think most advertis make product seem much better than realli are .
