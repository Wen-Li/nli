it is alway wise to have knowledg about a particular subject rather than know everyth about everi subject . we all are human and have onli a limit capac to grasp thing though there are except . we can focu clearli and effect on one particular topic at one time . focus is veri import for a better result and that can onli be possibl if we exactli know what we are go to do next . there are lot of peopl in thi whole world who are effect do research on a particular topic of their interest and therefor are expect to give product out come becaus they are veri much focus . they have enough time and energi to concentr on a particular aspect of a research also it is a veri old say that littl knowledg is a danger thing and as we know that our brain ha onli some limit capac so we can not afford to have profoud knowledg of each and everi subject and therefor thi will onli result in frustrat . also incomplet knowledg can prove to be danger and misguid also . for exampl if a chemistri student tri to teach physic then he sure be less effect in explain everi point becaus he ha onli limit knowledg of the subject , thi will be harm for the student he is addres and thi is quit possibl that someth wrong can be constru from hi teach . similarli a chemist can not perform a physic experi or vice versa and thi can result in even accid moreov if we assum that everi person know everyth about everi subject then thi will result in decreas in interact among peopl and advanc in ani field will be halt becaus we know more the number of brain work togeth , more better is the outcom of the result so in my view it is alway benefici to go more deep in a particular subject rather than have a superfici knowledg of all subject becaus in that way an individu can benefit the societi in a more effect manner and thi is also neccesori por the satisfect of the individu that he is master of atleast someth .
