in my opinion it is much better to travel in group led by a tourguid . becaus the guid is knowlegbl about the airea we visit , we save money and time , and we we get more inform about the countri we visit . first , the guid is the best person who khnow the place we like to visit . he know the trafic and the geographi of the region . so there no chanc that the visitor may get lost or go the wrong way . howev , the guid could do better job than the map . secondli , be led by a guid is a smart way to save money and time . we can imagin how much money the person would spend if he need sever taxi and buse to get the region we want to see . but travel in group with a tour guid hepl to reduc the mailag becaus the tour guid may know the best way to get the point we have the plan to see in a short time and short trafic . in addit travel in group would reduc the transport charg . thirdli , the tour guid is the best person who know about the histori of hi countri . in thi way it more benifiti to get more inform about the countri we visit .
