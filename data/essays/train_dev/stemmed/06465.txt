i agre with the given statement that modern adverstis do not reflect the real qualiti of a product . sinc advertis is known it had the purpos to get the comsum attent for a product , then caus interest for it which should end up in demand for the product and final in the action of the buy process . so it is no wonder , that a compani offer a product want it to be present in the most favour way to rais the amount of peopl buy it . in onli a veri few case the compani and it advertis compani care about the product shown as it is . from an econom point of view thi behaviour seem appar right , but from a moral point of view it is veri debat . a support role play the develop in the field of digit and technic progress . with contemporari techniqu it is possibl to refin pictur or movi clip by digit mean . so in an advertis for a lotion which proclaim clearer face skin , the pictur of the campaign protagonist 's face might have been enhanc digit . so it seem , that the lotion is effect becaus he or she ha veri clean skin in hi facial area . that the pictur doe not reflect the true situat the consum will get to know after he ha bought the product , when the adverstis ha reach hi goal - a sale . in my opinioen thi emphazis the nowaday problem that the popul - the consum - are not critic enough toward inform they receiv via televis or media in gener . they believ in what they see without a critic attitud to it . as a conclus i want to say that from my point of view , it true that advertis often make product seem better than they are , but that okay becaus the advertis act in econom purpos .
