for me , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus in thi wey we can have more possibiliy to chang my life . for exampl , i can special in one specif subject but the futur can reserv me a lot af problem and so i can costrec to chang my work and in thi case it is veri import have a big knowledg . in fact , for your privat live , a broad knowledg is more valuabl than a specialis one . a broad knoweledg can halp you in a differ situat , for exampl to tri a new job . for thi reson , we must studi a lot of subject and we must tri to have a big knowledg for all and differ situat . whith a broad knowledg you can commun with everyon about everyth . so it is veri import read mani newspap and a lot of book . but , it is import tell that in some case we can special in one specif subject . but , in these day there is a specialist for everythin and it is not to easi to find a topic to do research on . you have to knew everyth about your topic and thi is veri difficult . at the and , i think that a broad knowledg is better for all the peopl and it is veri import .
