today i 'm go to discu whether most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are or not . i agre with that statement becaus the compani that make the advert often use mani trick to make to product look better . for exampl a clothclean product . in the comerci they put a dirti shirt in the washingmashin , in the next moment they take a clean one out . how doe the custom know that it 's still the same shirt . he doe n't , to find out if it realli work he ha to buy the product , and it often doe n't work as show in the advert . the custom is often flash by an incred design without spend much thought about the effic of the product or if the product is realli worth it money . it often happen that if you by cheap product , you have problem read the handbook - if there is one at all - or when unwrap the product it sometim alreadi fall apart . but in the comerci show on tv everyth wa work fine . i made the experi that in the past more product held what wa promis in the advert and if not you could just return it . the custom here is king , as it is suppos to be . but now day more and more product are n't as good as present in the comerci , and if you tri to return the product you might have a hard time do that . some peopl even offer a great deal , but you have to pay in advanc , and in the end you do not even get a product . thi happend in berlin , where a store offer two flatscreen for the price of one . on the deliveri date the shop wa close and the boss were gone with the money . i person research on the internet befor buy an expenc product what other peopl think about it or experienc with the product , and if there is a equal or even better product that is not so promot like the other and therefor cheaper .
