broad knowledg of mani subject in comparis to one special on one specif subject . there is a famou say that `` knowledg onc gain is gain forev '' . academ play a import role in one life it prepar a base for a person to reach a highest point of attain of knowledg , but as with just a mere knowledg about anyth we cant get the successs so therefor special is need . today world is greatli move forward go for new advanc in everi aspect of life either it may be in term of health , engin , agricultur , pharmaci , commerec , manag etc or ani field . everi day advanc are come in everi field , thi chang in societi can be through chang in field of research and technolog . the scientist , engin who are experi new techniqu is through special in one singl stream . if a person do not get specialis in `` it would be like jack of all and master of none '' , but thi it is also import that a person can lead to final asses through collect all the evid for everi singl conclus a approach to other field is also desir so basic knowledg of other subject is veri necessari to reach the result . knowledg is a process of contin learn , it requir lot os skill to learn knowlegd same as dure school it is necessari to studi all subject as it interact us with worldli import thing and later on when we move to subject of our choic we move to particular stream we gain knowledg about everi basic aspect about it later on we reach to specialis subject . the concept is same as child when he come to thi world he need to take small step first to learn to run in futur . so at the end i would i like to say thatbroad knowledg of mani academ subject is essenti but to reach a hard core research or invent specialis is compulsori .
