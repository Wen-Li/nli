i rememb me surround by my friend plant tree in the backyard of our neighbourhood . those day are gone , now we do not have time to plant tree , to organ chariti market in which we sell old close to save money to decor or beautifi or commun . i total agre that young peopl do not use time in help the commun . but the question is whi ? in my opinion young peopl should be spend more time in the activ that involv the neighbourhood , just becaus we are young , and with thi i mean we are strong , with energi . .. so we are in the addecu state in our life to do thi . the problem is that nowaday life is realli differ as it use to be . today you have to be competit if you want to have success in the real world , and young peopl know that . we are concern about the lack of job so we spent our time studi and learn languag , get skill and knowledg that make us overweight the compet . and as a result we do n't have time for other leisur activ . the other point is that now the neighbourhood system is regul by the townhal , now it would be unimagin for me see small children plant tree on the street , there are law that regul the decor of a citi . so that is anoth reason whi young peopl can not help in their commun , becaus the system doe not allow them . but anyway , sometim i think we have gone to far , that nowaday we are so worri about our econom futur that we do not have time for other import activ . mayb a cure to thi busi blind will be to obliy us to take part in some social work , like a commun servic , of cours regul by the townhal . so help other might open up our eye a littl bit and we discov that sometim help peopl around you provid you more person benefit than a good job could do .
