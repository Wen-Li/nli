today , mani peopl have a car or even mani car , howev will it be the same in twenti year ? mani clue show that thing will chang in the futur becaus car are danger for the environ , oil will depletel in few year , but also becaus car are not healthi . now , everyon know that car are pollut , and as a consequ , are veri bad for the environ . scientist tri to make car which pollut less , but current it doe not exist a car which doe not pollut . i think it is veri import to be awar of the environ problem and to be concern about the global warm . the first step to reduc the global warm may be to reduc , or even to stop the use of car . there could be a solut to thi problem if scientist would build clean car , but it is not the case yet . an other import thing is that there will be a lack of oil in few year . current , with no oil a car can not work . so if scientist do not make car without oil , there will not be ani car when oil will deplet on the earth . final , car do not help peopl to be healthi and do not incit them to walk , which is in a way quit normal sinc peopl prefer to choos the easiest and most cumfort thing . while the obes keep grow , peopl use their car instead of walk , even for a short time . i thing peopl should walk more often and not use their car everi time they have to go out . thi is whi i think , and i hope , there will be fewer car in use in the twentiy year . mayb cycl could replac car , it would make peopl more sporti and healthier and it would be better for the environ .
