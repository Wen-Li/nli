i wil agre that the best way to see place is by travel in a group led by a tour guid . by do so we can get a good compani , as there are mani peopl with us , we can see more place , and we can collect more infrorm about the place , and further more mani peopl can get their live by do the travel guid job . i beliv that there are mainli three reason whi i agre travel with a group led by a tour guid . the first reason is we can have a good compani . thi is becaus mani peopl are travel with us . we can have a good talk with them , and even more we can learn some thing new from them . and the second reason is we can see more place in the tour . we did not feel lonli by that . by visit more place we can learn more informaton about them from the travel guid . he will say the histori , and import of that place . he will show us each and everi place that ha import . as a good exampl , when i and my friend visit kalahasti one of the most import place in indai , we dont know ani thing about that palc , just we got few direct about the palc like where to stay and how to go to place . when we came to place with that direct , they are veri confus we cant understand ani thing . so , we share our money and keep a guid to help us . he help us veri much by show all the place and keep on tell their import . even though we spend money , we enjoy the tour veri much . and the last reason whi , i prefer the tour guid is , they make the live with the money , the tourist gave to them . their entir famili is base on that money . thi money will encourag the peopl to do the job of travel guid . for all these reason , i prefer travel with a group , that wa led by a tour guid .
