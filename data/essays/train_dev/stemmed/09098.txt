no i do not entirli agre on the statement that group travel led by a tour guid is the best way to travel due to numer reason i have gone to mani countri both in a group with my parent and alon , in my experinc the best time i had wa with a group of teenag my age in usa becaus we were all the same age and of diffrent background , but it wasn ' entirli like a vacat where you had your peic of mind , and complet freedom to they way you want to enjoy your time . rather than wake up at 6 in the morn and go accordiong to set guidelin made by the tour guid i would chose to roam the place alon , discov numer place on my own and take the vacat as an adventur . altough move in a group can be fun , but i beliv go with a small group of mayb about 2 or 3 freind that think alik is a better option and even though go with a huge group is amaz fun , the tour guid is what spoil all the fun . tour guid usual have the whole vacat plan out with set tim make the holiday seem like anoth school day where you have a work up schedul to follow . therefor in my opnion the best way to travel would definatli be in a group but without a tour guid , becaus then you get the freedom to do you want and the liberti to make you own dicis rather than follow a tour guid . but if the tour guid is anoth person similar to the group your travel in and know the place well the tour could defintli be the best one . but go to the himalay for adventur with a tour guid would defenitli kill the adventoru feel that could be achiv by go alon . therefor the statemnt ha it pro and con dependiong on your tour guid , the group and the situat . but if all the three are perfect then the statment is defenitli justifi .
