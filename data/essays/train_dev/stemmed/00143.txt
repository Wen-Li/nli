person i completli agre with thi statement . not onli i think thi statement is true , but also that thi statement express just how success peopl should think and act . i 'm sure that one of the most import guidelin to follow in life is that if you want to make money and be success , first of all you have to spent a lot of it ! all the success peopl such as factori owner , broadcast owner or for exampl fashion label owner have alway clearli in their mind the sens of keep evolut their compani and buy or creat new one . i also think that one of the most import thing for success peopl is to enlarg and extend as much as they can do their busi in order to get more money , of cours , we all know that `` money make the world go around '' , but also for a feel of desir power ! it realli doe n't have ani sens for me to stop at what you reach . .. keep go on and further should be the right way to live our work live . i can pick up a veri well known exampl of a person which ha been realli success : silvio berlusconi . the intent is not to discuss about he 's polit idea , but to analys goal a person ha reach . a man which ha alway live follow thi principl . at the begin he start creat a new broadcast and later kept creat and develop new compani . some of these alway in the field of media , but some not , like the italian footbal team ac milan which he bought 20 year ago . anoth exampl can be seen in the american bill gate . can you imagin if he would have stop creat and invent comput softwar after the realli first version which made him gain a lot of money anyway . probabl we would be now less evolut . bill gate is that kind of exampl that make me think that thi risk , sometim innov and brave peopl are , in some occas , also veri import for the evolut of mankind itself .
