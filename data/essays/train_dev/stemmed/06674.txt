some peopl prefer to have knowledg in mani differ subject , which will stay broad . other peopl prefer to special themselv in one specif subject . from my point of view , it is better to start with have a gener knowledg in mani academ subject , and later on to spezial in one specif subject . the argument i have for thi opinion are state below . first of all , i definit believ that , until you are a student , you should follow differ class dure the whole time you are at school . the reason is that it is extrem import to have a lot of knowledg in gener cultur and an overview of the mani topic you will have the possibl to studi in a more detail way . for exampl , it is import to have a broad knowledg in biolog to first know more about life on earth and second to be abl to decid if you want to specifi yourself in that domain . otherwis , you might want to specifi yourself in biolog without even know if you like that subject . later on , when you begin to studi at the univers , i have the opinion that it is a better solut to special yourself in one specif subject rather than follow mani cours on differ subject . the reason i have thi opinion is that regularli , student know which subject they like . therefor , they should special in thi specif subject . they will get interest while go deep into the detail of thi subject . thi special will have a posit effect after finish the univers . the student who have special themselv in a specif subject will sure have good opportun to find a high-paid job they will enjoy . to conclud , i think that the best solut is to first have a broad and gener knowledg in mani academ subject to creat a good overview in the mind . then it make a lot of sens to special yourself in one specif subject you find interest , to expand your knowledg in that subject while have fun to studi it in the same time , and then be abl to find a good job in the futur .
