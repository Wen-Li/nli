i agre with the statement that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . thi is serious observ in urbanis commun than in rural comun . the possibl reason whi young peopl nowaday spend less time in help their communit could be their tight and hectic schedul . the educ system these day is realli challeng the student . it is not that easi to get through such a process of educ becaus of the sever competit among the young student . the student can not afford to leav the educ system responsibilit for the sake of commun requir . if they dont concentr much on their educ they will have to regret at the poor grade they score and the poor perform they had given . thi would affect their futur . they would n't get enough or suitabl employ opportunit . usual , a student with good educ qualif get enough opportun to lead their profession life satisfactorili . the other possibl reason could be the chang of mindset of the student these day . the present day student lack the qualiti of help natur . thi could have been result from the sever competit from their counterpart . so , student have turn selfish . they dont show concern for the develop of the fellow-stud becaus of the fear that they might overtak . for exampl , in a univers there are limit number of seat . obvious all those who are awar of the fact keep it confidanti and do not show concern for other becaus of the fear that the univers seat get exhaust . a similar kind of attitud is more serious observ among the employe of a compani . an employe is reluct toward hi co-employe or he doe n't show ani concern to help him becaus of the fear that the opther person might overtak . the reason for thi kind of behaviour among the peopl is the lack of enough number of opportun . so , for all these reason , the pesent day student neither concentr much on commun affair nor contribut for the commun welfar .
