i strongli agre with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are three advantag for thi : cost , time , and good place to visit . first , it is much cheaper to travel in a group than travel alon . in group travel , i can take discount . for instanc , if i tri to go to sydney , australia , the return ticket may cost me more than 200,000 yen . howev , if i choos the travel agent 's plan , it 'll cost me around 100,000 yen . it is ridicul to pay such a high price to travel alon . there are mani fee for trip such as accommod , meal , or entranc fee . if i join group tour , i can take discount all of them . therefor i can save a lot of money . second , i do n't have to worri about schedul . tour instructor alway know about locat , if some troubl happen , the tour instructor alway cope with to adjust the plan . and they well know about histori , so they simpli and kindli explain us about the sightse spot . if there are some troubl dure the trip alon , who can look after me ? third , i can travel a lot of good and nice place to visit . if i travel alon , it is much more difficult to arrang buse , train , or plane than join group tour . if i went for a trip by me alon , sometim i might take pain to kill time , and sometim i might about to miss the transport . howev , if i join a group tour , i do n't have to worri about it . i 'll have more time dure the trip , and that mean i can visit more good sightse spot . in conclus , i strongli agre with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
