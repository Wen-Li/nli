i would disagre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk . rather , i would prefer to describ the success as a result of be awar of one 's own potenti , which is relat with ` what peopl alreadi know and and how to do well` . peopl can take risk ani time in their life . in fact , risk take is an open ventur to all human . nevertheless , onli few could manag to be call success , becaus they knew what they would do . for instanc , it 's hard to assert that , a person who ha an outstand perform in the school but not social enough , will achiv to be a well kown stand up star . if he tri hi chanc in show busi , that would not be take risk , but rather unrat , sinc the result would be catastroph . if that student develop a brand new idea in her or hi relat subject , that would again not be risk take or tri new thing . the project or the idea of a person deriv from hi or her capac . consid the hyper rich peopl and inventor , success stori are creat and these are given as exampl to the public . howev , there is no clear prescript of be success that can be appli to all peopl . success peopl are the peopl who could be abl reach the knowledg of be their potenti . as in our illustr , the student in the school , be awar of hi potenti in studi , is more close to be succes .
