i think that both understand idea and learn fact are equal import for a student , but if i were forc to choos between the option i would say that understand idea and concept is more import than learn a list of fact . the comprehens of the idea that give the mean to a fact will enabl the student to understand all the fact that are base on that same idea . for exampl : teacher teach the children how to add number by explain them how addit work , not by tell them that 2 + 2 = 4 , that 2 + 3 = 5 and so on . when a child ha understood the idea and the concept of addit he 'll be abl to make all sort of addit . what i realli mean to say is that the understand of a concept will lead you to the full comprehens of sever fact of the same kind . on the other hand i can not avoid to notic that we face a big risk in focus too much on idea and concept : the risk of leav out the realiti . realiti is veri import becaus it 's the point we tend to : all idea and concept are studi to give reason on thing we 've seen in our experi , if we do not refer to realiti we would be just speak about noth , our talk would be onli specul which is not useful to us . i would say that we need a balanc between the two thing , becaus they are both import to the student : i think that a good method of make them understand a theori or a concept would be give them exampl , becaus talk about experi is effec in make them realiz what concept we are deal with . on the other hand i think that when a teacher talk about a specif fact he should alway say what is the idea that stay behind that fact so that he woul obtain two import result : fistli the student would fulli understand the fact in it implic , caus , consequ ( for exampl whi a war wa declar , what consequ it had . . ) and secondli the student would be abl to understand mani fact of the same kind becaus they may recogn the same idea behind other fact .
