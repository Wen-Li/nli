in my opinion is imposs to theoret defin whether it is better to manag sever academ subject or to go more in depth with just one subject . inde , it realli depend on the field you will appli thi academ knowledg to . i think i 'm in an ideal posit to give some exampl of differ situat to which the two differ approach appli . so far , in fact , i had two veri differ work experi , the first one as a control in a multin compani and the second ( and current ) one as a manag consult . on the one hand , dure my first work experi as a control i had to get a deep understand of all the account principl that regul the activ of the financ depart of my compani . it wa a realli tough experi becaus i had to get familiar with a lot of veri specif and technic subject sinc otherwis the qualiti of my work might have been affect . i had to develop a veri good memori to rememb all the detail typic of thi kind of field . on the other hand , dure my current work experi as a manag consult i need to be more flexibl than spcializ , so that now i 'm familiar with a huge varieti of subject . i work , in fact , in sever differ industri - such as automot , consum good and bank - and in veri differ compani ' function - like for instanc market , human resourc and financ . given that i usual work on veri short project , i alway need to get familiar with the context of a project in a short period of time , which mean that i need to have at least a gener background on that particular field . thi usual allow me to work on the project without necessarli get a veri deep understand of how the relat inustry/funct work . to conclud , i would say that i gener prefer deal with mani differ subject rather than special myself . nevertheless i think , as my work experi show , that there alway could be situat where you also need to get a specialist knowledg .
