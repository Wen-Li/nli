today , advertis are everywher . we are bomb by them in almost everi part of our day : while we are read newspap or magazin , watch at tv , listen to radio , or just walk in citi , that are sometim complet cover by them . they are so spread that we often difficulti notic them , caus we consid them as a normal part of a page , or just a paus in a tv program . so , to catch our attent , today advertis tend to be realli exager , sometim even shoke . infact a societi must to send us a messag that is fondament for it life : that hi product or servic is good , or howev realli better in comparison with the one made by the concurr , and that we need absolut it . there is no need to mention that it 's not true : mostli the product avail on the market are actual on the same level , not so better or worst respect the other . therefor what we need in realiti is just a realli littl part of what we think we need , even if , today , peopl have usual no awer of that , and have the tendenc to consid everyth necessari : it is exactli the aim of the societi who sold them all that product . thu , if a societi must convinc us in everi way to spend our money for what they are sell to surviv and develop , they wo n't consid immor to hide some characterist we should now , or even to state someth realli wrong about the product . a custom need not to trust advertis almost ever , and to go beyond what we listen to or see to understand the realli qualiti of the good or servic . and we should alway wonder if we realli need a new kind of pen , if what we are use it 's perfect for itself .
