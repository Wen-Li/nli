i potenti disagre with the statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . first , what i feel is that it 's not the age which determin the level of pleasur or enjoy in life . it 's basic our attitud toward life which enabl us to take the maximum out of what life ha to offer . our outlook toward life is the determin factor for the paramet that we set for enjoy life . secondli , it a matter of committ and percept that win us point in the game of life . for exampl , an old person have an optimist approach toward everth what life ha to offer would rather enjoy stressless leisur even sit in the garden or mayb garden . in contrast to thi a young man have more than half of hi life to live could be sit on a chair in the same veri garden and curs hi fate for provid hinder in hi path to success . thirdli , it may be assum that the younger part of life or the youth age demand more of you but it doe n't mean that a young man simpli can not enjoy hi life becaus he is ha more work / assing to complet . it 's a function of mind game that determin individu percept and it is thi percept that fuel us to look toward life in a differ plain altogeth . i have seen old peopl like my grandmoth enjoy trek and mountain . histori , like all other exampl incorpor one in these term too . we 've had scientist who were old enough to be count out as non-excit in gener view but but activ enough to invent some of the most excit thing on earth . lastli , the fact that the bodi may be old enough but it is our mind and will power that combin togeth to give us a rush of adrenalin even at the age of 70 .
