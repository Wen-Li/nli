we live in an age where inform is exchang between contin on the click of a mous , where geographi ha ceas to defin distanc . what i tri to mean is that with globalis come competit . accord to me , to stay ahead in thi highli competit race one ha to excel or master in whatev academ field one may be . thi masteri of an academ subject can onli be attain by special in that particular subject rather than have onli a broad knowledg about variou relat subject . the old clich `` jack of all trade but master of none '' doe not appeal much to me . i would like to elucid my theori of special in a particular subject is better than have knowledg of variou academ subject by cite a practic exampl . obvious a compani would prefer a man with a master degre in chemic engin to anoth man appli for the same job but with a diploma in chemic engin and a diploma in biolog engin . even if the compani would employ the latter for hi skill in both chemistri as well as biolog he would definitli be given a post subordin to that of the former & a pay packag which would be lesser than the former . howev if the man with the diploma would hold a degre in say a manag cours and if the compani would also requir the manageri skill at the same time then it would be a differ question all togeth . to sum it up i would say that a special cours in today world is given a higher prioriti in the competit market .
