now a day , the number of car in use is veri larg and mani peopl believ that the next twenti year wouldnt be ani differnet . i share the same opinoin and think that street are go to be overcrowd with car in the next twenti year unless a solut is found . thi non-stop increas in the number of car be use is due to mani reason . firstli , car compani are decreas the car cost signifcantli and make their prduct more attract to consum , which encourag peopl to buy new car more often and have mutipl car for each famili . thi would result in an increa in the number of car . secondli , mani bank are offer loan to peopl which help in provid them with the money need to buy new car . thu , peopl who do not have car now aday due to money issu , will have enough money to buy them in the next few yearss . thirdli , with all the support from the bank and car compani , more car are go to be in use as the popul increas rapidlli . the young gener would find it veri easi to afford to have their own privat car and the same would appli for the next come gener . morov , the gover also play a veri import part in thi increas . for instanc , if a countri 's rule state that drive for 16 year-old is allow , then the number of peopl use car would increas result in crowd street . also , if the gverment doesnt inforc sale and registertaion tax on car then driver would be encourg to buy extra car for their famili . in adsiton , the cost of car fuel is also signific in restrict the nuber of car use . in my opinion , the number of car in use after twenti year would be great than that use today and if no aproperi solut are enforc , then the crowd street would be anoth big problem everyon should be envolv in .
