i complet agre with the statement . accord to me , success can not be acheiv by a particular formula or a so call tri and test method . to becom success you need to have your own new or deriv set of idea that you think will make you success . if you have to acheiv great success you have to come up with new idea otherwis you will lose or at the maximum be moder success . for eg. we all know about the `` easi '' group which is head by mr. stelio . when he tri to ventur in cruis busi there were preset notion and fix rule like the ship had to be alway be on sea and all the luxuri of life were to be enjoy there . moreov , the averag age of cruis goer wa in 50 's . stelio complet revamp thi strategi and brought hi idea . hi prime area of think wa that the cruis should attract younger peopl . so he develop hi own way by bring in new concept of low cost travel and also halt at prime locat . the cruis took stop at place like mont carlo dure f-1 race which is a veri expens place to stay . thu it can be said that stelio did ventur into risk and tri new thing in which he wa success . if you to surviv in the competit world of today you need to tri new thing becaus there are larg number of peopl who are goin to do the same old thing that they know . ventur into risk is other major aspect of be success . you have to take calcul risk if you have to surviv the competit . for eg l n mittal formerli the chairman of mittal steel took a calcul risk by weigh hi option and did a bid to take over anoth steel major arcelor . he did becam success in hi ventur and now run the biggest steel make compani arcelor mittal . so if you have to be success in ani field you would have to break the stereotyp and find a path for yourself that you feel is go to make you success
