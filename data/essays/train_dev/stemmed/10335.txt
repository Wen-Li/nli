the statment affirm that in twenti year will be fewer car that there are today . agre or do not agre with that statement it is not a matter of mere opinion but a matter of what will be , for the next twenti year , the goal of the govern and their popul , and whi not the privat compani . on one side , it could be possibl to agre with the statement if we think that in the next twenti year all the state with big popul will be abl to offer other secur and massiv mean for transport , for exampl . in that case , and onli in that case , it could be possibl to begin think in fewer car in twenti year from now . that possibl impli that govern will have at least to strong compromis . one would be with it own popul , tri to offer them differ a effect mean of tranport for all of them . the second compromis would be with the environ , tri to respect not onli the well-known kyoto protocol but , of cours , tri to avoid ani kind of damag to the environ due to a pollut problem but on the other side , we can also view the coin by the other face . even if the technolog can be improv dure the next twenti year , it will be veri difficult that normal peopl can reach all the advanc . in that case , in the non develop countri and mayb in mani develop countri , the car could keep their own place as the main mean of transport . it is not too difficult to think about the implement of the chang in the case of africa , the poorest contin of the world . even in europ could not be possibl to eras or to decreas the number of car in the next twenti year . there are mani countri with problem in that particular area that have been tri to solv them , such as itali , spain and franc . .. and they fail . in latin america , and i think also in north america , a car is a symbol of power and of prestig . in that case i think it could be difficult the chang of mind for the next twenti year . to all the thing i point out i must add the fact that daili all car compani are produc new model of car , faster and luxuri , but not cheapest , to improv and to renew the old model . tokyo motorshow ... could be a good exampl of thi . to sum up , i think either possibl are open for the discuss and even in my case i am not sure about which one could be the best to agre with that . but in my particular way , if i wa ask to see my futur ... i would like to ha a car .
