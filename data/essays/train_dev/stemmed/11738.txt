`` everybodi back to the bu pleas ! '' the voic of the tourguid wa as distress as the shrill sound of my alarm clock on a monday morn . we had had onli five minut to look at the exibit apollo rocket , when we were call back thi way , off to the next sight . the short drive wa made unpleas by the overli obes neighbor , who spill into my seat and press me against the glass of the window . thi is , how i rememb my trip to cape canever in florida on a guid tour , one of a group of 24 tourist . not an enjoy memori . some peopl like to travel that way . i think that travel in a group led by a guid is almost a guarante for a regrett experi . first of all , you have to do what the guid tell you . the plan were made under consider of the special logist and econom that a group bring with it , by peopl you do n't know . on a trip to spain i took with a group , i wa not abl to visit a church i had read about and which interest me . instead i had to go to a so-cal `` spanish even '' ( in spain ! ) to see mediocr flamenco danc and eat less-than-great paella . then , of cours , you are constrain by the time tabl that wa set for the group . you can not linger around a sight that fascin you . no , you have to rush off , in order to check off anoth item the agenda . a friend of mine told me how he wa rush through the tower of london by hi tour guid , although he realli want to spend more time there to connect with the circumst of the prison which were onc held there . and , abov all , you do n't chose your travel companion . the behaviour of other group member is sometim the straw that break the camel back . the perfect exampl herefor is mayb the movi `` train , plain and automobil '' . all thi should make it clear , that it is better to travel with peopl one know and like . and to make one own 's plan .
