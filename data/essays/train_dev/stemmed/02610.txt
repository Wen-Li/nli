there are two differ aspect which make the question difficult to answer if it is better to have broad knowledg or to special in one specit subject . at first if you studi undergradu it is neccesari to get a lot of inform from diffrent academ subject . becaus you do not know anyth about that subject you studi and so you have to lern a lot . you have to learn practic thing like how to prepar an essay or how do i have to work out my letter for the proffesor or mayb how can i regestrad me in the system at the univers . also you have to learn a lot of stuff to get the abil to talk with someon around your topic . it is necessari to know the topic . i will give an exampl if you are studi architectur you have to know how to build a hous if you do not know thi it make no senc to learn other thing like interior design . so if you do not kmow basic you can not go on futher . therfor i found it veri import to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . second if you are a graduat student who know the pasic he can consentrad on speciff subject . mayb for interrior design or special concret . in the upper class i would say you have to specifi your topic . howev at the end i have to say that it give no genurali answer on thi question . it depens on you life situat .
