it is wide believ that successful peopl tri new thing and take risk instead of concentr on someth they alreadi know veri well . on the one hand peopl who want to be success should reli on their skill they alreadi have . it is veri import to take an advantag of the qualiti a person alreadi ha , so that thi person is sure to do the right thing , which mean that the person is self-confid . but on the other hand a rigid behavior could influenc the work in a neg way . for exampl it is veri import for manag who run their own busi to stay flexibl so that they can react to everi chang of the custom choic . the custom choic could chang everi day , so the manag ha to adapt hi procut in order be successful . otherwis he will not sell enough product . a good exampl could be advertis . you must have new idea to impress the peopl see yor advertis in order to push their attent to your product . sometim it is also essenti to take ani risk in order to improv your busi , becaus it could be a chanc to multipli your success . of cours such decis are veri difficult and you have to think about them veri care . all in all i think that it is a big advantag if a person ha enough courag to take risk or to tri someth new becaus in most case it is worth it . in spite of short-term neg impact it is import to be innov in order to be a successful person . rigid behaviour caus disadvantag in nearli everi part of life . in my opinion it might be helpful to stick to the well-practis skill a person ha , but everyon can improv these skill and learn new think in order to achiev hi aim . that is whi i think that thi statement is right .
