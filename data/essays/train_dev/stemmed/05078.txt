as i am studi busi manag at the univers in bayreuth i am special on one specif academ subject . but mani peopl ask me what i would do if i do not get a job in a compani or need knowledg of anoth subject to fullfil a new job . so is it better to have a broad knowleg of academ subject than to special in a specif one ? well , i do not think so . of cours , if you have a broad knowledg of differ thing you are not so much restrict to a certain job . you might know a lot of thing other peopl might not know . nevertheless , what kind of job will you get ? mayb you are abl to work for a lot of differ compani or do someth on your own but the job you can get will alway be in a lower posit as you are miss the necessari background inform to fullfil the complet rang of task of thi job . one might say that if you are special on a certain topic it is hard to get anoth job . thi might be true , but whi should you even look for anoth job ? you are specialis on your subject becaus you think it is the best for you and you want to spend your lifetim with a job work in thi special segment . if you have enough knowleg in your subject you will soon reach a higher posit as you have all the necessari background knowlegd to fullfil your entir task . peopl who know more about their segment they are work in have more success and therefor live a happier life . as arthur lassen said : `` noth will make you happier than to succeed in the thing you love . '' as a conclus one ha to say that special knowledg will help you much more to find an apropri job . even if a broad knowledg could help you in differ part of your life , know more about your subject and go below the surfac will lead to much more success and mayb even happy .
