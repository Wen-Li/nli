educ is the most import thing in our modern societi - someon with good skill have much more opportun to succeed in hi profession life than someon with low skill or educ . the main goal of school is to well-train young gener in order for them to adapt and improv our fast progress societi . there are mainli two way of educ : one way that allow student to understand by themselv theori , concept or idea by differ mean such as scientif experi or self think and a second way that provid to them all teach without real understand . someon who realli understand the root of thing is better train as can shape thing base on the fundament knowlegd he ha . on the contrari , a student who onli learn the fact and doe not understand the principl or concept will at ani time appli what he ha learnt but will be ineffici in a gener case . thi last can never shape thing or invent new thing as he doe not have the capabl of think by himself . howev , thank to the new technolog , it seem sometim even not necessari to understand concept to accomod in thi societi . mani peopl who are train - in the new scienc & technolog like the internet , without have the fundament knowledg , are as good as those who spend time on get the real concept . it seem useless to get fundament knowledg and peopl are live and succed in their work base on their educ of learn onli the fact . to conclud , we think that understand the real concept of main subject is import and requir but student can not master all concept , which will not prevent them from be good student .
