in my opinion , i agre with thi statement becaus i believ that understand the whole context of an specif topic , in other word , captur the idea and concept , would allow a student to develop a better mean of what he is learn which could be reinforc with the differ fact describ dure the cours . for exampl , when i wa a attend class at univers , i alway tri to pay more attent to the main idea the professor wa tri to explain , which doe not mean that i found fact less import , but in my case , i knew that in order to understand and facilit my studi for an exam , it would better if i could develop the topic think in a differ way and not just memor each word he said or each fact state . nevertheless , fact would help me have more specif detail about the class but if i have just learn fact or be more interest in them than in concept probabl i would forget those fact faster and may have more problem in answer question that were not ask dure the class becaus i did not understand what the main idea wa about or what the professor wa tri to teach us . anoth import exampl whi i am convinc idea and concept worth more than fact is relat with the way we understand how a singular topic in real life is be develop . for instanc , most student have a knowledg on how a countri 's economi work or whi it is import to have account in a compani without need to studi econom or financ just by understand the concept of free market and how import financ are for compani to succeed . student are go to have a better knowledg of what they are learn if teacher put mpre emphasi on the idea and concept rather than fact .
