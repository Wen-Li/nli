i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is group tour led by a guid . of cours , group tour can give sever benefit : prove some good inform , make friend with peopel with differ background , etc . but as far as i am concern , i believ that it is best to travel alon or travel with a few friend . first of all , i like organ tour schedul and prepar for travel . i search good inform about my tour in the web site . we can have a lot of valuabl inform about cheap price hotel , afford rent car , or wonder sightse . in contrast , a group tour usus make me be veri passiv . i do n't like be passiv . secondli , i feel more free and comfort when i prepar for my own travel . group travel usus provid rigid time schedul and travel itineri . but i enjoy freeli choos our schedul and place to visit . our schedul alway can be adjust base on our situat . thridli , i love drive my car when i make a trip to histor site , park and mountaint with beautifu scenari , or cutting-edgi citi such as new york , l.a . in contrast , i can not drive car when i becom a member of group tour guid by a tour guid . drive car , especi in the highway , make me feel relax and happi . final , i do n't think that group tour provid cheap price . it usual need a lot of money to particip in group travel . i believ , prepar our own travel can help us save a lot of money . to sum up , group tour is not best option for me becaus it make me feel more passiv , less freee , and veri often the price is so expens . i prefer travel base on my own schedul and plan .
