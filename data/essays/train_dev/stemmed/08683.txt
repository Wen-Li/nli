can it be that peopl turn to use horess and camal again for transport ? i dont think soo , peopl over time are be better and better in discoviri , and the day will come when they start use airship and viecl that will be abl to fli . i agre that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today becaus of the divlop in discoviri , and the spread of air transport . in everi new gener there are new mind and new peopl that think about life in a differ way . with all the discoviri that have been done and the new mind whicj are comin to the world they will sure discov a new way of transport that will make car dissappear . nowaday air craft and air transportaion is the largist kind of transport in the world , and with all thi spread in thi kind of transport and the knoledg in it are make car a way of transport that will not last . therefor , i think that car woud'nt last and there will be some other way to move from some place to anoth in less time and less affort .
