i agre or desagre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , depend on the size of the group . i desagre if the group is so big . i had the opportun to travel with a big group to a countri that nobodi knew befor . it wa a veri bad experi becaus the tour guid wa in troubl becaus he wa respons for everybodi and dure the travel some got lost . some want to spend more time look at other thing and some want to take pictur and got lost , etc . so , i do n't recommend travel with big group . instead , i agre that the best way to travel is in a small group led by a tour guid if it is consid the follow : first , the group ha not to have more than ten peopl . in thi way , the group can be well manag accord to the cirscunst . for exampl , you can easili rent a van to visit some other place that are not in the itinerari or you can plan a parti dure the night . second , the peopl that are travel togeth need to have almost the same age in order to have fun . it is not easi when you are travel with old peopl that you can hurt with a simpl nois or with anyth that they do n't like . and third , do n't let the tour guid to take all the control over the itinerari becaus they can be like a father carri littl children . i have been see tour guid that do n't give ani flexibl to the group . be in other countri and other cultur the group want to experi the new environ , especi at night if they want to have a parti , and not have someon to tell yor `` time to go to bed '' .
