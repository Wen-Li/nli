gone are the day when peopl use to say `` jack of all trade and master of none '' . today in thi competit era , the time ha come when we should rephras thi popular say that `` jack of all trade becom the master . '' i feel that a person have wider knowledg succe in life . although special is need to excel in certain field but in the develop societi where everyon is busi in the race of cat and dog , one ha to excel in everi field . we can take the exampl of so mani scientif experi which ha led to a new discoveri . even a simpl biolog experi requir the effort of peopl from differ field such as chemist and physicist . had there been no chemist to provid chemic and reagent for purifi dna and had there not been ani physicist to develop machineri for us , we would not have sequenc the genet materi in us , and the use of these requir the knowledg of these area . the variou exam such as the one i am give also make us realis that it is better to have broader knowldg of mani academ subject . also , i feel that have a broader knowledg increas the learn and applic power . we can think bigger and put in our vast knowledg to do great innov . we should have gener studi about the cultur and histori even if we studi scienc . in variou intervew and examin , the questionairr are not from what we have learn specif but about our knowledg and i feel it good too becaus thi can onli tell how we know about thing happen around us . broader knowledg not onli help us lead a success life but also make us an improv human be . it help us in better understand and thu lead a better life .
