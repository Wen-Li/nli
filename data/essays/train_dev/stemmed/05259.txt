there ha been mani controversi go on regard whether it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i strongli believ that a person should have broad knowledg of variou academ subject rather than special knowledg . first of all , have broad knowledg allow an individu to becom `` better '' than a person who special in one specif subject . what i mean by better is that the person will have more opportun to get a good job and have a better life , becaus after all , what a compani and the societi look for in a person is how round an individu is . the broader a person 's knowledg is , the more an individu is consid round . for exampl , my father who is a ceo of hi own compani onc said that a compani look for a person who is round rather than a perosn who is good in one specif area . when he choos new worker for hi compani , he alway see if a person ha broad knowledg or not . hi rational behind thi is that if a person is more round , then the individu will be abl to work in mani differ area , which bring up the effici of the compani as a whole . not onli that , but a round person is usual more experienc with variou thing . round person ha vast knowledg which reflect that the individu must have had experienc mani aspect of life . howev , if a person is special in one detail subject , then it reflect that a person ha narrow mind and is less experienc than the round person is . for exampl , a friend of mine who ha broad knowledg is more familiar with all the differ kind of event happen . howev , anoth friend of mine who is special in one speicif subject is narrow mind and unfamiliar with subject that he did not special . thu , the extent of the knowledg portray 's a person 's experi in life . lastli , a person who ha broad knowledg is more open mind than the special person is . a good exampl is my mother who ha endless knowledg about everyth . everytim i talk to her , i realiz that she is veri liber and is open mind . howev , my father who special in chines cultur in univers , ha a veri conserv and close mind about all the event becaus he simpli doe not have broad experi . i person think be open and liber is crucial in current societi , becaus the new gener of peopl are gener welcom chang and are open as well , and in these day it is import to fit in the societi in order to surviv . to summar , i advoc the point that a person should have broad knowledg of mani differ academ subject . a korean proverb state `` dig one well is hard , but dig mani differ well with same depth as that of dig one well is harder , '' which mean , an individu should challeng oneself by dig variou well , also mean that a person should have broadd knowledg of mani differ subject .
