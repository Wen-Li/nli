nowaday while some peopl like to travel in a group led by a tour guid , other like to travel alon . both of them have their own advantag and disadvantag . in my experi , i agre with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tuor guid for sever reason . first , travel in a group led by a tour guid can help me manag my time effici . a guid may know well the famou site and place which visitor want to go and he can let me know about that within a short time . for exampl , when i travel in florida a few year ago , at that time i did not know where to go and what to do . howev , my aunt introduc her friend who had a guid job . she kindli offer me ride and comfor place to relax as well as let me know the most famou place such as disney world or sea world . thank to her , i did save my time of sightse and spend my free time effici . second , travel in a group led by a tour is more enjoy than travel alon for me . in a group , there are mani peopl from differ local or countri . with these peopl , i can share a lot of valuabl nformat and can listen to their uniqu experi . it is a kind of interest experi for my life . when i wa a colleg student , i travel in canada . in a group , i made some friend there , and still we keep in contact through email . last , travel in a group led by a tour guid can enabl me to save money . he can tell me about inform about the new countri such as how to spend money properli . if i do not know the local live style , i might spend more money than i would expect . to conclud , travel alon or travel in a group led by a tour guid have both benifit and drawback . howev , i agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid sinc it can help me make a plan more effici and save money and it is more excit for me .
