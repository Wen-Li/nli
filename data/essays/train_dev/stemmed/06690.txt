in my oppinion , these both suggest : understand idea and concept , and learn from fact . becaus these both teach peopl a idea about common sens in the world . and some of the common sens or common knowledg ca n't be learn by own experi . for exampl , peopl often learn better behavior in their life through the religion . becaus some of the idea that religion teach peopl can not be figur out by one 's own wisdom . and for the improv of their life and spiritu health , peopl often will to learn more about their religion . besid thi reason , a lot of those belief , idea that had been found by mankind in the histori , alway had begun from the curios about somebodi els 's idea . for exampl , the famou scientist galileo could prove the truth , ' the earth is spine around the sun ' , indirectli by the idea base on roman cathol ; which he argu to . hi conclus about univers came from hi own experi about the fact . but if he could n't understand the concept of the univers and idea which peopl befor galileo believ , he could n't take ani chanc to make arguement . just like the exempl show abov , to learn someth from fact , we basic need to have some basic knowledg which had alreadi been set by somebodi els . through the histori , the idea and peopl ' creativ ha been grow upon anoth . that show the import conclus ; peopl learn from the idea befor they prove the truth by their own fact . along with thi fact , we are live in the world that requir the proof ; we have to prove thing that we have learn . if we know onli the knowledg which learn from fact and we ca n't prove it . then our knowledg becom just one 's stereotyp method with our ani reason in the public . therefor , if we do not understand the idea and concept which is gener prove as truth by somebodi . we ca n't expect our fact that learn from experi to be gener truth . in conclus , to learn or to prove new thing learn from our life we have to know about old concept too . caus th
