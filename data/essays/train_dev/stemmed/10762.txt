in my opinion the statement is true . if you think about it you will recogn that the risk of fail might be veri high but if you want to be success you have to take a risk . if you just do not tri you might regret it later . take madonna as exampl . she wa one of the first woman in music busi who appeard on video not wear much . peopl were not use to that way of present themselv and there were mani discuss about it . mani want to permit the video and her music . there were a lot of neg articl in the world 's press but it also brought her a lot of attent which wa , by the way both , posit and neg . but that wa not the onli thing she tri . she also sang about topic like abort which were tabu at that time . in the end that is what made her famou besid her music . she tri out new thing and risk a lot . she could have fail becaus you never know if peopl are readi for it or not but she succeed . now she is not onli one of the most famou musican of all time but she also earn a lot of money . mayb thi is not a typic exmapl if you compar it to peopl with innov busi idea like henri ford but in my opinion it fit veri well with the topic anyway . if she had not tri she might be a well-known artist by now as well but she would probabl be one out of mani and not the one . all in all everyon ha to decid for him or herself weather he want success or weather he want secur and be one of mani .
