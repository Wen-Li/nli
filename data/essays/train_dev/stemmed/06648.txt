in ordinari life , we often have to face delimmat choic , just as the statement give rise to a debat over whether the understand of idea and concept is more import than learn fact . some peopl assert that understand idea and concerpt are more import for student , while other peopl believ that learn fact is more benefit to student . as a matter of fact , thi issu is a complex and a controversi one . differ person will have their differ choic due to their distinct background . in my opinion , there is not a universi answer to thi question , and which choce take preced may quit depend on the specif situat . the final decis , nevertheless , should reli on a case - by-cas analysi . as far as i am concenrn , howev , i agre that learn fact is more import . i would like to provid evid and give reason to suport my choic . the first argument that can be present to support my option is that real knowledg come for practic . i can think that there is not a better exampl of the idea than the obviou fact that learn swim must make practic . onli understand idea and concept can not grasp swim . to illustr , that chemic experi make student to learn chemistri knoweledg more better . although that real skill come from learn fact is an impor aspect , it is not the onli explan for me to choos the statement that learn fact is more use . the increas valu place on the idea that fact are the deep understand to the idea and concept . in addit , accord to my person and experi , as well as common sens , i believ that learn fact is a better choic for student . to be sure , it may be true that understand idea and concept are use in some condict . howev , thi is not fuffici to support to claim that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is too weak to strengthen the argument . in cloclus , base on the abov mention reason , which sometim correl with each other to make part of a larger unit , thu becom more convinc than each singl one of them . so we can firmli to say learn fact is more import .
