whether the young or the old enjoy life more than the other depend on how one would defin `` enjoy life '' . if i keep in mind the physic endur of the bodi at young age and the old age , i am of the opinion that the young have more option to tri out new activit therebi lead a more enjoy life . first reason for my view is that at old age the bodi doe not allow a person do pursu an activ that he/sh may be veri fond off at young age . for exampl , at a young age a person can tri activ rang from scuba-div or sky dive to glass paint or even etch . at a young age if there is inclin to be involv in an activ there would be no restrict . howev as old age draw near , the bodili restrict may not allow the older peopl to be abl to be involv themselv with the same activ as the young peopl . an activitiy like glass paint might sound like an activ veri much possibl at old age , howev , those inflict with arthirit at old age will not be abl to pursu an simpl activ such as thi . so a enjoy activ like glass paint which be possibl at young age would no longer be possibl for the elderli . anoth exampl would be of a sport . a person , who at a young age wa veri passion about basketbal or squash may no longer be abl to play that sport as hi bodi would not allow him/her to do so . thi would lead to less opportun avail to lead an enjoy life . anoth reason for my view is that , with the fast pace life of today there are much more option avail to our gener than what wa avail to our grandpar . so an activ like long walk which would be consid a enjoy activ in past may not be consid one ani longer . admittedli , older peopl do enjoy the comfort of live a more relax life with less responsibilit , which might be fun in itself . howev , i am still be of the opinion that young peopl enjoy life more than the older peopl . in sum i would agre that defint of `` enjoy life '' may vari to the young and the old but keep in mind the veri fact that the young are abl to do what the older peopl do and also a lot more , they defin have more option availbl to enjoy life and thu lead a more excit life and enjoy life .
