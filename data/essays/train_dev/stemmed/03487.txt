well , accord to me it depend on the real time situat . sometim it better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than special in one subject . for exampl to make a live a person should be abl to adapt himself in ani kind of work atmospher . suppos , mr.x ha done hi graduat in say , chemic engin , it does'nt guarnte him a job in chemic or ani relat industri caus it hard to get a job in the chemic industri as the number of employe requir are fewer compar to the it industri . if mr.x ha learnt basic about comput , which is usual thought in undergradu school , then hi chanc of get a job in a it industri is more compar to chemic . it industri do requir chemic engin to deal with the client relat to chemic background and he can do a great job in understand the problem of the client . so , hi broad knowledg about all hi academ subject can get him a job . one more exampl , let talk about a paediatrician , a person ( doctor ) special to treat children problem . well he is much more familiar to diseas of a child than a grown up . suppos , he is travel in a train , and suddenli there 's some problem to an accompan passeng who is a grown up/eld person . as a doctor hi duti is to look at the problem of the person rather than say i 'm a child specialist . at thi instanc of time a broad knowledg on hi academ subject could help give a immedi initi remedi to the person befor he is taken to a hospit . at time you need to have special in one specif subject rather than have broad knowledg about all hi academ subject . for exampl a person special in nuclear engin and work in a nuclear power plant . well , it a must to have a special in that one subject subject rather than have a broad knowledg about hi other academ subject like sugar technolog , petroleum engg .. , etc. , becaus he is respons for the process go on in the plant , and ani problem can caus great havoc . at thi situat it worth to have a special in one subject . i , conclud by say that it realli depend on the job , the atmospher one is work into have special in one subject or to have broad knowledg of mani subject .
