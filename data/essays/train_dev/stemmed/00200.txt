firstev , it is import to remind that , usuali , successful peopl are peopl with habil and knowledg in specif field . usuali , the success doe n't come alon . you succeed becaus you have dare thing , which mean gener that you took risk . success peopl usuali get money from their success , and we could think thi is crazi to take other risk becaus you may loos the money you won . to my mind success peopl are peopl who like risk , and who are better under pressur . as an exampl i will talk about my girlfriend 's granfath . he is a decor and he lost all hi money and everyth he made up sever year ago . but while some peopl would n't know what to do , he restart everyth from the begin , to find success again and that 's what he did . i think most of success peopl are veri self confid peopl , and that 's whi they 're stronger than the other , becaus if they fall , they can also rebuild what ha been destroy . otherwis , tri new thing and take risk while you succeed may appear as realli crazi . would n't it be better to take advantag of what you won , instead of risk to lose it ? i think the best to do , when you are a success peopl , is to tri new thing but take the less risk as possibl ; inde , even if you are success one time , may be next time you wo n't and you will loos everyth . but in the opposit , if you do n't take risk in your life , you may never success or at least , you may spend a veri bore life . that 's whi a certain dose of risk ha to be taken , even if you are success . tri new thing open up your mind , wherea go on to do onli what you know how to do well doe n't .
