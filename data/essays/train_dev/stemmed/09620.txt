i absolut agre that ` most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are . ' i confront the bundl of advertis on the tv , radio , bu , and even along the wall and on the road . the food in the advertis loosk more elig , so i feel that i have to eat that . how about the facial cosmet ? it effect is signific so that i ca n't resist to tri it . the advertis of diet is incred . it show even the pictur of the ` befor ' and ` after ' use their product . is it real ? i do n't think so . the answer is clear if you use those product . i tri food , cosmet , and ` incred ' diet drug . noth is like the advertis . i mean that the food doe n't tast great for me to make a smile , and the cosmet that i chose among the advertis did n't give my face enough moistur . as for the drug for diet , it realli did not lost my weight . far from my experi , the peopl around me and my neighbor gave the similar experi to me . there is no big chang such as the advertis . even the surfac of the packag is n't like the content in the view of color or shape . how shame on them ! i 'm so sensit consum to tri the weight of the purchas on the scale . it did n't match exactli . i show the case of exagger advertis base on my own experi . in order consum ' to make a right decis , it is import to show the way the product are as well as to deliv the consum ' report to the public .
