in my view , while one may say that peopl in gener do not give enought time to help their commun , i do not think that young peopl do not help enought . the first reason for my view is simpli that i know mani young peopl who care a lot . some of them would help directli their commun , by spend time with older , or take care of adult ' children . some other would even make bigger thing to help peopl in the world . for exampl , i have a friend who left franc last year , to work as a benevol to build a school in a certain countri in africa . the second reason for my view is that we had never seen young peopl care and particip thi much befor . in the last presidenti elect in franc in 2002 , when jean-mari le pen , who is known to have racist and seggreg opinion , reach the second phase of the elect , the first group who demonstr in the street to show it reluct of see such a man becom the presid wa a group of student and some teenag from highschool . i believ thi would have never happen befor . final , i think it is import to say that young peopl do not have alway the possibl to show that they care . inde , young peopl do not win much money , if ani at all . they are at an age where they have to give prioriti to their studi , or have just start a job which can be a veri difficult period . becaus of all thi reason , i think that even if some peopl think it is too low , the young peopl are help commun larg enought . to sum up , i believ that while it is sometim difficult for young peopl to find the time and the money to help commun , they are care enought , special compar with the past . accord to me , young peopl more and more understand that they are crucial actor of the commun .
