some peopl say that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact , on the other hand someon say that for a student is more import to learn fact and not to understand idea and concept . the fisrt group may give some reason to support their idea , becaus fact can be consid a logic consegu of the idea and the concept , and if a student understand the idea and the concept he can learn fact easyli and quicklier . the second say that for a student is more import to learn a fact and not to understand idea and concept , becaus the histori is do by the fact and not by the idea or the concept . as far as i 'm concern , i perfectli agre with rason of the second group of peopl , in fact i think that for a student is more import to learn fact than it is for them to undestand idea and comcept , becaus in my opinion fact is the applic of idea and concept , and if a student learn fact he ha more help to understand the concept . for exampl if i must studi the second world war for me is more import learn fact and not what idea or what concept there are under the fact . for exampl if i studi the german 's invas of poland i learn the fact , but from thi fact i can understand that the nazism 's project is to conquist all the world and thi project start from the poland . final i think that a student must learn the fact becaus from fact he understand the idea and the concept that there are under the fact and not more import in the histori text for exampl the question is about the fact and not about the idea , thi is onli an exampl , but it is anoth reason for me that is more import to learn fact .
