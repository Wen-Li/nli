like mani peopl , i too feel that travel in a group is much more fun than travel independent . henc , i complet agre with the statement . there are mani use by travel in group , spend time with famili , have a guid tour etc . one gener goe in group with famili and friend on tour . thi give them an oppurtun to spend qualiti time with them which would otherwis may be not possibl . sinc these tour are gener plan dure vacat or holiday , it make the time spend much more worth while . more over ` happi increas by share it ' as a quot say , the main purpos of go on a vacat is to enjoy it and be happi and go with famili and friend increas it . and also it posit affect the interperson relationship between the member of the group , be it famili member or friend or complet stranger . when you travel alon , you obvious wouldnt have anybodi to share it with . more over the journey wold be more bore and dull or even uninterest . furthermor , when it is guid tour , one have the advantag of know the histori and cultur of the place , that one is visit . it is alway import to be inform about the place , becaus it not onli educ , but also provid the necessari inform . go to histor place on a giud tour is much more worthwhil . for exampl if you go on a trip to rome or itali , it is alway good to have a guid becaus , they inform you with their histori and cultur which is infact veri interest , sinc
