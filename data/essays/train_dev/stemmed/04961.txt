car which are the most typic transport are wide use by the peopl all over the world . but late peopl found that car also should respons for the seriou air pollut . so , accord to thi reason , mani peopl requir the govern to restrict the number of the car and they believ that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year . i do n't quit agre with thi statement for follow reason . though too mani car will pollut the air , it is a conveni way to travel by car . and thi thought will not chang for onli a coupl of score . there may be mani kind of transport , such as bu , subway , plane , ship and so on , but not can be compar as car . take me for an exampl , if i want to go to a supermarket which is 4 mile away from my home , what transport would i first consist ? of caus the car ! i do n't want to wast my time to wait for a bu , it is unabl to take plane or ship and the subway station is far away from my hous . in conclut , unless we invent anoth kind of transport , car wil still becom the best transportaion in decad the biggest problem of the car , everyon can tell , is the wast air and smoke . car use gaslin as their power and releas harm gase which pollut the air . gaslin may be run out and air should never be pollut . howev , thi problem can be solv . recent , mani car builder have invent new car that use solar power rather than gaslin . thi is sure to help protect our natur resourc and our environ . the overcrow road may be the second biggest problem . mani of peopl think that we must solv it , otherwis we will hard to move effici . but thi problem is due to the over-grow popul , it 's not the car ' fault . if the popul decreas , thi problem will not exsit . so thi is not the excus not use the car . all in all , we must find a posit way to solv the problem . use the solar power and solv the road problem , the car will still be use and help . as a result , the car will not decreas in twenti year .
