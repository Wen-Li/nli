first of all , i agre with the statement given here that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a fow guid '' my first reason is , as we go to a new palc , we may not be know how the place will be , how will be the behaviour of the peopl , what their cultur is , what their custum are , whta their tradit is etc . if we go to some american countir , we may find some difficulti , understand their languag and aslo we can not understand their accent eventhough their speak english . for exampl suppos you plan to go franc . the languag the peopl speak there is french . you may not understand french . here you need a guid . my second reason is , if the palc you plan to tour a histor place without a guid , you final end up with the rockey structur you saw there . as each histor place ha a histori behind in the main purpos of visi is to know it histori . as we are not familiar with the palc and it histori , a guid it is right person to expalin it . fot exampl , take an instanc os vise mahabalipuram , a famou histor site in india . it 's all fill with templ made ofrock , car on stone etc . we need a guid to expalin what rocki strutur are . and lastli the import thing is fullfil the purpos for which have spent the money , let suppos you have paln an europ tour . but you did not have a proper person with you to expalin their what is the purpos of visit is not know ani thing .
