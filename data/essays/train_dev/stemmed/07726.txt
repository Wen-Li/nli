i think we should studi towo question te make respons to the subject : whi today product seem tobe better that they realli are ? and is the increas in advertis explain thi fact ? first i will make a littl histori and the evolut of market . first the product wa local and not industri they were a littl number of product on the market and to sell it wa veri easi to sell them the offer wa more import than demand . in a second time at the begin of the industri revolut , when the demand egal the offer , all custum could fine on the market the same product one exapl is the ford t the same car , same color for everi one . a third evolut of the industri revolut is to propos , on the market , for a same product which have the same function , differ option . for exampl a car with a choic of differ color . so in thi phase of the evolut peopl could satisfi also primari need and also desir wich is new abotu the pattern of buy someth . maslow with hi famou pyramid explain and illustr the differ need and desir . the technolog of indistri product have chang the market and today we have an offer more import tha the demand and the primari need or the origin function of a product are today less import than the desir of make an acquisit of a particular type of car . for exampl if you buy a bmw car today you also buy a certain rang in the societi . when peopl were buy the ford t they were buy a product which permit to go from one point to anoth and it wa n't a for distinct from other peopl . in conclus i think advertis contribut to clarifi and commun on the desir wich is offer by the product to the person . the qualiti bqsed on the primari function is secondari .
