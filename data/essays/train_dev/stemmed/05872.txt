i agre with that statement , though i have to admit there are except . nowaday , it seem to be all about themselv but noth els for young peopl . they do not mind about the one in need becaus they are not even awar of such a thing call `` in need '' exist . their famili spoil them to no end which led the yoiuth to be unawar of what go on in their commun , let alon the world . the thing with the young peopl these day is that they are be brain wash by some industri and they are be victim of these industri . like the food industri . they creat a new form of ideal for women bodi and nearli all the young girl are concern about their weight more than anyth els , thi nonsenc is what is take their mind of other thing . like help their commun !!! and thi gener [ which i am a part of ] is veri self center becaus what is expect from them is perfect . which , we all know is imposs to reach . so to reach that imposs goal of themselv , they give their full attent to theirselv . i know the thing i wrote down is a littl bit off the topic , but think twice , they are somehow relat . youth is strive for an unrealist goal , make them imperfect by the way of characterist , just the oppos of what they are strive for . all in all i do agre that my gener is not give enough time and care to help the other /
