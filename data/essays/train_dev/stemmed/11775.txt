i think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid becaus it is safer , the best tourist place are shown , and it can be cheaper . first of all , travel alon can be veri danger sinc you are in a place that you do n't now . some time even the idiom is strang to you . it 's possibl that by mistak you end up in riski place where you can be assalt . these are some risk that peopl like me do n't want to have , so the answer for them is to travel in a tour . becaus tour 's are compos of mani peopl and are led by a local guid who know the zone , you can be almost sure that noth bad will happen to you . furthermor , lone travel have to ask for interest place in each citi they go . they will visit some place , but probabl they will miss other . when travel in a tour , all the place are known by the agenc , and they usual give you the best of each town . you dont wast time ask for advic and you do n't miss import place . final , although tour agenc seem to be expens . in my opinion , they end up be cheaper . when you travel by yourself , you can make some good deal . nevertheless , veri often peopl are cheat by local seller , and they do n't becom awar of thi becaus they simpli do n't what is the correct prize . these event never happen in tour . they know where they work , and the correct prize . thay charg you some extra money for thi knowledg , but it 's worth it . overal , i prefer to travel with tour agenc becaus an import thing to me is to play safe in my trip along with the fact that i do n't like to miss ani interest spot . in addit , tour agenc end up be cheaper .
