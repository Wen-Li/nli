i do agre with part of the statement about tri new thing . when place repeatedli in the same context , individu tend to limit their horizon to what they know . in a busi environ , thi lead to two possibl neg result : predict and lack of innov . if competitor know that one will continu to do the thing it current doe without chang , they can adapt and exploit the compani 's weak . in the case of ibm , for instanc , led by loui gertsner at the time , the compani knew how to build and sell comput . the compani did n't take ani risk , such as engag in softwar develop or applic . emerg compani seiz the opportun , and that is how microsoft came to market . microsoft , led by bill gate , took risk , expand in new segment , and becam a juggernaut compar to ibm . on the other hand , i do believ also that alway tri new thing and take risk can be a danger proposit . an exampl of thi come from the automot world . jack nasser , ford 's ceo at the time , wish to take ford beyond automot and transform it to a global consum product compani . ford engag and invest in differ ventur . eventu , thi prove to be a distract to the core busi , automot . insuffici invest were made in improv it product line . and with so much focu on new ventur , ford lost sight of the market forc chang the automot landscap . ford had stop produc the kind of car and truck consum want . toyota , on the other hand , focus it busi on increas sale in the automot sector onli , and close rank to becom a danger and grow competitor . i do believ either option can be relev for differ peopl or organ at differ phase of their life . sometim , peopl can use someth they do well but still take risk . i would cite the exampl of appl , led by ceo steve job . while success earli on thank primarili to it eas of use and it attract design , appl comput becam larg irrelev when other option came to the market . recent , appl took advantag an emerg market in digit music download and design the now famou ipod . the ipod leverag appl 's legendari design and eas of use and becam an unsurpass competitor . in thi case , appl took someth they knew how to do well ( design , eas of use ) and still took risk ventur on a complet new market ( digit music download ) beyond their core market .
