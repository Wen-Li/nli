everi time i have the opportun to travel i like to travel by myself , but sometim i also like to travel with a group led by a tour guid . when i decid to travel by myself i make a littl research about the place i am plan to visit , in that way i can know what place are the most popular , where are the cultur and archeolog zone . after that , i make a schedul with the place i would like to go and the rout i should take . travel like these allow me to learn more about the place i visit . if , on the other hand , i decid to join a group led by a tour guid , it is a differ expiri becaus i am travel with more peopl and by do that i can share my anecdot and expiri dure the trip with other poepl , and i can also learn about the place by listen to other peopl stori . in my opinion , if you want to do a littl more research about the place you visit it is better to travel alon but if you onli want to enjoy your trip , you can join a group . i like travel by myself and with group , so i have to say that i partli agre with the statement . i agre becaus travel with more peopl make the expiri better tran travel alon but i also disagre becaus sometim , when travel with a group you would have to follow the direct or the order given by the tour guid and sometim that just not what peopl is look for or sometim you will want to stay for a littl longer but the schedul of the tour guid will not allow you to do that .
