i strongli disagre to the quot given . i believ that enjoy life depend on the mindset and person of each individu , not on their age . i have confront mani teenag who stress about their academ studi and social relationship with their friend and famili . i have had convers with numer teenag who simpli do not stop complain about their live . how much homework they receiv each night , how much nag they have to bear from their parent , and what kind of social drama are go on between their friend are onli a small portion of the complaint that i hear from other teenag such as myself . on the other hand , i have encount mani old-ag adult who are enter into their latter portion of their live but are enjoy their live to the fullest . they might not be financi well off or social success but they see thing in a posit way and are thank of everyth they have . i know an old man who ha lost hi wife sever year ago , but , even after such a huge emot obstacl , he still interact extrem well with hi children and peopl in hi commun . there is no doubt that he miss hi wife with all hi heart , but he leav hi past to stay as hi past and form a better futur with everi moment that he is live out . i think that when a person know how to learn from the past and to look toward the futur by live their best in the present , he/sh is the person who know how to enjoy life . to be satisfi with the thing that he/sh ha and util them to make the most out of them are the ultim way to be truli happi and success in life . i believ that age doe not alter an individu 's abil to be happi , but it is the way he/sh view life and what he/sh make out of it that help him/her find true joy in life .
