i do agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i think that young peopl today are less involv in commun activ and spend less time there becaus the societi in common becam more individualist . for instanc , a lot of young peopl today perform individi sport or they perform sport onli occassion . it is no longer common that such peopl are organis in sport club and take responsibili as team coach or in train kid and younger club member from their commun . it seem also that organis like the boy scout or church have a problem to attract young peopl . and i think that young peopl were more polit engag in previou time . there are onli few young peopl nowaday join polit parti or labour organis such as union . in particular , most young peopl are reluct to take polit posit on a commun level becaus they can no see ani sens in it . one reason seem to be that the econom situat ha chang much over the last year . the pressur to be successful in the job is much higher than ever befor , and the high unemploy rate threaten a lot of peopl becaus of their proffesion futur . henc , young peopl are urg to finish their school time time and studi as fast as possibl which leav onli veri littl time for commun activ . in addit , it seem to be more common today to teach competit instead of collabor , lead to a more egoist societi . a lot of young peopl start to learn thi earli in their career , leav the impress to them that is not benefiti to take responsibilit in their commun becaus of the time it cost . final , the societi becam more mobil over the last year , which mean that in particular young peopl often chang their job and live place . henc , these young peopl can not realli get root in a commun . but thi seem to be a major prerequesit for ani commun engag .
