in my opinion , i agre thi statement . i think that number of car will dicreas at least around in next decad . there are a few reason for it . first , recent concern for environment pollut is get higher . of cous , it doe not caus of onli car , but the great number of car appar affect to air and water and so on . moreov , in our daili life car is veri notiv ellement to environ . second , from aforesaid first reason , the number of prietor is not increas like befor . for exampl , my parent thought it as a dream to buy car when they are young . now , i am almost same age to them at that time , but i do not need ani car . i do not feel necessari to it . the mean have car is changinng more than befor . third , mani vehicl have develop veri well , so we can go anywher by use them , such as train or airplan or ship . moreov , although there is not onli one compani but also a lot of compani offer their vehicl with compet , we can use them cheaper than befor . some peopl may disagre with my thi opinion . the market of motor car is still now storong , therefor it never decreas thei number . of cous , in japan also , the market is still now vegor . if i watch tv program , i can see a lot of commerci through the time . even now a lot of peopl may be purchas their new car . but i think that recent main stream ha chang ovbious , that is to say , recent the most motic stream is new type of car that never excharg ani pollut . in addit , eco-car is famou and popular , which use not nonrenew resouc , petrileum , but electr . i think that thi show our view had chang from befor . therefor , i agre thi statement that recent fewer car are in use . the number of car will chang into fewer .
