i dissagre with the opinion that the way to travel in group led by tour guid . in addit , travel alon give you more benefit . first of all , travel alon give you much freedom . you can go everi place where you want . tour guid ha a certain schedul . so visitor have to follow the schedul even if they want to see in same place where thi are . in my case , i went to china with guid . we have mani schedul in a day . if we arriv at one place , guid said , `` get off bu and i will give you 1 hour to travel here , after one hour , let 's see in front of thi bu . '' at that time i feel i am just like a machin and child . one of the reason that peopl want to travel is have a relax in a comfort place with freedom . travel with guid take my freedom in travel . second , travel alon give you more time to think . if you travel with group and guild , you feel happi in a new place with mani love peopl ( famili , friend , girl/boy friend ) . feel sympathi with peopl who you love in new palc is veri good thing . but it might reduc to have person place and time . becaus you should follow busi schedul in a goup with guid . for exampl , i went to australia alon and tailnand with my friend and guid . feel in these two travel is veri differ for me . in australia , i felt lone in everi night and thouht my famili and friend . so i realiz that they are realli import peopl in my life . also , i had much time to think my future. ` what i want to do , what i like to do . ' final i had got some result in that part . on the other hand , travel tailand with friend and guid is just for fun . we had great time there . we did swime for whole day , ate delici food and did shop . it wa fantast but just for fun . for thi reason , i recommand travel alon to my friend . i think travel along not with group led by a tour guid is better choic .
