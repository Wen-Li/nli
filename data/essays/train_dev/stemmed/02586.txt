i complet agre with thi statement . in my opinion , most advertis make product seem much better as that is what they are meant to do . advertis make the product look much more attaract and much more use than they realli are . a lot of compani spend a lot of money onli on thi area . thi is due to the fact that they have realis that most of the consum believ the advertis and will be under the inful of them . howev , a lot of the time it is veri unfair to the custom as well . these advertis can be veri mislead sometim and custom end up buy what they dont realli want . i have seen it and experinenecd it myself . televis advertis have mislead me in buy mani product that i did not want . anoth techniqu that mani busi firm use is that of use celebr to persuad peopl for buy their good . celebr with veri high social statu 's can be veri persuas at time and thi is anoth case of mislead the consum . there is not much anybodi can do about thi either . peopl need to understand that firm would tri their level best to make peopl buy what they do not what . it is us who are at fault as well . beleiv these advertis blindli would be stupid on our part . we are the one who are spend money and we need to make sure that we do not wate what we have . i think most of the advertis are veri mislead and make the product look much better than they realli are . nevertheless we are at fault as well and we need to make sure that we do not make mistak easili .
