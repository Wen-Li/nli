i think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first , with the big developmemt of the technolog travel will be easier than tose day . actual with plane , train , and car peopl can be in their countri at the time they want . so if we return for twenti year ago we 'll see how the peopl were travel in the past . there were n't car or train so they took day and month in travel , for exampl , they use anim camel , hors and also donkey . but now they use car and plane so they saw that the life becam more better than befor . as we see , in the futur peopl will tri to make their travel more easier than now . i think that they will discov new machin which is faster than the car . they 'll tri to get their life more easi and comfort . may be they will tri new train which connect the word togeth from west to the east . in addit what will happen if thae car fill all the street in one citi ? it will caus mani problem for exampl polluiton on the air . as aconclus , in my opinion in the futur there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
