i believ , to be a success person one should be capabl of take risk when it is ask for and should also be adept enough to continu do the work which he doe well . a combin of both act as a lethal weapon in thi today 's world of excess compet . person 's abil to learn new thing and take calcul risk alway put the person in a favor posit in the eye of success . becaus success ha and will favour all those who have taken risk . for exampl : - consid howard hugh who wa not onli a inventor but also a imagin thinker , who believ extens in take risk and also cultiv and mould the abil alreadi posses by him . when he wa shoot for the film , which when releas . .. turn out to be a block buster , he had inculc so mani new thing in movi which dure hi time were total unthink off . but not onli were the risk account for hi succ but hi abil to be good at what he doe and to keep on do what he know best help him to direct a blockbust . he also took risk when he want to break the record for the fastest speed a plane could fli at . thi risk wa not minut , but it wa hi lilf which wa at stake . hi expert help him to reduc ani human error that might incres he risk , and at last he won . anoth exampl is hi endeavor of build the largest plane `` the hercuel '' . at that time he had vow in front of an enquir comiss that if he is not capabl to construct and fli such plane then he would leav the countri and live in exil . such high were the risk involv in thi task that he had to use all hi expert and he requir to focu all of it into realis hi goal . that made him success . therefor i total believ that consist of onli one of the mention qualiti might ultim result in the person 's failur becaus larg number of uncalcul risk would make him vulner as he would not be experienc stabil . wherea onli do the work that the person know veri well would lead to stagnat of mind and imagin power of the person . thu a heathi mixtur of both the qualiti would be the right formula for a person to be success .
