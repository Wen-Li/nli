i do not agre the statement that claim young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . we can not defin certain paramet of joy in life . it depend from person to person , not with the time we spend in the earth . i think that the joy of life increas by time becaus we are given a chanc to understand what 's go on in our life , get familiar with so mani aspect of it or even to get rid of some paramet of it , if we are lucki enough . an older person could possibl know what he or she want in life and in my opinion , that kind of knowledg can be a relax issu and call joy for that particular person accordingli . for exampl , we do not need to worri about our futur and from now on everyth could be our new way of fun . moreov it is so possibl to see and meet so sad and bad look and miser young peopl while compar an energet and smile old peopl . the fear of futur effect so much on the young peopl caus them to behav and live just not fit with their potenti possibl and even some kind of joy turn into an addict issu even if they are rel too young such as drug . as a conclus i think that onli be young can not give us the chanc to enjoy life .
