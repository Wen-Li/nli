there are two type of success peopl i think : the first one is the person , who reach the success with the own forc . thi kind of success person is intellig , quick , know the mean of the word ` work '' , all that he/sh ha it have been earn from him/her , so he/sh know exact how to do the job or how to behav in vari occas . for thi reason i do n't agre with the statement becaus i think thi kind of person will sure tri new thing or take some risk to reach what he/sh want to or to improv in his/her job , becaus he/sh is sure , compet and respect . howev in my mind ther 's anoth kind of succes peopl , those who reach the success becaus thi success ha been gift to they . in thi case the person ha not the qualiti to be a success person becaus he/sh did n't work hard to reach his/her life 's purpos , he/sh doe n't konw how to work well or how to behav in some kind of circumst and first of all ther 's the risk that the success can have a too big weight for he/sh and thi kind of peopl could crash down . i think they would never take into account to take a risk or triyng new thing , becaus they know that in case of a big problem they would n't know how to solv it . they would of cours look for the help of other peopl . becaus of those reason i agre and disagre with the statement in the same time . all that concern the choic of a person depend on so mani thing like charact , abil , past and also a littl bit of luck .
