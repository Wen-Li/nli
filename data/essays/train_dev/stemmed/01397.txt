in fact , peopl usual think that life is more enjoy when a person is a teenag . i actual dont agre with thi idea . i think it depend on the person rather than the age . in thi passag i will tri to explain my opinion . first let us have a look at the period of life . a child usual seem happi with hi or her toy . and a young boy may enjoy the time that he spend with hi girl friend . a young ladi may find her hobbi or interest after her work time . an old ladi may be veri happi when she is with her grandchildren . these are realli a sight through the window of an optimist person , are not they ? thu , it can easili be seen that a person can enjoy the life at ani age . although these exampl can be expans , we can sometim ran into pessimist peopl . when an optimist person can be happi with hi bicycl , small but pretti hous etc. an optimist can look for the way in order to be worri . thi kind of somber person usual copmplain about unnecessari thing like not have much money , not be a famou person , etc . i think , thi kind of pessimist peopl cant be simpli happi even if they are 17 year old . from thi it can be conclud that i dont agre the statement and believ that a person at ani age can enjoy the life . i have talk about the period of life and gave exampl of both optimist peopl who enjoy the life and pessimist who make life harder unnecessarili . accord to me , everi person may not enjoy life as much as other , howev , it shouldnt be forgotten that everi age give the same chanc to enjoy .
