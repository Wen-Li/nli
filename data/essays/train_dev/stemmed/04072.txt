i disagre with thi statement becaus when i travel alon , i will just care about my self . but if i travel with a group , i will take care of all of them . inadditon , tranel alon is saver , cheeper and more interest than with a group . first , it is saver becaus when peopl travel alon , they will focu in the road that they are drive on . for exampl , onc i travel from citi to an other citi by a car and alon at night . while i wa drive my car , i saw a big camel on my way . i thought that i would die but i pass thi anim becaus i wa focuss and also lucki . second , it is cheeper becaus peopl who travel alon , they will need less food and less drink than other , for exampl , when i travel with my friend to somewher , we stop to eat in restaur but when i travel alon i just eat anyth from ani store
