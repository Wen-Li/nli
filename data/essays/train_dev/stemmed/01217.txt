histor , student have been thought given fac and definit . but recent develop show , that a new form of educ , name teach the principl guidelin , the basi of complex structur is more use for student in order to understand a certain problem . that rais the question whether or not the old form is still appropri ? first of all , i would like to point out that i 'm a student of a univers that strongli encourag the student to think for themselv . therefor it is veri essenti to understansd the basic structur and the idea behind a problem . simpli learn fact is not onli bore but also veri like to be forgetten soon . for exampl , it is possibl to learn chemic reaction simpli by heart but is also possibl to learn whi element react in a specif way and how they do . not onli that it is easier to learn one concept instead of a whole set of formula but it also make you abl to understand how the element behav under differ circumstit . that simpl chemic exampl is applic to a whole rang of problem . moreov it is essenti for a later job , to have complet understood the princip of certain structur . with a broad basi of concept , you are abl to solv problem more independ and to anticip possibl futur problem . it is no use for anyon be abl to respond to a certain problem with fact that have been learn , but not have understood what stand behind them . final , i 'm person convinc that lern too much fact is a wast of time and a barrier when you tri to commun with specif peopl over a complex topic . to conclud , it should activ be encourag to learn the essenti sructur and to build one own opinion , rather than learn fact
