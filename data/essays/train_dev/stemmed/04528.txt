i think it is a difficult question becaus it can have two simliar meanign . first if it is better for a student to know the theori rather than the practis aspect ; but it can mean also , if it is better for a student to understand a concept rather than the fact which the concept come from . in thi second mean , for exampl , if it better for a student to learn princip polit idea of the french revolut or to learn fact that brought to the revolut ; or to know caus and effect of the second world war or to know person hitler histori . i think that there is not a more import thing between understand idea and learn fact . in fact , educ can not be onli theoryc . so i do not agre with the statement . for exampl , in chemestri , student can not learn onli formula . he-sh ha to do experi , otherwis scienc can not go on , becaus theori have to be prove . mayb onli who studi philosophi can learn onli idea of ancient greek or roman philosoph , for instanc . that mean that who work onli with concept can have an abstract way of learn . even though also in thi field there is a sort of evolut . for exampl , some branch of philosophi , of human , like antropolog ha to studi human behaviour so it ha to know fact . in the field i studi , that is law , fact are realli import . eve though there are mani rule , we can not use onli them to give a legal advis . we need to refer to fact that realli happen .
