i agre with the statement . in twenti year , major chang in technolog will take place in our live , those chang would make transport so easi that peopl wo n't have to use car anymor . sinc the human be wa born , he 's look forward to learn more about the world around him , therefor , he invent way to transport from one place to anoth . he start with a hors and carriag . howev , he want to transport faster , so he kept learn and learn until he made car . car are veri use nowaday and in my opinion a person ca n't live without a car . the human 's life depend on transport with car . howev , there are disadvantag for car such as , pollut . pollut is a big problem in societi now so they are tri to find way to reduc the number of car to reduc pollut . in addit , if car are still produc from today until twenti year and peopl kept buy , there wo n't be enough land to move our car on , it 'll be alway crowd and uncomfort . so it 'll be inconveni to buy a car . as i said befor , the human be ca n't stop develop himself . he 'll tri to find an altern . as a result , recent studi have shown exampl of air-craft , person air-craft for one or two peopl in it . they cost more ofcours , but in the long run i think it will take over the car industri . becaus peopl will arriv to their destin faster , less frustrat . and eventu the price will be reason for everybodi . in ten to fifteen year , those person air-craft will spread out magic . but not everybodi could afford it . therefor , it will take about anoth five year until peopl get accustom to the idea of drive a plane , and price becom reason for all level of peopl . as a result , the number of car will decreas . in conclus , the technolog in our world move so quickli that noth can ever remain forev . a great invent will take place and help the world . but use too much of it will caus problem and have disadvantag . as a result , a new technolog will take place .
