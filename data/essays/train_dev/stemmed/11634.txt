in my opinion , the given statement is right on the one hand , but it is not abl to be use to everi specif subject on the other . class of differ subject have alway been differ and will alway requir differ strategi to handl the materi which is taught in them . for those subject who tend to be in the technic and scientif area , understand the main way of work is far more import than ani detail . in gener , understand the fact of how someth , e.g. a motor of an entir power plant work is more import than learn and know ani singl detail without realli know what purpos they are for . in my opinion , especi scientif subject like chemistri or biolog and technic subject like engin will get along wonder with that statement . for those kind of student , it ha to be import to understand the function of techniqu they are confront with while attend their class , omit minor detail ( which are often omit by professor and teacher themselv ) . after univers , be confront with your job , there is no use for those who learn by heart ani singl detail of a machin they are confront with now , but not know the way thi particular machin work in gener . in addit to that , minor detail are also often describ right on the machin , but their gener way of work is not and should have been understood earlier . moreov , i think idea and concept are were and still are the basement for develop and research . with monoton learn and repeat fact , it is far more difficult to understand and without know about the core concept , there is no possibl for progress and new develop , e.g. in the medicin and biochemistri . but nevertheless , understand the concept is not alway the one way to success . be veri help in technic subject , i still think that you should not use thi method in subject like histori . in these specif class , detail fact of our past are equal in import as understand the concept , e.g. the concept of commun invent by lenin . to put it in a nutshel , i am convinc that the given statement , which is to concentr on an idea than to the fact , can be veri use for everyth concern develop and techniqu , but it should not be use to those class that deal with the past . in these particular subject , you should spend half the time for the idea and the other half for the fact .
