i disagre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . mani youngster today volunte at hospit , old age home , or particip in anim care center and natur club . young peopl sure care enough about the commun to help out , for the simpl reason that they also belong to thi commun and are proud of it . mani peopl have a gener impress that young peopl just do n't care about their commun especi in the present day . on the contrari , mani young peopl are awar of the variou problem face by the commun . there are a varieti of are where you find the young take part . mani student help out in hospit where they are requir to do simpl thing but which make a world of differ to the patient . it show them that some one care . student join natur club or anim protect club . such group alway conduct activ which benifit the commun in some form or other llike build tree or care for injur or homeless anim . the young also join commun which help take care of orphanag . a lot of youngster visit old age home and spend time with the fok there . sometim ralli are held for the better of a certain caus in the societi . thi could also be thought of as a form of help out the commun . most young peol do care about their commun and help out whenev they have spare time . thi is becaus they are introduc to the problem face by the commun earli in their life . in the present day , the young have a lot more respons to give back to the commun . it is veri import for young peopl to think about the commun and come up with solut to help the problem face by the commun . the young will alway help out in the problem face by the commun as they are the futur of that commun .
