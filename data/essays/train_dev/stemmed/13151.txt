first of all , i disagre with the statment . i prefer to have a travel in group all my by ourselv . the reason that i disagre with the statment are , first , i will have less freedom on my trip . basic , go for a trip is a way to relax and have more privat room for ourselv . so a led who usual is usual a stranger could interrupt our privaci . second , the tour guid may usual mislead us to some place where we are not will to go . for exampl , if we are hope for somewher for excit . by mostli , the tour guid may usual get us to some place purpos for shop or those typic place for sightse which may probabl cant ful our wish . mayb you may doubt that what if we are not abl to led our way when go to somewher that we never been to ? of cours , thi will be hard to go . at thi point , i will first suggest u to join with the tour guid for your first trip . becaus dure the trip , you will get some of their advic and knowledg to help you go by yourselv in the futur . when after that trip , you will be abl to go for a trip all by yourselv . and , you will have chanc to discov more excit without the tour guid . go travel without ani tour guid could be fun . there must be more unkown and unpredit result final . dure the travel , all disicion all make by ourselv and the time control ha no limit . we are abl to stay or leav whenev we want . everi moment we are have is great and excit , becau . and thi is the main purpos to go travel . to explor , to experi , to tast the life .
