ye , i agre with the follow statement . it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . well , i am a student , i studi architectur and for me is veri import to understand that i studi . infact if i do not understand i do not know how mani import thing . when my professor talk about a famou architectur i like to listen him and i like dream about thi thing . if a student do not understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . .. well , he or she do not learn anyth . i think that if you can learn more thing about you studi or not , your mind can learn much more . well ! i think also that if a student do not have a good theacher he or she do not like understand that he or she studi . howev , there is must a good collabor about a professor and a student . i do not talk about complic , but i talk about a good abient where theacher and student could be to learn . if a student do not understand that he or she studi i think that he or she do not have more thing about tell . in conclut , i think that if a student have a good teacher , he or she can understand everyth he or she want . infact , i understand more that i studi becaus i love that i studi . i love architectur and i like see , touch , and talk about it .
