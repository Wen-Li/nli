it is ask whether grasp the idea and concept are more valuabl than learn and just memor the fact . i hold the view that , although sometim it is use to learn the fact , to be abl to understand the idea and the underli reason behind a particular topic is far more crucial . the student should be expect more than learn the fact and way of critis these fact should be taught them . to begin with , i believ that the fact do not alway remain constant . they can chang with time and old fact can be replac with complet new fact . thu , the fact itself are not alway reliabl . to illusr it with an exampl , befor galileo and some other scientist it wa believ that the world wa flat . besid , it wa a well accept fact . howev , later the fact were question and replac with newer fact . what i can recommend here is that learn the way which go to these fact are more import and the idea and concept behind these fact form a more solid understand for the student . secondli , the fact are usual more difficult to keep in mind . sinc i am also a student , i know veri well that the fact are easili forgotten after one year or even after the cours finish . thu , to understand idea would enabl the student to carri their knowledg to their later period of life . besid , focus on the concept and gener idea would also enabl them to studi more effect , sinc they are usual more easi to rememb . thirdli , the fact do not prepar the student for a real life at all . usual at school , the student just keep the fact in mind , which are explain by the teacher . later on , the student just memor the fact in order to be readi for the exam and they usual do not grasp the topic as a whole or they can not add someth from themselv . howev ; when these student will graduat afterward and will be in the real life , they will be expect to be abl to interpret , to make comment and to offer new solut base on basic idea and concept . therefor at school , the student should be train and encourag to question the fact and offer altern to these fact . that is often a more effect way of educ than learn the fact . in conclus , i support the idea that to understand the idea and concept is more crucial than just tri to keep the fact in mind . there is no guarante that the fact would remain as they are and a student should learn to do more than just memor the fact in order to be readi for a life outsid of school when they graduat . thu , student are better encourag to understand the idea and concept and be abl to critis the fact , which i think is more import than the fact .
