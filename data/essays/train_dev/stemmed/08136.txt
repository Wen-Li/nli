i definit disagre with the idea that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun becaus i know that a lot of young peopl work for their commun as volunterr . i would like to offer some exampl to support my opinion . first , there are a larg number of student at my univers who are interest in help their commun . for exmpl , when i went to the volunterr meet at the univers a few day ago , although it wa still on summer vacat , the meet room wa pack with student who want to volunterr . i wa so exit to see and know that the number of student made time for the meet . it show the fact that there are a lot of young studet who are interest in help their commun and make time for it . second , i know that a lot of my freind are work for volunterr alreadi . moreov , at the meet of thi kind , i have seen a lot of young peopl who join for volunterr includ from differ univers , locat and background . if young peopl have not given enought time to support their commun acit these day how come i have seen these peopl ? also i know that they are not onli suppot their commun but also they are will to do it . they feel more repons to the commun through the acit . do these activ give them a lot of satisf as a member of commun and societi . for these reason , i disagre the idea strongli that young peopl today do not make enought time to help their commun . furthermor , as long as i know , they particip more to help their commun .
