i agre with the statement that say that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , if i go back in time and i start to do some memori of my time as an student at school and at the univers , all those thing that i learn it wa becaus i understood the idea and concept that my teacher explain to me and my classmat . when i final understood the process of the french revolut i never forget it , becaus i did n't learn it as a fact . second , is realli great when you get the concept of the differ thing and you can start to make some interest relat between them and with the experi of your own life . i think that is nice when you can make question about what you learn and give some conclut about it . i also found that is nice when you meet with friend and you start a convers with them , talk and exchang idea of all those thing that in a moment you learn and understand them . i realli have a veri good time when i have those kind of opportun to share with friend what i have learn and also to be sure that i can do my own statement . futhermor , i consid that fact are too weak , you learn thi fact for the test and then you eras them . is like a fore learn , from one moment to onoth it flye away , from your mind . instead , when you realli understand the idea or concept yo can be sure that thi knowleg will never forget , never more . final i can say that , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
