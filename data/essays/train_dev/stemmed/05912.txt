i am agre with thi statement . the reason is that in the twenti year there were not mani car in use as now or becaus the peopl could not afford to buy it . if we look at the histori , the twenti year were not mani success for mani peopl . for exampl , in the unit state although there wa a period of healthi in the earli twenti and peopl could afford to buy car , at the last year of the centuri the depress let mani peopl witouth job , hous and withouth even necessari item . as well in europ , as alway , there were so mani statu differ between peopl that onli rich had the opportun to get car . howev , today there are a lot of differ model of car and you can buy a car cheaper that in those year . for exampl , now a littl car that allow you to drive along the citi cost about 6,000 euro that is a raison price . also , nowaday , you have the chanc of buy a car and pay for it everi month dure sever year , so even young peopl have good job can afford to drive their own car . besid , you have the option of buy a car that have been use befor . we know that , propabl the car will be broken befor than a new one but , if you realli need it and you do not have enough money to buy a new one , is an option that can be consid . howev if you have money to spend and you realli like car , there are a huge varieti of them to buy . nowaday , car almost can drive by their selv or at least , park . thi type of car are from japan or china and mayb , in not a long time , mani peopl will be abl to get these wonder car . as we can see , today , there are so mani option in the market that make possibl to everyon to get a car in an econom way , if it is that they want , or to buy a super car spend more money . howev , i think that in the twenti year get a car wa a thing for onli rich peopl and it is for sure that there were not so mani option as we have today to choos one , base not onli in the price but also in our prefer .
