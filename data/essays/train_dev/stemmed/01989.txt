i agre with that statement . there are sever reason for young peopl not to take activ part in their commun . the main point is the miss educ of children and young peopl . today mani of them are n't well educ in behaviour . famili do n't spend enought time to affect the children 's behaviour , becaus they think it is the teacher in school who ha to do that , but he is n't . a famili ha to provid social rule to it 's young member to make them known in the import of relationship and communit life . to me , religion also play a role in thi educ . mani young peopl are n't religi for sever reason , but religion can have an import effect on the peopl communit think . it teach equal and understand and it tell that everi singl person is import and a good relat between each other is one of the most import thing in life . most of my friend who are member of the christian church are highli interest in our commun and particip activ . anoth reason for the miss help is the influenc of mass media on the teenag . advertis impli that everyon is onli next to hisself , no one els matter and it final suggest that one is the middl of the univers . young peopl who have n't a work familiar background , are left alon with that suggest . it is no surpris that they ca n't cope with the influenc and that result in miss interest of the commun they life in . so as i mention in the begin the main thing is educ in the familiar background to increas the number of activ work young peopl within commun .
