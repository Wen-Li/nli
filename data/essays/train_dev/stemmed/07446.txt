in follow text i 'm go to express my thought about the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know . there is a distinct of success peopl that i want to make befor answer the question . there are two kind of them . first is the success guy , who just happen to be in the right spot or have the right friend to come into a posit where he is successful . those peopl mostz do n't tri new thing at all or use new knowledg . they 'll be interest in keep the current statu quo . the second kind are the self-mad success peopl . they do have to take risk and think new thought in order to be success . for exampl if you open a shop , you 'll have to get a loan from a bank , which is riski becaus you might ca n't pay it back . if you are not abl to pay your rate you risk not onli the new shop you 've open , but your whole exist . therefor you have to make sure that your bussin is go to work . the best way to be success is to differ from other . you 'll have to think about new product to sell , new way to advertis them . mayb new locat and way to build them . without innov it wo n't take long until there is someon better come into the field , to take your custum away . that 's whi , as a self-mad man , you alway have to be on top of new develop . whether in technic or in market issu . that doe n't mean that in order to be success you 'll have to start someth total new . it 's perfectli possibl to start with someth that you alreadi know and are good at . but it 's a must to alway develop new skill and knowledg . custum alway want the best servic they can get so you have to improv your servic . onc you 're successful , ther is no guaranti that it alway stay like that . success peopl will alway make effort to improv further . it 's neccesari for them to take risk and think new thought .
