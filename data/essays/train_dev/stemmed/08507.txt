i do agre with the follow statement . i think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i have sever reason to share : first of all , young peopl have usual much more energi than older peopl . for exempl , young peopl can go do all kind of sport like skydiv , scubadiv , danc , and a lot of other sport , without realli think about the heart or bone problem . second , yound peopl still have to live mani year and experi mani differ thing . a teenag want to becom independ and go to travel all around the world to make hi own experi , but older peopl are often alreadi set with husband or wife , and with children , and prefer to relax at home dure the week-end . third , yound peopl have much more free mind than older peopl . young peopl from today in franc for exampl , live a life with a lot of comfort and do n't worri much about war or hunger , but some grand-par experienc the war and rememb the difficulti of thi time . some have resent against german for exampl , but young peopl live all togeth in peac german , spanish peopl and all becaus they did n't live the war . fourth , young peopl can experi much more thing with the evolut of the scienc . there are mani innov today that young peopl can use for their everyday life , that older peopl did n't have at their youth time . like the mp3 that can carri mani song and most of the young peopl use it . to conclud , i think it 's normal that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . everybodi is young one day , and becom old an other day .
