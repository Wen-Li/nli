i do not agre to the idea that the car will be decreas in twenti year . the reason is that the peopl keep seek conveni . the car is one of the most marbl invent in the human histori . it make fast the transport and wide the work rang of the peopl . it is imposs to make slow the peopl 's commutt and to make narrow the influenc of individul in the futur than today . then , we need altern to replac the car . howev it is hard to expect that in twenti year . instead , i think the car might be develop in mani way . for exampl , it can have convin wing to solv the traffic jam or it can be driven by non-pollut fuel . howev , the car will be more in use , even though the popul is decreas . i live in korea which ha a small land but ha three major supplier of the car which call hyundai , deawoo , samsung . that mean that the car is veri use and use widespread even in a small land . i also have my person car and my famili ha 4 car with 6 menber . i would say it is common and get more common in the world . anoth reason is that the car industri ha much share of the whole industri . it provid mani job and is support by much side industri and research . as i know the industri which ha the most big percentag of invent in the world is the car industri . if the number of car is decres , the much of the economi of the world will be affect . therefor , i think it is hard to imagin the decreas of car in twenti year .
