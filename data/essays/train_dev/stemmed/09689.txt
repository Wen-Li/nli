car are the symbol of the access to a better life for a lot of peopl becaus they have the fell to be free to go everywher they want . howev , car ha no futur 's life in front of all the new technolog in commun an interact . that is whi i am convienc that there will be fewer car in twenti year . my first reason to beliv thi is that , in twenti year car wil represent too mani disagr . for exampl , today , a lot of street of big town like new york or london are realli overcrowd . the street are becom too littl for all these car . for instanc , it is more difficult to go outsid pari , in the subburb , than take the plane an go veri far from franc . in twenti year , i think all big citi will be like london . actual in london , you can not enter in the citi without pay a right for entranc . thi solut express that peopl realli want to reduc the number of car into big citi . in addit , that is whi everi big citi develop the buse or the subway , which is realli more confort for peopl who have to across the town everyday to go to work . as far as i am concern , i prefer take the subway becaus i do my travel in less time than if i need to take the car . in my opinion , thi solut to develop in big citi subway or buse wil be develop as far there will have no more car in citi . furthermor , i think that we must take into consider the develop in twenti year of new technolog . first of all , we realiz today , and more in twenti year , how the pollut is damag for the environ . and car are one of the main reason to explain thi pollut . that is whi we realli want to promot some way to travel which respect more our planet . in twenti year , i am convinc that we will have new way to travel , faster and with less pollut . for instanc , in some littl town like bordeaux ( in the south of franc ) , there is the tramway , which allow peopl to across the town without breath the cars'pollut . i think that is a realli good experiment . morevo , in twenti year , we use more and more plane . inde , plane are becom less an less expens and i hope than in these time , all peopkl can afford it . that is whi i argu that in few year , all peopl use traway or subway to across their citi and use plane to across some countri . tu summaruz my point of vue , i am realli convinc and i hope also that there will be fewer car in use than today . in few year , we have a lot of new way to travel , without wast all thi time in our car and , by the same way , we have the opportun to save our earth .
