i would like to dicuss on the question if young peopl nowaday do n't help enough in their commun . by think about thi notion the question aris what is the communiti for the teenag today . is it their household , their famili , is it the life at school or their posit in the societi ? all these set chang like everyth chang in the world . in the consequ of new aspect in their life and new influenc which affect on them , a new realtion to all of the cummun , which could exist for a teenag , is build . so you can not compar the attitud of help in a commun from nowaday with the situat 20 or more year ago . you could juxtapos the societi and communti in realtion to the help of teenag at thi time . befor around 40 year all peopl need the commun to stay aliv . thi depend is one of the mainfact whi the attitud of teenag with help in nower time is anoth one than 40 year ago . i agre with the posit that they do not help as much as around 40 year ago but i 'm oppos with the statement that they do n't help enough . everybodi will feel if they need to help more than now , but just now our the societi is fed up with peopl who want to work and can not work becaus of the less job . anther point is the communitiy at home - the famili . it could be that there 're a lot of children and teenag how do n't care about their famili and the staff in it . i would not mention that the parent have the foult at thi situat , the social sorround of their children influenc them more than ani other asepect . i 'm convinc that someth have to chang in thi . but for reason alreadi state i would suggest that the develop of the societi is the reason for that . the teenag do n't need their parent anymor , or they think . becaus the realiti show that those children who run away from their home , or those who doe n't care on their famili they will not be succesful in their futur . they think they can use their time much better that spend time with their parent . all thing consid i would state that there is no problem with the realtion between the societi , the state and the young teenag becaus at thi time they are not use to work or give their power to the gener societi , but in realtion to their famili i total agre with the given statement . i is justifi to say that there have to chang anyth to cope with the now situat . they have to realis that they need their pa
