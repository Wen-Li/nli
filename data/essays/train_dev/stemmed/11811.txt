i do not agre with the statement . that is one-sid and not consid the mean of what is realli to `` enjoy '' . young peopl seem that they are more energet and full of hope and potenti . their interest might be focu onli on futur . in a way self-cent . to them , life seem go forev and ever and never end . they are enjoy youth . not life . some of the younger peopl , they have n't even live yet . also , life doe not alway go as you wish or plane . when you 're younger , you do n't have much patienc and it seem frustat . we do n't live alon , noon doe . life mean includ all other peopl come in our live . as we get older , we realiz that . when you focu on onli the futur and yourself , how can you appreci and enjoy ? i like the old say : stop and smell the rose . sure the futur would be alway there no matter how old you becom but your prioriti shift as you get older . but as you get older you realiz what 's matter in life . peopl who onc realiz the prioriti , more like to enjoy life . in most case it 's the freind and famili in your life becaus they are the one you ca n't live without . also as you get older you realiz what is the qualiti of life . in younger day , you would think youth would be there forev then onc day you realiz that is not true . i also believ it take some matur to enjoy life itself . i know some older peopl who are retir and not much so call excit in life go on like younger peopl but they seem happier and more satisfi of their live . everytim i ask them if they are happi , the answer is alway ye . you 'd be wonder whi or how can they , old and bore but they are happi with themselv and know what they have accomplish . they are pretti much content with what they went through and gain some confid from it . so therefor , i do not agre with the statement . it take some time until you make peac with yourself and your own life . older peopl enjoy life more than the younger peopl .
