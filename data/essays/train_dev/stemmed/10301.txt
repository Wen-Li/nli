how often have peopl travel on their own ? in group ? by coupl or with their class ? what is the best way to travel to a countri ? opinion differ depend on peopl , but i believ that the best way to travel and to learn about a countri is by be led by a tour guid . first , a tour guid can help us travel in the countri . i rememb the time i travel in itali with my parent , we took a guid who made us a visit of the entir rome . he knew everi corner of the citi as if it wa himself . we took the subway and we were amazingli surpris of how mani station and changement we had to make . becaus we could not speak italian , travel alon would have been much more difficult without a guid . thank to our tour guid , we were spare intermin hour of wander in the intric street of rome . secondli , a tour guid can give us some histor background that are specif to the countri or to the region . our italian guid , name gino , explain to us in detail the histori of the coliseum . we thought we knew alreadi enorm about the site , for we have read mani book about it , but we never knew how it wa built , in how much time it wa built , and whi wa it a phenomenon in rome . he explain us how itali undergo a chaotic period dure the civil war and the second world war , fact that have not alway been explain concis . but he also talk to us about italian legend , that are onli known by italian . he also familiar us with the tradit italian music which origin bloom dure the renaiss . gino also talk to us about the great thinker , mathematician , musician , politician and dictat of their countri and i had to admit that i could never have thought about them if we were not guid by gino . thirdli , if we are not completli familiar with a countri 's languag , peopl , or food , a tour guid can alway facilit our task . i rememb how lost my parent and i were the first day we arriv in rome . we could n't speak italian and becaus we were tourist , some italian took advantag of the situat to make us pay more than the regular price in restaur . gino got furiou against the waiter and when we ask him what happen , we were horrifi to realiz that the waiter want to make us pay the bread , the tabl , the glass , the fourk and knive . apart from thi littl misunderstand , gino alway had great museum , restaur , bar , adress . he would recommend us the best italian pasta dish and would bring us the great comedi show ! he would also bargain with street seller so that we could afford cheapli a dolc et gabbana pair of glass or a perfect imit of a gucci bag . i believ that my experi in rome clearli demonstr the fact that it is best to travel somewher by be led by a tour guid . for he is more experienc and familiar to hi countri 's lifestyl and peopl .
