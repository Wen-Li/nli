i believ that it is better to have wide knowledg of mani academ subject than to one specif subject . the reason is , narrow knowledg is veri unus . for exampl , when i am a student studi about onli one academ subject , and if i must chang the theme of studi , i will in troubl and at a loss . becaus in the situat , i must studi other subject from veri basic part . but if i have widespread knowledg about other subject , i will chang my theme easili . but studi broad subject is give up to gain profound knowledg in the same time . one subject taker can spend hi time for the subject onli , therefor it make him a profession of the subject . on the other hand , mani subject taker must spend hi time for each subject . so , wide subject taker may have just sharrow knowledg about each subject . thi is the wrong point of studi mani subject . but , i think , there is no reason to have profound knowledg . becaus profound knowledg is useless in the social life . exampl , while i am work , i use no deep academ knowledg . deep academ knowledg make no money .
