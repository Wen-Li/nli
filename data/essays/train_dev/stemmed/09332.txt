we live in an era where money is the most import thing for mani peopl . the seller of the product and the industri do n't care about the qualiti of the product , they onli want to make a lot of money fast . a good way to make a lot of money fast are good advertis . they show pic of product or say thing about the product that are not real . but often thi advertis make seem product much better than they realli are . a lot of food industri show pic of product that are complit differ from the real product . mcdonald for exampl show on their advertis not the product how they realli are . you can see on their advertis veri big hamburg with fresh bread and lot of ketchup . but in real they are differ , they are not so big and the bread is not so fresh . on the pictur they are show other hamburg that you becom in the fast food . it 's onli a fake . an other exampl are the cigarett advertis . for exampl the marlboro advertis . you can see a sane , handsom cowboy on a hors . it seem that marlboro cigarett are a good thing , but in realiti they are lead to a lot of disea . if think it should be a regolament about the advertis . that you can not say thing about your product that do n't correspond to the realiti , and that you can not show pictur that make appear the product better than it is . if somebodi show fake pictur of the product they should pay a fee . i think the industri should better concentr on the qualiti of the product . they should better use the money for increas the qualiti of the food and to make food that is better for our health .
