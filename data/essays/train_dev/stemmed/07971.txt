i am agre with thi statement becaus if a student understand idea and concept use anal fact he can reach quickli the learn of the fact . i think these are two differ way of compreant but a student can choos the one he prefer . there are some peopl who prefer studi from book and impress fact in their memori , other listen the lesson of the professor and understand the idea and the concept that can help him to reach fact stude just a littl bit . for exampl if you studi histori , you can studi the fact appen but if you do n't understand the reason which bring these fact you will find problem to colloc them in the progress of the stori . on the contrari understandig the ide or the fact which support the way adopt , you will be abl to reach the fact easier . i think that in some case understand concept and idea must be relat with exarcit and speriment . for exampl you can studi for a week math , you can make exercit but if you do n't understand the reson of the oper that you made you do n't will be abl to use it in a correct way . make exercit student can learn how to proceed in a correct way and make wrong oper they will be abl to understand the concept and don-t make the same error or mistak in the futur . we can associ thi process of exarcit or speriment with the studi of a foreign languag ; the most pratic way to learn a languag is to go stude in a countri where thi languag is the nation one . listen and talk with peopl is the easiest way to learn the languag .
