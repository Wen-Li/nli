although it 's import to learn idea and concept in textbook , i disagre the statement that it 's more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus the idea and concept are origin from fact . for exampl , capit , one of the econom idea , had been gener around 19th centuri in the unit kingdom when they made stock market . thi idea wa gener from the fact that the stock market wa made . the fact give the idea and concept when peopl tri to understand the phenomenon of fact . moreov , the new fact are not defin as idea and concept immedi sinc the idea and concept are produc through discuss of fact . it take time for peopl to gener idea and concept through the long procedur of discuss and comprehens . still we do n't know whi the pyramid in egypt were construct . thi is complet misteri of idea and concept . but we can learn the fact that pyramid were construct through histori . we could miss some point if we focu on onli idea and concept . needless to say , sometim the idea comflict with each other becaus peopl comprehend the fact individu and gener idea differ . those differ idea gener conflict . i assum that the war are induc sinc the happi is defin by individu peopl . for exampl , peopl in some countri believ in commun , one of the polit idea , and the other peopl believ in democrat . those might start war at some point . of cours , i agre it 's veri import to refer idea and concept in written texbook accord to fact becaus thi process help student to understand the fact better . howev , student should studi fact at first sinc those idea are alway origin from the fact .
