befor start thi argument , i would like to defin the term `` success '' as a achiev of what he/sh want to do . '' . base on the definit determin abov , i would agre with the statement due to the two reason . first , peopl who tri new thing basic know what he/sh realli want to do and have a strong will to achiev it . gener , for most peopl , find what he/sh want to do is veri difficult and peopl who are do what they alreadi know how to do well tend to have a hard time with thi process or stop think about it . for exampl , i have been work as an auditor for more than 5 year and i know what i am do well . although , the salari increas and i work more easili becaus of the experi recent , i doubt if i am do what i realli want to do and to achiev . the peopl who are tri new thing have alreadi gotton over thi question to themselv and is in at next stage . second , peopl how are do new thing are take risk at the same time . for exampl , as i mention in prior paragraph , i have been an auditor for 5 year and am work as a manger now . if i decid to leav my firm and to start new career in differ compani , i might have to start my career as a staff again . take thi kind or rik is veri difficult for most peopl . i respect their brave in conclus , base on the reason mention abov , i strongli agre with the statement .
