ye , i total agre well , nowaday mani peopl do not give enough time for help their commun especi the young peopl , becaus for exampl they are alway busi go out with there mate , and go to club and mall , play soccer , and mani other sport , that whi they do n't have enough time i guess , that what a young peopl at age of 10 to 18 year old peopl think about most of the time , well it actual depend on which countri your' talk about , becaus each countri differ from the other , for exampl in thi countri , young peopl and old peopl help their commun most of the time , like they clean the street sometim , that 's what me and my mate did last week to make our area clean and good look . in gener , most of the young peopl do n't help their commun in everywher most f the time , well my advic for all the young peopl is to help their commun no matter what situat he 's on , even if you help your commun for onli one day , that would be realli good , and about get an execus that you are busi , well i guess you can manag your time , like make a schedul , to know when to play and go out with your mate and when to help your commun . it 's not a hard job to do , it will take onli one hour or two hour maximum a day , that would be realli good .
