i think a basic knowledg is necessari , but in my oppinion our societi need more peopl who are familliar with one specif subject . have broad knowleg doe not necessarili help you to solv a specif problem . in my home countri for exampl , there are mani peopl who can handl a comput , but there are onli a few who have enough knowledg to deal with certain problem on their own . that 's one reason whi mani computerfirm hirer peopl from countri like india . thi situat is not so good for our inhabit , becaus often they do not get a job . thi is onli one exampl for whi special ha advantag for the economi of a countri . there is no doubt on that employe need a broad knowledg to be flexibl , if they for exampl lose their job , which is a great problem in our countri . but i think , if there are expert for almost everi area , a countri 's economi ha mani advantag , altough it is veri riski for the inhabit to special , becaus they may get no job in their specif academ subject . but as i said , there are mani advantag which support the idea of special in one specif area . but it shoulb be regard what size and capac the firm ha . a big compani ha mani employe and so each employe can handl a problem on hi own . if he need to know anyth about an other subject he can ask an other expert for help . so with the help of teamwork they can nearli solv everi problem . in smaller busi thi look a bit differ , becaus small firm can not afford so mani employe . so for smaller busi it is better to have a broad knowledg , so that you can solv mani differ problem .
