genarelais there are two differ academ educ approach : one beliv that is better to have a brite gener knowleg in differen feld , the other think it is better to special in a specif domain . though both posit have good argument i beliv that it is better to special on one fiel . first we have to admit that if a student is accept to a univers he or her ha be tought for around 12 year . thu the school schould have jet given a gener cultur , and had to present a panorama of the differ subject . thi is whi the student how enter in the univers normal ha alreadi choosen hi field of interess , and appli for a specif prepar in a scientit sector . secondari we schould not forget the obiect of unives an of a student self is to creat a proffessionist who is abl to manag with hi subject and eventu to reserch on it . who could be possibl to work and reserch on differ not relat topic in differ subject ? rare have the human be the faculti to manag on an higt level compet and knowledg of mani academ sector . we normal citat leonardo da vinci as a exept genial inventor . .. but of cours . . he is an exept . to conclud we schould integr the special in a well base background of genar knowledg . but at the univeris in my opinion is better to achiv the skill and to denvelop the knowlegd in one specif subject , than cultiv mani subject which knowledg are not deep enought .
