the statement that it is more import for student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact ha to be view care and from both contrast side . on the one hand it is of cours crucial for student to learn the fact of the class you 're take part of . thi is especi import in class that contain a lot of inform and fact like histori or medicin . most class also end with a test or an exam and in order to pass thi one succes you definet need to learn the fact by heart . on the other hand it is so much easier to learn the fact if you realli understood their idea and concept first . in thi way you are not stupidli learn the fact to reproduc them later in your exam , but you are abl to explain their mean and purpos . thi make it much easier to keep them in mind especi if you realli think about the concept and discuss them with other . in addit to that you should be awar of the point that you are not onli learn for school or univers but also for your whole life . especi on univers you are abl to get to know a varieti of thing that wo n't onli help you to achiev high grade in your exam but also prepar you for your later profession life and expand your gener knowledg . you definet wo n't learn that fast and easi anymor if you grow older and you 'll never get the possibilti to get to know so mani differ fact for free and with so much pleasur than you can get dure your studi . as i alreadi said , to my mind it is not possibl to simpli decid for one of the opportun . by express thi i mean that it is help to find a way in between them , a combin of both , which mean to first understand the fact and concept and then later on learn them as a prepar for your exam . that 's the way i do it at my univers studi and until now thi ha been a veri succes concept !
