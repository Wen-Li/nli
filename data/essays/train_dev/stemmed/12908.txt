i agre with the follow statement . it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in addit , in my opinion , it is hard to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . to learn fact , the student do not need to have their own idea , they just rememb these fact and it is realli hard becaus the fact do not have ani background , concept , and idea . for exampl , in the histori class , i often just rememb the fact , like what happen in 1945 , i just rememb a lot of event in the text book without think . as i thought , i got a great score on the test but a few day later , i forgot these event that i rememb . i did not understand about the event at all , just rememb them for the test . i think thi is not leanig or studi . i think everi thing have reason and result . when i am interest in someth that i have not known i alway think of the reason and result , not the fact . for instanc , in histori class , the theacher taught me mani thing which have been happen and mani peopl who affect to mani thing . i preffer to think about whi they did so than what is happen becaus there is mani reason and jener it is so complex . it is realli interest to me and i notic that if i could understand their idea , concept or detail , i never forget these memori . i wa realli interest in japanes histori and especi , ryouma sakamoto . he is realli famou person in japan and he ha mani strategi for life . i research about him and hi effect , and i think i could understand hi idea and comsept . now , i never forget about him becaus i could understand hi idea and concept , not onli thing that he did . if peopl want to understand someth correctli and deepli , i think peopl should to understand the idea and concept , not onli fact .
