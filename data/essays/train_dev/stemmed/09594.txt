i complet agre with the given statement . it is inde far more import for student to understand idea and concept in gener than it is for them to simpli learn fact . i believ so for sever reason , howev , my main argument behind these reason is the import of flexibl and creativ for deal with problem in a chang world . if student are taught static knowledg , they can onli learn a limit amount of fact , which might not prepar them for problem they will have to deal with dure their work . learn to understand idea and concept on the other hand , allow them to gain new knowledg whenev neccessari . it provid them with a more gener skill that can be appli in all kind of situat and to solv all kind of unanticip problem . i think thi sort of gener skill and flexibl becom ever more import in these fast chang time . the valu of knowledg understood in term of fact more and more decreas . in the face of contemporari scientif progress , what is held to be fact and truth today may well turn out to be untru tomorrow . the preper provid by univers can not be veri specif . student of the same subject are like to work in differ sector later on . it is often said that learn in fact begin after graduat . the relev `` hard fact '' requir for a certain work are anyway more like to be acquir dure work . so , concentr on learn fact in most case mean memoris a lot of fact which will never be of use . in contrast , concentr on learn concept creat flexibl for a varieti of task , for chang biographi , for a chang world . flexibl is in the contemporari world a major key to success . it is therefor a crucial skill of univers graduat to be abl to find solut to all kind of problem which might occur by appli knowledg in a flexibl and creativ manner , base on the more gener idea and principl they have gain understand of dure their studi .
