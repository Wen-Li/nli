it is a difficult question , but for me , the choic is clear . i disagre that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are two reason ; the prevent of the realliti and the conclut of the reliabl relationship between retail and custom . the first reason is the prevent of the realliti . it is base on the situat that custom ordin make a judg from the advertis whether they buy it or not . i think advertis should be bese on the product . the role of the advertis is tell custom what the product ralli are and what point are distinguish on other product . the advertis should be neesd the realliti of the product . the second reason is the construct of the reliabl relationship between retail and custom . the advertis explain about the product , so the custmer can buy it without anxiou . those are my opinion . thu , i disagre the follow statement .
