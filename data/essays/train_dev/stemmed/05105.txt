is it more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ? by learn fact it is possibl for the student to get access to lot of inform . huge topic and their content can be pass in a minimum of time . but certainli the student will forget a lot of inform as fast as they have just learn them . if student have mainli to understand the idea and concept of a theme they need more time to pass the same quantiti of inform but they do reali know it and will not forget it as quickli as they do if they would just learn it without understand . so both side ha their posit and neg argument . the quantiti of inform on the one hand , the long time argument on the other hand . is it better to have a lot of inform in your brain you do not reali understand or would you be better of with some inform you can handl and understand ? well , the best way is sure the intermedi way . everi student ha to find hi balanc between learn fact and understand idea . there are certain thing you do have to know but do not need to explain and the other way around . if you studi scienc for exampl you have to learn a lot of fact and there is no chanc you will ever understand all of them . the topic are just to huge and for instant everi process you learn is so complex that it is just not possibl to fulli understand it . so one should not concentr on just understand idea ( thi would take a lifetim ) neither one should just learn fact . you would not know what to do with them . it is just danger becaus if you do not know what you do and someth occur what you have not learn , you are helpless . refer for the question of the essay , there is no `` more import '' . it is as import to learn fact as to understand idea and concept . if student go to an extrem they will find out that thi doe not work . today societi is complex , the human natur and a lot of process are complex too . if you studi you tri get in to a certain topic , a topic which is also complex . just if learn and understand are combin in balanc a student can be long time successful .
