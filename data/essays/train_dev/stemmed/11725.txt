the question if it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than to special in one particular subject is not easi to answer . first of all mani academ field need a specialis to explor new develop that broaden the understand of the relat research field . thi are especi the human scienc were process becom more and more complex and a particular research propabl would not profit from knowledg in a field not relat to hi work . in contrast to that there are mani academ field were a broaden understand of differ scienc can help you enorm , as mani field are interact each other . the whole world is involv in the global process , so new commit between peopl , countri or institut are made , that had no ealier contact . busi manag have to face new partner belong to an other cultur , that could lead to misunderstand , if the peopl do not have the relat cultur skill . from my person point of view , i appreci to have a broad knowledg of differ academ subject . studi european studi with a focu on polit scienc , it is absolut necessari to have skill in sociolog to understand what societi as well as part thereoff are think about variou step of polit integr on the european level . thi also includ skill in european law , as you are not abl to archiv your polit goal without know the particular law system , thi appli at east on function democrci . addit , my econom skill are import as without their function the whole system would collaps , so you alway have to take differ posit of view into account , befor make a particular deciss from your own point of view . summar i would say that it is depend on your academ field to choos in favor or against a broad knowledg . on the one hand there are definitli expert need to be sure that scientif process goe on , but on the other hand in mani differ occass a broader understand of differ academ field is use to act secur in a world becom more comprehens .
