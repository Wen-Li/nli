i disagre with thi statement . i think it is much more import to learn fact that actual illustr an idea , than to understand concept and idea . inde , the latter are abstract and thu , more difficult to memor . on the other hand , a fact talk from itself . onc for exampl , in market we are taught a lot of theori which are said to make a product more attract , or to make a firm more succesful ; we have to learn these theori by heart which is difficult for a lot of student , as they do n't have the opportun to actual test thi idea . fatc would actual help them to understand each and everi step of the theori , and understand whi there ha to be a theori by practic . thi way of learn is what student of work-studi program experienc . they are taugh a lot of exampl about the theori they are about to learn , and they have to practic what they are learn , and to learn what they practic . for instanc , they will spend two week at shool , dure which they will analys sever exampl on a select topic , and learn the theori . the next step will be two week at workdur which they will have the chanc to tri , experi , and test what they have been taught . and thi process happen everi month . thi method make it more easier for the student becaus they have the opportun to put their knowledg in practic . and if they do n't understand a point dure class , they will have the opportun to get to understand it dure their practic week , and to ask proffession about the question . learn fact should be the first step in the learning-process , follow by the theori step , and then , by the put-in-practic step .
