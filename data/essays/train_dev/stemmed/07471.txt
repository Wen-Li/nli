if someon onli know a lot fact ( like date , name , locat , time period etc. ) , he is definetli predestin to be the next candid on the show `` who want to be a millionair '' . but if he doe not know the support idea and concept that actual connect all the singl fact to a logic whole , he is of no greater use for anyth els . in my opinion , it is our understand of idea and concept that determin our abil to think analyt and to develop new idea and concept of our own . i therefor agre with the statement . student go to school and to colleg in order to get prepar for their profession life in the futur . in most case , their career will not depend on their knowledg of certain fact but rather on their abil to understand and grasp the whi behind those fact and eventu creat someth new on their own . consid a busi econom student : if he is go to work in some busi in a free economi , he need to be abl to understand for instanc the competitor ' success with a particular product . it doe not help to do that the competitor produc that product and that it successful in do so . rather it is necessari to understand the concept behind the product , that make it successful . in other word , he need to know whi the product is sold so well . therefor , it is import that student learn how to analyz fact and situat . accordingli , teacher have to emphas on critic think and understand rather than learn by heart . now consid a biolog student . if he want to work for the research and develop depart of some big pharmaceut compani , he must sooner or later be abl to to improv exist medicin or even invent one himself . he can onli do so by firstli understand the ill and what it doe to the human bodi . or he ha to understand how an alreadi exist medicin work and in which way it could be improv . the former student therefor reli on hi abil to understand a concept in order to improv it or creat a new one . again , thi clearli show that it is most import to train student to develop a keen analyt sens . these two exampl can onli give a small impress of how import understand idea and concept is in contrast to simpli learn them . but i am sure that focus on understand will help ani student who want to work in a challeng surround .
