i absolut disagre with thi statement . whi should enjoy life be base on age ? sure , young children have a lot of fun play around and laugh about simpl thing and just enjoy mostli everyth they do but i also know a lot of older peopl that still enjoy their life veri much . a good exampl are my grandpar . they are almost 80 year old and are happier than ever . they had to start work realli hard when they were teenag . both of them work almost all the way up to their 65th birthday . they have 4 son togeth , so you can imagin that it cost a lot of time and work to rais the children . now , the son are adult and alreadi have famili themselv . my grandpar are retir now , so their hard work life is over and they can just enjoy life . their usual day includ long walk through the natur and spend a lot of time with friend and famili . they have a nice hobbi : bowl . everi thuesday afternoon they meet with other peopl at the same age in a bowl center near their hous and just enjoy bowl and talk to good friend . they often come over to my parent ' hous on the weekend . sometim the whole famili , includ all 4 son and all their grandchildren meet there and we sit togeth and have coffe and cake . my grandpar have so much they enjoy . last yaer they even made a lifelong dream of them come true , they went on a vacat to the swiss alp . they spent 2 wonder week there . they took tour along the mountain , had a picknick in between a veri nice land sceneri . after they came back and told us all about the trip we almost got a littl jealou . they were so excit and now they are even plan to go back there next year . so you see older peopl enjoy life just as much as young peopl , mayb sometim even more .
