car are one of the major mean of transportnow a day . mani peopl use car as they are more convieni mean of transport . they save time and energi in reach our destini . but in my opinion in com twenti year their will be fewer car than they are now . firstli now a day most car run on petrol , desiel , gasolin . these are fossil fuel . due to increas in the popul over past 20 year , more car came into market there is a great demand for the fuel . but the fuel reserv are limit . thi lead to the shortag of the fuel in the com year . more over due to high demand for the fuel the fuel prise will go up . the rise in the fuel price can not be afford by the common man. thi will make him look for other mean of transport may be public transport such as buse , tram . due to advanc of technolog the price of the car decreas rapidli , thi decreas in the price made comman man to own a car . as the popul is increas mani peopl start own a car , thi lead to the traffic congest in the citi and town . the present road may not be suffici to accomod the car present , and it is difficult to expand the road to the reqir of the peopl own the car . thi lead to traffic jam and take lot of time reach their destin which wa the advantag of own a car . so most peopl will avoid car in the com year . due to increas in car the pollut increas rapidli . there will be a lot of air pollut and nois pollut . thi lead to the global warm . to avoid damang there is no other option than control the polut . take these effect into consider the gover may concentr on the public mean on transport , as thi save fuel , pollut and traffic congest . earlier peopl thogth that have a car is prestig but in futur they feel it head ach to own a car and maintain it , they will move for other better mean of transport in com year .
