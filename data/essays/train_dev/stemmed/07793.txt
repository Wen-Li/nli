i definit think that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , rather then specialis in one specif subject . firstli , in my opi it is necessari to have a broad view on a varieti of subject in order to understand our increasingli complex world . secondli , innov , whether in the field of scienc , busi or polit , is often lead by peopl who have a cross-funt view . to begin with , the primari purpos of educ is to prepar student to face the world with the right skill and knowledg . the world we live in , it turn out , is increasingli complex . in order to succeed in thi world , it is necessari to have a broad understand of sever subject . for exampl , an engin can not reli onli on it engin skill but should also commun on what he is do , as most of the great technic achiev of our time reli on a team rather then a singl person . then , a lot of innov result from appli a principl or idea taken from one field and appli it to anoth , which can onli be achiev by peopl who have a broad understand of sever field . the post-it is a good illustr . it ha becom a popular and use item in offic but it actual result from the invent of a glue that did not fix well enough to be use in a tradit way ! anoth strike exampl is the bridg that wa creat between comput scienc and biolog in the invent of neuron program . neuron program simul the mechan of the nervou cell of the brain , enabl the programm to learn . as a conclus , i think that student benefit from have a broad knowledg of sever subject , becaus it help them to tackl with the challeng of our modern world , whether as leader or as innov . of cours , thi should not prevent them from acquir more extens knowledg in a specif field .
