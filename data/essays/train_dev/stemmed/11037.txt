i fulli disagre with thi sentenc . some peopl say that it is more use to have bread knowledg of mani academ than to on specif subject . they argu that by two reason ; these day , much inform are more valuabl than ani other thing and it is more use if you find job . i , howev , have convinc evid to the contrari . first , some peopl argu that much inform are most valuabl . howev they do not see whi their argument is far-fetch . actual , inform is veri import to anybodi . also mani media provid variou inform ; like internet , tv news , and so on . so we can get a much inform by media . but they do not provid alway true . if you get wrong informatin , you could get disadvantag . so mani compani and peopl effort to find currect inform . therefor their argument which much inform are most valuabl , doe not stand to reason . second , some peopl claim that if you find a job , broad knowledg is more help . howev thi is not alway true . actual , theas day , mani compani reguir knowledg of specif subject when they employ person . if you have knowledg of specif subject , you will easier find a job . actual , mani compani emphasi that when they introduc their compani in univers or other place . henc , their claim , which is broad knowledg is more help , ha no persuas . therefor , with unswerv convict , i firmli disagre to have broad knowledg of mani academ . all in all , i strongli believ that it is better to special in one specif subject . it is more help anybodi .
