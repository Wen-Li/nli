regard the question of agre or disagre with the statement that indic that `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' , i would have to disagre . the main reason : whi pick one side of the balanc , when - at least in thi case - you can choos both ? i think that the specif knowledg of a subject doe not excus a person of know other subject , even if it is at a small level . knowledg alway complement our activ and , most importantli , it complement ourselv . knowledg make us more complet individu and better profession , no matter what activ , profess or craft we practic . imagin if the statement wa true . .. if we could onli pick one side of the balanc it could be inferr that an aeronaut engin would not be abl to sustain a convers with the louvr museum curat , for exampl . do you imagin what they both would be miss ? regard the second part of the statement reffer to `` broad knowledg of mani academ subject '' i disagre base on person experi . i 'm a journalist , and in my countri there 's a say that state that journalist have `` an ocean of knowledg . .. onli one inch deep '' . thi highli offend me , becaus it gener the idea that a journalist is not abl to conduct and actual investig on a subject ( becaus of hi lack of knowledg depth ) . on the other hand , i 've seen journalist use thi `` statement '' as an excus for their lack of knowledg and investig capac , which offend me even more ! whi not have specif subject knowledg combin with broad knowledg of other subject ? for me , thi is the perfect choic : it allow me to becom a more complet profession and person , and to talk and exchang idea with a varieti of peopl and profession , which deriv into constant learn of new thing . thi would also make the world a much `` social '' place : everybodi could satisfactori discuss topic and exchang idea with lot of differ peopl . the world would n't be made of `` knowledg ghetto '' ( engin vs . artist , musician vs . chemist ) . could you imagin the isol ? so let 's get all the knowledg we can , both broadli and specif . when it come to knowledg , do not choos a side , learn about them all !
