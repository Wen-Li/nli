nowaday there is a discuss about the youngster . it is that recent , do young peopl give enough time to help their comun ? in my opinion , young peopl do not give enough time to help to their commun , as it wa at past . at our time , there are lot of thing that youngster can wast their time with . firstli , most of the young peopl are wast time with comput . comput were made for peopl 's good at first but then it start to becom a toy or a game machin and no one tri to stop it , becaus game are a serious larg echonom resourc for the peopl work in thi sector . for exampl , young peopl can tri use comput and internet for search for the inform about their countri 's place in the world and featur predict about their countri . further more thi interest would make the young peopl more interest in their commun . secondli , i think that younng peopl are not take the lesson at their school so serious . there are import lesson given to the student at school about their commun like histori and geographi . in my opinion , everi person , relat to a commun , should know hi countri 's histori . also geographi is an import factor for a person to help his/her commun . these are just two factor for a person to help his/her commun that the educ of them are given at school . moreov school give the educ of love your countri , after your famili . these are all well known by peopl , but , howev , still peopl are not take serious and think school as gamefield . young peopl are like diamond . you should shape them , otherwis you can not expect anyth from them . they have to be shape , if they are want to be the saver of the commun . so if a youngster doe n't give enough time to help his/her commun , it is also his/her famili 's fault .
