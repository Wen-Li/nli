it is gener believ that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . our societi tend to put older peopl in the corner and to see them as depress and useless . such gener point of view is mislead and i person do not agre with the statement . i will discuss whi young peopl are consid to be happier than older and to explain whi i do not agre wth the statement . first of all , young peopl experi a lot of new emot , both posit and neg , that are consid veri posit in our mind . secondli , the physic strength of a young person allow them to do extraordinari thing . nevertheless , experienc a lot of emot or be veri strong doe not impli be happi and it is not what older peopl are look for . in my opinion , older peopl do not need strong emot or extraordinari thing to feel happi . in gener they choos to do what they realli want to do . in fact with their experi they are abl to enjoy life simpli read a book or visit a museum , thing that are gener not consid excit by young peopl . i think that thi changement is due to a physiolog evolut of the brain throughtout life and to the capabl of understand their own limit as well as their own sourc of pleasur . in conclus , i do not agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl , but i just believ that older peopl enjoy their live simpli in a differ way . as i wrote abov thi is strictli bound to the fact that human mind chang dure life as well as human be doe .
