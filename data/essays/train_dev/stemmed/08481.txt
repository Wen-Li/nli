i disagre with the follw statement . in fact , i hope to becom a person that i 'll be special in one specif subject . now , i 'm studi mechan engin at the univers and when i 'll be finish , i 'm go to work in an industri factori . so thi is one reason on about i do n't agre with that opinion . in fact i have to learn alway and alway knowledg about mechan problem becaus thi is a condit that it 'll let me to enter facili in the world of job . so i still have to studi more to reach that goal . in spite of thi consider , to have broad knowledg of mani subject is a condit that can also give import result for the futur . to know other argument such as economi , literatur or foreign languag is anoth opportun and , with thi cultur you can have interest result to improv your career . but i think that it 's better to know onli a sector of own job . mayb , one explan can be given . until i wa a young boy and i wa ten year old , i just had a clean idea about what i'b have want to do when i 'd have becam an adult . so i alway want to be an engin . my father is an engin and also my grandfath wa an engin and mayb thi can be one factor of my choich and of my opinion about thi statement . so , i went to the tecnich school and i receveid a diplom as mechanich . now i am a student of politecnico univers and hope to have the degre as soon possibl .
