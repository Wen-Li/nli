in my opinion , i would agre with the statement that say , `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' but student have to learn both concept and fact . then they have to compar between them and decid . and sometim fact chang with the daili increas in scienc feild like physic . for exampl peopl use to think that earth is like the sphere then it wa found that it is not exactli a sphere but ha an oval shape . and fact too that dinasour were just myth till they found the bone of real dinasour . so when a student understand cocept and idea , he can think and use hi brain and mayb discov someth that can chang fact . but thi still doe n't mean that they should n't learn fact . they have to learn fact but concept and idea are more import . let say for exampl the law of motion they are concept but they were use in may discoveri after that . whi the first fact wa that when you throw an appl in the air it fall back . therefor fact are import but concept and idea are need for student and well after that scientist to discov thing . on the other side fact are veri import too . for exampl the fact that if you jump out of the window of the 7th floor , you will die . if someon doe n't know thi fact in the end he is go to die just becaus he want to know what will happen if he jump but that a far exampl becaus in our day thi would never happen . other thing is the fact that human ca n't just disappear . but by studi concept and idea and do test . you find that you can trick someon and you can not be seen if you walk slowli and walk in the dark part without make nois . illus too is that you use concept that human mind ca n't explain so you trick peopl by do that . so in the end both concept and fact are import . but concept are more import .
