mani believ that in the earlier stage of life , you are most like to have more ` fun ' than that of in the later stage . there is even a say in korea which say , when translat , ` enjoy life whilst you 're still young ! ' . my opinion on thi topic is that , peopl 's enjoy in life doe n't depend on the age of that human be , but the perspect , experi they have encount , and the situat the peopl are in . my reason for believ thi is becaus firstli , person look at my parent , hear their experi of their daily-l , i pictur happi , laugh , relax peopl , not stress over homework , project , test , what they 're go to be later on in their life , or their duti in the hous . occasion i even wish i wa a fulli grown person , to have a job , and not stress over of choos what job i 'm go to get . i believ that i am not the onli one who ha idea simliar to thi , especi 12th grade student , who are prepar to play their role as a fulli grown adult in the societi . secondli , sometim when my parent have too much to do , they tend to look at my sister and i and say someth along the line of ` you are veri lucki to be so young , not to have ani worri or concern on the problem of the real world ' . they say that they wish they could go back in time and re-liv their live as an adoles . sum up , i think that everi human be ha a differ opinion on thi topic whether old or young , affect by their person experi , the environ around them , and the situat they are in . a young one may look like they \ re enjoy life to anoth older person , and visa versa .
