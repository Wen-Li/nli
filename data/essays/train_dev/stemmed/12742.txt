i partli agre with the statement that young peopl now a day donot give enough time to help their commun becaus of the lack of time and do u lack of awar . it also depend on the individu attitud of the peopl . most of the young peopl have a busi schedul and they dont find time in help their commun . again it depend on their individu attitud . i have seen mani peopl who wantedli neglect . they wantedli neglect and think help commun is wast of time even though they have ampl of time . young peopl alway tri to find fun and act reluctantli when they ask to help . it is becaus they are not awar of the benefit and the happi they get out of it . studi alon dont count you should also have help natur . on the other side there are mani youth organis who specif aim at help their commun and peopl in need . we have mani blood bank where mani young peopl come and regist everyday . they collect blood and send them to hospit when need for free . they organis event and give prize for those who donat blood to inspir young peopl we also have organis who go around and collect money and send them to peopl who get effect byenvironment disast . when the tsunami catastroph left mani peopl homeless these youth organis collect huge amount of money andhand over to them and won their heart . so it is not that young peopl dont help , it is that they dont spend time due to lack of awar . it is onli possibl by young peopl becaus they are energit and dynam in what ever they do all we need to do is motiv them and tell about import of help . elder should teach young peopl about help peopl and spend some of their time for those activ . so i conclud that young peopl dont give enough time for help but they are not so cruel that they dont extend a help hand when need .
