some peopl believ that it is better for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . they think that student get benefit by studi other idea and concept and use it as a derictori in thier live and thier educ jaurni , they may use as an exampl for that the old concept about the shape of the earth and how it had been hold until it wa aprov . i total disagre with thi concept for mani reaso , first of all thi concept and idea might be wrong so it is redicul to make student hold them . in contrast , we can let them develop thier won under our opserv . also , some of these concept are harm , for exampl , it is until recent in my cultur background , poepl inheret and believ the stori about how sertain tribe member are abl to come back after thier death . the third reason oppos thi concept is that student are the futr . at the time they will be in charg , they need thier won idea and concept to deal with it becaus the everi new day the world chang . in conclos , i disagre with the statement becaus of variat of the relibilti of the idea and concep content , the posibl of it is harm , and to allow them develop their own .
