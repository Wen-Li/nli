well in my opinion have broader knowledg in mani academ subject will be better than have monarchi in one subject . man learn basic to earn hi live . in thi fast gener what subject get boom at what time can not be expect . so if u learn a particular subject when it is in boom sometim it also happen that while the time you learn the subject it loos it import . quot an exampl java wa famou few year back but now the boom of sap ha come , in the same way knowledg of comput hard ware wa not learnt by mani but now peopl attend special class to learn comput hardwar . the grow competit is demand them to learn hardwar along with softwar . anoth exampl which impli to my opinion is a person who is learn danc . it would be difficult to him to just danc without ani minim knowledg of music . hi learn will be incomplet . in the same way the basic acens of learn is to gain complet knowledg . have knowledg of one subject can not fullfil the requir of complet knowledg . even though a person is call `` jack of all trade '' when he or she tri to gain knowledg in mani subject the fast grow world which is hungri for mani more new invent to come is demand him to be `` the jack of all trade '' . with such talent onli one can surviv thi world of highli competit natur . also when we learn differ subject a person can relat them and thi can help him at the time when he get interest in research or thi knowledg itself can drive him to relat and make new invent . have one subject can also make us feel bore . have knowldg in one subject will be like eat bread onli for the entir life . thi sound difficult ! henc i conclud that have knowledg in all subject would be a better choic than to get specal in one subject .
