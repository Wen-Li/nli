i 'm not sure about the real mean of the word succesful near the word peopl . so , in order to tri to answer to the question , i can tri to look to my experi . throughout new thing and take risk you can obtain more benefict but , in the same way , you can easili go to the bankrupti . howev , actual , if you search the success you must tri new way as well as our parent do . the standard and the global made all of us at the same level and so for emerg you will find mani problem becaus there will be alway anyon that make your job better . in the other hand i think that if you know well your job and you work with attent and expeci with passion you will recogn by other that , for exampl , will prefer spend more money with a qualiti or tradit product instead of pay the multin that producu your product at a lower price . we can think to the `` made in itali '' in opposit to `` made in china '' . whi the peopl continu to buy product with a higher price ? in my opinion you will can be a succesful person both tri new thing and do well what you alreadi know . the main featur that you should have is the passion for your job . if you had thi capac you will be abl to continu to do what you alreadi know how to do and to tri new way or new thing with less risk . in that way you will be a succesful person . the realiti is that you are a succesful person when you feel so .
