nowaday , mani student are studi mani academ field and at the same time , it is a problem wether they must have broad knowledg or special knowledg . i agre with the idea that it is better to have broad kowledg of mani academ field . there are two reason for thi . first of all , broad knowledg is base of all academ skill . for exampl , in my univers , i must have taken mani field of lectur in my first grade . afterward , i studi a specif subject , commun . becaus i learn mani academ field , i studi my major more effect . moreov , know mani academ field can be use in mani way . for instanc , when a doctor make up hi mind to start hi job as a doctor , it is import where to build the hospit , what age of consum in each area , and so on . that is the time when busi manag or psycolog are use . secondli , common sens is need for live in societi . for exampl , i live in japan and especi in japan , compani strongli hope new worker to have common sens becaus japanes are have less and less common sens these day . for these reason , i agre with that have broader academ knowledg is better . i think broden knowlwdg of mani academ field is base of our studi and lead to have common sens .
