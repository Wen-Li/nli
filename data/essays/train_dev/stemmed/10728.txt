famou research , import peopl or success star have a common point : they all look further afield , want to meet other peopl and to broaden their horizon . for all that , i think you can be success onli if you take risk , if you test and tri new thing ; so you can be success onli if you want or search someth you do n't have yet . famou and success peopl are veri often ambit and courag peopl . when we take a closer look at christoph colomb , bill gate or john ford , we can see that they all had someth in their person that encourag them to test , to search , to tri someth unknow and rather riski . how can you have sucess if you onli do what other peopl have alreadi done ? how can you have success if there is no origin in your prospect and object ? i will now tell you about a person experi to show you have sometim to take risk to succeed . becaus most of the time , the opportun do n't come to you . but you have to creat these opportun . here is my personn experinc : toward my final year at the secondari school , i had to combin a lot of thing : i had to studi for my `` baccalaureat '' , i had to take final exam in flute and piano , to obtain a certif in music theroy at the conservatoir in besancon , and to gain my drinv licens . a lot of peopl said i had to give up music . but i wa determin and i took the risk to continu my music and all my undertaken . thi wa riski . i could have fail . but i succede . and therefor i wa abl to find a veri interess placement in a big intern compani . to conclud , take risk and tri new thing is a veri import and unavoid condit to succeed . you have to be courag , to experi and to look further afield to success .
