i believ that special in one subject is better and more import in the world we live in today , than have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . have broad knowledg of mani academ subject can be veri good social sinc it allow the person to commun with peopl on mani subject . howev it is not enough in the societi that we live in today , sinc you can not have a decent job if you mere have broad knowledg of thing . job requir specif and thorough knowledg of a specif subject or subject . work as a lawyer for exampl requir thorough and indepth knowledg of the law and gener knowledg would not be enough to becom a lawyer . special in one subject mean that that person is go to becom realli good at that subject and that therefor he may pursu it in the futur . thi ensur that thi person will be abl to find a job in our now veri special world . someon who special in financ , for exampl , may work at a bank and then from there he can learn about mani other thing , which help in everyday life , and he can gain knowledg from have a job . therefor special lead to broader knowledg in other subject . special , as it wa discov and agre upon by most economist includ the `` father of econom '' , adam smith , lead to greater effici . thi is becaus someon who special in someth and doe it all the time discov way to improv upon it and therefor becom an expert in that field . thi ha led to an increas in the specialis of the workplac and job . that is way anyon who wish to succeed in life and have a job need to special in someth . due to all of thi broad knowledg of mani academ subject is not better than special in one subject , atleast not at thi point in time .
