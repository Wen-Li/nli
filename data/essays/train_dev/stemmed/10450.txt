broader knowedg for a broader world ? in my opinion , there is no deni adult need to be awar of variou issu , especi in a global system , becaus individu way-of-leav influenc global phenomena . school have a great role to play in order to give peopl thi knowledg , then peopl have to keep it in their mind their whole life along . first , let 's briefli summar what is a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . it is an educ which give key to understand the world in which he live to the student . histori , mathemat , languag , econom , philosophi , let 's call them all the scientif way explor by scholar for year to understand matter of common concern . terefor , teacher are greatli respons for children to becom open-mind adult , or on the contrari narrow-mind peopl . inde , teacher help children to learn the world is not limit to what they see . they can guid them throughout flow of pictur media publish everi day . becaus peopl need to learn earli to deal with huge amount of inform they daili get . and school is the onli area were everi child can receiv the mean to be abl to defend himself against wrong or bias inform . these mean broadli consist in strong knowledg of variou topic . then , adult will be abl to stand critic about inform they receiv . as a matter of fact , if they have learnt china is a communist regim , they will not trust everi inform publish by chines media . the same thing about advertis ; thank to a comprehens educ , with hisotri and econom , but also mathemat , he will be abl to better chose the product he need . he 'll fail less easili to notic lie . for all these reason , i think it is more import to have broad cultur . nonetheless , it doe not mean specialis scholar ar not need , on the contrari they play an essenti role in progress .
