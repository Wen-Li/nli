i agre with thi statement . the reason whi i think succes peopl are those who tri new and take chanc ha to do with thi behaviour be the more suitabl for adapt . befor i adress how these action may serv adapt purpos , we need to accept that life in modern societi , in old societi and even in most biolog system ( to cut to the chase ) is one of constant chang . in light of the constant chang in everday problem and neces , the lack of habil to tri new thing - or to be inov - will invari leav us lag behind , uncap to cope with even the most basic challeng . for instanc , imagin an alarm compani that decid not to chang their sale stategi becaus the long time way of `` do it well '' wa knock door by door to offer their servic directli into the costum face . in the era of internet shop for just about everyth , thi strategi would have foretold the collaps of the alarm sell time of thi compani . to point out on the need to take risk , thi compani , in the begin of the 70 's or 80 's would have had to start take chanc train their worker in the use of comput and comun technolog . it may have seem incred back then , that in 20 year a substanci amout of peopl would be purchas just about everth sit in front of a screen in the comfort of their oun home . but , what might have seem like take a huge risk , had to be done . therfor , i beliv that be inov and brave ( take chanc ) with work , famili and friend is the key stone of succes life . a life that may not onli cope with new challeng , but may actual improv the condit of those around us , and the condit insid ourself .
