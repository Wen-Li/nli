in my opinion , the car and other vehicl use for transport have a central posit in our modern societi . the use of car will therefor not decreas but even grow in the futur . to ensur that develop be sustain we have to make great effort in scienc and technolog . first of all , i am convinc that transport in gener is the heart of our modern world economi . the globalis of our world ha onli been possibl becaus of a broad and intens use of car , truck , ship and other vehicl . within thi process the structur of our modern economi got more and more focus on cheap transport and mobil . second , car a an import part of the peopl 's daili life in everi modern societi . we use car to travel , to work , to go shop and even to compet against each other ( e.g. in motocar race ) . besid that , it is an import statu symbol for mani upper and middl class peopl . in my opinion , the import and therefor the demand for car will increas substanti on a worldwid scale - especi in develop countri as china or india where the new emerg middl class is head for privat car . but there are also problem with a possibl grow number of car around the world : first of all , the exhaust fume and product process will caus a lot of environment damag . the second problem that aris is the question how all those car and vehicl can be fuel . the worldwid quest for petroleum and oil , from which ga for car is made of , is grow higher and higher . to challeng those two problem , scientist and car produc have to concentr on do research to find altern to the current car concept . there are promis idea and experi , but still no revolutionari new concept to assur a sustain use of transport vehicl in the futur . find those altern is absolut necessari to further enjoy the benefit the car bring to differ societi and economi around the world .
