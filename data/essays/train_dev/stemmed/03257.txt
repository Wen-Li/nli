i agre with the propos statement , becaus if peopl is success , thi is even becaus it ha been abl to take risk or to do thing that are not common to other all peopl . in fact if we could all abl to take risk , we should be all success peopl . but it 's no so ! a reason for which a man tri new thing could be that he want to give a support to the societi in which he live , improv the life of other peopl ( but even the one 's ) . it return on my mind the discoveri of great medic solut that have been use to a lot of peopl all over the world . but everi new solut or discoveri could bring even a great econom fortun to it inventor : accord to me , anoth reason could be that the inventor just would like to improv hi econom condit . perhap , i could be the first to do so ! i would like to give an exampl of a success peopl : he is the ceo ( i.e. chief econom offici ) of an italian telecomun industri , name 3italia . hi name is vincenzo novari . i 've had the fortun to follow him dure an univers lectur , in which he explain about hi person success and the success of hi industri . he said us that the biggest qualiti of 3 italia is that they tri new thing : thi to attract alway new client , but expeci becaus they want to have as distinguish characterist that they do n't want to do what the other competitor ( tim , vodafon italia and wind ) do . it seem to me a veri good purpos for have success and in fact the number give reason to novari : 3italia is grow in the number of client , and the biggest part of them is happi for have thi telecom .
