i mainli agre with that statement . but it is import in which relationship thi statement ha to bee seen . i think for exampl that it is correct if it is relat to languag . it is obviou better to speak a littl bit of english , french , german and italian than onli one of them perfectli . concern the profess i have to disagre with the statement . in today 's econom situat it is better to be specifi . the unemploy is so high that it is possibl to be well educ but yet unemploy if you are not special enough . on the other hand a broad knowledg of mani acadam subject can be better , if you have to manag for exampl your own firm and can not reli on other specialist . it is import to notic that a broad knowledg is the base for further knowledg in these area . so if you do not have ani varieti of knowledg it is much harder to gain experi in those unrev area . especi in the actual situat it is import to be flexibl and to be will to keep on learn dure your whole lifetim . if you were a specialist in one certain subject you probabl would not be will to listen to more actual inform becaus of your statu as specialist . it clearli depend on one 's charact but my oppinion is , that special is minor in contrast to a broad knowledg of mani subjet . as i state abov the base is the most import thing . afterward there is still time to special certain subject in which you are interest in . if you do not know all the possibl you can not be sure have chosen the right way . i would prefer a broad knowledg becaus then i stil have all possibl . if i special and chose wrong , i would be dissapoint . you do not know how the futur will be that is whi special is such a danger thing . it is better to be eventu less qualifi in a lot of subject than to be special in one which no one need . so in gener i would agre with the statement . special come after the broad base of mani academ subject .
