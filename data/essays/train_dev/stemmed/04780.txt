i disagre with the fact that in twenti year time there will be fewer car in use than there are today . infact i believ that their number would have gone up ten time . car have becom the most basic and primari mode of transport in the world today . from the time they were introduc until now , their number have gone up exponenti and there ha been no declin in their sale . provid both ride comfort and safeti , car have becom the basic necess for all and for some it ha evolv to becom a fashion statement and an articl of pride . peopl now a day , are in the fals belief that the use of car might stop in futur becaus the petroleum reserv are slowli get exhaust . but what they fail to realis that petroleum is no longer the onli sourc of power that can drive the vehicl . after year of research new technoligi have been devlop realis thi danger hybrid car are alreadi be produc and market . so are electr driven car . howev some research are work on use hydrogen as a fuel . sucess in thi will be the biggest break through ever in the field of automobil engin . hydrogen is avail is abund and it also ha a veri high calorif valu . thu capabl of produc greater power than petrol driven vehicl . in addit to thi the problem of pollut is also solv as , the onli exhaust that would come out of a hydrogen driven vehicl would be water . twenti year is a lot of time and by then thi technolog would have not onli been test but would be drive the entir world . see the latest innov in thi field , car with better look and aerodynam are be manufactur . in twenti year time concept car , which have alreadi taken a start , would be in full product . our world is full of peopl who admir beauti , safeti , comfort and most of all technolog . thu make car not a curs of the past but refin gift for the futur .
