i agre with the passag that state that success peopl tri new thing and take risk . it is good for peopl to do what they know how to do well , and probabl they will succeed on that topic but if they onli focu on that , they wo n't be as succes as they would have been by tri differ thing and take risk . i believ that the more new thing we tri , the more we learn , and therefor , the more chanc we have to feel that we made it to our goal , which i think is what defin sucess in life . but of cours the risk should not be ani type of risk , for exampl , open a new busi like the restaur , would be a risk for peopl that do not have the expertis on that type of busi but if they ask for advic from expert on that area and make a sound judgement of the possibl of that particular busi , it is good to take the risk . anoth exampl of a type of risk that peopl can take in order to reach sucess , is take the chanc to appli to a univers to get a degre . some peopl think that they will be reject and becaus of that they just keep in the same possit that they are at that moment , mayb becaus they have a fear of failur . if they do not work hard to get what they want and do not risk the possibl of feel reject , it is someth that , i believ , will affect them in the futur when they think about the thing they have done in their pastw and did not do it . that wo n't make the person feel sucesss . for all these reason , i believ that sucess peopl should take risk and learn to do new thing in life .
