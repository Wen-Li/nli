from past 20 year one of the groom industri is automobil industri . it show it impact on all part of the world . there is a gradual increas of car everi where . i dont think that number of car will be reduc after some year . instead therewil be more number seen than what today . they are pali major role in transport . firstli , car are ragard as statu symbol for mani peopl . they buy it just to show their statu rather use it for some genuin reason . car seem to have drastic impact on everi class of peopl stare from lower middl class to upper class . so nowayo a car can be disappear . . seconli they are consid to be more comfortbl . car is preferd becaus it is easi to raech our destin rather wait for some public transport . it dont give much stress and make peopl get relax when compar to other mean of transportaion . ani time it can be use and make our work done in a cool way insta of rush for other way . final , now a day the price of car are also declin due to some reason . so they are affordbl by even a middleclass person which again symbolis rise in the car popul . be a car owner ani person can make a plaln spontaniuosli and even implement it . like plan for a picnic . and exampl whi anyon go for car is it may be use for all purpos both for offici and person thing . and car doesnt realeas much of the ga and it is not the victim for pollut too . car not onli serv as person but they are even use as public transpot like taxi . so car ha it effect on everi walk of man 's life to reach the destin and to enjoy luxieri too . i conclud that i cant imagin road without a car as it carri mani advantag .
