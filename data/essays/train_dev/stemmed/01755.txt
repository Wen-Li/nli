peopl have saver thing for get in knowledg . there is mani train subject that peopl have broad knowledg in one specif subject or in mani academ subject . i do n't agre with both of it . i think peopl should have knowledg in one specif subject and also mani academ subject . becaus there is mani problem in the world and much of them ca n't solv by know one subject . it requir mani knowledg about differ subject . for exampl , in engin problem you have to know mathemat , phsic and also chemistri to solv it . i think a person also must be good at one subject and he know everyth in thi subject . thi give a person self convid for exampl i 'm an engin and i know mani thin about steel , if ani bodi ask me some question about it , i enjoy to tell him what he ask and i enjoy read someth about it that can be in inthernet or in newspap . and other reason for have more academ subject is that make peopl open mind . for exampl , if a writer know someth about histori , he can write better . know event in the past give him new opinion about what will happen about peopl . have broad knowledg in one spesif subject help peopl to find a job . i think if you are realli realli well in one subject peopl need your opinion and your work . becaus compani hire 2 or 3 person for a subject but if you demostar them you 're best in it , compani prefer to hire onli one . i think that onli have knowledg of mani subject ca n't be good for us and also have knowledg in one spesif subject ca n't help us at all . peopl need both of it for be awerag than other .
