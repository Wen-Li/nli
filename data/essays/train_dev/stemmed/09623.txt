i definit agre with the statement at hand . in fact , in my opinion , thi is the main goal of educ itself . educ should give to the student main idea and concept , thing that the student can absorb , make their own , and use as a basi for further educ or even for their choic in life . fact are like evid in a trial , thing that support the main idea and concept . the student have to read the fact , understand them and , even more import , understand how the fact give an exampl or an explan of the main idea . they are veri import for the understand process , but at the end they are notion , they are someth specif that we learn at eventu we forget . on the contrari , what realli last in our memori is the main idea , the concept and thi is the veri import thing . the first exampl that i can cite is histori . when we studi histori we studi a larg number of fact , date , event , mean that we learn a larg amount of notion , that we are most like go to forget in the futur . but all these fact are necessari to understand what happen in a specif period and to analyz the caus and effect that took place in those year . the fact are the instrument at our dispos to build a broader vision of the period at hand and to have a gener idea of the econom or sociolog or religi forc that interact in that histor moment . even if we eventu forget the specif date or fact , we still keep a concept , an idea of what wa happen in the past . moreov i think that it is sometim even imposs for our mind to store and rememb all the notion and inform we read . comput databas are in fact veri good instrument to store and retain inform . our mind , on the contrari , ha the wonder abil of elabor inform , put them togeth and draw conclus , in form of main idea and concept . again , we see what is realli import : idea and concept . in conclus i definit agre with the statement at hand as i demonstr with the exampl i gave .
