i do not agre that the best way to travel is to be a part of group which is led by a tour guid , i feel so becaus i do not enjoy much when i travel in group with more peopleand led by a tour guid , especi with peopl who i do n't know much . eventhough travel with group led by tour guid is quit comfortableand have lot of advantag , i feel it ha mani other drawback . first of all time is an import factor , i feel that travel in group with a tour guid will not give us enough time to spend in all place we visit , more over they follow a schedul which may not be alway accept to all peopl . recent i went to nigara fall there we contact a tour guid and we were ask to join a larg group who also were visit the same palc , he wa so quick and did not allow us to spend more time in certain place which we realli like , we felt that we realli miss a lot of fun by join the group . the second reason that i peref to travel alon is that i find it challeng to fine my self variuo place to be watch , i realli enjoy it . furthermor if we travel in a group led by tour guid , he provid a lot of un interest inform which i realli do not enjoy and feel as wast of my valubl time , if i were travel myself i would have avoid it and would have spent more time in certain place i realli like . the other factor that make me to prefer travel alon is food , if we travel in group the tour guid will suggest some restuar for have food dure tour which may not includ my choic of a particular place and is not possibl becaus it will delay the schedul of the tour guid or out of reach dure the time allot by the tour guid , for exampl in my tour to nigara fall we want to have good food at a particular indian restaur , we could not have that as he stop hi tourin vehicl some where els which can not be reach with in the time allot by the tour guid overal i prefer to travel alon
