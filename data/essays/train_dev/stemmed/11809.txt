in my person opinion , i agre with the statement , that defin success peopl as the person who tri new thing and take risk rathern than onli do what they alreadi know . i consid that succes peopl share thi definit , in the sens , that peopl that doesnt tri new thing , experi , or adventur will suspend or shorten out their knowledg , convert them into not succes peopl and standard peopl . if you have that spirit of investig , like in tri new way of find certain knowledg , you could consid yourself as a succes peopl . other import thing , is that if you are scare of tri new experi or new method , that at first could seem rare or odd , you coud never have the believ that you are go to succ in the life . if you studi the histori , you could find some exampl of scientist like gramman bell , franklin and mark twain , that assum mani risk on their investig and tri hundr of time their experi , here they never settl up . now their discoveri and their knowledg are recogn in the world wide , and they were success and recogn scientist . thi scientist never declin in their idea of investig new thing , thi characterist permit them to go beyond the other peopl that dont tri or investig new thing . alway , when you tri new thing , you have a porcentag of fail in what you are do or of get your objet , but imag if you take the risk and invent someth that nobodi have reach to . i can support my afirm , with some particular exampl in my life . in order to have all what i had , my father had to affront new thing , sometim he fail on what he start , and other time he achiev the goal . becaus of thi argument , i consid him as a succes man in life . in conclus i consid that by tri new thing , you could convert into a better huamn and also a success person .
