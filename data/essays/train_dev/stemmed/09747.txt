` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ' - i complet disagre with thi statement . i believ that one can not generalis thi concept base on a criteria like age . one can definit enjoy life irrespect of age . it is all a matter of individu prefer , tast and situat . i have seen veri gloomi young peopl with absolut no spirit or enrgi to enjoy life . at the same time i have met veri energet and joy old peopl who ensur that they enjoy each and everi moment of their life to the fullest . one can enjoy life if he ha a good compani and good circumst too . it not the youth or old age that decid thi . it may appear that young peopl enjoy more as they hang around with friend in big group make nois , smoke , drink and parti all night . but i believ that the concept of enjoy is differ for differ individu . for exampl - i do not need to go to a disothequ to enjoy life but i enjoy life as it is - i enjoy the first rain of the season , i enjoy the fragranc in the air after that first rain , i enjoy my morn cup of coffe with the newspap , i enjoy sit at night and chat with my freind - and all thi i will even enjoy when i am old . in fact i feel that old peopl have more to enjoy . they have ampl time especi if they are retir from their job . they have the entir day with them to enjoy . they do not have to worri about work pressur . they have beauti memori and experi of life that to cherish and feel happi about . at that age they have an entir life to look back upon and feel relax that they have achiev so much . wherea young peopl have so mani worri with them alway - first school then colleg then work then marriag then kid and so on and so forth . in nutshel , it 's not the age that make one enjoy life - rather it 's the spirit that make you live life to the fullest enjoy each and everi moment of it .
