i strongli agre to thi statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are two reason whi i believ that the statement is correct . young peopl nowaday do not have much free time and do not have time to think about their surround , and they also tend to be extrem lazi and are not will to help for their commun . these day it seem to be that young peopl have a veri tight schedul . most teenag have school till the even , and some may even have extra curricular activ or part time job to earn some pocket money . unlik befor , young peopl are veri independ and use time wise which would benefit them in ani possibl way . sinc they have a tight schedul and do not have other spare time other than think about themselv , they do not give enough time to help their commun . in addit to their tight schedul , young peopl nowaday are extrem lazi . thi may be becaus of the fast develop techonolog , such as use of comput , and easi access of transport to place . teenag are especi lazi when it come to solv problem . they believ that they have better thing to do than help their commun , and avoid volunt work . howev , problem may chang onc money come into an issu . young peopl nowaday love money , and they would most like do anyth which involv earn money . if the govern make thi commun help as some sort of a part time job , young peopl may find some interest in help . today , young peopl are much more independ than they were befor , and are extrem self center . i believ that thi problem should deffin chang as soon as possibl . in thi way , young peopl would learn that help other is an import aspect in their live .
