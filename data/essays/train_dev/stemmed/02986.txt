in my opinion , succes peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . becaus of their charact , they are succes . for exampl , the architect build build . aldo rossi is one of the succes architect . he ha a lot of drawn , industri design , build . in hi school year , hi teacher didnt like their drawn and build . they made him to draw the way they want . if he didnt do the teacher want , he didnt graduat from the univers . so he give up studi in univers . then in hi work , hi boss want him to draw the way hi boss want . he didnt give up drawn . he ha alotof drwane alten about one build . in addit to thi one drawn about hi design is not enough for him . so you can alotof drawn about one of the build . also he search while design . he alway tri alot of altern about hi design . so he take risk . for exampl : hi build or hi design arent sold or like by the peopl . in addit to thi other architect disagre with him about the build or hi design . but to explor new thing ( pozit or neg ) make him more success . by the way thi make he is differ from the other architect . by tri new thing and take risk help him while other design . he can easili improv himself and her career . so her design and product are not similar . in architectur the varieti is veri import . so aldo rossi is veri success architect . on the other hand , if he onli do what he alreadi know how to do well , he repeat himself and hi career . so aldo rossi isnt known as a succes archtect in the world . in conclus , tri new thing and take risk is veri import in our career . if we want to be success , we alway do the best that we can .
