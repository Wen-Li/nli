i do not agre with that statement , becaus in twenti year there will be more car than now becaus of the peopl they will be more number than now . for exampl if there is small famili and they have onli one car later after the sun or douater they will be adult should they have anoth car becaus they need to go to the univers or the collag to studi if it is far from the hous . anywar if the peopl in the world they will increas the car must be to increas , and with dilat of the build and in the distans all of the peopl need the car . the car it is veri import in our life . it is notlogicali that we have all these street and rood just to use there for twenti year . some countri did not develop enough to use car proberli . therefor with the modern world the will be more and better inject .
