i agre with the idea that is better to develop knowlegd in sever subject instead of special in one onli . the first reason to believ it is relat to the impact of knowledg on the individu . an extens knowledg of a singl subject confin a human be to it academ subject and doe n't evolv it person at larg . on the contrari , the studi of sever subject expand the limit of a person 's undestand of life as a whole . a second reason , focus on the scholarli impact of knowledg diversif , is that it offer the opportun of a compar approach . an academ who is educ in sever differ subject will be abl to identifi interest connect between distant disciplin , thu open the way to new approach . thi is true not onli for the academ world . ani person who expnd her/hi area of knowledg increas her/hi possibl to be success in life . a third reason to prefer diversificationi is that it can prevent interest from dri up . when a person concentr for a long period on a singl subject , he/sh is expos to the risk of lose dedic or flatli identifi with a specif point of view . deal with differ subject , instead , gener a relativist approach that help creativ and encourag new point of view . a clear exampl of how cultur can posit expand in a singl human be is offer by some renassainc intellectu . a man like leonardo da vinci , for exampl , could with it knowledg embrac almost ani subject known of the time . even if in the present day ' realiti such case are not possibl anymor becaus of the incommensur expans of human studi , the case of leonardo still repres a valid exampl of how a multidisciplinari approach to knowledg can boost human brain power . in conclus , even if a few men can aspir to reach the erudit of leonardo , the argument abov effect clarifi how divesrif of knowledg can benefit intellectu work .
