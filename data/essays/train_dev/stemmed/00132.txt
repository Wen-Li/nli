what is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or to special in one specif subject ? in my point of view thi is a veri controversi topic and i will explain you whi . on the one hand you can say , that a broad knowledg is veri import and it is good to understand mani thing and if you know a lot you will be abl to learn new thing faster . but on the other hand there are mani disadvantag . fist , it take a lot of time to get a broad knowledg . for exampl you have to studi longer and so you have less time to earn money later . second , you onli take an overview of the topic , but you do not receiv a deep understand of them . that is not a problem for easi discuss , but it is veri depriv for realli big problem like in scientif understand . moreov , compani want to employ specialist , becaus they are often confront with veri difficult task , which can onli solv by an expert . so in a societi , where knowledg is becom more and more import we need peopl who are the best in their subject and not peopl , who onli know a littl bit about everyth . in addit to that you are uniqu when you are an specialist . so you are better than the rest and therefor you are in a veri comfort postit . for instanc if you appli for job , you will have no problem to get it , becaus there are not veri mani other applic , who are so fit as you . as a result you get the job and you can earn a high salari and live a pretti good life . to sum it up there are more andvantag than downsid to special in one specif subject . deeper understand of the subject and work are onli two point , which show you that specialist do better than peopl , who have a broad knowledg .
