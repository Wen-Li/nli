i do not agre with the follow statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . '' my definit of `` travel '' would be feel the breez and have relax , but with tour guid i would not feel comfort at all . from my experi i went to yellowston nation partk with a group led by a tour guid . it wa veri help to learn about yellowston nation park but they had limit time , so if i want to go somewher to see more informationa or to take a pictur i would not have time becaus we would have to move on to next place , i did not have ani individu time to spend with my famili . all i did wa walk and listen , walk and listen over and over again . i felt like thi wa more like school field trip not travel . of cours you can counterpoint with my decis , like what if you do n't know the direct or you have no idea what to do ? well i thought about that too but the whole point of travel is you look for direct and find the place and keep search for new thing . i got lost sever time dure my trip but it wa all worth it becaus next time i went there i could rememb clearli becaus i got lost onc and now i think about that moment i think it 's good memori to have . i 'm not say that you should not have a plan for your trip but with tour guid you schedul is go to be so tight that you will not have anytim to have your own qualiti time , all you do is sleep at night becaus you are so tire from tour . in conlcus the best way to travel is to travel by yourself or your friend but not in a group led by a tour guid , it will make the trip wors .
