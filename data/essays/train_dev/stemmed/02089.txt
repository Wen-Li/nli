i sure agre with the opinion that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are and i think it 's a problem that involv a lot of peopl , yong in particular , and sever field . in my opinion a veri great number of these advertis are given by televis instead of be given by paper or other media . thi fact could be explein think that the paper are read by adult , that have a bigger knowledg and can avoid the cheat . instead the televis is use by a number of young person ; the advertis are made to be read or heard by them . inde it ' s easi for young to believ in a wounder advertis that promis to give them what they desir . advertis that give am imag of a product better than the real one involv differ field : the fit , the food , the sport , the way of dress and so on . to conclud i think it 's a veri seriou problem that could be solv by autor
