to predict the futur ha alway been a difficult task or at least a task that requir either a great deal of imagin or a deep knowledg of scienc and of it actual develop . therefor what i can do now is a simpl hypothesi base on my person experi and on what i read on the newspap . basic i think that the statement is correct and that it is veri like that in the futur man will use less car then nowaday . thi is for sever reason . first , as the problem of air pollut will increas , new technolog will be discov in order to make the problem less urgent and hope to solv it . i would therefor imagin that instead of car other mean of transport could be use . for instanc , small airplan fuel by hydrogen . second , the actual trend goe in the direct of reduc the time in do thing in gener and in move from a place to an other in particular . it is a common experi in the life of each of us the morn traffic jam in which we get stuck . third , probabl in the long run it will decreas the need to phisic move in order to fullfil ceirtain task . the movement will be in the ` virtual world ' instead that in the real one . in other word , internet , connect peopl who live in differ part of a countri , will dramat decreas the need of transport . in fact , it is someth that it is alreadi happen . summar what i am tri to express , there are both reason of health and pratic necess that will lead to a situat of less car and thi will be made possibl and afford throught technolog .
