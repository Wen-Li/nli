i agre with thi statement . some time compani do market of their product to get more profit . i think not onli some but most of them do same . there are lot of reason and exampl avail to support my claim . lot of peopl are there who complain about product . they start use that product after view advertis . i have a seriou problem due to thi . when i use to stay in india at that time , on mani tv channel they saw realli veri popular and attract advertis for shampoo . it is like if you use thi shampoo your hair will look like thi man . you can feel chang in your hair with in few week . so i attract due to that and star use that product . and it true that i start feel chang in my hair . but instead of shine my hair , my hair start disappar . ye that true that i have hair lose problem . befor i use that product i do n't have that problem . so i quit use that product ani more , and start use what i use to use earli . but that not end of my problem . even today aslo i am suffer with that problem . i had spent lot of money for madit but i did not find ani improv in my hair . but due to that madicin i have anoth side effect . ohh god ! i am realli feel so bad . not onli that but now in the usa also i am affari of tri new stuff . i think there must be some rule to make advertis . like in advertis compani must show what could be the side effect and how to take precat to use that product . in my case it okay , but i had seen lot of peopl who are suffer from seriou problem just due to much more good advertis then actual they are . accord to my view point govern must pass a law that compani must have to show truth in advertis inst of imagnari thing . let peopl live in real world and not in just imagnari world .
