some peopl beliv that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . other beliv the best way to travel is on your own . both opinion have it adventag and disadventag actual . i agre with the second opinion . to me , travel on your own is much better . first of all , when you travel on your own , you are free to go wherev you like . you can design your own tour accord to your like and interest . you can manag your time better . that will give you the opportun to spend more time on the place you like better . anoth benefit to travel on your own is that you can manag your spend accord to your budget . in a group , the place you will visit are determin by the tour guid , and unfortun , you can not chang it . travel in a group led by a tour guid cost a certain amount of money , which probabl would cost you less if you plan it yourself . you should follow the tour guid and go the restaur the guid determin as oppos to get your own food . for exampl , my husband and i plan an `` interrail '' trip in europ coupl year ago . it wa all on our own . we plan in advanc where , when , how , for how long we would go . it wa more fun to explor the place on our own sinc we hand the chanc to interact with local peopl in their regular daili life . we made friend too . as a result , i strongli support the idea of traval on your own . you have more freedom , you interact with peopl and you make friend .
