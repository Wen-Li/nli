`` the new gener '' is a veri critis topic these day . young peopl often give out the exampl of a modernis gener who care about noth but temselv and how to stay entertain . even though young peopl alway seem to be preocupi with themselv , they do care , in a way , about help their commun . it is true that they do not show it as much as older peopl do but that doe not mean that thi new gener doe not care about help their commun . after all , they are part of their commun , so by help it they end up help themselv . for exampl , young peopl will tend to help their commun by make it seem more enjoy . they will plan numer activ for differ event , like trick or treet and costum parti for halaween . by do that they entertain peopl of all sort of age : children will be happi as well as their parent who will enjoy spend time with their famili . now of cours thi exampl might not be veri reveal for older peopl who think that by help the commun you must decreas the number of unemploy , help the elderli , organis chariti event . .. but younger peopl , are not alway awar of the import of these sort of problem , which is whi they do not give it attent . thi doe mean that teenag do not care about these social problem but it will take more time for them to understand how import they are for the commun . by say that `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' , we give out the impress that they are spoil kid who do not give attent to their environ . that is whi i disagre with thi statement . both teenag and children help their societi by not even notic . for exampl , they are awar of not throw their rubbish on the street . by know that they help decreas the pollut rise in our world today . of cours , they would not be help their communt as much as adult do , but it is a fresh good start that prove that thi lack of care of the `` new gener '' is not alway true .
