i agre with thi statment , becuas noaday young peopl are occupi or distract by other thing for exampl vido game . date girl , the internet , movi , concert the list goe on and on . young peopl today are not that interest in thier commun all they are interest in is fun stuff thing that are not complic or stress , they think becuas they are young they have the rest of their live to worri about the commuinti , yong peopl like the fact that they should n't care about their commun when they are young . thier perent are the blame becuas they are most of the time tell them that stuff in the commuinti doesnot concern them . firstli young peopl these day think it is okay not to care about their commun and that they shouldnot be more involv becuas they are not matur enough or have n't experiec life long enough , or the fact that their opiniuon is not vaild becuas they are not old enough . secondli their perent should engourag them to be more involv and not to pay alot of that attent to movi or girl , that attent should be direct in a more use way that they should use all the knowledg they have to help and improv thier commun . their perent send them to school to learn and get a good educ for them to leader and help and improv countri and commuinti . they should n't wast that on thing that are not use or help in ani way . final i would like to encourag the young peopl of today to studi hard and be more involv with your commun and use all the knowlgd they got and put it to good use and help their commuinti .
