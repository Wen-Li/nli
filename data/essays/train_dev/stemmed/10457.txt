when it come to choos whether you prefer broad rang of knowledg or just one special knoweldg , there could be a lot of opinion just as differ stroke for differ folk . some of my opposit number would tri to win me over by say ` one special knowledg is better ' . they would come up understand reason like ` if you tri to learn a lot of thing at one time it will simpli overwhelm your self and you may not be abl to master just one knowledg pluentli ' . their reason is quiet accept and veri tempt howev if i am allow to choos one treasur from the variou shini one i would claim my prize by say ` i think it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject ' . there are variou reason to support my idea . first our live are limit to short period and we can not turn it back or reset it like a comput . so what i figur is if you have limit time to learn might as well learn much stuff as possibl . the second reason is that we are live in fast evolv societi and i think the era of one special knowledg is over . peopl with broad rang of knowledg are treat more nicer than peopl who just special in one academ subject . let me give you one exampl . in our countri it is veri hard to get a reliabl job . we have to faster than other , smater than other , even richier than other . at the time like thi special one academ subject is like a sucid attempt becaus job are limit and compani are look for more intellig peopl . come to think of it the idea which my opposit number are suggest is veri reason . but i think what they are clame is kind of far from the realiti . besid i do n't think my opinion is not a far cri from the given subject nethier . so in conclus i think it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to have just one special academ subject .
