i agre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all , i think that the peopl today worri much more for the envioron than in the past . the gover and associ such as green peac tri to get peopl involv to protect our planet and in my opinion their are achiev their purpous . there are lot of peopl that go to work in bu and other public way of transport , or share a car with other peopl to go to work everi day . the govern in some countri are also tri to control the pollut by law and restrict such as not allow to drive car one day or anoth depend on the number plate . anoth fact that i think will influenc on the decreas of the number of car in use is their price and the price of ga . young peopl that start their first job do n't earn enough to buy a car and to pay for ga everi month . i think the prioriti for them is to buy a hous and sinc these are realli expens they do n't think about buy a car . on top of thi , go by car to a big citi is a huge wast of time becaus there is alway a lot of traffic . for exampl , my friend ana ha to leav home at half past seven in the morn to go to work , but she doe n't start until nine o'clock . after the hard day of work she leav at half past six in the afternoon , but she doe n't get home until eight o'clock . she wast three hour everi day on the road ! that is a lot of time and i think peopl are realis that is better to get the train becaus you know that you are alway go to be on time and not wast your day on the road .
