i agre with the opinion that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for the follow reason . first , when peopl do not often use car , the air of the citi will becom clearer than now . when i wa keio junior high school student , a privat school in tokyo , the capit citi of japan , i live near the supermarket which had a lot of park for the car of the custom . the air near my hous wa veri dark , i wa alway sick inmi throat . but when i wa tokyo univers student , i move to the small town where peopl did not use car at all . so i becam nice of my condit of throat becaus of the clean of air . second , in twenti year more and more transport sytem will becom expand all over the world . when i began to work in osaka , the second big citi of japan , i went to the offic by car , becaus there wa no transport system , for exampl , subway , bu , train . but i wa worri about a heavi traffic jam everi day , besid i wa often late for the start time of the offic . after two year , now , i can go to the offic by subway happili becaus the transport system becam expand to the station near my offic . now unlik me what two year ago , i am never late for the start time of the offic . so , in twenti year , peopl will use more transport system which have not ani traffic jam . therefor i strongli agre the opinion that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
