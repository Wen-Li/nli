nowaday , old peopl blame young peopl of not help their commun for enough time . they accus young peopl of be more person than be a part of the commun . if you just look at time spent on commun , they seem to be right . on the contrari , if you examin the condit , they are not . today , it is veri hard for a young person , to have spare time . becaus work hour and condit are wors than older time . they have to work hard to have a job . if you are not a devot worker , it is possibl to lose yoru job . in addit , find anoth job is much harder today . a young person who may have the opportun to help hi commun is probabl a well-educ , econom secur . nowaday , peopl in same condit as menion abov are numer . thi give the opportun to the employ that if he/sh fire someon becaus of not stay overtim , he/sh will find a new employe in short time . in the past , qualifi worker were rare , becaus of war and epidem . also , it doe not make ani differ , even if you spend much of your time in help commun , your effort are neglig compar to the need . commun are get larger and more peopl need these time and money . older peopl look at the number of peopl who need help and they claim that young peopl do not help them . i tink thi is not fair . govern and local author should help commun , not individu . today big money is requir for fulfil these need . older peopl may make larger donat and profession may do the job accur and effect . so , it is not fair to say that young peopl do not use their spare time in help their commun . it is the condit that prevent them from it . young peopl do not have enough time or money . older peopl should get involv in the subject and help their commun . if they are unabl , than govern and local author should do the job . pleas , do not make young peopl life harder .
