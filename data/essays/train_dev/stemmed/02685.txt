i agre with thi statement although it is realli hard to imagin that there should be fewer car in use in twenti year . dure the last centuri the use of car ha name grown enourm , but i think that there will be a chang soon beacus car are get more and more expens and peopl are earn less money . soon most peopl will not afford a car ani longer . the first problem is that in our centuri of unemploy you can not spectacul that peopl will get more wealthi dure the next time . mayb even more peopl will get unemploy . a result of thi is the second problem , the fiscu need money to ensur that all of those unemploy peopl are abl to surviv . the fiscu ' most like opportun to get money is to higher tax and fee and becaus petrol is noth you need to surviv , the fiscu higher the petrol tax at first . petrol , which you need to use your car , is get more expens . the third problem is that our petrol-ressourc are fade . in a few year there will be no more petrol to get and the price for the last rest will explod . the result is that petrol is get more and more expens , but in a veri fast and rabiat way ! i know that there exist altern for drive with petrol , for exampl use bio-diesel , solar/energi or a hybrid motor . but these technolog have not still grown out and onli few peopl can afford them . they can be further develop and they will be further develop , but thi will need a lot of time ( more than twenti year ) . i think that in twenti year mani peopl will have got rid of their car and will not look after petrol altern but after car altern ( public traffic ) like buss , tram or train .
