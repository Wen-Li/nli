whether it is import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . accord to me , for a student to understand or to know about ani subject , both understand of idea and concept , and , learn fact are the vital part . but in my view or opinion i would give more weightag to the learn of fact instead of understand idea and concept beacus of follow reason . firstli , as for ani student , studi in school and univers for hi first 15-25 year of life would basic teach him to understand variou idea and concept through variou book and through variou teacher but he would certainli gain or expand hi knowledg from hi practic experi or by learn fact onli . like for ani medic subject student , who from hi textbook and through hi teacher learn variou aspect and idea for medic practis but hi basic and import learn would base on how he work in the hospit , by check the origin diseas affect bodi . anoth reason for my favour of learn fact as against understand of idea and concept would be that by onli learn idea and concept of ani subject the student would not be successful in hi life or career becaus without ani practic experi or go through with fact he can not abl to show hi talent or perform on the field or practis area . like onli by stude variou concept of music like it histori . about variou type of sing the student or person would not becom a good singer , so it is by learn fact in practic experi the aspir singer would abl to know whether he should continu with thi music class or not . so , by ad all abov reason , in my opinion learn fact is more import then learn idea and concept of ani particular subject . though learn idea concept which our textbook and teacher teach us are not the thing which one should not do but gain practic experi or understand or learn fact is like expand the knowledg of particular subject which one should not afford to skip in hi life in order to be successful person or entiti in life .
