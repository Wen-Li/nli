i believ that is better the person special in one subjetc . we need studi evryth to choos thi subjet , depend of as qualiti . we qualiti are so different one to the other , but alway , we have more develop in one to the other . it is my opinion about thi topic . . for exampl : i love play tenni and i practic everi day , i can play with the other person and understand everyth about that . if i have a problem or the peopl ask me someth about that , i can explain becaus i know about tenni . but , if other peopl ask me to the soccer and he want play with me , is so differ , becaus i 'm not play soccer and i not have practic to that sport . if he teach me i will can play , but i 'm better to other sport . if i want to learn to sport at the same time , i will learn but i ca n't develop all day in onli one sport . i need concentr in the two sport . we need have differ observ about differ subjetc or in thi caus sport befor to choos ani one . is neccesari stay sure about your decis . is the same with the subject 's , i can to learn the basic to each one but i need prepar in onli and in my futur will know everyth about my career . if you can develop perfect the subject , now , you can find out to the other and can the same effort that the first . sometim we hide mani posit thing , but we dont know about that , with the practic we can take off and show thi habil ! we can plan our futur is onli our decis . but for my life or for you life is neccesari of the studi .
