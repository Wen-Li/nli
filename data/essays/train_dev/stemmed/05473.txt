i agre with the statement most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , in advertis ment they will show so much about the product , but when we buy them and use them they r not realli as good as they show in the advertis , in my opinion they show like that to incras the product and for the market purpos . i have come to that conclus becaus i had three person experiens , first i bought one dress from one shop by see an advertis ment , in wich they showbi by tat they are sell veri good dress in term of qualiti as well as the prise and by see that advertis ment i went to that shop and bought one dress , after use it i have obsev the color of the dress is go , after wash i recogn i t and i could not return it . and the other time i bought shoe form one shop by see an advertis ment in the t.v they show the shoe wear one of my favotret star and i bought them , but the are veri coastli compar to the same shoe brought from the other shop in my third experi , one of the groceri shop ha advertis in such a way that everi bodi should attract to their shop , but all the groceri are veri coastli and some of them are expir , so they want to sell them as fastli as tey can . theas are the three person experi i have come across and so i strongli beleav that the advertis will show more about the product than they ralli are . so i strongli beliv the statement .
