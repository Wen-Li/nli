i total agre with the statment that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . `` what you see may not be true '' some veri wise person said that . we peopl forget a veri simpl fact which compani in the advertis will show v that their product in not what you want or are expect but will show that product is beyond your expect and will do wonder . take an exampl of a cosmet compani in all their advertis , we will see beauti girl and boy who have the perfect hair , face and not to forget figur . whi all thank to the product of the compani they are advertis . we peopl get carri away so much by these beauti face and the magic creat by the billboard and telivis , that we end up spend load of money without think for one second that these peopl are paid model and it their job to look beauti . none of these advertis anywher will show or tell how harm their product can be . also none of these advertis will take ani gurante that what these product did for those model will do the sameth for you . like meet your princ charm on a subway if you wear a certain perfum . the onli thing i can smell is other person bad breath or their underarm odour . most of the time as a parent it is vey difficult to explain to your younger children whi a certain brand of cereal is like by so mani children on telivis and when you bring it home everybodi run away from it after first tats session . also whi most of the food chain make their produt so delici that you want to eat right there from the screen but when you order you feel like throw out . in my opinion compani should take responsibilti not to mislead peopl by show that their product are not onli of superior qualiti but will also achiev what they show in advertis . they should instead of spend thousand on public , should spend all that money on mainta the qualiti of the product , becaus noth work better than word of mouth . public .
