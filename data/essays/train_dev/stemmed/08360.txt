i disagre with thi statement . actual it 's true that understand idea and concept are import for student . howev , even the student have those thing , i think the learn doe not work without the learn fact for the student . when i wa in grade 7 and 8 , i could not success with my studi that much , becaus i did not tri to studi hard at the time . howev , i wa chang my mind by my mother 's word when i wa in grade 9 . and i could think that i have to studi and if i studi i will get good mark than befor . sinc then i studi hard , and my effort wa permit from my teacher . and my mark wa get high like i have ever seen or i could not imagin befor . when i got the report card from those teacher , they wrote some masseg for my mother about me on the report . and it said `` she chang a lot in thi year . i knew that she is a person who have good unerstand knowlegd and nice learner , but she did n't tri to work hard befor . so her mark were low , but she tri to studi so hard in thi year . i felt she grew up littl bit , and i am glad to see her mani great idea and imagin and also i felt her good attitud in those class . i learn from your daugnter that even if we have good qualiti , if we did n't think we want to show the qualiti , the good qualiti never get great qualiti . '' when i saw the massag , i felt so happi and i thought i will keep studi hard for me , my famili who support me , and those teacher who i got when i wa in junior high . from my experi , i think it is more import for student to learn fact than it is for student to understand idea and cocept .
