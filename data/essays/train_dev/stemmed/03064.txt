i agre with the statement becaus i think that if you onli do what you know and even if you are veri good at it you will not learn anyth new from it . and i think that to take risk it might not be success everytim but it a new way to learn . if you risk and is not success you should go back and look what you did wrong and learn from those mistak and how to not ever make them again . so i look at take risk as a way of learn somth new . if you do n't risk your live will never chang and you will do the same thing over and over and if you ever have to be on a situat of take risk you probabl would do n't know what to do , or what to say , or how to react . take a chanc to do somth with your live like live in a differ countri , with a differ languag , differ cultur , and a lot of differ situat , it to take risk becaus you dont know how peopl will act , or you do n't know peopl costum , or even if you do n't know the languag . but with time and a possit actitud you will eventu learn about it . i beliv that opportun is take risk and opportun doe n't come veri often so i think even if you do n't end up been success after it , i 'm sure you would learn someth from it . i took the opportun of live in anoth countri than were i wa born . and i did n't realli know where i wa go and how wa it go to be . but with the time i have learn a new languag and new cultur , a differ way to look at the world preati much . so i think that i 'm preati lucki becaus not a lot of peopl ha done what i have , but i the same time i took a risk and i did n't know if it wa go to be succesful for me . that risk i took it 's made me enrich my person .
