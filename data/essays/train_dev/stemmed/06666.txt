commun involv ha alway been view as an integr and substanti part in the develop of young peopl into matur and respons peopl of the societi . even today we have academ institut strongli involv their student to `` give back to the commun '' through a number of program . i am in strong view that young peopl today think of themselv as import member of their commun and tri to devot time to help out in their own way . more than ever , young peopl today have been expos to a larg array of problem that their ancestor or even parent never face . see the maginitud of crime , social and polit disturb , racial and cultur discrimin , environment problem have made today 's children more emphath to the peopl and surround around them . com from broken home in citi fall prey to rise crime rate and poor environment condit , these young peopl have a better understand of the problem their commun face . me and my friend have been involv in sever commun project right from our school day . from help out at the local librari to assist the rotari club in our citi in organis drive for collect toy and cloth for the lesser priveledg children , we see our work in such project as a meaning extens of our live . today , sever young peopl see their commun as one of the most central aspect of their be . from defer a year befor colleg or graduat school in order to travel and volunt for social organis to choos to work with non profit organis for their internship , young peopl are increasingli becom awar of the way in which they could help not onli their commun but reach out to peopl across the border and sea . one veri posit aspect that work in the favor of student who activ contribut to their commun is that their work get highli appreci by colleg and univers that view them as prospect admit . they see such student as well round peopl with more than just a prestigi degre or job on their mind . there are sever trust that set up scholarship and travel grant for young peopl who have show a more compassion side of their self . thi motiv student to set time asid to work with social and environment group in their academ instituit and commun . due to rise competit , it is true that student need to put it long hour to studi for exam , write paper , prepar for job interview and so on . but i believ that by balanc their work with a sens of duti toward the world around them , they could do their part in make a chang in their commun . thi ideolog is not onli mine but also that of thousand of young peopl across the globe .
