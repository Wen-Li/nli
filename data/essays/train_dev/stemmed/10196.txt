in my opinion thi statement is true that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather then onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . ani new invent start with new thought , new creativ , plane and hard work toward the goal . for exampl newton , he wa a scientist he gave us a lot of new principl on scienc but befor him no bodi wa think in that direct . after hi , peopl fallow hi principl and do further more for new creation and invent . that is thue tri new thing is better becous if you sucss in ani concept you will becom famou veri fast , with new concept you can earn more money and can lead a good succes life . for that you must be creativ for new idea and concept . we can take a exampl of macdonald , initiali it wa a simpl food chain but due to do right effert in right direct , and tri some thing new , made them a gaint food chain . so in my opinion succces peopl tri new thing , altough there are lot of hard work , passion , time and money requir toward the goal . in conclus i will say that if u want to be successful person , you have to keep tri new thing rether than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
