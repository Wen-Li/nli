some peopl agre that it is better to special in one specif subject , howev , i think it is better to learn broad knowledg of mani academ for the follow reason . first , have broad knowledg allow us to work more effect in busi . when i wa a univers student , i major in econom at hitotsubashi univers , in tokyo , japan . hitotsubashi univers is famou for econom , manag , and law . but in hitotsubashi univers offer me broad academ cours , such as scienc , environ , and mathmat . so i learn scienc and environ as well as econom . after graduat , i ha work in osaka ga comapani . so i had to get the knowledg of natur of ga . though it is an area of scienc , i can learn it easili , becaus i learn scienc befor . if i had not learn scienc in univers , i should have troubl studi natur of ga . thi experi clearli show that get broad knowledg is more use in busi . second , learn broad knowledg provid us the oppotun to think broadli . as state abov , i took the environ class in hitotsubashi univers . so i deepli know that the environ preserv is essenti . and becaus osaka ga compani start to sell the environ friendli boiler , eco-wil , which is cogenar system for redidenti , i appli to work for osaka ga . becaus i consid osaka ga as a environmen-friendli compani . in fact , osaka ga is environment-friendli compani , my desicion is justifi . if i had not studi environ cours , i might not recogn that osaka ga is good compani thi exampl strongli show that we may as well studi broad knowledg . in conclus , i definit believ that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is more use .
