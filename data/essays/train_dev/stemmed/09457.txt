i agre with thi opinion . when i wa travel thiland by myself . there wa too mani problem happend . as im a girl . i wa threatend my secur . it wa realli stress . and i ca n't convers with thai peopl . i did n't know how to deal with mani problem like hous , eat . . so travel in a group led by a tour guid ha mani benefici . first of all , you will protect from a guid and group . secur is veri import when you are travel new place . secon reason is that tour guid know well about travel and which place is recomend . so you do n't need to spend your time for consid about which place is more good to travel . third reason is that you do n't need to worri about hous and eat . gener a tour guid is speak a veri good local languag and a tour guid led group of a peopl . so fee for room is more cheap . and most tour compani relat to bunch of hotel chang . if you travel as a group member you do n't need to worri about food. a tour guid help you what you eat on the travel . all you need to do is just enjoy your vacat
