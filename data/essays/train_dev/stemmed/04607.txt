the issu of whether young peopl these day , give enough time to help their commun or not , is an issu that ha been debat on extens over the last few year . i person dont agre with the statement as i feel that young peopl still play their part in help their commun . the issu come up again and again becaus peopl just take the action of these young peopl to heart without actual understand the situat they face and see how thing have chang for these young peopl over the year . first , i have alway notic that it take a thousand good deed to be appreci and just one bad deed to be curs . veri often the action of one person are taken as the trait of a group of peopl without actual know what these other individu are like . a few bad exampl have help promot the idea that the young peopl nowday dont care . secondli , a lot ha chang in the life of young peopl . the world is a great deal more competit today than it wa ten year earlier . everyth from an educ to an occup demand much more . time can not be taken for grant anymor and young peopl find themselv more and more time bound everyday . i dont think thi aspect is complet understood . yet you see these young peopl do the best they can to help their commun . a simpl exampl of thi is how at the time of someon death everyon is there to lend a help hand to the famili which ha suffer the loss , and at such occass if you tri to think about it it usual the young peopl who run around to help all the time . moreov , there are so mani young peopl who have dedic almost all their time to sever and help their commun . there so mani young peopl either involv with or run ngo 's or organis which deal with seriou issu like educ or ampl food and shelter for their commun . these peopl have devot all their time and energi for the better of their commun . in the end i would just like to say that , there might never be a common agreement on thi subject , but i firmli feel that the young peopl are do their part . i guess all we realli need to do is open our eye and see the bigger pictur and i have feel that the result , like me , might not support the statement either .
