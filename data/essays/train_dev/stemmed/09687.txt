although travel with group under special programm is a good idea and number of peopl prefer it , i strongli agre with travl with out ani previou guid . in fact , i have two reason to support my opinion , first of all , from my person experinc i think peopl may gain more self confedint so , thi can perform everi thing an they will increas the abilitti to comun with diffrent aspect . as an exampl of thi is when a person travel to china for trade and he did not prepar ani thing , in the begin he might have som problem , but after while he will get more benefit . the second reason is that i need to learn more english languag . in order to contact with peopl in forgin countri . so , ihav to listen carfuli , use my hand to explan , fouc on the way they thak with and tri to make agood relationship with them . inrel to thi , take an exampl of iner nation student and thier experinc in thi kind of travl on the other hand , travll with guid may be more fafe , ornan , and conveni . to sum up , in my opinion i pefer to travel with out guid for the previou reason .
