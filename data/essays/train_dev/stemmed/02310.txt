nowaday , it is often point out that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . person , i agre with thi idea . i 'd like to look at some of the reason . first , in current fast-spe societi , young peopl are veri busi in their own activ , such as studi and sport . for exampl , some student have goal to becom politician in the futur . some student may want to becom professiona footbal player . to realis their dream , they need to dedic in their own activ . second , there are a lot of kind of distract , for exampl , tv , music , movi , the internet , and so on . it is difficult for youth to look at help their commun , which doe not look like more attract for them . third , it is not well known for youth how to particip in the activ of help their commun . i expect that there are some young peopl who are interest in help their cummun and want to particip in such kind of activ . howev , from my experi , it is difficult to know how to join their commun , even though they have a littel interest and awar of help and contribut their commun . these are the main reason whi i think young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . the caus are in both young peopl themselv and the structur of the societi . therefor , i 'd like to propos to improv the system of the societi . for exampl , i want the local govern to establish and open the homepag where young peopl can obtain the infom regard help their commun . by introduc such kind of homepag , the door to join the commun will open for young peopl who have a liitl interest in help the commun . and then i expect the societi will becom better .
