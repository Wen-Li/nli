the issu of whether success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than the peopl who do onli what they alreadi know is interest one . in my opinion , the success peopl should have challeng spirit . first of all , the most succesful peopl have been someth of challeng to date . for exampl , soichiro honda , who wa a founder of a japanes car maker call ` honda ' , wa a typic challeng . befor found hi compani , he wa a onli owner of small cycleshop . but , he had a great ambit and strongli desir to help the peopl who were at a loss in mobil . eventu , he invest the first motor cycl in japan . it wa not onli hi challeng , he endevor mani thing after thi and found hi compani . nowaday , honda ha success hi challeng spirit and tri mani new thing , such as make robot call ` asimo ' , invest hydrogen electr motor car etc . howev , it is not necessarili that everi challeng bring success everi time . for exampl , about 100 year ago , there is a trade compani call ` suzuki shoten ' in japan . the peopl who work for thi compani were full of challeng spirit . but , unfortun , their effort went too far . their attitud which they tri someth new and spend money on it lead thi compani to bankrupt . thi wa an exampl that challeng ha not onli advantag but also disadvantag . but , i can safe say that peopl never get the chanc to be success if they onli do what have been manual and never want to take ani risk becaus everybodi can do the same thing in the same way . in other word , nobodi can stand out from the crowd without new challeng which make person distinguish from other . in conclus , onli the peopl who made a lot of effort to challeng someth new can abtain big succsess .
