i disagre with the present statement . i think it is better to have an specif knowledg about an academ subject than have a wide rang of academ knowledg . to underlin my opinion i would like to refer some argument and exampl . first , i would like to refer my own experi when i wa studi law at univers . there wa a mass of student that start with me in my first semest . about 300 student had for sever year the same cours , so we were all taught the same gener subject . there wa no differ between the student , though the number of student wa so high . is it possibl that 300 peopl like to be taught in the same way ? thi wa someth that disturb me veri much . in order to get rid of that academ uniti i refus to listen to each lectur and start to read book on subjct i wa interesst in and got specialis by myself . second , you have to keep in mind that you need to get a job . i think most of the job are veri specialis and you will need certain skill and knowlegd to get your work done . thi is whi you have to specifi in one or two subject befor . then it would be to late for you to specialis . a as result you have to conclud , that it is better to specialis earli in order to get a good job . third , of cours i have to admit that there are so mani thing that are interesst to be dealt in class . in that gener way it is grant that you also learn about thing you were not interest in ( yet ) . perhap you find out more about other subject , that you did not get in contact with , becaus you were specialis . but neverless i would like to prefer to specialis myself and pay it tribut not to get into touch with other more gener topic . i think when you are realli interest in art , music or anyth els you can still read book about that or occupi in ani other way yourself with gener topic in your freetim .
