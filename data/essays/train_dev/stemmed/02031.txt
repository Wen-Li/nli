lot of poepl think that young peopl enjoy life more or better than older peopl . in one way they are right but in the other hand they are wrong . for a moment let take the word enjoy life as have fun and do lot of thing . young peopl are activ becaus of their age . the age is a big advantag . they have the energi for do lot of thing . for exepl , travel , ride a bike , run , and sex of cours , thing most older peopl dont have much energi to do . and ofcours they have kid mayb even grand kid to tie them in to the life they current have . thi is mayb their onli satisfact in life . to be abl to achiev lot of thing that younger peopl did not achiev yet . becaus of thi satisfact they mayb have no need to realli experi differ thing . on the other hand i can not realli say that young peopl can enjoy life much eihter.21st centuri realli doe not allow lot of us to explor . with the need of a succes job ; the need of a diploma appear . with the need of a diploma money come in to the stori . well we all know that we can not grow money on tree so we start work part or full time at an earli age . on top of work we have to studi in order to graduat . even after all of thi the onli time we will enjoy life seem like retir . well again when we retir we are consid older peopl . so tell me who are the peopl that realli have fun . younger or older peopl ? have fun is not about age or activ . it is about be abl to enjoy life at it most . we are the one who determin the term `` enjoy life '' for our self . at ani age if we are satisfi with what we are do and who we are and how we interract with peopl then we are the one who chose to enjor or not to enjoy . let ask thi question to our self : to enjoy or not to enjoy ?
