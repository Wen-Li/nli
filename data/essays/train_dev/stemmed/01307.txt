i strongli agre with the statemet that advertis drive us to believ their product are better than the truth . it 's sure a way to attract more peopl to buy the product . but sometim , the product are realli make client disappoint . for exampl : onc a day , when i wa too young , a univers student knock my room door while i wa lone in the hous . she recommand a type of shoe were veri good . it could prevent from humid and fire . then it wa magic to see while the skin of shoe , it did n't get fire . then a young girl curiou as me thought it wa veri interest , as a consequ , i bought it . but onli after some day , i found the shoe have n't good textur and destroy by walk . then from thi advertis , i take a lesson : do n't believ adversis ! when they claim some aspect are realli good and attract , it mean in other aspect , mayb are controvers . when the claim someth is high technolog , mayb it indic thi product is easili to be destroy ! but can we prevent the advertis from daili life ? certain not . watch advertis is a way to collect inform and get up with the pace of world . and some advertis are too artic or storic which attact peopl veri much . like microsoft 's advertis of pentium 4 . they tell us a new gener of comput , though the high-techniqu such as comput , mobil , mp3 improv veri quickli . but they are the fashion . and for me , i think high-techniqu and make-up thing are toy . they are changeabl like the toy i play dure my childhood . and they can be the discuss topic . it make us more interest . though their price are not reason . afterword , though the advertis alway give us product not as good as they claim . but as a daili inform , we ca n't get away from them . in a global world today , we also get benefit from advertis .
