dure my academ educ of biolog , i studi a wide varieti of topic . besid my major subject , ecolog and zoolog , i took class in botani , genet and physiolog . after get thi scientif overview i special on the biolog and ecolog of spider , which wa also the topic of my diploma thesi . later , dure my phd thesi , i veri glad have receiv a scientif overview espaci in botani and zoolog becaus i need the knowledg of veri differ topic to conduct differ field - and laboratori assay . to my opinion , it is not a mistak to take veri differ class at the univers , if thi is still possibl . thi is becaus then you have the possibl to choos the subject you like most and on which you can then special later in your studi . furthermor , you never know , which knowledg you will need for a futur job . if you have a broad but superfici knowledg of some subject , you are alway abl to intensitfi your studi and get more special in the desir topic . unfortun , the educ system at most univers in germi have chang sinc my tand mostli , it is no long possibl to studi all subject simultan due to limit money resourc . often you have to choos your major befor get regist at a univers . i think thi is not a good develop at univers , becous no one know what fure will bring and which qualif are need when peopl have finish their univers degre .
