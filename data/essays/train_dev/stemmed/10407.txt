to be abl to take part in the competit world , peopl must be more qualifi than befor . everyon is tri to improv their skill by attend to certif programm , seminar , internship program or attend to the top rank school . the educ they get there is a big step for their career . especi student feel big pressur on themselv , sinc they do not know where they will be after they finish their educ and if they will be abl to play a role in thi global world . henc , they tri to do their best at school by studi their cours , do homework , get good grade . howev , after they complet all these requir they may not reach their goal unless they . learnt to understand the idea and concept . the educ system forc student to learn what is written in the cours materi . it is easi to memoris all the fact in the book and get good grade . howev , these learnt fact will be forgotten quickli and easili . henc , it is import to understand the basic idea behind the subject and question everyt to gain perman knowledg . for instanc , a student take a polit scienc cours may have an assign about the differ between polit view . he may studi the differ type of view like nation or fundemant . if he understand the basic idea behind those , he will never forget or confus them . howev , if he just learn the fact it is possibl that hi knowledg will not last long . as a student , i believ that it is more import to understand the idea and concept than to learn the fact in order to gain perman knowledg . if a student is awar of the subject , he will be more like to improv hi skill and qualif . in my opinion understand the consept is the core for self develop and may give you the chanc to play a big role in the competit world .
