while some peopl may believ that most advertis can make product seem much more attract than the realli are , i feel that some case can be made for the other opinion against that augument . in short , i disagre with the statement . it is true that some advertis can do it . for exampl , the enegi drink in japn is typic product . the ingredi of those dirnk are usual onli sweet water with some caffein . but peopl are made to believ that they can get energet by drink them via advertis . by contrast , there are also opposit case to the effect of advertis . as a matter of fact , i can reffer to the case of pocali sweat which is the most famou sport drink in japan . for japanes peopl , pocali sweat sound fresh , healthi , and sporti . the advertis of the drink emphis these imag on tv and so on . howev , when the maker of thi drink expand the market to outsid japan , the compani wa oblig to recogn the problem . becaus the word `` sweat '' doe not sound good for english speaker , the maker ha fail to advertis the product successu , what is wors , the advertis ha harm it imag . as anoth exampl , i have person experi regard advertis . in my school day , i open the food stand and sold ethnic meal in the festev . then , i have just emphisez the ethnic trait of the meal , but have fail to convey the imag of delici . to sum up , becaus the fact mention abov , i do not think most advertis are alway effect to make product seem much better than they realli are .
