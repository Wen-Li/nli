nowaday , you have to take risk and danger decis if you want to succeed . i obvious agre and i find it normal that your are more success if you take risk than if you onli do what you can do . exept if you are a geniou , you can not succeed without take risk . for exampl with a cloth shop . the owner take risk by order new collect of cloth everi year . he do not know if he is go to sell all the cloth he order and he do n't even know if the custom are go to like the style of cloth he order . so he ha to take a risk by imagin what cloth will be fashion enought thi summer . he is take a risk so it is normal that if hi predict were correct , he receiv more money by sell more cloth . he can be successful thank to the risk he took . but if he hire someon to help him sell the cloth , i reckon that it is normal that the person he ha hire do not succeed becaus he did n't took ani risk , he is onli do what we ask him to do . howev , the fact of take risk consern also take risk with what is legal , and what is not . unfortun more and more peopl becom success becaus the took risk by do someth forbidden . for exampl , someon who will sell drug take hudg risk but he can easili becom veri healthi . in summari , even tought i agre with thi statement , i would permit myself to correct it by chanch the fact that it is not success peopl who tri new thing and take risk , but peopl who tri new thing and take risk in order to becom successful . onc they are successful , they should stop take risk becaus risk can ruin them either .
