there is a recent discuss about if young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl do or not . as far as i am concern , i think the young peopl can enjoy life more becaus of the characteristic of young peopl that is internatonl , mobil and the abliti to commun . to begin with , with the advent of internet , the world we live in is becom more smaller than befor . today 's young peopl can easili get in touch with the most popular cultur in the world . they are more intern than their parent henc they can enjoy the movi in holywood from america , the most fashion cloth from pari and the most excit footbal play from the endland . becaus of thi , they enjoy the life more . furthermor , today ; s young peopl is mobil . by car , train and air , they can travel to where they want to go . just contradict the low qualiti of transpor their parent have in the past time , we can responbs to say that the young enjoy life more . the young peopl can go sight-se and enjoy the magnific cultur all over the world . in addit , for the variou way that peopl can make a commun , the young peol gain more stronger abil to commun with other and it maks them more friend . dure their studi time they can meet lot of peopl who may be come from differ place even countri . those peopl all may help the young peopl or provid them mani opportun when they begin to work . so the young peopl can enjoy life more . but the old peopl may not enjoy so much friendship becaus of the limit of way of commun . from what ha been discuss abov , we can safeti draw a conclus that the young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do .
