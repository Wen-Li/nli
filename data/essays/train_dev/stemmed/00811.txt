some compani show product not over they realli are . on the other hand , most compani show thier product over thire think by use advertis . i think that it is possibl to occur some problem becaus of differ of the thought between compani and custom . i think that if compani tell a truth on advertis , the compani can get aom advantag , the belif of custom and can continu to manag for long time . therefor , i disagre that statement . first of all , what compani can get advantag by tell a truth is the belif of custom . it is difficult for compani to get the belif becaus normali the custom do not beliv other and even compani . for exampl , we do begin of someth , we becom realli care . we listen mani explan not to have mistak . after that , we reli on the thing . like that , if compani make custom beliv , custom continu to buy product . therefor , it is import for compani not to show over thire think by advertis . secondli , not to show over imag of product mean that compani can continu to manag for long time .
