i think that are both import for the knowledg of the student . but exist differ way to applic them : for exampl for a kid at the primari schol , mayb it 's better to understand idea and concept , becaus he is at the start of hi studi career , so he need everi strument to grow up well . with my person experi , i think when you arriv at the univers is import to understand idea as well as learn fact . i 'm stude design , and how can i learn the topic of the project without test on my skin how project work ? i 'm realli convinc that theori without practis at univers it 's not so good , the same for practis without theori . i think like thi becaus when you are graduat there is n't anyth more between you and you work life , and work in gener is more about fact thant theori . so if a law student will be an advoc , it 's better for hi career to star to comprend what the worker life will be . but at the same time student have possibl to learn idea onli at school , so it't realli import to combin a good theori with a good practis .
