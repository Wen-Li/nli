young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun at all , and thi will have veri harm effect on the commun in the futur . whi are they not give enough time to help their commun ? i think becaus the are busi enjoy their life , have fun , busi in life , just think in them self , they are not think in other . they will face the result in the futur . for exampl : poor peopl nobodi take care of them , except when we have a problem and you can do noth you will go to god and ask god to solv your problem and you will make an agreement with god that if your problem wa solv , let say you will give the poor peopl food , and that becaus they do n't think in poor peopl at all . thi is not the big problem . the problem is that in the futur thoe povierti that the young gener didnot takecar of will start to act agress mayb by murder , steal toward thi commun and it will be veri hard to stop them . i believ that the best way to prevent thi is by take care of these peopl , who know they might help the commun in someway or other , for exampl : mickal jorden , the best basketbal player all over the world and he is veri famou , thi guy when he wa young he couldnot efford to join a club , but when he found the care he bacam a star and now all the world know him . what i mean that we can help these peopl by persuad peopl to help the , whi do n't we make a special day in the year that all peopl an the world in thi day will support the by anyth , money , food blanket , anyth , even use book , anyth we might not find it use for us mayb it will be useful for them .
