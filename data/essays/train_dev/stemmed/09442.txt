is it more import for student to undersand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ? everi idea and concept is base on a fact . some student are smart and learn by read and understang a new concept . some other take longer to undestand it . at the end , the slower student might memor an idea or a concept , and might get an excel score in an exam . but how will he appli thi new knowledg to the real life if he never undestood what it meant ? learn a concept or an idea first will help you to use your imagin . the tutor will tell you a new concept to learn , explain you what it is , and follow up with a given definit . howev , what will the result be if you appli it all the way round ? what will happen if you start by the observ the fact ( for exampl , watch some chemic reaction you 've never seen befor ) . onc you observ it , you come up with a conclus , you get into the class and learn that what you have observ ha a name , follow up by an explan of it , so you expand your reason and come up with your own idea of the concept . i believ reason is stronger that memori . memori get forgotten and reason stay . if so , concept and fact might get forgotten sooner than learn first the fact by experienc and understand it . by learn the fact first , you will end up learn the concept base on your own idea .
