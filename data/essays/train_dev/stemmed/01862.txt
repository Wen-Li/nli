i do not agre with the statement that nowday , young peopl do not contribut enough time to help their commun . in my opinion , today 's youth is much more awar and respons to the problem that exist . although there are peopl who like to paint a pictur of the youth as be reckless and irrespons and thi might hold true for a certain section of peopl . howev , the major of today youth is more respons and care toward the commun . thi can be veri clearli seen from the fact that most of the organ that exist today to help variou section of peopl have been start , own or are be manag by youngster . also , the major of peopl in these organ who reach out to help the commun through variou activ belong to an age group of below 30 year . for exampl , i went for a chariti drive be organ by the cri ( child relief and you ) center of bangalor . thi drive involv go to school in the rural area to interact with the under-privileg children and hand them book and other necessari item . i wa amaz to see that out of the 120 peopl who turn up , around 95 were young peopl who were either attend colleg or work . if we see the mani revolut and opposit that are take place in today 's world to oppos either the pollut of the environ due to increas industri or deplet of the forest cover or even start old age home and orphanag , we can see a gener trend that these are be led by young peopl . thi trend is not onli limit to organ or a group of peopl . for exampl , i have notic that it 's gener the old peopl who tend to be a bit careless about litter public place or pollut the environ , at least in my countri . on the other hand there are young peopl , who go to the extent of clean road and pick up the litter themselv rather than just leav it to the govern . from an earli age , the youth ha been made awar of the problem that today 's societi face , thu from a young age they are better equip to find solut and lend out a help hand to these problem . thu , i conclud by say that it 's wrong to make a statement or gener someth base on the behavior of just a small section of peopl . today 's youth is much more respons to the commun .
