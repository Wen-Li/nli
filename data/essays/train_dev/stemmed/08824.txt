in my opinion , for a student , it 's far more import to understand idea and concept than learn fact . in the procedur of teach there are two conpon to establish : the fact of learn itself and the interpret the student may give it to . at first , a student ha to learn the basi of a subject . the teacher 's job is to give him as mani inform as he can . these inform have to be gener . a teacher is not an amateur ( as he ha alreadi learn the subject befor ) so he ha alreadi hi on point of view . the teacher is just here to give gener inform and in ani case he could influenc the student ' mind . so learn fact is too tune on theori and not in practic . then , onc the student know the basi , the gener fact , he ha to go further from the given-inform by himself , in order to understand all the specif of the subject . i think that understand idea and concept is someth person . it is someth made by oneself . nobodi would never ha the same interpret of idea . it depend on the experi of the student and it possibl stori or link to a subject . for exampl , in a theoric cours of law , the teacher can teach student the evolut of someth in particular like the stanc of societi with the homosexu marriag . but i think is for more import for the student to understand how thi stanc ha emerg and learn all the discours of both of the peopl for or against it . thu , the student can make hi own opinion even if it is not the same as the major of the popul .
