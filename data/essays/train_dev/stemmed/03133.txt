both understand idea , concept and learn fact are have a differ role in the student . but i use to support understand idea and concept rather than to learn fact . as everyth in the student academ class are use to the student so they must have an idea about that concept . so student can easili learn that topic and he can use that learnt subject in hi futur . for exampl if the student ha a topic on prevent of communic diseas , how can he learn fact with out know about the concept so he should have some idea about that topic by see some practic condit and there by he learn fact . understand idea are veri import to the student as it give him a solv of ani critic problem . if the student understand idea and concept of the problem , he may be awar of it . not onli that hi mind hi sharpen , hi think power increas , hi reasion increas ther by he can learn so mani fact . if they have the capabl to understand idea and concept , they aris themselv a question and they will tri to solv , there by thier think abil increas . it is also veri import if the student ha some idea about the topic , it is easier for the student to learn . some time idea about the topic give him a doubt and he will do a research on it also . if the student with idea will alway be a intellig and hi mind is sharper . if the student ha anidea in one topic then he dont feel that is harder and he easili learn fact from that . even for the scientist also they first think about that topic and they come to one idea and they do reasearch and give us a fact . thu i conclud that idea about the concept is more to know the fact easier .
