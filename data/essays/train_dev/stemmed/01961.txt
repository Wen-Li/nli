regard of whether car will be fewer in use than there are today , or vice visa , peopl have divers opinion . if i had my way , i would fulli side with the notion that car , or other tool of transcommun are the detriment of the environ and will be reduc in twenti year . what is beyond a shadow of doubt is that the tempo of the technolog ha never been rapid as it is today , due to thi , we live in a world , where the technolog contribut both benefit and widespread plagu . howev , if there is a view that car could contribut such a tremend advantag and conveni that would not be reduc or replac , which i take leav to suspect , then it is the romant and naiv peopl who creat it , not those who never fail to be with consideret of realiti and modern societi , in so far as it is univer acknowledg that car is the major reason to the air pollut , which is the vitalest problem today and leav all the peopl in a lanch . so , what we could deduct from gener principl is that we thrive on technolog , and decend on technolog . to explain my mean perfectli , let me give you a concret exampl . due to the massiv air pollut , what we breath is not as clearli as it use to be , and most of them caus from the pipe of the car . and by make the car less access and more costli to peopl , by stignaz them with a anti-car compain , the author still tri to reduc the number of car , in order to solv the air pollut . all thing consid , make the car fewer is a trend in twenti year ahead . if it is not , it would be without ani consideraion of our next gener , be no regard of our own physic statement , and without ani idea of other speci on the earth .
