mani thing make the person sucssesful in hi societi , and what you exist of experi in your life will addit your abil to face mani problem in your life . first of all these two chois have thier benefit in our life , but when i ought to chose one of them i will chose the first chois , becaus it more suitabl to me , in my opinion the person must have mani differ knowledg and mani differ subject becaus know is a veri use thing to the person in mani way like to becom a use person in thi life and it will improv hi behaviour to do and speak well , for exampl i face some difficulti to read mani subject in 2005 becaus i have a test that major my abil , and if i pass thi test i will take a present but it veri valuabl present , when i get home with frustrat didnt pass the test , and without ani present my mother said to me , that not everi thing in our life is money , present and so on , but we have mani benefit thing to upset to dont have it like the knowledg . if i had a good knowledg i would pass the test , then i understoond that to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to have the present . so alway when the person have the chanc to learn dont miss hi chanc and to tri mani time to get it , becaus you will if you have the well . so each person must have the abil to learn and to learn and have mani knowledg becaus noth will stay forev like the knowledg , and we hear about mani scholor who face mani hard situat but they complet thier studi and thier learn and teach also to let thi sciens pass to mani peopl . final no one have adoubt that knowledg is the most import thing and the key to mani achiev in our life .
