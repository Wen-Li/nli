i think young peopl defin enjoy life more than old peopl do or ever did . in the olden day , there wa a lot of respons on the shoulder of the younger gener . howev , the more laid-back lifestyl of the 21st centuri allow youngster to have more than their share of fun . nevertheless , there are alway limit as too much of a good thing is also bad . with all the respons on the older gener , the younger gener doe not even feel the need to be role model for their sibl . children , with all their innoc find joy in the most mundan place . a tini chocol make a child smile ear to ear wherea an adult strike a million dollar deal is overcom by greed instead of be proud and happi . children can enjoy the littl aspect of life which go unnot by the older gener . i would like to illustr an exampl from my own experi . when my famili visit thailand in june 2004 , we were all veri enthusiast as the entir famili would be meet up after five year . we all had a blast jet sking , parachut sail etc . it wa onli later that we realis that our parent did not get thi opportun as they did not have enough money at that time . in our merriment we had forgotten about them and they , not want to disappoint us did not say a word . thi is a veri trifl exampl but for the first time i realis how much elder do to make our life more enjoy than their . as we grow more matur , our definit of fun keep chang . initi fun wa synonom to ps 2 's and parti but as we grow older we mellow down . we realis that fun and respons are a packag deal call life . when you are depend on someon , it like your insur and you have no caus for worri . when you get past be a teenag and peopl start depend on you , you are their insur and therefor have respons . thi is not necessarili a bad thing as it instil in you a sens of independ and pride . a littl fun is alway necessari for anyon - young or old to lead a happi , healthi life .
