there are two way to learn someth , the first it is stude by heart and the second is to undestand the basic idea of the topic . i think that is better to lear the idea of a concept , and not to lear it by heart , although i think that stude as the first way it 's also import sometim , it also depend on what a student have to learn . in my experi , i found more use to understand instand of memor some concept , for exampl take a mathemat topic . it 's pretti impossibil to appli some theorem or forumula if we have not undestood what them are deal about . mathemat it 's beauti , becaus you have onli to understand the concept , and after that appli all the rule that you have learn to a real problem . if a student studi by heart these mathemat concept he will never be abl to solv ani problem that is n't but methodolog . otherwis , in my opinion , there are other concept that are veri difficult to memor onli undest their idea . an exampl my be a law topic , becaus student stude to becam a lawyer , have to learn by heart mani concept and mani rule that they necessari need to know to make their futur job , and not onli to undestand what their are stude or what about is the paper that they are read . in the end , i think that a person , or a student , doe n't have to make an absolut choic between `` understand the idea '' and `` stude by heart '' , but he need to find the right tradeoff to get hi cultur perform and to improv as better hi knwoledg .
