carnot , a veri famou french physician wrote three law , one of wich i could translat thi way : `` with time you gain in organis what you lost in energi '' . he wa speak of fundament physic , but i think that thi could be appli to human be . when you are young , you are fill with energi and you intend to do or tri everyth , travel around the world , practis extrem sport , as we say in french , burn the candl by both end . but do we enjoy life more than old peopl ? answer thi question is quit difficult for me , as i still have n't tri be an old man - it will come soon enought . but howev , i think that you can enjoy your life , young or old , no matter your age . each age ha it own pleasur : when you 're young they may be a bit more intens or demand , but when you 're old , i suppos pleasur are more wise and simpl . moreov , as time goe by , you can enjoy - mayb - your children , and grand children . that 's a real advantag ! joy come from simpl event : the visit of your famili , a good meal all togeth , etc . on the other hand , you may have hard time when age : diseas , loos memori , etc . that 's the big advantag of be young : gener , you 're more fit , and move around , do sport is not a difficulti . but be busi all the day is not allway enjoy life : you can have multipl activ and spend most of your time unhappi about everyth . to conclud , i would say that if enjoy life is have a full life , then young peopl enjoy life more than older do , but , if enjoy life is just be happi and take care of yourself and other , then there 's no age for enjoy everyday 's life . ..
