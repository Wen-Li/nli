nowaday it is quit difficult to answer such a question as we all live in veri hard time . first of all , i would say that , as be a young person , it is quit more easi for us to enjoy life as nowaday everyth is possibl . our grand father had not even the half of what we have today , mean that the rang of possibl have largen . it is also due to the fact that at our age , they were fight at war . sever time my own grandfath told me thi so i would realis the chanc we have . secondli , i think thi is so not to compar as we have total other leisur time becaus of our age . by thi , i mean that for instanc , a younger one will enjoy do a huge travel aroung the world while at the same time , someon older wo n't enjoy it as it mean to much troubl and move all the time . also it is not true to state that we , be younger , enjoy life more than elderli peopl as we do n't have the same mean of enjoy life . for me it could be read book while for anoth it would be bore to do so . thi mean the same for elderli peopl . howev , if it is a question of travel a whole year long or to practic some extrem sport , it is true that we take more advantag of life than anyon els whose work hard to rais a famili . so i would say it is more a matter of what kind of schedul you have . if you are someon who ha plenti of time to do all the thing you like instead of have to earn money to surviv , then it is true you enjoy life more than anyon els . but it is not a matter of age . in conclus , i would say that i do not agre with the statement abov . it is not a becaus you are younger than someom that it is obviou you are enjoy life far more . it is a question on how you oragis your time and with who .
