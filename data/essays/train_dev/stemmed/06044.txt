it is a good idea that when you travel with a group to be led by a tour guid . there are mani reason which make thi issu an import . on the other hand , there are some peopl who think that when they travel with a group , they do n't need to be led by a tour guid . the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid becaus it is import to have a leder . when peopl travel in group , they mostli can not make the desicion about what to do in an exact time ; in contrast , when they are led by one person , they listen to everi thing he say . peopl alway have controversi in mani thing , if they are not let by one person , they may have disagr about someth which is not import in their trip . some peopl think that it is not necessori to be led by one person becaus they do n't accept comment from peopl in gener . thi think that a leader will be strict , and he will just give order for the other peopl . some time if peopl have a trip without a leader , their trip would have a disapoint . actual , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i would suggest everi person who want to go on trip with a group to have a leader .
