now aday most of the peopl are tri new thing without take risk , in my opinion it 's a wrong thing , 1st of all when we are go to tri someth new we should ask about it , special we should ask the pirson who tri thi thing , 2nd the success peopl tri new thing and take risk , i want to tell someth from my own experi , i have a cousin & he want to buy a new car and i warn him ' i told him thi car is not good it 's spend petrol & it 's not fast car also it 's expens car , he told that i do n't believ you & i will buy thi car , i told him it 's up to you , after one month he came for me & he told you that i wa right when i told him not to buy that car , also that i have i friend & he want to marri one girl in the univers i told him that i know thi girl & she 's alway prepar date with a other men , he told me that you are jaleou , i told him ok do what ever you want , after 6 month he came & told you are right , i hear her voic talk with anoth guy & i wa shock , so i think we should ask the peopl who have experi befor we tri anyth new , it 's better for us , from now on we should learn to ask the peopl about someth we want to tri it i think it 's not a shame to ask question , i ve got a lesson from my cousin & my friend , that 's u should't tri new thing befor ask the old person or the person who have an experi
