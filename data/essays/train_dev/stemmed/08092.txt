i total agre with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one spesif subject . one good exampl of an academ subject is medicin . i have a friend who studi medicin at medic scool right now . she often tell me about her school and about doctor . now i will explain follow reason and exampl which i heard from her to support my opinion . first , it is difficult to diagonis desis . for exampl , if you are an ophtalmologist and one patient came and she insist that she could n't see well . you check her eye but note wa wrong with her eye . in that case , there might be someth wrong with her brain . howev if you do n't have ani knowledg about a brain , you ca n't think about it . you ca n't save the patient from her eye sight problem . we ca n't say that you are a good doctor . second , if you have onli have knowkedg about medicin , it is fun to talk with other about medicin . probabl you will be speak with other doctor onli . howev there are mani kindsof peopl in thi world . you can gain and learn mani thing form talk with them . you do n't talk onli about medicin with them . a lot of knowledg will help you to commun with other and make friend . from these reason and exampl , i think we shoud have mani kind of knowledg . it is fun to studi one feild and special it . howev while we special one subject , we should also studi broad subject . thi will make us to have a lot of friend an knowledg in our live .
