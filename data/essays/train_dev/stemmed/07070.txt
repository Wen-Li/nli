learn a wide knowled of academ subject is strongli import to nourish a person in univeris . although there are variou method of gain educ program through life , the univers is necessari as the place for the pre-step to work in societi . let me explain these reason as follow . my primari reason is that a broad knowledg could stimul student ' interest or help student find their interest . when i enrol to tokyo univers , i wa think about major in civil engin . howev , though mani academ class in first two year in the univers , my interest expand into a wider academ world . although i major in civil engin , i could solv problem accord to buid structur or environ engin with variou aspect of thought such as econom or chemic scienc , owe to a boad knowledg . next , variou skill will be requir in workplac . even one project of a construct build need mani knowledg and skill . to research the site to build precis , scientif knowledg is import . skill to make blue print for it is also inevit , in addit to the basic techniqu of use person conput . in order to exoplain thi build plan to other peopl and share thi concept , limit knowled and skill are imposs to work better with other . if a student hope to concentr on the special subject , he or she could enter the graduat program . in the graduat , student can pursu own interest more deepli and take a step to ahiev a career goal . howev , the young ha great potenti which an individu never find it by themselv . then , absorv the knowledg in the unknown world could play an import role through life . i believ that unknown subject of mani academ subject could expand student ' interest and abil in univers . provid skill and knowled in academ institut also are requir in the workplac someday . it is import the young to gain a wide varieti exoeri though mani subject so as to solv mani probelm and deepen own interest for good .
