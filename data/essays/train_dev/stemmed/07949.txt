i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact . learn fact is just a metter of rememb detail . when know a fact is requir , one can alway go and check himself on a book . lot of book have been written with that purpous and there are a lot of written materi which can be use in order to check a date or a name or whatev . the hardest thing is understand the reason whi a certain fact ha occur , the idea that have brought to a specif event , the concept that lay under a certain episod . i think that the fondament issu is to teach the student to becom confid with thi process . for exampl , onc that a student is tought to understand and recogn the caus that have brought to the second world war , detail about when where who and what can be left to sever inform that can be found in book . on paper and other materi it is possipl to find a lot of inform about the mere fact and everi time it is need , one can go and check . student should be rather tought how to use these inform properli . idea and concept provid a frame in which it is then possibl to orient themselv , in order to give sens to thing which ha happen in the past , which occur in the present time or which could happen in the futur . we have to remenb that past can explain the present and somehow foretel the futur as well . if student learn how to collect ide and concept from fact , they are then abl to give a place to mere fact . well , i can not deny that know fact and detail do make sens itself and somehow it is also import for knowledg . howev i think that is not the primari thing . first of all idea and concept are worthi to be understood , then detail come . so , in conclus , i would like to outlin again that understand idea and concept is more import then learn fact .
