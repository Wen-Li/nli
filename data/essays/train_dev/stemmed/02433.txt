i think it is veri possibl to be decreas the number of car or vehicl in the veri near futur . nowaday , number of the car increas especi in big citi day by day . our live becom harder and harder while thi number increas . peopl spend their hour on road just to be abl to get to their offic or school . tranport can easili be a chao . on the other hand energi resourc are limit to suppli energi for the unlimit number of car . excess number of car also caus air pollut which is a big problem . scientist are also tri to develop altern way for suppli energi such as car run with solar energi . but energi suppli will remain an import problem as long as new car are produc . dozen of new car enter to traffic each day . but thi can not be unlimit . even for today , peopl have begun to find effect way of transport . these altern way can be public transport , subway or motorcycl . accord to my observ most of the peopl prefer public transport instead of use their own car . i think peopl will have to stop use car in the futur even if they do n't prefer . becaus natur condit wo n't let them pollut the environ so much . mayb , it will be too late for take thi decis . there is no resourc in the world that we can use unlimitedli . with the rapid improv on technolog , some geniu solut can be found . mayb , we wo n't need car in the futur and return our natur .
