peopl have to choos a major befor enter in a colleg . there are special major such as for exampl engin , languagu , litteratur , etc . .. but we are abl to choos a studi which taught mani academ subject . is it better to have a broad knowledg rather than have a special in one topic ? on the first hand , i will talk about have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . i think it is veri import to have a larg knowledg of mani academ subject . for instanc , when i talk to a friend , if he told me a lot of inform about sever subject , i would find he is veri smart . have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject prove peopl thqt we have a huge cultur , and it is use when there is a discuss about a topic . inde , if we had a broad knowledg , we would be abl to talk about everyth ! howev , there is a drawback . we just have the main point of everi subject , we wo n't be abl to talk about everyth of a subject . that 's whi i think that it is better to studi sever subject , such as for exampl math , biolog or litteratur , when we are at high school and not at the univers . inde , pupil have to tri everi subject in order to find which way they can take after the high school . high school help us a lot in find the perfect major we want to studi in a univers . on the other hand , peopl are abl to choos and to special in one specif subject . i think it is better to make thi choic becaus it is use in order to find a job in the futur . for instanc , i would like to work as a flight control in the european space agenc ( esa ) . that is whi i have to special myself in one specif subject : aerospac engin . if i chose to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , i would have an enorm cultur but i would n't be abl to find a particular job . to sum up my opinion , i do n't agre with the statement . i think we should special in one specif subject in order to find the job we want to have in the futur .
