have broad knowledg is alway better than have special in one specif subject . but , thi doesnot appli to everi student . we can classifi thi for student base on their level of educ in two categori . one is a undergradu level student and the other is a graduat level student . for an undergradu student , it is recommen to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . have so help him to know what fileld he is hi intrest in . he can choos the area of subject , in which he want to special in graduat . moreov , ani person should have minimun knowledg on differ file . like if we take an engin , if he doe n't have minimun knowledg about human bodi , then he may face problem in hi life . like he can not explain well enough to doctor like an illeter , if there is ani problem with hi health . also import is some polit and gener inform for student who come from enginn , medic or ani other file . ani citizen of a counti need to know atleast some histori about hi countri . he may be a big doctor , but if he doenot know how hi countri got indep or who are the great leader or atleast the geograph structur of hi countrti . there is no point say that , i am a medic student and i do n't requir ani histori knowledg . he should have atleast some basic knowledg relat to ani field . where as in the case of a graduat student , it is better if he special in one subject . he need to concentr on one subject and special in it . most probali , a graduat student , like one after complet hi master will go for a job . so , he need to special in one specif subject , where he is dream to work . a doctor need to special in one particular field , like an eye specialist or becom a cardioligist by special in heart relat problem . in short , we can say that a undergradu level student need to have broad knowledg of mani subject and a graduat level student can special in one specif subject .
