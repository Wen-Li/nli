i do not agre with the statement that young peopl do not spend time to help their commun at thi time . thi is not true at all becaus you can see a lot of young peopl share their free time in project to help other peopl as volunt of red cross for exampl or collect money or food to send to non develop countri . peopl nowaday have more inform than befor about what go on around them , on the world . these inform are see in the televis , read on the newspap or by internet , talk with hi friend or collegu . anoth thing is the new thecnolog made possibl comun with more person and share inform faster than you could imagin befor about what 's happen in a place and the possibl to go those place are more easili . all these thing made young peopl to be in contact with the realiti and they awar up about problem in their commun and in the rest of the world and tri to help in the way they can . i am realli surpris when i saw young peopl share their time go to home of lone old peopl one or two time a week , or when they help in hi commun to collect food , cloth or money to send non-develop countri or when some tragedi occur . i realli proud these young peopl becaus they are the futur of next gener and they made a better world f
