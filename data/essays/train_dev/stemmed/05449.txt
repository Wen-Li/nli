despit the fact that there are numer car run on the street nowaday , i think the number of car in use will start to decreas in the twenti year to come . there will just be fewer of them due to the follow two reason : less birth and more advanc technolog . current there seem to be a trend for peopl to give less deliveri of babi , thu reduc the popul , which altogeth would also cut down the amount of peopl use car . with fewer birth rate , there come less popul on earth . these two are tightli inter-connect . take one famili , for exampl , who want to go on a famili trip together . when the number of famili member drop , rel there would also be fewer chanc for that famili to take on car as their vehicl for the trip . if such be appli to everi other famili on earth , there will be an appar decreas in the amount of car in use as a result . anoth possibl explan for the decreas of car is the advanc in technolog . as the year go by , the technolog is enhac and improv at a veri rapid rate . complex invent such as car that involv the applic of high tech were introduc to the world , enabl the possibl of move freeli from one place to anoth . it is then veri like to conclud that in the year to come , other altern way of transport might also be creat and develop . in that case , it wo n't be necessari for us to travel through car , but via other motor vehicl instead as the altern way . the advanc of technolog as well as reduc on the birth rate are take place even at thi veri moment . they can have variou impact to our societi , fewer car in use be one of the effect that they will bring . with these two factor involv , it can be thu expect that , in twenti year to come , there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
