i disagre with the idea that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . thi is two reanson . first of the reason is we should learn fact becaus we have to know what happen in the each countri and get a inform from learn fact . for instanc , when i learn some fact by somet . i got to understand what happen nowaday and if i do n't know eveyth about fact . i can not explain to peopl waht happen yesterday or today . second of the reason is we do not have to understand idea and concept . becaus we could understand idea and concept ani time . but fact have to learn than understand idea and concept . if we miss to learn fact , we could not learn anymor that happen . so we can get more skill and knowledg if we lern fact . for examl , when i tri to understand idea and concept , it wa much harder to understand , but when i tri to learn fact , it wa easi to understand and i wa interest them . therefor , i disagre with the idea that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
