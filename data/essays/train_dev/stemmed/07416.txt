i would agre with the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to specialis in one specif subject '' i think it is wise to be a ` jack of all trade but may be master of none ' . if one know suffici about mani subject but not everyth about a particaular subject then he might not be abl to top ani subject but atleast he would not fail ani of the subject and if he perform reason ok in most then hi overal perform would certainli be enhanc . also it is alway help in daili life aswel as in term of futur prospect if one ha a broad academ knowledg . thi would open him to far more career opportun than if he limit hi knowledg to onli certain subject . say for exampl , in high school , some one who ha score grade ` a ' in physic or mathemat while grade ` c ' in all other subject , although may be abl to get into a top class engin univers but would not have much other choic left incas he decid not to go for engineerin . on the other hand , if one score a ` b ' in most of hi subject he may not be abl to get into the top class colleg but would certainli manag in a fairli good colleg and at the same time enjoy the liberti of have mani career option to choos . thi also come into play when one is applyinfg for job in futur as the person have knowledg in variou academ field would find himself in a situat where he could appli in variou institut . also in place of hi work , he might someday make use of hi knowledg in other academ field than what he is current practic , help him handl a critic situat better and attain more success at work and a thu a brighter futur ahead . to summeris , knowledg never goe wast . so it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . although except might be there , as they alway are , but in the long run it help to have a broader spectrum of knowledg .
