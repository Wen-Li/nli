say wether or not know mani academ subject superfici is better than special in one spefic area of compet is veri hard . i ca n't give an immedi answer becaus there are advantag and disadvanteg of both type of knowledg . peopl who have learn mani academ subject will be prepar more complet than those who specifi in one singl subject . but the knowledg of the former will be clearli more superfici and inaccur in everi field than the knoweldg of the latter on the area of their compet . i would probabl prefer have a broad knowledg of everyth becaus it allow you to tri differ studi and differ job to test your abil and make your goal . furthermor i think it is more interest to know littl of everth , you final know a lot of thing that you could alway want to know better later in your life . in addit thi type of knowledg permit you to understand , . although superfici , differ aspect of the world . on the other hand the person who know one singl subject and who excel in it is oblyg to do that thing all hi life . of cours he can alway improv hi knowledg and find new goal to reach in the same field , like a research doe , but i think that not onli it is more bore and less stimul for our brain but it lessen one 's possibl to find a job in anoth work 's field . of cours i have to admit that without peopl with a veri specif knowledg in one field we would n't have progress in scienc or new discoveri due to their patienc and applic in their subject . in conclus i would say that it is good for a countri to have peopl who grew up with both of these two differ type of knowledg .
