`` the idea and concept are base on the individu one . no one can forc to the other to follow her/hi idea . '' - it is well known adag . accord to the statement it is import to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact . i would also agre with thi statement . from my point of view it is veri impot to be a successful person to understand clear about the concept and idea wheteh in whichev field she/h is . we can take the exampl of the mathemat to support my thought . in mathemat we see that , it just depend on the concept . if you have the concept you can easili understood what the mathemat is all about . there are a lot of theorem in it which are just deriv from the concept . when the concept of it are not clear to the student then he/sh say oh my god how difficult it is . without know that how wonder subject it is . the second exampl for support my idea is comput languag . the comput languag is beauti combin of the idea and the concept . what you think is in the languag bust conceptu structur . just take the exampl of visual basic languag how nice and pliabl languag is thi . if a student just follow the fact without notic the concept and idea then it would be difficult to him to understand mani problem of day - to-day life . sinc day-to-day life is base indirectli on the mathemat and which is total depend on the concept . sinc fact ca n't be chang so they are not flexibl as the concept and idea are . the student ca n't be a poetic one if he just depend on the fact sinc for the poetri the idea is veri essenti factor . so fact are necessari but with idea and concept . becaus with idea and concept the student can get profound knowledg about the subject . concept are fit directli into the mind without ani confus . and thi will help a student to achiev the goal and fulfil hi dream .
