in the question there is two veri differ point which are : have a broad knowledg of mani academ or to special in just one specif subject . in my mind there are advantag in the both of them , howev i prefer the second one . in fact , we are perhap more broad mind if we have a lot of knowledg about mani academ subject , howev i think it 's realli difficult to learn a lot of thing at the time sinc there is too much inform ; that 's whi we could n't be excel in all the subject . moreov , when we know a lot of thing we do n't are veri passion , so it 's hard to choos a favorit subject or find a job which is veri interest and which regroup all the thing we 've learn ; wherea when we speak about just one subject and we know onli thi subject we can be more concentr on it . in fact when we learn a subject deepli it 's more interest sinc we can know more detail and actual be more concern by our subject . besid when we work just on one subject there is probabl more motiv that 's whi it 's easier to have good remind of the theme and all the detail the subject . for exampl it 's better to work in a manag school to conclud i am not sure we can good learn when there are too much thing to know . howev i think it 's easier to special in one specif subject to have more inform and eventu feel better thank to our work which seem to be finish contrari to the work we do when we 've a lot of subject .
