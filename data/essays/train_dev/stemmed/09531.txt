the most effici method of learn cen be debat but on one point all method that were produc ha the common featur of teach the main idea and concept to student . if one learn the way , the process of problem solv , he can also creat , introduc or experi new solv method or new solut . for a student of architectur or design , if he can learn how to cope with the idea of design , includ not steal or not reproduc , he can manag creat hi own item and express it whether it is like or not . he can have the courag if he learn the concept behind the design process . in a social field , for exampl in sociolog , the strudent 's main aim is to learn the idea and the concept instead of the fact . the histori behind the thinker or the idea maker should be studi in order to understand the philosophi of these peopl . if a sociolog had learnt these main idea he can also have a chanc to make hi own research with the avail method and introduc hi own thought . unless a sociolgi student doe not know the idea and the concept , just the fact doe not mean anyth alon and doe not lead a student to an approv research . for an engin student the fact also mean just the result of a problem but it ha no mean if he doe not know the process of the experi . the aim and the method of an experi are the idea and the concept of engin . the fact are like the result of ani disicplin it is like a finish build . wheter it is a social scienc or an appli scienc the theori includ idea and concept are the main brick to be built first . instead of these brick one can not hold a build even if it wa built , depend on fals structur .
