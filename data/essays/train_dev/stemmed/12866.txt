thi is a conversi issu about it is better that learn differ aspect than to special in one specif subject . depengd on person experi , person type and emot concern . we may find that some peopl hold the idea about learn broad knowleg ; on the other hand , some peopl might choos learn in one specif subject . the answer , nevertheless , is not easi to make , with all aspect care consid , i deem that former one is more reason . the essenti reason that whi i agre with the abov statement is that learn differ subject will make peopl have more experi when he ii in the troubl . a good case in point is the affair happen in my hometown last year . some student in my hometown decid to have a trip in desert , befor they went , they prepar all the thing . howev , they met the problem in the second day , a girl wa sick becaus the bad enviro , the madicin they took is useless . when everybodi did not know what to do , a boy who studi botani use the moth he studi in the extra class to save the girl . so , learn extra subjuct is a sensibl choic . anoth reason can be seen by everi one is that learn broad konwledg will make peopl know more friend . take differ class will let you know more classmat , and it is import that the friend will help you when you be in troubl . the case is not isol , it is typic of donzen i have heard . althought differ view about thi topic is exist , i still vote for learn broad knowledg . although the merit of learn one specif subject is recogn , it is evid that the drawback is far outweigh them . learn one subject will make peopl bore sometim , it is not good for peopl that alway think one aspect . so , with the evid offer , i will choos learn differ subject as my opinion . judg from all evid offer , we can draw the conclus that have extra knowledg will be good at both experi and make friend . so , to be frank , i strongli commit the notion that stude broad of mani acsdem , but not onli one subject .
