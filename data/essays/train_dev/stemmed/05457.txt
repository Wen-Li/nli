i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i support thi statement becaus of the busi schedul of the young peopl which make them run out of time . major of the young peopl now a day have busi schedul either with their academ or with their regular offic work . well becaus of the heavi competet in thi modern world the yong peopl who go for school will have a pressur on them to get good grade in their section . to achiev thi they have to work hard which consum a signific amont of their daili time in studi which sap their energi and concentr . usual after thi hard work rest is need and no time is left for them to help their commun . for exampl when i wa studi in my intemedi i wa made to studi for about sixteen hour a day which made me to ignor the thing and happen around me . young peopl work in offic do not have time even to spend time with their famili member so how they can help their commun . they will face a lot of pressur from their head and upper manag to complet their project and the work in time which leav them with no time either to spend time with famili member or help the commun . an exampl of thi can be taken as the neighbour work in an compani who leav hi hous at seven in the morn and return at around nine in the nigt which make him restless . he just talk to me just twice a month or so . in the view of the abov state statement and the exampl that the youg peopl do not have enough time to help their commun .
