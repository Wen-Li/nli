ye , i agre with the statement wich say the it is more import for a student to understand idea and concept . i think thet it is right becaus i have never had so much memori for name , date and fact , but i had more memori for concept and idea . i think olso thet if one person can understand the concept of a problem will be abl to describ the fact . date , name and fact can be remembr read mani time the tex , but the concept no . concept must be explein veri well by a teacer , and it is import thet student can ask him some question if the concept is not so much clear . anoth veri import thing is thet the teacher must be veri abl to explein the conjcept : he must speak slow and he must be shure thet all the student have understood whot he wont to say . to be shure he should ask hi student if the concept is clear everi time befor go on with hi explen . the fact thet it si more import for student to understand idea is more valid for logic and scientif disciplin , were the most import thing is to understand the method . disciplin like stori and geographi need thet student can rememb fact and name , but olso in thi case it is veri impot thet student understand the concept as , for exempl , the way for an histor fact ha happen , wich are the motiv thet make it to happen . for the studi of geographi it si not import to know just where a place is situet , but it is impost to understand the cultur of thet town .
