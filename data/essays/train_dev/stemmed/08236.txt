i think that it 's better to have a prepar in one specif subject than to have broad knowledg of mani academ , becaus the work 's of world research student special . for exampl in my experi of student at the politecnico of milan , the are two main street for to follow . you can to do three year or five year ; the main differ is that at the third year of engin you must to decid your address of studi . for exampl veicl , turbomachin , industri field , materi . .. at the end you must to do an work 's experi in a factori . thi permit to know the new work 's world earli and more fast , while if you choos five year have more broad knowledg of more subject but less special .
