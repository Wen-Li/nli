today , the inform is veri easi to get , and everi compani need the peopl who have mani knowledg of differ field . so , i think if student can learn broad knowledg of mani academ subject . then , their think will becom more extens , and they can get a high-paid job . final , they will have good develop of their futur . nowaday , internet is veri common . therefor , everi countri is connet with each other . it mean everyon will compet to the other peopl more seriou . for examl , ten year ago , the student in taiwan just need to compet with the taiwan peopl . now they need to compet with china student or american student . therefor , student need to have extens knowledg and it will help them to creat new thought . next , if we have mani profession skill , like comput manag or finan skill . it can help us to get a high-paid job . becaus if the compani hire thi kind of peopl , it seem that they have differ field peopl . so if we can be thi person , we will get a high-paid job , and the compani also can save money to hire mani peopl . but how to let us have broad knowledg ? the onli way which i think we should learn differ academ subject in the school . if we just focu on one specif subject , we will lose chanc . some peopl think if we do not focu on a specif subject , we will not learn veri well . we will not be profession in our field . in my opinion , i think it is wrong . if we just learn one field , it may be easi for us . but in futur , we will be sad becaus we can not comet with the other peopl , therefor , i agre it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to specizl in one specif subject .
