ye , i definit agre with thi statement that young peopl nowaday dont give enough time to help their commun . in thi modern world , younster seem to be too engross with their work . they are realli strive for success . but while do so , they forget their moral respons and duti . the older peopl realli care about the societi . most of them are philanthropist and are concern about the develop . they offer their help , wherev they can for the uplift of their commun . for exampl , in a local , if there is a major power failur and the local is plung into dark , it ll alway be the older peopl who will report thi problem to the concern author . the younger peopl feel that they have better thing to do in life , rather than perform act of altruism . such kind of an attitud should be done away with . they youth should realiz that the futur of the societi is their hand . word like ethic , prinicipl seem to have die out in today 's world . take for exampl , a student studi in high school . he is do realli well in hi studi and score high grade in all of the subject which are be taught to him . but besid thi , he should also offer some help to hi commun . he can do thi by help the weaker student out with their academ . also , he should think about the student live in the sub urb who can not afford to go to school . he should be inspir by thi veri famou say `` each one teach one '' . henc he should take the initi and rise to the occass . he can offer help by take lectur there , becaus educ is the pillar of the nation . social servic should be an integr part in everon 's life . therefor , i feel that it high time , that youngster start contribut to the commun by offer their help in whichev field they can . be it in school , hospit or offic . they should set an exampl for the gener to follow , by be benevol and therbi make thi place a better place to live .
