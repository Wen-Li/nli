there is an arab say that say `` understand the the question is half of the answer '' .. i agre with thi opinion becaus the main deffrint between human and comput isth mind . ani comput can memor , ani flass memori , memori card or ani other electron devic can store inform . on the other hand it can not understand these inform , but our human brain can understand them . it is veri importan to search for fact , becaus while search you learn other thing . you read book , articl and web search , you will gain more and more . when you learn a fact you are not do ani thing new . you are just get what other accomplish . i am not say fact are not import but we do not have to relay on them . we have to understand look for more so we can then built new fact . bill gate for exampl develop him self he thought and thought , and he understood idea then he invest microsoft . he stare for noth and reach the top by hi brain ( think and understand ) we wont gain ani new if we did not understand what go on . if u memor there will alway be poepl abov you . japanes develop themselv becaus they understood and thought . while other third world countri are remain the same becaus they do not think , they onli get the inform from other poepl . befor 100 year ago no one thoght that a human will walk on the top of the moon , but understand the idea made us think and now day we have nasa . u can learn fact sometim but u have to understand them . the deffrint between a smart student and an oddnari student is how he think and understand . physic doe not depend on memor . niether do math . they need understand and they need think . on the other hand learn hestori reqir to learn fact . i prefer go for siencebecaus it like a compatit . you need to think and use your brain . that my opinion and again my chois is to understand idea .
