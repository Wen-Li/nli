success peopl can be defin as peopl who have much knowledg and have good propect of behavior . to be success peopl , i believ that peol have to tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . in that way , peopl can have more experi as they tri new thing and also peopl can tri their best all the timea as they take risk . success peopl challeng new thing to get own experi . if a person challeng new field , he or she will experi a new thing . thu , he or she will have more knowledg about the field . i , for exampl , am tri toefl test for the firt time and it is sure challeng me and press me . howev , sinc i experi the test for now , i guess i could do better for the next time . it is becasu i challeng the new thing , toefl thest , and have more knowledg than befor . as take risk , peopl can have good prospect of behavior while they are tri their best . when peopl are take risk , they have to be care as possibl as they can and also tri their best to acheiv their goal or not to fail . even though peopl fail , they will tri their best not to make the same mistak like befor . for instanc , if a student get wrong on the test . on the next test , the student will learn someth from what he or she got wrong and will correct later . as peopl challeng new field and take risk , they can have much knowledg and good person , which mean they can success for the rest of their life . if peopl onli do what they alreadi know how to do well , then it will make them not learn anymor , and caus them to think they are the best . therefor , i stronli recommend peopl to tri new thing and take risk to live better qualiti of life .
