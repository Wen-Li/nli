what is it that differenti a success person from an unsuccess one ? well success peopl dont do much differ thing but do the same thing in a differ way . i disagre with the notion that you have to alway do some thing out of the way to be success . sucess in today world is alway determin by the amount of money you earn but then suceess is a combin of factor like good relationship with famili friend or the commun you are live in. unless you have these basic thing in life in order you can not expect to be success just move in a singl dimens . i am not say that a person should not follow hi or her dream or should not tri new thing in life but befor do that you have to be root firmli on the ground . onli from a secur territori you should go for explor unknown one . peopl usual take risk which come under the categori of reckless not worri about other or ignor their respos . i believ in the law of karma which say that whatev work we find ourselv in , the kind of peopl we are sorround with are all a function of who we are and a function of our past do . to do the work we are assign to the best of our abil is our duti . onli when we follow thi we will find new opportun as we go along . to do new thing and take risk we have to do it from a posit of strength and for that we have to focu on the basic of life . we should tri new rhing onli if come from our heart and not just for the sake of adventur . that all i have to say
