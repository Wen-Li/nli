in thi societi , understand idea and concept and learn fact are both import to the student . normal , most of peopl think first step is to understand idea and concept , and then second step is to learn fact , so student can use the idea and concept what they understood into learn fact and make it easi to learn . howev , for some reason , i prefer to learn fact is more import for student than to understand idea and concept . the main reason is after student learn fact first , their own opinion and question of the fact will appear in their brain . they may have a differ or a similar idea or concept of the fact . therefor , after teacher tell student what is the true idea and concept , they may get the answer of their question and prove their correct opinion in their mind . it help student understand the fact in a better and faster way and get to use what they learn in the fact . then , after student learn fact and understand idea and concept , they may use what they get in real life easili , and it decreas the probabl of make mistak . when student are get to learn fact better and better , they are in their way to understand idea and concept at the same time . in fact , understand and learn have some similar advantag , student will get the idea and use into the fact at the end anyway . everyth depend on the student , like which way is better to them to learn and understand . differ peopl may have differ opinion . howev , for me , learn fact first contain more advantag than understand the idea first . therefor , i agre it is more import for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept .
