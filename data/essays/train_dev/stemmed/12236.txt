i do n't know if be agre with thi idea or not . i would like it . i hope is the result of a scienif research so to be suppor by statist , sociolog , psicolog and univers professor . the onli idea i can use to approach thi thing in a scientif way is to think abouth the forc around thi topic . there are 2 thing who confirm my hope : the traffic and the cost of petrol . from the other side ther are other 2 thing that destroy my hope , they are : the number of peopl how live in good econom condit , the econom car busi thet in more than one countri is support by the central governa . start from the traffic , in the biggest citi in the world , from milano and roma to tokyo , london or new york the traffic problem is veri veri big . a possibl solut is the growt of public transport . for exampl the underground ( or tube like in london is coll ) is prefer by a great number of peopl respect the car to move in the citi . for the petrol cost , i think that is to long and to complic for me to approach a solut . from the other side luke ( with econom growt ) today more peopl can buy a car then 30 year ago , so is possibl that more peopl buy the car . more than thi , the car in some place ( in rapid growt in the last year ) are consid like a statu simbol , a way to confirm the econom power of the famili note : our focu abouth the use of the car and not abouth how mani car will be buy .
