while we are studi it is good to know what should i learn . should i keep work in a subject that i alreadi master or shoud i developp a wildspread cultur ? on one side i could special in order to becom one of the best in what i am do but have no abil to recycl myself in anoth suject , while in the other hand i can learn enough to have an overal cultur and knowledg but no special skill . a lot of scientif developp would n't have happen if scientist just focus on one subject . for instanc , even if einstein improv the way a view physic , he would n't have been abl to developp hi theori if he had n't master mathemat . usuali great intellectu have a broad knowledg that give them a new way of see their specif subject . so in mani way both assert are complementari . personali i am a veri curiou person . for me all knowledg are good to fulfil my intellectu curios . therefor i found it interest to fli from one subject to anoth that to studi one field that would allow me to becom the best in a subject that i onli few can understand . for thi reason i believ that it is `` better '' to have broad knowledg . it is more social . howev our social environ and our societi enhanc expert . if you want to be hire by compani , wathev you are do , you need to be good at it . that the reason whi school and univers are provid student with a veri precis knowledg . you can easili find cour of developp economi or in french middle-ag litteratur . our cultur is driven by experis . at ani cost , you have to master at least one subject . in my view thi attitud is danger to cultur . cultur is divers , therefor one shoud seek for a broad knowledg , rather than a specif subject .
