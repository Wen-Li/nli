there ha been an arguement regard the issu that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . for my perspect , i agre that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus learn broad knowledg of lot of academ subject give benefit that student develop social abil and it make student have human emot . first of all , learn broad knowleg of mani academica subject give benefit that student develop social abil . if srudent have broad knowledg from academ subject , they learn way to face to mani difficult situat and through relationship of student in same class , they also can learn social . in the futur these give lot of help to student . they can develop their social abil . but if student special in one specif subject , they could not have vari experi and they could not have chanc that they develop their social abil . second , learn boroad knowledg of lot of academ subject make student have human emot . there wa time that mani peopl thought that they special in one site are suc . so at that time they thought that human emot is not import . but theseday import about human emot appear countinu . accord economi magazin , it describ that ceo who is succed in one site have great human emot .
