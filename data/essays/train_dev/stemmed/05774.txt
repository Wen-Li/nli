differ peopl have variou opinion about educ problem . studi fact ha it advantag for student . for exampl , student can studi a lot of thing within short time . studi formula is the best exampl . if we studi how to soluv problem by certain formula , we could utliz mani problem especi math . howev , i strongli agre with the statement . there are more advantag to studi concept for student . the best exampl , which illustr my point of view is studi scienc . when i wa a child , my parent encourag me to have currious . they made me to think whi the rainbow is coor and whi shape of the moon is differ , and so on . then i tri to figur out the stuructur and element of them by myself . sometim i went to librari to research and ask professon peopl . from thi process , i train an abil of how to soluv problem . thi is realli import studi for childlen . in spite of thi , if student just studi fact , they regard the fact without doubt . as mani student studi onli fact , the new idea and concept will not be produc . even new technolog will not progress at all . and when student encount problem without abil of how to soluv the problem , they can not do anyth . the my primari consider with respect to educ is studi think process and concept are more inport than learn fact .
