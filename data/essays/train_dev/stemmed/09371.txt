the issu is concentrad if it is better to have knowlagd of mani academ subject thahn to special in one spefic subject . i believ it is veri difficuilt to awnser thi question , becaus tere are mani aspect which speak for booth of them . i think to have a special in one spefcif subject is import for an special job , like chemistri . it will help you to be good in thi work and to have the kowledg . a boss in a firm or compani would search for thi special kowledg and i think you will have a good chanc to get thi job . the special kowledg is veri useful for you and you are an expert in a special subject . peopl would ask you for help and you are abl to give a awnser , becaus you are good educ in thi subjetct . but on the other hand you should have broad knowledg , becaus to have the chanc to get a better job and peopl would respect you . in my view you have a better chanc with a broad knowledg of a lot acedem to get a good job in thi world today . you have a better spectrum of knowledg and i think it will help you a lot . i think knowledg is power and that is veri import . peopl would you more respect and you are onli have a knowledg in one subject . you are special in more subject . in my perpect it is the question for what you need your knowledg and what for a job you want to do . it is your turn to special in one specif subject or to have a broad knowledg of a lot academ . in conclus i would prefer to have a knowledg of a lot academ but in special job like chemistri you need a special knowledg . so all in all it depend from the choic of your job .
