i agre with the opinion that one need to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than specifi knowledg of one subject . there are two main reason ; one is that the modern societi need someon who ha multipl background , and the other is that one specif academ subject is limit to defin the complex realiti . most of all , as a societi is get develop and modern , it need someon who ha multipl knowledg of variou subject . as someon who is special in one specif subject ha a limit to util hi knowledg and experi to other part of the societi , hi valu in thi societi will be reduc . for exmapl , my uncl , who work for samsung electron , major in comput scienc in univers . becaus he doe n't have ani knowledg about the busi and economi exept for the specifi comput subject , he could n't make success when the compani offer a good posit in the busi plan team . in addtion , one specifi subject ca n't explain and defin the complex realiti . in the past , it wa possibl to anal a natur or social phenomenon by use a specifi knowledg and theori . howev , in order to anal and defin a modern phenomenon , we have to mix the variou academ background and knowledg . for instanc , when we analyz the main reason of imf period in earli 2000 in korea , we had to util such mani academ knowledg as polit , econom , socialog , statist , intern econom and financ to get the correct answer . as a result , have abroad knowledg of mani academ subject is veri essenti in that the modern societi need someon who have variou academ background and the complex realiti is hard to be explain by one specif subject .
