while there may be some peopl who disagre , i total agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the reason whi i take thi posit are elabor on in the next paragraph . firstli , for exampl , when i wa look for a use car about 6 year ago , what i did first wa to read thoroughli the car magazin . these were full of advertis actual . there were so much car inform in the magazin that i wa next to imposs to sellect 3 or 4 candid . one day , after i manag to do so , went to the car dealer in person to see on of the car itself . at the sight of the car itself , i wa a littl confus becaus the car did n't look as good as in the magazin . secondli , when i made uniform for the basebal team in my compani , i again check the catalogu in depth . in the catalogu , almost everi uniform desigh look cool , but when we order one type in the catalogu and final saw the real uniform , iwe were a littl dissapoint to see the differ between one in the catalogu and the real one . furthermor , i have made a compani recruit websit for college/univers student . thi wa like a advertis of our compani , our workplac . we tri hard so that our compani would seem excel . of cours , we did n't made fals statement or imag use pictur and cg . but what we tri to do wa to collect best pictur of our compani and workplac . so , in thi sens , our compani 's websit should have been the veri best imag of our compani . in conclus , for the reason state abov , i total agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . on the other hand , i seem to have to learn that product in the advertis are not as good as they realli are when i do the shop .
