i absolut agre with that statement . and i do agre becaus i think that onli by take some risk in life you can make yourself differ from other peopl . i think thi for sever reason . fist of all , everyon can do the same thing well all life long . but just a few can distinguish themselv . for exampl , mani peopl in life are happi by do the same thing , all day , all year , all life . but for other peopl thi is a limit . some peopl in fact ca n't do the same thing all life long just becaus that ' s not in their natur . they feel not satisfi by do a repetit life . they must chang their posit . i believ that succes peopl are success becaus they ca n't do same thing all life long . but not onli . i believ that success peopl love the challeng . challeng is in their natur , and they just can not ignor it . they do n't like to feel like other peopl so they take risk and tri new thing . they do these thing to prove the world that they are better than other peopl , that they are special person . challeng is their life and without challeng theiy are not stimul and so they feel depress . so anoth reason whi i believ that success peopl take risk is that becaus they are ambiti . that 's not all . there is someth more , i beliv . and thi is the feelig that a person feel when he reach an high level , for exampl in work , or anywher . for exampl : a man with a normal job in normal citi , in a normal and bore coutri , decid to invest hi money in a new activ . the activ work good , and the man feel like he is god in person . he chang hi life ! the feel is the one that say to them : i made it ! . the adrenalin that you feel is such a good feel . you feel like you could do everyth , if you just want . so ambiti peopl also love that adrenalin shock and the feel that they prove when they made someth import . but take risk is not alway an open highway . tat- a difficult path to walk on , but if you have got the abil , the intellig and a littl luck it will problabl wok . to sum up i think that succes peopl love the challeng , love to feel good with themselv and love to say : i made it !
