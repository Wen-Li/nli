the issu argu that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani subject than to special in one specif subject . in my opinion , i believ that it is better for student to know broad knowledg . there are three reason whi i think that . first of all , it will be veri bore to studi one subject for a long time . in fact , you might get total exaust and you might even lose the interest in that subject . for exampl , student who are good at calcualt studi math for a long time would also want to chang the studi subject to a subject that can read without use your hand or brain . secondli , you can know what you are realli interest in when you studi a bit of variou subject . thi is the reason whi educ do n't focu on a specif subject and it also can make up the choic which what we realli like of a student after a long time basic educ till high school . for exampl , we decid what major we want to studi after enter univers . we can decid by the interest we develop sinc we start elementari school . futhermor , i believ with the advantag of learn everi a bit give more opportun of choos variou job . we can use our broad knowledg instead of one specif idea to appli job we want in the futur . for exampl , peopl who want to studi hotel manag when they appli to thier univers . peopl who put hotel manag as their major need to lean a lot of thing than just manag . as far as i know , they need to know about differ kind of wine , busi , economi and commun among peopl . in conclus , i prefer that peopl should learn more than just a subject .
