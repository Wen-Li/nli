i neither agre nor disagre with the point suggest abov . i believ that the success can be obtain by tri new thing as well as practic what is alreadi known to us . thing that are alreadi known might not be as refresh and excit as new technolog or knowledg , but they 're still import , becaus you can not do anyth advanc without learn the old thing correctli . for exampl , let 's say that i 'm a member of a medic research group that is tri to develop a new type of medicin for brain cancer . even if the point is ` tri to find a new way , ' you can not perform the task success unless you know and perform the previou thing veri well . that is , in order to develop the new medicin , you have to learn all the previous accumul knowledg about medicin and brain cancer first . at the same time , howev , new technolog and trial are certainli shortcut to the success . mani peopl who had deni the stereotyp and tri new thing had succeed and becom a billionair . and that is inde how our histori had advanc so far . peopl have tri new idea , knowledg , vogu , system , and so forth , and up to now we 've becom a highli industri world . even onli 3 or 4 hundr year ago , our life use to be all about church and work . but thing get chang and chang . and if those new thing have n't been tri , our world must have been stagnat and still . and that rule appli to an individu as well . as long as you stick to the old topic , you can not go forth . histori ha prove that for you . so my whole point is that the success can be obtain onli when you respect the alreadi known thing and new thing equal . neither old thing nor new thing can exist without the other . old thing exist to be use and to be replac by new thing . but without the accumul histori , new thing can not come into it place .
