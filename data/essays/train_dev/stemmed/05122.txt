sinc five year i am a student in biotechniologi . thi is a veri special subject - but i got dure my studi also an overview to mani other subject . like i have made it i think it is good . have hi own specif subject and be realli compet at thi subject but have an overview and a basic knowlegd of differ subject . then peopl from differ specif subject can work togeth on a bigger project in which are differ specif subject are need . in my opinion it is import becaus today everi special subject is veri larg and you can not get enough knowledg in everi subject to develop a bigger academ project alon . for exampl i am do my diploma thesi at a topic in biotechnolog . and about the task of biotechnolog i know veri much but sometim i have a question about the chemistri . then , ye - i can read a book about it but i can also go to the chemic depart . there i can ask a specialist , and he can explein it to me veri easi . and there is also anoth argument . it save time and time is money . it ist quicker to put the knowledg of differ person togeth . when i would read a book about my chemic problem , i would lose much time . probabl the person from the chmeical depart would have explain it to me in an fwe minut . in conclus you can see that it is more effect to have one specif subject and then to make some teamwork with peopl from other specif subject . it will be easier and quicker .
