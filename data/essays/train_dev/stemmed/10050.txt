while some peopl disagre with the stement becauseof global pollut problem , but i personali disagre to the statement , there are two reason for that : peac and high technolog . first , i think young peopk enjoy peac . for exmapl , i am in japan and my father suffer pacif war but i do not suffer ani war . anoth exampl , u.s.a. peopl dead peopl in iraq war is much smaller than vitnam war . acoord the survey , iraq war dead of u.s. number are thousand of peopl , by contrast in vitnam war ten of thousand of peopl dead . for these reason , i feel that young peopl more enjoy peac than old peopl . second , young peopl enjoy high technolog . for exampl , young peopl enjoy intenet but old peopl could do not it when they were young . moreov it is hard for old peopl to adapt them . for exampl , send email is easi for me . but for my mother 60 year , she ask me everi time when she send email . in anoth exampl , thank to air taranpo it is easi for travel today . in japan , in1970 travel to europ cost 700,000 yen . but now it cost 7,000 yen . for these reason , i feel that young peopl more enjoy high technolog than old peopl . in conclus , i think what stetement describ is right . sinc young peopl can enjoy the peac , and thank to high technolog young peopl can enjoy new world .
