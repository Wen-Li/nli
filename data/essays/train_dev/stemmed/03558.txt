i clear disagre with thi statement abov for the follow reason : mayb on a first impress , young peopl often seem to have more fun becaus they are abl to take part in activ like do sport , go to parti and travel . clear , some of these activ ca n't be done by older peopl mainli for physic reason . but on the other hand , there are still mani activ remain that are even more suitabl to be done by older peopl : first of all , there are characterist way to engag in sport for older peopl , like hike , swim and play golf and chess . they even may have the advantag of perhap have practic thi kind of sport for sever year and can now acchiev greater , more satisfi success . second , there are a lot of opportun to meet other peopl in sever club or on bu tour . in these occass they may even meet peopl that share the same interest . final , a lot of old peopl start travel all after the world onc their done with their career . at thi point , it is import to mention , that in an older age one ha a much greater amount of freetim he can use for ani of those activ he like most . that 's due to the fact , that in childhood and youth one ha to go to school , to studi or to work in a job . i person know older peopl , who realli began travel all over the world becaus they final had the time to do so . so it is obvoiu , that there mani possibili for older peo so final , one can conclud , that you can onli answer thi question for yourself , depend how `` fun '' is defind and how it can be measur in your eye .
