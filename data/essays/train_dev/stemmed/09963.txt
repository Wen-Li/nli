i disagre with thi statement becaus in my opinion for the new work 's world is more import be special in one specif subject than in mani academ subject . i think that becaus in my school i have studi a lot of subject but i admit say mani thing but these subject are n't studi in a specif way . in fact i have found a lot of problem when i came in my univers , where is import onli one specif subject . the new world of the work , in my opinion , request a specif kind of worker . in fact now there are mani type of work and the number of peopl who have broad knowledg of mani academ subject are not increas . i tri to use an exampl . an architect that creat all of the part of hi project is rare . we can find a lot of architect or design that are special onli in one specif subject . it is so becaus is chang the univers and the new work 's world search differ kind of worker . so , i think that is import studi one specif subject and do the best work that i could make .
