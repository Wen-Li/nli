i agre to the statement that success peopl tri news thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know . take risk is a trait i consid most necessari for success . and success peopl are master of thi trait . one can not discov new shore without will to lose sight of the shore . take risk is the first step to innov . progress is mark by innov . and innov occur onli when peopl take risk and tri to bring about someth new . the key element for an individu to succeed is to innov and bring about new idea . if one keep do what he is good at , there is no learn and no progress . consid an exampl of one of the busi great in the world , bill gate . he came up with a product microsoft which wa total new when it began . but now it ha captur the world market in comput . he is the richest and the most success man profession . to bring about anyth new in busi , take risk is the first step . there is a risk of the product fail miser in the market . but at the same time , you can never know the true potenti of your product until you take that risk and bring it into the market . i have known a sportsman more closer to home who chose sport over academ despit hi parent and peer want him to go to colleg and get a degre . now he is a sport star that hi parent are proud of . had he not taken the risk of go against hi parent and follow hi heart , he would not be as success as he is today . i also know of a friend in my field who quit a lucr job bring him a fat salari to pursu wild life photographi . not mani peopl would have taken that huge a risk of put their alreadi establish career into jeopardi . but thi friend is now well recogn and contirbut to the nation geograph channel on televis . he is a veri well recogn wild life photograph . if one would just go about do what he know well all hi life , then he would never get a chanc to realiz what hi other potenti are . there could be a lot of talent in him . unless he take risk and explor them , they would remain hidden . if the wright brother had not taken that first risk of flight , there would be no aeroplan today . stick to norm and do what you know the best all along would stunt growth . henc , i believ that take risk and ventur to do someth new is the key to success .
