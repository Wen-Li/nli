in thi eassi i 'm go to answer aquest which is base on my experi about '' should success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how ro do well '' . and i will give my opinion whenther i agre or not with thi statment and give some reason and exampl to support my opinion . will i think that success peopl should alwasi tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do , becaus in order to suc in your life you have to tri new thing and take risk becaus it make you learn more about your self and life , so for exampl , i have live my whole life in saudi arabia a have live there for about 18 year , and now after i finsh high school , i came to the unit state to get my univers degre there . so it wa hard decis for me to make and it wa also a risk to do that and also it anew thing for me , but it wa a good decsion to make even if there wa some rik but in order to suc in life a have do it , so now i am in whole diffrent cultur than i wa in , and i am learn new thing and i have been in a lot og risk a tri alot of new thing , but it wa good for me . but it wa good for me that i made thi decis becaus i lear alot from it and if i did n't do it i wo n't suc in life , so if i just sate in my countri and do that same thing as i do i will not suc and learn new thing . so in conclus i just want to say that if u want to suc in life you have to alway tri new thing and take risk in order to suc beacus it make u learn more and more about life so
