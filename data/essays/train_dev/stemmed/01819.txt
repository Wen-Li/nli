i agre whit the statement that success peolpl tri to do new thing and not onli what they are alreadi good to do . in my opinion thi is a main aspect of a success person , inde success peopl have the abil to understand what they can tri to do even if they know that they alreadi have n't the prepar to do that . someon ca n't becam a real success person if he does't tri to risk . he ha to have the abil to understand that he can tri to do someth even if he does't know how to do that . in modern societi it is more difficult to rase over other peopl than some year ago , so peopl , who want success , have to go over their own limit to tri if they are realli abl to do some thing . it is like when someon bet , he doe n't know if he will win , but he know that if he will win he will be happi and success . nowaday there is n't so much space for weak peopl in the high level of the societi . but there is a big problem about thi aspect of success peopl , and it is a proplem for all the societi . i think do thi , there is a low qualiti of activ . in other word , if someon stop to do someth when he becom abl to do that , becaus he want to do someth els , there wo n't be a person abl to do that work and so there will be less qualiti .
