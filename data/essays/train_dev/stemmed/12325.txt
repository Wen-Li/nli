the guid give us a lot of good imform about the place , and they know where is good place to see . we do not have to reserch about the place where we travel . it is veri easi to travel . but i think that the best way to travel is not in a group by a tour guid . there are some reason whi i think so . first , i think it is not intrest to just follow the guid when i travel . i think , howev , it is import to find someth interest or someth new by myself . i am happi when i find someth that other peopl do not know and when i find somewher beauti by myself . second , travel by myself make me feel confid . when i went to australia . i went to the zoo by myself . i research the fee to enter the zoo , how to get there , what to see . it made confidenceto me that i can travel in foreign countri by myself . abov all , if the travel is in foreign countri , i would like to travel by myself definitli , becaus travel abroad is chanc to learn the languag or cultur of the countri where i travel . the tour guid might explain what is good , what to eat , where to see , and so on , in japanes . i think it is import to be surround by the air of the place to have best experi . i do not think travel led by a tour guid is bad , but the better way to have fun is to travel without her . i think find or learn someth new is good experi and the experi will never be the same , on the other hand , travel led by her is almost alway the same . i think peopl who want to do someth differ from the other should travel by theirselv .
