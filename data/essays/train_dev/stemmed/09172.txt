i don-t total agre with the statement . my opinion is definit differ from that . if we go to take a look at the past year we can onli see a costant increas in the use of car and i think it will constantli keep on grow up . there are a lot of reason support my opinion . the first is the constant research for altern energi also to be use in the car . in fact a wider and wider area of the planet is under the threaten of pollut caus mostli by ga emiss in the air . even if thi bad aspect exixt from a lot of year nobodi ha still found a solut and the result is an alway much more pollut world . anoth reason whi we-ll never stop to use car is becaus we are total dipend on them . we can-t live without them . for exampl if i have to go out for an holiday , not abroad , but in my countri , i would take my car and not other transport mean like train . whi ? becaus i should stay at it hour schedul and it- not so seldom that it come on late . in my person opinion a modest advic i can give is to improv the transport system in the countri . as a student that ha to take the train and the bu more than 5 time a week i notic a big mess in everi mean . they are not onli often on late but there are also strike that caus a lot of problem to peol who have to go to work and should arriv on time . if we don-t tri to solv these problem befor , we-ll never stop to use our car . i think we should take a look at some other countri where these aspect function better than here . for exampl i went to helsinki two year ago and i never wait more than two minut for a bu , a taxi or for a train . everi mean wa on time and in fact there were much fewer car in street ! here in itali it- quit imposs go around our citi and don-t get trap in the traffic ! it- terribl and sometim a lot of peopl don-t have enough patienc to wait and they start to scream or do veri dangerour thing . but everi year noth is done to improv the situat . how long still do we wait ???
