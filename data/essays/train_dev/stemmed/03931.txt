ye , i agre with the given statement . success peopl tri to do the new thing rather than do old thing or repeat thing . here success peopl mean the peopl who got a lot of experi in their job or in their person problem . do the repeat thing didnot give the new idea and we also do n't get new knowledg . rather do the new thing we get the mani idea and these idea can be use in mani of situat . but old thing are also import for begin of a new thing . thi mean that repeat thing are fundament or basic of begin new thing . so we ignor the old thing in some case not in all . suppos if we neglect the old idea for start a new one , some time new thing becom fail . so we have to take care while do new thing . these are some disadvantag for not take the old idea . repetit of thing is a bad idea . inord to improv our intellectuv abil we have to improv the new idea . onc we find the new thing and new idea the organ or anyoth criteria where we are work give award and also give the better posit than now you are work and also a good salari . by do new thing we have to discov mani thing , these will be help for the futur use . onc we find new idea it will be use for mani gener and our name be print in mani book . if we do n't get proper repons at the time of invent the new thing , prosper name will come after centuri or decad . so accord to me find the new one is great rather than old one . these are some advantag of get to do new thing and new idea .
