i ultim agre with the fact that it is better to be special on a specif subject than to spread energi on differ subject . howev i say ultim , becaus be and stay focus on one subject mean alway to discard other subject . i found the focu necessari and veri import at a certain late stage of the person work career or academ career . the reason behind hi you build up some `` spike of knowledg '' on a broad knowledg platform . these sharp spike of knowledg will allow you to promot yourself and to pull with you the societi forward . have said that a deep knowledg of one subject can onli be base on the focu on a certain subject and none us are born with a direct and with a goal readi to be accomplish from the day of birth . instead we should find our path and our focu by ourself and to do that we need a broad rang of knowledg . think for exampl to the manag of a compani who is veri good financi , but it doesent know histori , polit ... he will alway take the best financi decis and at the same time will alway have a strong opposit insid hi team or industri , becaus as he doe n't know the histori and the cultur of the peopl behind the busi , he will never be abl to respect them . therefor i think in an earli stage it is posit to broad our knowledg on differ subject like : histori , languag , polit , art , mathemat , phisic , biolog , economi ... howev at a middl or later stage we should focu or refocu on the subject we love more or on the subject which will give us more satisfact . as an exampl for thi i can talk about myself . i have receiv an educ on differ topic from latin to mathemat , i have studi engin and i got a doctor degre in engin , howev one day i found out that my life wa in busi , therefor after 12 year work in sale & market , i decid to build up my knoledg focus on busi matter and to pursu an mba studi and i am sure that thi will bring success to myself and to the peopl around me .
