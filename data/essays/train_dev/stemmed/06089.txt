the discuss about the success of peopl accord to the risk level of their do should be split into two part . one the one hand are peopl , which tri new thing and take risk to fullfil their target . on the other hand are peopl , which do what they alreadi know to do well . such two differ type how to handl with risk will reach the final success . peopl have differ kind of mean about their own apil of risk . if i think about such differ , i will talk about two friend of mine . the one boy is about 35 year old . he reach one of the best school examin with a grade of 1.2 dure hi school period . he began studi law and finish univers after less than the regular stude time of 4 year with a veri good grade . hi first contact with the econom or in gerer with busi had taken place for him with 26 year in a big compani as an assistant for law specif question for consoult contract . he wa veri resist against risk , mayb becaus of hi first contact with the busi world . he had been in such offic and posit for almost 9 year without a lot of experi , but also without tri ani higher risk , than go home earli then 10 minut befor the regular busi close time . my second exampl is a boy , who is 28 year old . he finish school with a grad around 2.5 , which hab been the middlefield in hi final examin year . he start an own busi idea after hi examin . hi busi wa about the offer of it solut for small and middl size compani . in the time of the new market economi a lot of compani use the consoult work of hi compani . he had have a lot of fix costum , which need hi help regularli . dure such period he had have the idea to export the concept to other countri , which he start in 1999 with austria . bank help him to fullfil such target by offer a lot of money . after two year he had have 4 offic outsid germani and a sum of 4.500.000 euro as a neg deposit on the bank . the concept fail by the crash of the new market and he lost all the life standart almost in 2 month and will not be abl to pay the whole deposit to the bank in hi life time . as a conclus of my two exampl , the level of risk can not be argu by the level of school educ , mean the final examin grade , and the univers statu . moreov peopl with a abil to tri risk , will have a faster success and will be stay there , if they control themselv regularli . the risk of fall down , becaus of uncontrol mistak is more realist in comparis to the risk resid peopl . howev , everi human bee have to know for themselv which goal and object he or she want to reach and how fast to get there . in adit such factor will bring the level of risk abil and the success .
