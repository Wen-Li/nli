i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact for the follow reason . first , if we put import on learn fact , it tend to produc peopl who think the result is alway the most import . for exampl . i use to think that the english abil test such as toefl is the genuin reflect of one 's english capabl . base on thi notion , i tend to judg how peopl i know is fluent in english by ask his/her test score . in addit , i wa easili dissapoint or overjoy upon my result of the score , becaus i tend to think my test score would determin my english fluenci . as i constantli get higher and satisf score , i reach the conclut that i had enough skill to handl english , and stop studi . howev , i found out my percept wa wrong . there is no limit , or end for studi langag and it is more import to tri hard or make effort , than make good result , becaus those process can tell us essenti lesson , such as import of be humbl or keep high motiv all the time . plu , sinc i have been live in the state , i recogn how my english level is not suffici to call it enough . therefor , put more emphasi on learn fact ha the riski effect that make peopl think the result is the most import . second , if we tri to understand idea and concept , better than to learn fact , we are like get more innov and flexibl way of think , or see the object . the idea and concept are fill with great experi , or lesson by our ancestor . for instanc , the japanes car is said to be excel in it qualiti . thi is the fact . howev , none of the good lesson or experi can be lean from the fact . on the other hand , if we tri to learn it idea or concept which lead the japanes car maker suce , we can learn benefiti informaion to us , such as how dillid is import , or how teamwork is import . thu , i strongli agre with the idea that understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact .
