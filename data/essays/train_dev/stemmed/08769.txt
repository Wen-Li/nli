i agre with the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . the statement abov is consid to be statisticli true due to the fact that those success peopl have a back-up plan that they are current use which is the thing they are alreadi do . the say `` if it ai n't broke do n't fix it '' is fals for the busi world . if those sucess peopl keep cling to what they alreadi have eventuallli somebodi els will take thier idea and evolv it or take it to anoth level , thu leav those success peopl no choic but to take risk and tri new idea . if success peopl tri new idea that help them and further increas thier profit and help them build a better reput then they will gladli take that idea . if they tri someth new and hope that it becom success then the faith that they put in thier new idea ( ex . project , product , or ani other thing ) will either strengthen or weaken depend on the outcom of the new idea . in life it 's either eat or be eaten . the same rule appli to the busi world . if you have a plan that you might think will work or will not work then you should take a chanc and not ani chanc but a calcul chanc that give you hope of let your plan work or flourish . mani peopl tri to invent new gizmo 's or even updat old idea , but they fail in do so becuas they lack the financi aid or even the help from peopl , that is whi onli success peopl take chanc and tri new idea so that their success continu and that thier busi continu to grow .
