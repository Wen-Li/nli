do young peopl enjoy life more than the older peopl do . i do not agre with the given statement becaus , young peopl are veri immetur to their age and can see thing onli in one point of view and analis thing to a limit extent , in fact will not be abl to enjoy anyth to the fullest . in contrast older peopl analis thing in broader way which facilit them to understand thing better ultem lead to more enjoy . for examlp if ani good novel is read by both the young and old peopl as older peopl have experienc much more thing in life these experi help them to enjoy the situat in novel better than the young peopl can do . as older peopl have broader knowledg about the wrold around them have better understand of the thing and are abl to analis thing better secondli when tour is plan by the older peopl with their matur in think they are abl to arreng the thing accordingto the need and tri to take fuul enjoiment of the tour , when it come to young peopl in their over enthusiasm they tend to neglect thing to plan earli ultim may get into onconvi and problem on the trip . if we take ani relationship into cosider young peopl lack understand about the depth of the relat and will not be abl to enjoy the relat emot affect to the fullest . for exampl in a father and son relationship the feel of immenc pleasur a father can enjoy when he spend time with hi son , as he treat hi son as a invalu treasur and cherish everi action of a child where as a son may not be abl to enjoy the time spent with father as a veri plesant as he is not matur enough to understand the depth of the father-son relat as the father doe . thu in my opinion i regard older peopl can enjoy life pleasur better due to matur of thought and the contribut of rich experi of their long exposur to the world . which younger peopl lack .
