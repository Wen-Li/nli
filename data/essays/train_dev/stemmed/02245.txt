accord to me , i think that it 's better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . it allow us to have knowledg in differ domain , to understand so mani thing and to poss all the basi in order to choos a special , in case of one . firstli , i think that a broad knowledg of mani academ subject give us a veri wide rang of inform . thi rang of inform permit us to becom awar of a lot of thing , subject and topic . we can learn so mani notion that it would be a pitti of not integr variou knowledg . second , i think that there are a lot of thing veri interset in thi world . know those , allow us to understand the place and the world where we live in . it give us a differ percept of the life , not a focus one as if we are special in a particular subject , that could be a veri deep one but not veri larg . be thi way of think we becom more open-mind and our place in the societi will be a result of that . and final , by have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , a special will occur alon and natur . we all have affin for a specif domain , so by know a lot of thing , one point will appear as more captiv than the other . thi view demand more research than if we want to special us in one domain , but it also permit us to compar diferr subject and then choos the best one for us . to conclud , i would like to say that a wide broad knowledg of academ topic is decid better than a special . we live onli one time on earth , and know thing in a hudg rang of domain is a possibl that we have the benifit of . so , whi be closed-mind and focus on one thing we suppos the best for us when there is too mani fascin thing to know ?
