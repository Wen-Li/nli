i agre with the idea that peopl should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . there are three reason whi i choos the idea . first of all , broad knowledg is use when we have to decid someth . it give us a object point of view , i think . for exampl , when i wa a high school student , i did n't have such broad knowledg that i could not choos to take the cours of physic which i realli want to studi and i final regret my choic befor . in fact , i did n't know well what physic is . if i have knowledg about the physic , i difinit choos the cours of physic . threfor , broad knowledg is use to have a object point of view . second , broad knowledg help us to work more fluentli . when we work for the compani , we face variou problem which are difficult to solv . in that case , most of peopl do n't solv the problem by himself or herself and have a meet to find a clue to overcom it . it mean that variou knowled which belong to a lot of peopl is effect to solv the problem . therefor peopl who have broad knowledg is compet to solv the problem . final , broad knowled make out life more fun . when we talk with the other person , a person with broad knowledg can give a lot of subject to talk and it give peopl enjoy time to talk . for instanc , i have a friend who have broad knowledg . when i go out for a drink with him in a group , he suppli variou topic and most of peopl concentr on hi talk . thu broad knowledg is effici to spend enjoy time with other . for these reason , i agre with the idea that peopl should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject .
