i total agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i have three reason to explain thi . first , the aim of the advertis is to sale more product . no produc want to decreas the function of the product in the adversiti . on the contray , the produc will tri their best to show the posit aspect of the product and minim the neg aspect . so , the product in the advertis will onli have the advantag . for exampl , the advertis of the medicin will onli tell the custom which diseas it can curv and neglect the seriou point of the medicin . some custom will be extra-damag by the medicin for the neg aspect of the medicin . second , in order to sale more product , the produc enlarg the function of the product in the advertis . the product in the advertis will be much better . for exampl , the miner water are good to the health of human bodi . some produc take the miner water as penecean which can be use as medicin to some ill . third , the advertis is a good too . the advertis can sale it onli when it can satisfi the produc of the product . that mean the advertis need to make sure the product in the advertis should be excel , even better than it actual it . from the abov , we can draw a conclus that the product in most advertis are not the same as themselv . their funcit are been enlarg in the advertis . so , the gover should care about thi problem to let the custom know the truth of the product .
