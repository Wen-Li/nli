have you ever been on a bu when suddenli an old woman get in it and nobodi offer their seat ? i guess that everi one who ha seen it , at least one time in their live , will agre with me when i say that nowaday young peopl doe n't care about help their commun . rigth now it is not a normal thing to help old peopl to cross the street , or to offer them your seat in the bu . when i wa at school , i use to go to the local hospit for work like a volunti . i realli love ! my dutti were to take care of some kid while the cleaner work on their room . i spendt four hour a week play with differ kid . it wa n't a hard work for me , and it wa a veri useful activitti for my commun . i think everyon should tri to help their commun , due to the fact that they will be abl to have fun an at the same time make an excel job to help other peopl . becaus all of thi they may also feel better with themselv howev , what it 's true is that in the 21th centuri 's young peopl normal ha a lot do . for exampl is pretti common for teenag to work dure the year , or to play differ sport . mayb those are the reason , but mayb what happen is that young peopl is becom veri selfish . if they have time to hang out with their friend i 'm sure they can also find time to help their commun . not to much time is requier . you can make a lot with a \ onli a few hour a week . in conclus , nowaday young peopl do n't give too much time to help their commun , actual they do noth for their commun , and thi is veri sad . i think school should have kind of a subject to show kid how to help other and how to be involv in their commun .
