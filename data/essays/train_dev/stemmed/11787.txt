i agre with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . know about differ topic is not someth that is good onli dure one 's studi life , it is good for as long as we as individu exist . there are situat in which gener knowledg is veri use . a way to explain thi idea , is with doctor and journalist . it is true that later on their profession life medic special in one area in specif , but befor that , they go through mani field of medicin until they final reach the desir one . in my person experi i 've known mani doctor special in differ area of practic and they have been capabl of answer or respond accordingli in differ situat . the other group of profession mention earlier , show us that they never confin themselv into onli one area . it is true that along their career they have the tendenc to follow one field , but it is a fact that have to know about other thing too . some newspap have special journalist but when they work on shift , they have to be abl to handl everi kind of inform that show up , otherwis , there would be an aw lot lost of inform . nowaday , dure job interview , mani compani ask their applic their opinion on differ matter and subject not relat to the post they are appli for . they do thi in order to ackonwledg how well prepar they are , and to measur the level of literaci the personel ha . thi is a situat that support the idea express at the beggin of thi essay . just for the fact that everyday we meet and talk to differ peopl , we see and know for sure that we all have a vari divers of opinion , thi is someth that is for our own benefit , so for all these reason and exampl state befor , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject .
