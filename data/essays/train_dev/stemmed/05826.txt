learn is a veri import part of student life . i think learn in ani form add to one inform and knowledg area . therefor in my opinion when a student is at undergradu level he should take varieti of cours both in the area of learn fact and understand idea and concept . on the otherhand when a student is take up a graduat program he or she should take up a cours which involv understand the concept and idea . for exampl take a profession cours in the understan of comput is better than studi histori or geographi . i beleiv that task becom easier and more enjoy if one tri to understand instead of memor it . thu a practic approach is better than rote learn . i feel learn fact is not as much interest as understand concept . thu i agre with the statement .
