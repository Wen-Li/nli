knowledg , is the ammount of stuff we know . mani peopl just studi one specif subject while other get more inform . by special in one subject you will know mani thing but onli in that subject . if you know allot of knowledg you can have a better convers with someon . i think that by know more thing about the world and what is around you , poepl have a better imag of how you are and you can have a better convers . there are mani way how to get more knowledg . for exampl , you start read mani book of mani differ topic and learn by yourself at your home . also , you can go studi more thing like studi one subject but you can go further and studi other stuff that in some way they are link togeth with the first thing you studi . in my opinion i think that have allot of knowleg about mani thing is a realli importarnt thing to have in your life . even as you are grow up you should watch show that have educ and read book that have import inform . while tri to have a convers with a person who onli know someth about one specif subject you will have an interest convers onli if you talk about the subject that person know . in the other hand , if you tri to have a convers with someon who know mani stuff about the thing that is around us you will have a veri enjoy convers . i realli think know someth about onli one subject it not good at all . learn is not realli expens if you know how to do it ( like read book ) and it is not a crime or bad for you to know mani thing . everyon should read everyday and if possibl studi for mani year .
