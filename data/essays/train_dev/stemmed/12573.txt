i do not agre the idea that it is bettr to have borad knowledg of mani academ subject to special in one specif subject . i have tow reson of it : our job and interest for peopl . first , specif skill are use when peopl find their job . most of campani want peopl who have them , becaus they can give the campani new idea or new skill . in fact , when we have interview test for enter some compani , we need to apeel our uniqu point and differ from other . specif skill are provid for good work . second , to special in one specif subject is interest for ourselv and for peopl around us , becaus peopl who have their specif subject know someth that everyon do not know . they can choos onli one subject what they want to studi , moreov they can give everyon surpris , interest or notic . for exampl , my teacher wa major in japanes histori at univers so he ha specif knowledg of it . he often tell hi student interest stori . we do not know most of them so we alway be realli amaiz but hi stori is realli interest . in conclus , it is good for us to have one specif subject in that we can get our job easili and we can give peopl around us amaz . if you have it , you are look as a great peason
