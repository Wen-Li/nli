i am agre on thi statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani subject '' . as per my view look at present day scinario , it is better to have a lot of knowledg of mani subject . as scienc is in a phase of revolut and today necess that peopl should to have an interdisciplinari person . anoth point is that use multydimenson approach to solv ani problem . firstli , now a day it 's time for revolut and renov . sinc , time is chang and we are in 21st centuri , so we have rebuild mani concept becaus today the scienc ha achiev so much and technolog is also in veri good condit . we have also to find out some answer of mani question which are not solv yet . therefor , we have to be gain knowledg of mani subject to improv our idea . secondli , we should tri to get enrol in variou new and intradisciplinari subject . here i want to say that at present time 's need that we should tri to get admisson in variou new subject and it 's much better to take an interdisciplinari subject . by studi an interdisciplinari subject , we can gain a knowledg of a varieti of subject . for exampl , appli scienc can provid a vast knowledg of variou subject , which we ca n't get from ani special subject . anoth exampl may be of bioinformat , where we learn and read variou subject as biolog , computersci , inform technolog , math , stat , physic and chemistri . so that i think thi type of student can work much better and can handl variou type of problem . thirdli , multydimensin approach can solv some critic problem . present time it is a veri nice idea to be an multidimenson person . for exampl , in ani research institut 's there a problem which involv physic , mathmat and biolog , then here is a proplem that not ani person know all the thing so here a person have multisubject knowledg can do well . so that we can make a model and can solv a problem without ani problem . therefor , i can say on the basi of these some point that it is better to have a knowledg of variv subject . mean jack of all tra
