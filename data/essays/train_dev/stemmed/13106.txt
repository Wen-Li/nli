it is gener said that when travel somewher we need a group led by a tour guid . although a group or a tour guid would give some benefit , howev , i definitli beliv that the best way to travel is to do alon , becaus travel with a group led by a guid is too costli and time consum . abov all , the cost of travel in a group and a tour guid suppli by tour compani is extrem expens . i experienc that befor travel the osaka in japan , the tour compani that i chose suggest differ option , if i ad the tour guid to my travel , the tour compani requir almost twice cost as anoth which did not includ guid . eventu i chose travel alon and could buy present for my famili and friend with extra money while abroad . moreov , nowday we have a lot of resourc about the tour informat such as book in the librari and internet that do not requir ani cost . with those method , we do not need to expens guid anymor . second , within the schdule cours suggest by tour guid , peopl can not enjoy the travel entirli . as each person ha differ tast dure the travel , natur there are differ that member want to look at . for exampl , when i travel over the europ with my famili use packag program desin by tour compani , i felt uncomfort becaus i want to stay in pari longer while other did not want . unfortun i could not make schecul chang , i should leav pari in short time with unsatisfactori . in conclus , i disagre with the statement that a group led by a tour guid give tourist most benefici method , for the reason that i mention abov . travel with a group or a guid contribut a lot of stress cost and it is wast in time-wid .
