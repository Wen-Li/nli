learn process can not be separet from understand . that 's whi , we can never compar understand and comprehend process with learn as they are alreadi the part of the learn itself . as an english teacher , have dealt with teach and learn process for year in the univerc , i can never think of an individu to divid these process which are close relat , even tie strongli to each other . ( comprehend and learn ) i think , herebi , the descript of the ` learn fact ' gain import . undoubtli , learn fact have vital import for the student in practic mean . but a realiti ha to be taken into consider , even a ` learn fact ' process is a part of understand the idea and comprehend concept . imagin that a teacher is tri to teach the student the vapor characterist of the liquid . it is an undeni realiti that you may make the student vapour a liquid . the teacher make him/her perform the vapor action sever time , again and again and the student may perform the action veri well but if the student doe n't grasp whi she/h is do that , what is the import of it or if he'sh can not make the necessari connect logic and can not gener the situat to an anvironment realiti ' then what is the mean of it ?? learn fact also have close and strong relat with the understand and comprehend process ! you may teach fact to anim also , by repetit , they even learn to sing or imit peopl 's featur which do not belong to their natur . an anim may learn a fact , but never can understand idea becaus it ha no think abil . on the other hand , if thi repetit doe n't becom continu , they forget . . but peopl have logic , abil to think which is the main characterist differ them from anim ! you may teach everyth to the student onli make them understand , grasp or comprehend . that 's whi ' it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn effect .
