today we all live in a world full of advertis . it is enough to walk in a street of a big citi to see how mani advetis are hang on the wall . i agre with peopl who say that most advertis make product appear much better than they raelli are for some reason . first it happen veri often to buy a product onli becaus you have read it advertis and notic that the product 's qualiti shown in the advertis do not realli match with the qualiti that the product actual ha . i think that it is an experi common to everyon . in addict it is well known to everyon that the true aim of an adevertis is to persuad the custum to buy the probuct . the batter way to pursu thi aim is to convic the custum that if he or she will buy the product he or she will certainli enjoy the extraordinari featur that the product ha . the point of the question is that it doe not metter if the product actual ha these featur or not . as a consequ of thi tendenc we can see that a bussin is grown around the abil of produc convinc and persuadign advetis . in fact today there are a lot a compani that employ a consist number of work and pay these worker to develop advertis . accord to these compani a good adveris is abl to convic a custum to buy a specif product even if the product itsefl doen not worth to be bought . i think that it is a strong suppurt topic for peopl like me beliv that advertis make product seem better then they actual are . in conclus i beliv that thi way of behav concernig product advertis is not a honest behaviour but , on the other hand , i realli convinc that thi beahviour is the normal result of our societi , a societi base more on the appar then on the truth .
