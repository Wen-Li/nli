student can learn about mani thing in school . when student learn new thing , it is veri import for student to know what they are lean from class . and there are some advantag and disadvantag at the same time to understand the key concept and to learn onli fact . i prefer understand the basic concept to learn fact from the text book . to understand the basic idea is not simpli but , in my opinion , it can expand student 's abil of think and creation . understand new idea and concept can take long time and sometim it could take few decad for student . it can be problem to learn new thing . that 's whi some instructor and student take shortcut to learn new thing . for exampl , when student who are major in visual commun art can learn the principl of ratio , so call ` golden ratio ' which is believ as perfect proport for everi object . it is veri difficult theori to understand for special freshman and it could take more than 2year , but if they can understand they can design anyth with the basic theori . even though difficult to understand the idea , student who understand the basic concept can appli what they learn through it . it can be easi to creat new thing with the basic concept . for instanc , a musician who understand the principl of music element can compos mani differ kind of song and lythm use the basic music element . consequ , i recommend to understand the main idea when student learn new thing . even though it is hard and difficult way to learn about new thing , after understand the notion from the basic . it would bring great abilit to student . that 's the main reason i studi and research in order to understand the concept in the class .
