whether one enjoy or not , depend mostli on the individu definit of enjoy . if a person find one work interest , he/sh will drive immens enjoy in do it , even though the same job might appear extrem drab to anoth person . in order to do justic to the statement made here , we need to understand how the prefer of young and old peopl differ in term of their activ . thi statement seem to be written by a young person who feel that his/her present pursuit of vibrant physic activ , adventur and long vacat spent in travel to excit destin are hi sole sourc of enjoy . becaus he feel that he might not be abl to do these thing in advanc age , older age might be bore in all respect . howev look from the perspect of an old person , have live his/her younger life in constant activ , lot more enjoy is found in do the other kind of thing . these can be small littl thing like read book , soak sun in the garden , garden , play with children and the like . we need to understand here that it is not that they have to do thi , but becaus they choos to do thi which in turn is simpli becaus they enjoy do it . i am not generalis all the elder peopl as dormant person who indulg in less physic activ . there are case that one come across in which peopl in old age resolv to do someth veri demand in physic term just becaus they could not do it when they were younger , and they feel that do it would bring them lot of satisfact and enjoy . therebi we have stori of some 60-70 year old tri their hand at trek or a cross-countri run . i agre that there can be case where a person might becom physic unfit to take up an activ that he would realli want to . thi might happen more often in old age , but we need not forget that young peopl are not complet exclud from that . there can be case where peopl in young age are incapacit in variou aspect as well . but even in such case one will sure engag oneself in some activ that he/sh might eventu end up enjoy a lot . it is apt to mention here that enjoy eman from an initi emot of accomplish . when one feel have made an accomplish in ani field , he/sh start ` enjoy ' it . to conclud , i wish to reiter that enjoy and happi are a state of mind and matter of person choic rather than absolut entiti . henc to say that criterion of age , sex , educ , opportun and the like will bar someon from ` enjoy ' , is not correct .
