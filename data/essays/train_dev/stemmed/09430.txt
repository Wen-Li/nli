i disagre with the statement accord to which there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today . as thi statement is howev support by strong argument , i will firstli name them befor indic whi i disagre . it is nowaday wellknown that car caus heavi pollut which damag the environ as well as the human health . in particular the co2 reject by car destroy the ozon . in some citi of the world the air is nearli not breathabl ani more and the citizen of such citi face , for instanc , heavi asthma problem . therefor citi all around the world tri to set up car free zone and to improv the qualiti of the public transport . in addit , petrolium ressourc are becom rarer everi day which lead to increas petrolium price for consumm . all these reason may lead peopl not to buy car in the com year and eventu lead to a decreas of the number of car in use . one should howev consid that as technolog develop everi day , petrolium may soon not be need anymor to move car . electr is more and more commonli use to make car move . main car constructor like merced are nowaday build such electr car with a larg autonomi . thi new gener of car is quit cheap which will even permit peopl who did not own a car befor to buy one . electr also solv the pollut relat problem and may therefor encourag peopl to buy car . anoth reason whi the number of car will not decreas in the twenti next year is that car allow peopl to be much more flexibl and autonomi than plane or train do . some place in the world can simpli not be reach without car . in addit , drive is a passion for mani peopl . thi lead to the final argument against the statement : it is difficult to chang peopl 's mind and habit and it will definet take more then twenti year to stop peopl consid car as part of our cultur .
