in facti agre with both of the statement , becaus i think that it 's an two adg statment . in my oppenion i see that it import to make a relationship between understand idea and concept with learn fact , becaus by understand idea and concept , the idea will take an uneras part in the student mind so i think it an ecel way to let the idea on mind , morov if ou add fact to the idea , the idea will have a stronger maen and impact ; exampl ; if the taecher gave the student an idea for exampl about war and polet broplem and add to thi idea some pictur from the real world or fact and artic , the student will more abl to understand the idea in the right way , and by thi way they will have the opportun to undrestand idea and concept also to learn fact .
