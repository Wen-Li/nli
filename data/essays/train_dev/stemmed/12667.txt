i agre that fewer car will be in use in twenti year than there are today . although , car are the main transport current , there are transpor we could use other than car . in addit , more invent would be brought , and also becaus car are one of the main factor that pollut our environ . everi year , our societi improv and evolv seek for better way of live . two of the issu that are dislik from use car are comfort and expens . as we all know , car are expens to buy , especi good and well-known brand car . great amount of money is also spent to maintain these car for such reason as oil fee and park fee . moreov , as more peopl afford car , there are lesser place to park car and the park fee would increas as a result of their demand , which make our life thougher . therefor , by the time of twenti year , more peopl would use other public transport such as subway . secondli , peopl like innov . they prefer new technolog , good , and idea , which lead to have new invient of transport other than car . therefor , in the futur , they might come up with new style of transport which is similar to the car we use nowaday , but that would no longer call car anymor . lastli , the issu i consid here is health . as more and more peopl afford car , the more our environ would be pollut , which is n't what mani peopl prefer . thi is obvious becaus pollut harm peopl by damag their health . fortun , peopl are get sensit about their health . thi phenomenon will possibl reduc the use of car in twenti year . overal , as a human be , i prefer have comfort life with spend less on car , ador innov , and have good health . therefor , in my perspect , i think fewer car would be use in twenti year compar to the use today .
