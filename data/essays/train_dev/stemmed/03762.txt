the best ? i do n't like say that . it meyb is the best way sometim but not alway . becaus we have some differ idea when we locat at the differ age . so travl with a guid or not depend on the period of our age . if i wa a child or teensag now , i 'd like to find a guid to describ the cultru of some spot . the reason is that , i have much less knowledg about some famour place . so travl with a guid is veri necessari for me to learn new thing . also , travel with a guid is a comfort way becaus i can save time and money to find the spot and buse which can lead me to the porpus place . but , if i am a univers student now , i will choos to travel myself . whi ? becaus i have had the capabl to do someth on my own . for instanc , if i want to go to yunnan , i will find some rel inform about that place from the internet . you know , in the morden world , internet is a perfect sourc for out younth . so travel alon is much easier for us . so , do n't you think it is a good decis ? then , if i am a old ladi who have had not abil to walk along . certainli , the best way to travel is led by a tour guid . the reason is that i can get some essensi sevic from the tour guid , such as help me to walk , introduc some spot to me aloudli and so on . someth look much foolish but are all necessari . becaus i am a disabl one and need more heart kindli . so , travel in a group and led by a guid depend on the concret situat . but , travel in a group is the best way to make friend who have the same interst with you . i have some friend who travel with me to some spot , and i found that we all have the similar interest at some aspect . henc , lead by a guid is the best way to trave sometim , but not alway .
