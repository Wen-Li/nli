i agre with the statement . to make the point clearer , i have taken `` their commun '' as their local commun where they live . i do not know how mani young peopl attend their local commun event or even strictli obey rule in their local commun . exampl are everywher . one of the reason would be that such behavior to help their local commun need to be learn some way or anoth , but not learn . if young peopl live with their parent or there were neighbor who had known them long time , they could learn it . if young peopl live in the same place where they grew up , they would undestand natur how to behav . but young peopl nowaday tend to live alon or onli with their spous and far from their hometown . anoth reason is that sinc nowaday almost all the everi day life is support by busi undertak , peopl can live without help their commun by themselv .
