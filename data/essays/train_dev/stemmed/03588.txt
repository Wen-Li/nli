will there be fewer car in twenti year from now ? my instant repli is no , and mainli becaus i realiz how our technolog are rapidli advanc , and car will chang , chang onli to make peopl love them more , satisfi urg for beauti car model , creat more desir to own one . look back into the past sinc car were first invent , there 's a huge big differ of how much car are own . compar to befor when onli the rich own car , car nowaday are get cheaper in price , consid the amount of second-hand car be sold and how cheap it is to buy one . as time pass , the rich will continu to buy more car and sell their old one , and at the same time , the lower class will buy these use car for a cheaper price . with thi cycl go on , more and more peopl will be own car rather than sell them . and whi are the rich buy more and more car ? gener it 's becaus of the constant chang in the car technolog ; the desir of speed and uniqu design . a stereotyp view of rich peopl are peopl who buy car just becaus of it look . car compani look at thi , will exploit thi point by come up with more and more uniqu design car . there 's a rare chanc rich peopl will disappear and their interest in buy these car decreas . on the other hand , there 'll alway be the lower class peopl who are readi to buy these use car at a lower price . most of the peopl want to own a car , and in my opinion , thi is a psycholog desir ; jealousi . when a person see anoth person with someth they do not have , that person will also want a car . when a rich guy see hi friend with a realli groovi car , he will also want a uniqu car of hi own . there 're alway more gener join us and with thi cycl of jealousi and how the car price fall , it 'll be easier for peopl to own car . conclusion , i 'd say that in twenti year , or even fifti year , the amount of car usag will onli increas but not decreas . unless someth better than car join thi market and success grab car buyer ' attent .
