i disagre with the argument that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . actual , it might be help to have mani knowledg but object , that is unnccessari than to special in one specif subject . anybodi have mani other knowledg by use some time . but if to special in one specif subject . than you will get more specif knowledg that other peopl do not know about it . it is more use to have the knowledg . for exampl , let say you are the owner of the compani and you want to hire some one for market section and there are two peopl who went just a univers and aother went a specif busi colleg . who do you go to hire for your busi ? i am not say that the just univers person is bad but , object , i will hire the specif busi colleg . becaus i want the person who have a idea of a specif section , which is busi and who have lot of knowledg at the field . and not onli my question but also the real world is like that . there are lot of peopl who are achiev at their field such as ceo of microsoft , not onli he wa good at but also he wa ti soecializ in one specif subject . may be to have broad knowledgeof mani academ subject will help you to decid your field but if you have your goal alraedi than i suggest that to have knowledg in one thing . and eventhought you think it is wast fo time but do not stop . becaus no bodi will go to have that your effort and you will get the golden age for your appreci .
