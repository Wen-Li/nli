there are mani advang in ani field of knowledg . they have some connect with each other . if student onli learn one specif area that will be misunderstood some part of academ subject . in my opinion , i agre with peopl are better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . some academ subject need student know the other subject first . otherwis , they could not total understnad it mean or how to figur out the answer . for exampl , student have to know mathemt class first and then they can use it on the account class . on the other hand , if peopl have broad knowledg , they can understnad the newspap what they talk . they also can join ani kind of topic to share their opinion . if peopl onli concentr on their area that will be lost mani chanc to know new friend . peopl special in one area that 's good for their career in the futur becaus they can deepli understnad their professionl knowledg . as the matter fact , after graduat , peopl can gain more specif knowledg when they work . it would be better than learn specif knowleg in school so they do n't need to focu on it . if student learn specif subject in univers , they will lost oppontun to gain more than other area .
