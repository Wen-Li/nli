i agre with the statement , that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , for sever reason . first , i think that the student should understand idea and concept becaus then they realli know how a thing work . when they just learn a fact they will forget it soon after . on the other side it is obviou that they when they understood someth onc they will not forget it for a much longer time . howev , sometim it can be import to learn fact . the student should learn some import fact , becaus it is nessecari . for exampl , i think everzbodi should know when the second world war startet and when it end . thi is just knowleg that everzbodi need that live nowaday . second , i think in the modern world it is much more import to understand idea and concept becaus today it is to difficult to know all the fact . we live in a world where everyth is special . nobodi is abl to know all the fact , so it is much better to understand the basic . fact are get more import for the person who work and don t go to school anymor . a doctor for exampl ha to know how the human bodi work . he ha to know all kind of bone of a human be . for student it is not import that they can show all the specif bone of a human bodi . it is possibl that a student that learn all the bone , will becom a lawer in the futur . then he ha to know complet differ thing in conclus , i agre in gener with the statement . i just think that it is import for the student to know some basic fact .
