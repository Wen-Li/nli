it is difficult to agre or disagre with thi statement . if peopl enjoy their life or not , depend most of the time on their charact and their live circumst . these circumst can be bad for young pepol as well as for older peopl . but i rather think older peopl enjoy their life more than the other way round . most of the time young peopl do n't have as mani respons as older peopl have . older peopl are limit by their job , their famili and other task . on the other hand the job and the famili can be veri fullfil for the older peopl and therefor make life more enjoy . due to a lesser amount of respons younger peopl can do what they want and like . thi greatli contribut to more joy in life . but there are exampl where thi doe n't hold true . a rel of mine who is 58 year old quit hi job with 50 and is now live a veri fullfil and enjoy life with less respons than even the young peopl have . anoth thing which contribut to a more enjoy life of older peopl is that they can valu good time more than the younger becaus of their experi . most of the older peopl went through bad time in their life and so they can valu smaller thing more than young peopl do . furthermor they know better what they like in life . young peopl often do n't know what the like . they are unstabl in their emot and tend to be depress over small thing . on the other hand older peopl are often less open to tri new thing . therefor they might miss activ or experi which they would enjoy veri much . in summari it is difficult to say who is enjoy hi life more , younger or older peopl . i think it depend veri much on the charact of the person itself . but when i had to decid between the two , i would choos the older peopl .
