nowaday most of the young peopl care a lot about their own problem . they do not worri , if they can help an old ladi to cross the street . focus on their own aim is veri import . in additon they onli live , becaus they want to enjoy their live . they do not look for peopl , who need help . i think , that young peopl should be ask or even forc , if they do not want to help other peopl . on the whole most of the young peopl doe not spend enough time to help their commun . work in a hospit for a low sale can help to remind especi young peopl , that they will becom older . for sure , they are forc to see a lot of deseas , for exampl if their grandfath suffer from a bad ill . thi experi can help to persuad younger peopl to spend more time to help their commun , especi their own one . young peopl can chang their mind , becaus they see , that it make older peopl veri happi , that their is somebodi , who visit them . secondli parent have got less time , becaus they have to cook for their childen , make the whole housework and they also have to earn the money . even becaus of thi fact , most of the younger student do not help their own parent . that is realli scare . onc they will becom parent and than they look back and see their bad behavior . chang their behavior can help them to improv the gener situat . as a conclus i can agre with the statement . i hope , that young peopl chang their mind . the gener situat of the societi can realli be improv , if peopl think more about each other and not about their own problem . for sure that is a realli hard chang .
