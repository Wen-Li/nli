some peopl hold the opinion that most advertis tell custom the product much better than they are . other , howev , have naget attitud . as far as i am concern , i would like to vote for the agreement for thi statement . the argument for thi point are list as follow : first and foremost , the enlarg of the qualiti of some product in the ad is one of lot of reason for inlustr the phenominon of the adervertis did not show the truth . for exampl , onc a coupl hang around in a mall , a saler of tv told them the high resolut of that tv is the best qualiti to enjoy . they bought it by cost more , but finnal they found the good qualiti onli come from the dvd present in the mall . so , it is reason whi most consum do not believ what the saler said . there is anoth factor that deserv some word here . the ad alway show fake feasur of the product . for instanc , the pictur of the product show onlin . onc you buy a good look stuff onlin , do not feel so happi at onc that you got a great deal to have your favor thing . you mayb need to wait for the last moment that you reciev the ship item you bought sever day ago . in addit , the gurante of some produc doe not onli want to show the coustom their item have good last qualiti , but also want ad a attract thing for ask you buy them . if you finnal make a decis to buy them becaus of the gurante polici , you may fall in a trap . from i have discuss abov , the enlarg of the qualiti of product , the more preeti but not real pictur of the product , and the fake gurante for the stuff are all the ad show the product much better than they realli are
