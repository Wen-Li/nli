homenkind alway need success to reach good life standard therefor succ is a veri import aspect of human life . everyon ha differ point of view about the idea of be success . some assum that , tri new thing and take risk is better than make what they do well , in contrari to those some assum that , do what you alreadi how to do well is better . i person agre with the first idea . these are my follow reason . firstli , success is relat with gain new experi and make new chang . everyon need to chang and must develop their self . for devolop and advanc , sometim peopl take lot of risk . becaus when you are tri a new and unmak thing you can loos your other qualif . i think that , a success person should be creativ . for that reason , these peopl should make new experi that other ca n't do . becaus they have abil and they are capabl to do thi . histori is full of with those courag peopl . in addit , success peopl should be hardwork and persist . they should alway want to invent new thing and should alway be inclin to chang . for exampl , there are lot of scientist in the histori that they establish the world unknown rule . we can give albert einstein for an exampl . when he wa at school he wa n't a perfect and brillant student . just becaus when he wa at he classroom he alway ha think about the world exist ani ani other unpublish stuff . after year he discov lot of thing about thhe enviro and he becam one of the most well-known scientist in the histori . the last but the least , when anybodi chang hi or her expertis , he or she take a lot of risk . if peopl attend to discov new thing , they sould educ other peopl around them and share their inform about their expertis . furthermor , when you are tri to make a new thing in mani way you should delet your ex-car . also , in your new direct you may not get suc . in that posit you might loos your respect , money and selfconfid . on the other hand , if you succeed then you would be more valuabl member of your commun . all in all , as i said befor successful peopl should tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know how to do well . i hope humankind doe n't disregard what i mention .
