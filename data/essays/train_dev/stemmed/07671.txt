an old say `` a jack of all trade and a master of noth '' suggest us that a person should not tri to have more of the broad knowledg of each and everi subject but should be focuss on a singl subject . so mani other say were develop in the past relat to thi thing onli like `` littl knowledg is a danger thing '' but they were the one which were state long year back and are not valid today . talk about the present scenario where success ha becom everi man 's need , a person who is just have a knowledg on one subject can not climb the stair of a ladder that could lead him to a successful path . it not bad to be focuss but not saluburi in the current era . focuss on one subject can have mani divers effect . have knowledg on one subject the job area to which the person can appli will be restrict . he will be abl to appli for some of the job onli , that could lead to more of frustrat and more of tension as he will not be abl to appli for job that may be could lead to fulfil hi major dream . the present man should tri to have as mani knowledg on each and everi subject as he can . as in big industri it the sphere of knowledg that matter and not the perfect on one subject . and onc you have got the platform then success is just few step ahead . take exampl from our outsid world as that of miss aishwarya rai , former miss world and a success bollywood actress . it wa not just her beauti that carri her through such a tough path but her intellig . she becam miss world , which is not an easi job , and then got an easi way to enter the film industri . so as she wa perfect in field includ intellig and beauti , she could reach the door of success earli as compar to the one who enter the industri at the same time . so in a nutshel it can be said that a man live in the present day world should tri to chang the say state abov to the one `` jack of all trade and master of everyth '' then onli he can surviv .
