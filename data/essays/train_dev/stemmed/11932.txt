i think that in twenti year there will be more car sin use than there are today . if we compar the prsent no of car in use in present with the past we can see that at present there are more car at present as compar to the past similarli i think that in next twenti year there will be more car in use than today there are lot of reason for that which are as follow . first of all nowaday there are have a lot of option for the car buyer . the cost of the car avail nowaday vari a lot accord to the econom statu of the buyer . so it ha becom easier for the car buyer to buy the car . moreov we have got a number of banker and financ who give attract deal for the car buyer . so it ha becom easi for the car buyer to buy the car . day by day the car are pproduc in a way that they are more fuel effici and so it is becom more econom for tha car user to use the car . so thi is one of the big factor due to which carus are use the car more . secondli if we see the conveni it more in the car as car can reach the remot where other mean of transport can not reach as easili . in case we see the other mean of transporat say for exampl buse or train they are not abl to reach everi where as they can not reach the remot villag the high mountain rang so over there it easier for the car user to reach . nowaday car are launch in such a way that they attract more and more youn gener . youmg gener is attract toward the speedi car with sporti look . the market is done accord to the user where car manufactur want to reach . so the market accord to the need of the costom ha also increas the nomber of the car user . so my pinion is that in the twenti year there will be more car user .
