in the era of fast develop technolog , enjoy life is becom goal of life . in my opinion , the young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . firstli , the older peopl have no enough time and spirit to enjoy their life . in the competect societi , the older peopl concentr their attent on how to find a good job and so on , so their time and spirit is exhaust and even they want to enjoy life entir it is not permit by themselv . in the contrast , that young peopl relet have more time than older peopl make them easier to enjoy life . when the older peopl are busi to work , mayb the young peopl are watch movi or even travel abroad . secondli , the young peopl meet a myriad of newli develop entertain such as electr game and internet . as the develop of technolog , it appear a lot of thing that older peopl never met . so if a older person have a cd-rom of a new game or chat on the internet , mayb he will not know what to do becaus in the time he is young he had never seen these thing . but the environ where the young peopl live form them a broad accept abil to someth complet new . it is the young peopl who compet in the world cyber game competet , it is also the young peopl who chat on the internet and play net game . so to the summari , young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl not onli becaus they have enough time and spirit but they also meet and accept some new way of enjoy life . but thi group of peopl may be older one day , so i think they should be more interest in enjoy life rather than gete tire as a older person .
