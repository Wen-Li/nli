i think it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus the idea and concept will provid them with the essenti thing that will help them to understand and to develop thier knowledg . for exampl : if we want to learn a new languag , we can not dive directli into the core without learn the basic such as letter and number . anoth exampl is to be a comput programm you have to learn the concept of program , basic of deffir languag and etc . if we do not first understand idea and tri to learn fact , the result wo n't be good . we will feel confus and we wo n't see matter clear . like build , if basi are week it will be degener . idea are veri import to imagin how the final result will be . therfor , we can go in the right way and achiev good result depend on the our idea and concept . most of peopl do not pay attent to thi point , but i think that anyon want to do someth especi big project they have to go in thi way . look to the develop now , ask yourself from where it came . peopl especi scientist and other peoplr put thier idea predict the innvat abd the situat in the futur , then it happen as they thought . i notic that peopl who work in the imagin movi innov more new thing day by day , especi in astronat field . they start by produc movi that show some strang creatur attack the earth planet and tri to captur it . then peopl fight them in order to get freedom . these seri of movi encourag peopl to seek and to innov depend on concept and idea mention .
