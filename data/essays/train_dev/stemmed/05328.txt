i do agre with the statement and i woud be even more radic : i think all the advertis tri to make the product better than what they realli are . sometim they do not succeed but i think the intent are alway to present the product at best , no matter what the real featur are . the reason must be search in the aim of the advertis itself : an advertis is a messag that must convinc and persuad peopl to buy the product it talk about , and to buy that exact product and not some of the other on the market . to obtain thi aim the peopl who make the advertis can rare escap the strong temptat to go beyond the line of an object descript of the product , especi if there are mani similar product on the market a custom could choos from . therefor as the number of product on the market have increas esponenti , the advertis had to introduc more and more sophist and intrus mechan to get it aim of convinc . in thi way the real featur of the product advertis have lost more and more attent , in favour of other messag which are indirectli and in a more subtl way connect in our mind to the product itself . these messag make use of attract area like beauti , beauti actress , actor , model are often show connect to the product , sexual messag are also use in differ way , other messag that make use of some valu and stereotyp , like brave men , happi famili and so on . sum up i think advertis ha gone far beyond the limit of present a product , mayb ignor the neg featur and emphas the best one ; it ha becom a power and intrus activ that make use of all the mean it can to obtain it scope . it not onli want to convinc peopl to buy someth instead of someth els , it also tri to creat the need of new product and servic . therefor it is not surpris that mani time we are convinc to buy product by the way they are present in their advertis , or just becaus we want to feel like the handsom actor use that product , but then we have to face a strong disappoint .
