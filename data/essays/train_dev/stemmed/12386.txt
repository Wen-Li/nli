life is all about the prefer . some peopl choos go on the wa x while the other walk on the y so the peref are depend on the way peopl want to walk away . thi rule is also valuabl for the academ life of peopl . some peopl prefer to studi and to have knowledg about mani subject , in contrast other want to special in onli one subject . i do not agre with the idea that it is better to have a wide knowledg of mani academ subject than to specil in one specif subject . firstli , for exampl , in my univers elig student are given an opportun to studi doubl major and mani elig student from busi administr depart are stuy doubl in econom as well although most of them is goin to work as a manag in diffrent depart of a compani . howev , in the busi field employ requir their employe to know pretti much about what they do in the busi , for instanc a market manag is not requir to know about econom . second , it is wast of time becaus instead spend time to get knowledg about mani differ academ field peopl should devot all their time and get depth into the most crucial subject for their futur and career . have a littl bit knowledg about mani academ subject doe not add so much valu on the peopl s career , on the other hand special in a singl subject can help a person to be famou all around the world just becaus of the contrubut s/he make to thi subject . in conlus , i believ that focus on one specif subject is better than to have broad knowledgeof mani academ subject . although i have been studi doubl major , i have been tri to focu onli on and pay more attent to economi class that i have been attend in the unives becaus i want to have an academ career on econom and want to be a famou econom professor all around the world .
