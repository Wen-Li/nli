i think it is not so simpl to explain about thi . whi ? becaus i ask thi question to myself differ time . i am a student . i studi civil enginn in milan . dure my differ exam i have found some import subject : gener subject ( for exampl math ) and specif subject ( for exampl road construct or structur design ) . gener subject help you to understand the specif subject . but the problem is thi : when i will take my degre peopl will see me as civil enginn . what i can do in particular is not import . i think that univers must teach differ accadem subject , so you can have a wide vision about a work , like a civil enginn . after a degre , everi person will improv hi knoledg in one specif subject . in my situat , for exampl , a civil enginn will special in road construct or skyscrap or off shore structur . it depend what part of civil enginn he like .
