over centuri , start almost with the found of the first univers , the ideal of a complet educ person wa domin on the european contin - somebodi who master ancient languag as good as he is at natur scienc or even the art . and on the other end of the line ? there wa the specialist , soley focus on hi subject , almost an idiot in hi single-minded . but the time have chang . with today fast grow amount of scientif knowleg and the fast pace of research - new find publish almost everi day - no one can know everyth these day anymor . so the specialist , who wa laugh at onli 150 year ago , seem now to be the ideal of an educ person . howev i think one should tri to take the best part of both educ ideal for oneself . and my suggest to make thi possibl , is not to tri to gain broad and specif knowledg at the same time , but one after the other . dure primari and secondari school there is plenti of time to teach the student differ subject and viewpoint . even if it seem to be a wast of time becaus there wo n't be an opportun to use the attain thing later on , it will still widen the student mind and help him organ thing s/he learn later on . for exampl , when i went to secondari school , i wa taught latin and ancient greek - which both do n't serv much purpos in today world , but it help me not onli to studi french and spanish easili but also told me a lot about european histori and mytholog , what is quit import for job i do now . on the other side , when somebodi enter univers or ha alreadi studi some year , it 's time to take a decis and choos a subject or a focu for hi graduat time . becaus of the abov mention imens amount of avail knowledg , thi focus on one field is propabl the onli way to be realli good at it . ( which again is in my opinion the main parti in do someth ) . so my ideal is somebodi who ha a broad basi of knowledg , which make him abl to decid , base on the broad basi , in which subject he want to specialis in later .
