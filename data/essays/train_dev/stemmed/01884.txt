i disagre with that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . there are three reason . first , older peopl have much time than young peopl becaus after older peopl retir thier job , they can enjoy the second life slowli . when they were work , they were so busi that they could not do what they want to . besid , they could not take mani vacat . they can do thing which they could not do when they were work becaus they have a lot of time . howev , young peopl do n't have a lot of time . they have to go to school or work . student have exam . they are recqir to studi harder and harder for exam . second , they have more money than young peopl . when they were work , they would save money for their futur . they can buy what they want , go where they want to and eat what they want to . final , of cours older peopl have experienc a lot of thing . they know what they should do when a problem happen . they also know how to avoid a problem . they would experi hard thing that as if it seem that they could not solv the problem , but young peopl have not experienc such a thing yet . even if young peopl have experienc such a thing , the number would much less than those of older peopl .
