i think that concept are cols to the idea of model and system . fact are close to the idea of oper . in thi way , i think for student is more import to learn how model and system work than to have a detail knowledg of the oper or fact . probabl we can use an exampl to better explain my opinion . for istanc a student could know everyth concern art hystori : the art movement , the life of the main artist , chronolog fact . thi knowleg is an import base to start a career as an artist but it is not suffici . i mean that to be a good artist the student should learn and understand the logic and the principl , import to produc creativ and art . if the student 's intent si to becom a painter , he need to understand the color system , the concept of composit , the rule how to evok emot and how to captur viewer 's attent . i think that we can also use anoth exampl to present thi point of view . schopenau , the philosoph , said that it is not import to read the newspap everyday in order to undesrtand the world , as well as it not imporatnt to read averi second on your watch to check the time . in my opinion thi is a brilliant exampl of the import of synthesi and learn . fact are import to shape the realiti , fact are also import as background for our learn . on the other hand , idea and concept are import to creat debat , new thought , new innov and creativ . even if inspir by classic rule , idea for exampl were at the base of the renessaic , a movemnet wich mean re-birth . so , fact are mainli importnat to help student in find the concept behind them . so fact are an iportnt sorc of inform and inspir but idea are the key ingredi abl to move the world and mankind ahe .
