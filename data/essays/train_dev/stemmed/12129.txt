i think success peopl tri new thing and take risk when do new thing is better than do what they alreadi know . i agre with the successful peopl , becaus if the peopl are success for wat they are then they can be abl to think for new thing . obvious while tri new thing risk may taken place , but if we are worri about the risk then no one can be success in their life . for exampl the scientist will produc new thing by take may risk if they are think that thi work is veri riski to do then now we ca n't get thi light , radio , tv and satellit and mani more which we are use in in our daili life . so for everi achiev there are mani risk taken for the thing to do . so success peopl onli can think of the futur , for everi achiv there are mani risk taken by mani person for those achiev . for exampl if we are not tri for better futur and be happi for what we have , then we will never succeed in our life . final my opinion is to agre with the hard work peopl i.e. , success peopl . becaus if the peopl are not success then they ca n't think for their further futur . so for everi success there are mani risk had been taken to achiev it . so final i agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk is better .
