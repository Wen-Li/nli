i have a veri close exampl in my famili that it is import to tri new thing and to take risk . in fact my father ha adopt thi rule , and he is a succcess man . but i think that you can tri great challeng when you are abl to manag all your skill , so to do well some thing is necessari to be success but not enough . moreov i think that to do new thing in everi situat in our life is an excit way of life . in fact thi approach allow to open the mind and to think with a wide vision . therefor travel a lot , meet new peopl and frequent chang the job is a way to improv oursev . in fact it is possibl to enhanc our skill and to solv better everi new problem . on the other hand take risk is an art and a person skill , but it is essenti to becom success . in fact do a challeng thing and be everey time under pressur probabl can extract our best and compet with greater forc . i thing that an intrest exampl of `` take risk '' is napoleon , who wa the greater gener of histori . he wa abl everi time to choic the win way , which wa a non convent strategi , which present mani risk but also the possibl to gain a great success . he wa also abl to commun thi approach to hi armi , so to transform the success of one man , to the success of an entir countri . in conclus i think that an aggress and competit approach is the best solut to tri to reach success , even if it is also necessari to have some luck . for these reason , hope to becom a success man , i 'll use thi set of suggest also on my normal life , both on work and dure social realtionship . in fact i like competit and take reason risk and i want to learn and do new thing everi moment .
