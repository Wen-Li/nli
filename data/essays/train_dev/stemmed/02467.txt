nowaday advertis have a big impact on our live . they can be veri infuenci on our decis and choic relat to the our shop . we can find them everywher , on televis while we are watch a movi or a show , on newspap , on internet and also on the street . sometim when we open our mail box we find a lot of advertis about for exampl restaur and shop . not alway what they tell describ the real qualiti of a product . in fact i think that often they make product seem much better then they are . sometim for exampl we buy a product becaus we have heard so much about it and it incred properti but latter when we use it we realiz that we have been stupid . in fact the product qualiti doe not corrispond with the descript in the spot and furthermor we have problabl spent more buy it instead of a similar product which wa not advertis . in particular i believ that these advertis are more power with children . in fact they usual ask their parent to buy a game or a pair of shoe becaus they have seen them on televis , they have been attract by the present of thi product and they realli believ that they can reproduc what is show on these advertis . in conclus i think that it is better to be a littl doubt when we see these spot . when we buy a product we have to be careful becaus sometim a common product which we have not ever see befor can show the same properti and qualiti of the one which is advertis . we will problabl save money .
