in gener i support the idea that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do thing they alreadi know . to support thi statement you first have to look at the reason whi peopl becom success in the first place . you also have to have a look at the word success and to evalu it definit . success peopl - usual we are think of peopl who are success in more than one aspect of life , e.g. work , famili , sport . .. we consid them to be abov averag . but what do you have to do to becom abov averag ? it requir you to go a step further when other peopl stop , or to use way and mean that nobodi ha use befor you . a success scientist , for exampl , ha to abandon worn out path and tri someth new , look in a direct that noon ha look befor or exploit a field that ha been consid as irrelev . by thi he move himself on a brink , becaus leav the standard rout alway impli the possibl of failur . a manag who ha the reput for be abl to fix unsuccess enterpris had to do the unusu to stand out of the row of manag befor him , who all but fail . howev , to reach true excel you have to take risk and do someth new - otherwis you will remain averag . addit , if you are alreadi successul you have the monetari or social background that you can risk someth without gambl with your bare exist . if you hardli have enough money to feed your famili you will be less like to do anyth that might harm you in a way that you wo n't be abl to support them anymor . on the other hand , if you have suffici resourc at hand you can afford adventur and failur , as they might onlyu set you back a bit but not depriv you of your way of live . have said thi , it is easi to infer whi success peopl tend to be riskier or otherwis exceptionnel : they had to have these strain in their charact to becom success at all and they have less consequ to fear . their abil to cope with failur and their exploratori sens make them more affect to be truli unusu .
