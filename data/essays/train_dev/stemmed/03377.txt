are young peopl not give enough time to help ing their commun ? and wa it other in former time ? to answer thi question you have to think about a few differ point of view . the first point is that they are a lot of young peopl , which have some kind of `` i do n't care '' opinon . they do not have target to life for or task to do . as i drive to berlin per train to do thi test a saw a few of them , alreadi beer drink in the more . furthermor , there are a lot of young peopl which do n't have thi kind of `` homefeel '' in their commun . they would take ani chang to leav their town . you should not forget that , perhap , they have to leav their commun to find a job or have a better futur . howev , on the other side there are young peopl everi age which spend a lot time by help their commun . they work in social organis like the `` red cross '' ( so , do i . ) or the `` kinderhilfswerk '' . althought , they spend a lot of time in social project like organis of a camp for kid without parent or collect money for a homeless shelter . the question also impli that it wa better in former time . thi is perhap true but i 'm to young to join thi expericen . i think as time chang aswel the situat al chang . all in all i disagre with `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . '' they are help young peopl , but you have to look for these .
