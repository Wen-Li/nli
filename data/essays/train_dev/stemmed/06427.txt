i believ that the most of the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , and thi can be infer from differ reason . the first of these is that we are live in a veri competit world and thi get the peopl to make bigger some detail more than what they are , to involv the client to buy the product . a tipic exampl can be found in a lot of good for children , where realli littl featur are present `` in scale '' , for exampl the abil for the toy to rise it size or the abil to make strang movement . anoth reason could be a legal process . the productor are cover himself by legitim someth of the good . in first thi could be a bed advertis , but could also explain the particular natur of the object , realli fragil , a qualiti that could be research from the client . there is also an `` intern '' reason if we want to say so . the manag want to present is creation to the stakehold and need to have their approv to start the product . in thi case the interest of the productor is direct to the owner of the compani , not to the client , but is import too , of cours . the last reason is similar to the first , in thi case we can find person who are present onli the posit point of the product without talk about the neg . the mission of thi manner is the same but here the peopl are n't creat anyth , they are omiss a part of the complet realiti , differ in the first case where the peopl could also present the neg point becaus there are a huge amount of posit point which cover them . a tipic exampl of thi manner can be found in the most of the new invent where it 's need a posit consider to be lunch , like the titan in which wa n't present the lack of ship to escap , look onli to the big fashion-styl of it .
