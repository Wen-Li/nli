current travel in a group led by a tour guid becom one of success busi over all the world . but is it realli best way to journey ? i do not agre thi point from my perspect . i think travel is veri person thing to process , such as plan and prepar . these part are also funni thing plu to `` real '' travel . you can not have your own flexit time plan after you joint in a gourp , and even it doe not need you to plan it . for instanc , if you would like to spend more day on the beach but the travel group you joint into ha alreadi plan to visit anoth town . how frustrat it is ! if you travel alon , you can alway chang your mind and plan about the journey . in addit to , from my experi in alon journey , i would have more opportun to meet local peopl and have convers with them . it is benefici to understand deeper and more abour the local cultur and local civil . unfortun , if you are in a travel group , you must spend most of your time convers with your group member and miss the chanc to commun even make friend with local resid . perhap someon would indic that travel with a group is conveni , but i would argu that travel alon is advantag by enjoy the featur of conveni . sinc you onli need to consid you suitat not all the peopl in the group . for exampl , i like to choos five start hotel to rest , becaus it will suppli good and conveni condit for my vacat . but if i am in a travel group , the tour guid must need listen to other peopl 's suggest . they may think it is so expens that they unwil to live in a five start hotel , or they more will to spend money on buy thing from local . that will wast time to decid where we live . but if i am alon , i do not need to consid so mani thing . it mean conveni for me . therefor , i would argu that advantag of the travel alon outweigh the travel in a group . sinc you will have your plan and prepar , chanc to meet local peopl and conveni in the travel .
