i fulli agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept rather than it is for them to learn fact . of cours , fact are import . it is essenti to know certain basic fact in almost all field of studi : for instanc , a literatur student must know about the main epoqu of literatur through the centuri , a scienc student must know certain formula by heart . yet a knowledg of fact that goe beyond these basic is not as import as have understood the underli idea and concept . fact may be chang . new style of literatur will develop , new engin techniqu will evolv . yet the main concept underli these new develop will not chang . they can still be appli , be it in an academ environ when write an essay or sit an exam or be it in the workplac when new method or product techniqu will have to be understood and assess . i am a lawyer and therefor know veri well that no scenario resembl the other . everi case differ from the other , at least in nuanc . therefor , in order to be abl to find a solut to a case , one must have understood the rational behind legal doctrin . onli then will one be abl to appli a doctrin to an unnknown set of fact . moreov , fact can be look up in book or are avail onlin . fact can also be digest fairli easili . they may be complex , but they are hardli ever incomprehens . on the contrari , concept can not easili be look up in a book . they are often hard to understand . they will often need explan and in-depth read . that is whi we actual studi them , often for year . thi is whi attend univers . understand concept and idea is the key to organis the myriad of fact there are . human knowledg ha multipli over the past decad . fact are readili avail over the internet . therefor i believ that it is even more import to understand idea and concept nowaday than it wa 50 year ago . otherwis we are run the risk of be inund with fact not know how to handl them . it is for these reason that i am convinc that understand idea and concept is much more import for student than to learn fact .
