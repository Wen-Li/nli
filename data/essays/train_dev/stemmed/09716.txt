it seem to me that specialis on one subject is much more import than know mani differ subject but not be special on ani of them for mani reason . it is clear that have the knowledg of so mani differ academ subject is realli import thing . by thi way , peopl may gain the special of look at a subject from differ point of view and express their opinion on mani differ area , howev expertis on an academ subject is much more import than know lost of thing without be specialis on ani of them . in the first place , sinc the peopl who have broad knowledg of mani academ subject will not be an expert for ani of the acadecimc issu that they know , alway there will be someon who are better than them and nobodi will requir their knowledg about that academ issu . in my opinion , knowledg is to be use and to make it be use , you should know it veri well . it is not possibl to gain benefit from that knowledg if you just have some broad knowledg about it both econom and person such as gain peopl 's appreci . in the second place , the main motiv behind learn an academ issu is improv the current level of societi . if someon do not have a deep knowledg on an academ issu , he can not put someth on account about that issu and can not be a use for hi societi . it seem to me that whatev someon do , he should do the best . in thi context , if someon is not veri good on a subject , peopl will not evalut them accord to the other subject that he know , both the societi and themselv will not get a much benefit of their knowledg without be special on it .
