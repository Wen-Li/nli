i complet agre with thi statement becaus idea can be adapt depend on the circumst and thi adapt can evolv into a success result that wa expect , so student can have the idea that if all circumst are optim , thi result will be given . moreov , concept are also import becaus they are not orient to specif detail of a situat , but to the gener situat , so student can have a good aproxim of the result depend on the interact of thi circumst . on the other hand , fact can be differ depend on the circumst . the result can vari and therefor it is difficulti to enclos a result . in addit , fact are disput becaus they usual occur in system in which the interact of differ subsystem in that particular time brought that result . but it is possibl that the same result can never be repeat again unless the same subsystem interact at the same time and in that precis moment . for exampl , wal-mart , one of the biggest retail in the world , sell idea and concept to it client . these idea have been chang throughout time . sam walton , onc a wharton student , state that idea and concept can vari through time , but fact depend on each circumst that can vari the result interact with each other . the demand chang constantli and the idea that onc work for thi busi are now useless . so student must learn the idea and concept that can vari through time and can produc differ result other than fact that depend of the interact of differ subsystem . student will then be capabl of direct those subsystem and manag them so as to get the desir result and be success .
