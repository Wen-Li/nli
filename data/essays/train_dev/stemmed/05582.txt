i agre with thi opinion . ofcous there is also chanc to enjoy older age howev it up to younger age which peopl had spend . so i wanna point out three pointsto explain whi young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . first of all , young peopl have power to gain what they want or to achiev some kind of goal . in the phisic , they are so young that they can work all of the day without sleep , sometim . besid it , they are not too tire after work . it is one of the import thing to achiev the goal . in the mental , they do n't feel respons for societi or famili so they can cahlleng someth import or need to hard work without think deepli . if peopl becom have famili or need to care their palent , there is some neg factor to challeng someth . second , there are opporturn to make them chang or studi or grow up . there are chanc to take educ and studi abroad or someth . older peopl , mostli it 's palent , give younger peopl to have time to concentr on themselv , in ohter word , to think about themseov . it is most import thihg to grow up and have identif on theirselv . thirdli , younger peopl can have time to have comun with mani peopl who have differ background . older peopl mostli have job and it is limit to opportun to comun with peopl in the offic and peopl . on the other hand , younger peopl have the cahnc to have convers and have time togeth with mani kind of peopl . they have time to go all around the world , a mntaliti , there is noth for them to lose . there is onli to gain . so
