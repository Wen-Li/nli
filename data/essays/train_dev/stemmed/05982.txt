i total disagre with the statement that say `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . i have alway like , sinc i wa a littl child , all the type of car and now i have a car all for myself i can unerstand the import to have it . in my life i have notic that the number of car in use alway increas year by year , and i believ thi trend will continu till the end of the world ( ! ) . in today-world a great import is given to the safeti of the enviro and , a lot of time , car are indic like the first reason for pollut . someon could think that the number of car will decreas due to thi fact but he doe not consid that there is a great develop in car that do not produc pollut . anoth reason is that , nowaday , the car symbol the statu symbol of hi or her owner . so all the peopl tri to purchas new model of car for feel better with themselv . in itali the busi relat to car-world is increas even if the whole econom situat is not good at all . in addit , peopl , obvious , like technolog and beauti stuff and i think that car can belong perfectli to thi kind . you have onli to see new model of car for understand that it is veri hard to tri to resist to the desir of buy a new car . it is also clear that peopl have to move for their date , for job and often the public sistem of transport , at least in itali , doe not make us feel sure to arriv in time or to arriv at all . for exampl today there is the strike of the tube and i have been oblig to take the car for be sure of attend toefl test .
