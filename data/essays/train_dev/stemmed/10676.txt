i am not agre with thi statement . i am not agre with thi statement becaus , from my point of view , it wo n't be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today . i my opinon it will be more car firstli becaus they will give a major util and we could do mani more thing with our car than we can do today . in twenti year time , car will have everyth includ and you will be abl to do whatev you want while you are drive . thi is one of the main reason that i use to argu that it wo n't be less car in the futur than nowaday . anoth reason is that from my point of view , the number of car will increas becaus they will be more sefeti and thi fact will aloud underag peopl to drive a car becaus they will have mani system to prevent the accid . sinc mani time , car have been the most safeti transport in the world , and i think thi is not go to chang , becaus car compani move a lot of money and they will do everyth to sell more car and make them more safeti and comfort . anoth fact that in my opinion will make the number of car increas in the futur is that the gover are spend a lot of money in the rebuilt of mani highway that will make the trevel by car more safeti , comfort a safer . to sum up , i would like to say that for me , car are a veri import part in our daili life and it will be an more import in twenti year than there are today .
