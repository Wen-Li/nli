old templ , beauti japanes tree , and tradit japanes snack and food . kyoto is one of my favorit place to travel . on the contrari , tokyo is where modern live of japanes peopl can be observ . high build , crowd street , and fetid smell of smog . but what if you do not know anyth about japan and would like to travel ? would you rather buy a tour packag led by a tour guid ? the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guid becaus of lack of person preparet , flexibl , and person experi . the first reason that a tour guid by a guid is not recommend is that peopl tend not to prepar by themselv . it is true that a guid know the place the tourist will go and prepar plan for them . howev , it is veri uninterest for tourist to go place without person prepar . for exampl , if you are interest in japanes histori and go to kyoto , it will be a great pleasur . rather than the guid tell you what happen in horyu-templ and whi kinkaku-templ wa construct , if you learn by yourself and are interest in , it will be more great excit to go there . in addit , lot of inform are easili avail onlin or in book , you do not have to get a tour guid to travel around . thu , you can prepar by yourselv to fit to your own interest and excit . the second drawback of a tour guid by a guid is lack of flexibl . the plan is so rigid that you do not have freedom to spend your time as much as you wish . the guid shout , `` get off the bu at 2:15 pm , and come back at 3:15 pm . be sharp ; otherwis , other peopl will be annoy . '' how doe it sound ? on the other hand , if you find a place is so bore and have to stay for three hour becaus of the schedul of the tour , how do you feel ? in addit , the plan of the tour doe n't necessarili reflect your interest . mostli , the plan by a guid is so gener that the place you will go are more like famou place . for exampl , i went to franc primarili to see the iron chuck which is the standard of measur becaus i am interest . is there ani tour like that ? lastli , the first and second disadvantag of a tour led by a guid strongli relat to lack of person experi . if you prepar by yourself and go to the place to learn someth more , the journey will be veri brilliant . if you have a travel desin by your own tast and favorit , the journey might be difficult but be uniqu . if you find the place uninterest and dull , you can chang your plan . if you find a better restauraunt to eat , you can just hop into the restaur . all these experi will be so preciou , person , and lumini . in conclus , the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guid due to lack of person prepar , flexibl , and person experi . ye , travel with a guid might be safer and knowledgbl , but get person and uniqu experi in travel is the most import .
