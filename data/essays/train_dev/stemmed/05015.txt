young peopl are energet and driven , so they have a respons to use their talent meaning . it is expect that they be enthusiast about give back to the commun that rais them . but what action constitut `` help '' our commun ? voluntari work at non-profit organ seem to be the easiest answer . small act of kind - like help a senior citizen cross the road - are often cite as way for young peopl to serv the commun . i believ that ani work - paid or unpaid - done for the right intent should count as help our commun . have said that , i think that the amount of time young peopl nowaday devot to their commun is regrett lack . i person know a few young peopl who have never done an hour of voluntari work in their live . not onli are they uninterest in the welfar of their fellow citizen , neither do they see ani point in serv their own famili member or friend . sinc they fail to see beyond themselv , there is no hope that they will give ani time to help the commun at larg . most educ young peopl have a vagu sens of respons involv their commun , but there are so mani distract that prevent them from devot time to it . peer pressur , new technolog , the mass media and pop cultur simpli teach them all to concentr on themselv and tri to live a happi , materialist life . it is a piti , sinc so mani young peopl are lead away from exercis their civic respons . no matter how much they are told by parent to help their commun , it is impract if there are so mani distract in their live . mani young peopl do a small part in help the commun by do commun servic . howev , perform is n't satisfactori either . even if they are do voluntari work for no monetari pay , mani young peopl are inevit wait for payment in some other form - point for an academ scheme , an impress mention in their resum , or an award for `` outstand servic '' . if they are intent on these superfici reward , what follow is that the extent of their help will not be proportion . moreov , what littl heart they have for servic will diminish quickli , and of cours thi is definit not `` enough '' . in some situat , it is certainli understand that young peopl choos other activ over servic . student should put their studi on high prioriti , and young peopl in gener seek excit and new experi , so they are entitl to some level of self-centered . in fact , pursu wild , creativ way of do thing will probabl be a help to commun , if these young peopl choos to lend their talent and innov accordingli . thi requir a much deeper understand than exist in the young peopl of today , but it also goe to show that the measur of contribut is hardli as simpl as time - it involv an awar and some heart in all of us .
