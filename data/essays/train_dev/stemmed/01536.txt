i do n't think youg peopl enjoy their life more than older one , although most of them think so . i like to give short exampl whi young peopl think in thi direct and than show it from the opposit side of the elder : most of the young peopl think they are enjoy their live more than older one becaus there are so mani new experi they are make when they are young , for exampl find a girlfriend . they are talk all the time about how happi they are . but after a while they search for a new girlfriend mayb becaus the `` old one '' wa n't exactli what they expect of the `` true love '' . older peopl instead of thi alreadi have the experi what they want or what they are search for in life , so , when they final find the right partner they stick togeth and stay togeth happier and longer then young peopl , becaus they know , that they wo n't have their whole life again to cherrish it with the person they love . and they do n't talk about how happi they are all the time , they just enjoy it more silent . secondli young peopl say , that they could n't imagin a life without a comput or the televis . for them , these thing make live more enjoy . they do n't understand how old person could be happi without use these thing . but older person grew up without know thing like that , so they never made the experi of tv or cumput . they had other thing to pass their freetim with . they play outsid or read a book . and becaus they did n't know these thing they were not unhappi by not have these thing . so , i think it is definetli not true that younger person have more fun in life or that they enjoy it more than older one . both of them enjoy their live but in differ way . but , i , for myself have got to say , that i definetli do n't want to live in anoth centuri or that i want to chang my age .
