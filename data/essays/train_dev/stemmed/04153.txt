thi is not complet true . inde , i think that the success is reachebl by the both way . some peopl build emperor do the same thing all life long , quit as a south-italian farmer emigr to canada after the world war ii . in itali he wa a well known mozzarella produc , and onc he estabilish himself in canada he began the same activ , with the same method , day after day , and now he is one of the most rich man of the countri , export hi famou mozzarella throughout north america . mayb nowaday in a such competit market thi kind of experi ha becom rare , becaus of the global involv all the 5 contin that caus the rise of new competitor everywher and becaus of the growth of the multin compani with uncount capit . what insetad is real , in thi statement ' is that in our own life , fossil ourselv is a practis to avoy . a new idea , a differ vision of life , market , and so on , can caus a sudden success into our work place , famili , group of friend or even into our school , and is import to elev ourselv from the regular level of peopl in order to hang a better posit into thi select societi where almost everyon ha the possibl to studi , to find a job , to be competit in a singl word . a clear exampl of thi situat is the advertis world . how can i convinc peopl to buy my product ? how can i make them understand that my product is better than other ? with ad obvious , but we are surround by ad ! in the street , on televis , on the radio , on newspap , on the web , dure sport event , everywher basic , and as a consequ of thi , peopl is no more pay attent to ad . so an advertis must find someth new , someth that attract the attent of the crowd , and so he ha to take risk , to innov hi approach . who stand on hi posit too long , will fail for sure . so in conclus i think that the sentenc of the topic fit most of the aspect of our societi , but is not to take as a law .
