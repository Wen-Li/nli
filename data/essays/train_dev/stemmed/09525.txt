as we all know , differ peopl hold differ view . whether one would choos mani academ subject or one specif subject to studi , each would have it advantag and disadvantag , it benefit and drawback . thu , a good argument could be made for either . as for me , howev , i definitli prefer to have broad knowledg , so i agre with the statement . grant , a number of peopl of peopl studi a special subject such as scientist who may dure their whole life , the reasion is they realli love the subject deep into heart . also , these peopl do a parament promot to our societi . on the other hand , howev , live in an ever-acceler societi , we , it seem , can never avoid be influenc by inform . we have to receiv thousand of news or handr of word everyday . it make me beliv that without a broad knowledg , we could not even commun with other , not mention to surviv . what is more , as the reason of the societi is so rapid pace , most of peopl may chang their work in the futur . thu have broad knowledg of manyacadem may adopt the new job in a short time becaus of they have know how to deal with the thing . for exampl , an increa number of peopl who chang their work more than onc a year . whi they get other job so easili ? in my opinion , they all have broad knowledg and strong abil . last but not least , student may have more motivit to studi more ragion of knowledg . in my point of view , most of student like the intigratit knowledg , may be two or three subject , sometim evenmor . that also can expand their horzion and get a world wide knowledg . in a word , in spite of the fact that there may a coupl of disadvantag of studi mani academ , i still feel that the advantag are more obvious . take into account of all these factor , we may reach the conclus that we should better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
