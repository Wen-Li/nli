i think that , in gener , we learn academ knowledg to get a good job in the futur , possibl the one we prefer . for thi reason i think it 's much more better to special in just one specif subject beacus in our modern life the medium knowledg is veri high and there is a lot of competit so i think that have a veri goog knowledg of a subject is the best way to get a good and satisf job . infact almost everi school system of everi countri is project to give the student a knowledg start from a basic and gener teach arriv to a high special ( like master ) . anyway sometim in our life it 's not bad to have a basic knowledg of mani academ subject like math and geographi , when we have to travel or shop for exampl . anoth thing that requir a broad knowledg it 's a phenomenon call job 's difersif , that 's whay veri often our job requir a well understand of mani differ subject . in the end i think it 's better to know veri well a subject but also to have a basic knowledg of other subject .
