young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun , i disagre with thi statement for the follow reason : everi age differ from the one befor it and everyon should know that everi age ha it own uniqu way in think , learn and solv problem so what we did and do to our communitiy now is differ than our older did to there at there age so they will think that we as a young peopl are give noth to our communitiy becaus it is differ than what they did when they were at our age . new technolog is spread all over the world in a super fast way that is help the commun to improv and to facilit life and with the help of young peopl these technolog will be spread and improv even faster with there new idea caus as usual new idea and revolout idea get creat from a young person , just like when an owner of an old factori refus to use the computr inventori system and stick to the old one that is mayb effict but not as effici as the new system is . no one can forget the great thing our older peopl did and achiv to make our life more easi . but younger peopl will help in their communitiy becaus it is a must and life will stop if they didnt , and as usual when young peolp grow up they will repeat the same statement that younger peopl are not help their commun becaus that the circl of life .
