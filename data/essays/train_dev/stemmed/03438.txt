if alway watch the tv , you must see mani differ kind of advertis . but most of them are not that true . i have heard someon said most advertis make the product seem much better than they realli are . in my opinion , i total agre thi statement , here is some exampl for me to support thi statement is correct . all produc must want consum choos their product while consum are compar the product toward other substitut . that is the main point whi advertis should make product seem much better than they are . in fact , their aim is to earn money . for exampl , substitut like fast food shop mcdonald and burger king , papa john and pizza hut and so on . even film or tv show , they still onli promot the best and the most excit part to audienc . inde , that is normal but thi is the main point that they did make the product seem much better . i had an experi about a film . watch the advertis about a horror film through tv , the film wa realli excit and the plot seem realli attract and scari , and so i paid and watch the film in a theatr . howev , that is an undoubtedlli bore movi i have seen . the most frighten and excit you could all know from the tv . the advertis realli make the product so nice . anoth bad experinc is i read a advertis through magazin which is about a hotel . the pictur insid were so grand and the food or room are nice . but , when i final arriv there , i found that the room were dirti and those food are awe . then i complain to the manag , but hi attitut wa bad and arrog . the result i had receiv which is far away form that advertis which shown in magazin . i wa extrem disappoint with that advertis which make their product seem better . in conclus , actual the advertis are not 100 percent true , we should pay attent when we decid to buy it or not , and do not just believ the advisetis . therefor , as i said i total agre with that statement which is total correct .
