i agre with thi statement . twenti year ago , when my father wa young hi famili had onli a small incom so he startet work in the age of 14 . so he had no time to help the communitiy . today , life is much easier for children and young adult . i am the best exampl - i am 22 year old and i onli work in the summer break . i am studi to get a better job and to earn more money than my father earn when he wa young . an other reason whi i wast a lot of time at univers is becaus i want to get a job that is not bad for my wealthi . that mean i have more time and i am not as tire as for exampl my father wa when he came home . but on the other hand today young peopl have a lot of hobbi . they like to go swim in the summer and they are happi if they can play in snow in winter . they can enjoy to be child . later they spend a lot of time in pub with their friend . they have also to go to school or univers and to learn for test . if i ask myself whi i do not give time to help my commun , i do not get a real reason . i think our gener is a bit selfish - everyon onli care about hi own problem and need . to increas thi situat it could be effect to talk about in school . teacher could find out the reason and they could tri to chang it togeth . i hope my children will give enough time to help their commun , becaus it is realli necessari for the commun .
