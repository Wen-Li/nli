in my point of view i complet disagre with the statement `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . in my countri , everyon enjoy life as much as possibl and for them they do not care about their age . for them age is just a number ; they think that the spirit that is within themselv is what matter . so they enjoy their live to it maximum in ani period of time . and so , do i . besid , everyon ha mani goal , and one of them is to enjoy life . so no matter what age you are you can enjoy life . for instanc a child could be think that he is enjoy life when he/sh is play with his/her friend , now let 's see a old person have a vacat on the bahama spend his/her time with the person that he/sh love . in my point of view , both peopl , the child and the old person are enjoy life , and i do not see whi would one of them enjoy life more than the other . as i said befor everyon ha a spirit and i person do not think that the spirit get older as the day pass by . within one 's spirit there is energi . energi is what take us from one place to anoth ; to eat or not to eat ; to do thing or not to thing ; to enjoy life or not to enjoy life . so then , if everyon ha a spirit that mean that they also have energi , therefor everyon ha an equal amount of energi to enjoy life at ani period of time . to put in other word , age doe not matter for someon to enjoy life . in conclus , young peopl do not enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus we are all the same . it is true that when you get older the muscl start to be more flexibl and solf and tend to break more easili than if you were young . but muscl do not have anyth to do with enjoy life . it is also true that as you get older , your brain develop in differ step and so you can think more deepli about thing that interest or bother you . but doe that affect whether you enjoy life more than other ? . well , in my opinion my answer would be no .
