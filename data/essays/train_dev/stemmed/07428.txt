in my opinion in twenti year there won ' t be fewer car in use than there are today . in such a short period of time noth so import like use car will be chang after all . mani peopl think that in twenti year everyth will be chang and we will have robot do our work . on the one hand it will be possibl that we will use more technic for mani daili problem and there will be more technic discoveri . but what can make our life more flexibl and comfort than car ? how should we transport or export our product in other countri or how do we get our post or go for holiday ? you ca n't reach ani region of the countri by bike or by plane is n't it ? and when we drive car we are faster in everi situat of life . but on the other hand we hope that the use of car will be fewer in a coupl of year becaus they caus so much pollut and by time destroy our environ . everybodi should use it car onli in situat which are essenti not to drive to the neighbour e.g. but in my opinion it is n't imposs to realiz all over the world . in addit what will be the caus of a fewer use in a few year ? that everybodi ha got a relationship to a partner in offic so that they can drive togeth or do their weekli shop tour togeth ? i do n't think so . for mani peopl a car ha a statu of comfort and will help them in daili situat like bring their children to school when they live far away from there . from my point of view the use of car will rise more in twenti year than everybodi expect and not will be in a fewer use .
