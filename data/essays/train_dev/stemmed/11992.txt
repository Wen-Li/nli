i disagre with the statement becaus i think that the old peopl can also enjoy their life by do what they want . it is true that there will a fewer chois to do than the youger peopl , but they can still enjoy it in other way . for exampl , let 's say that there is a old man who love to do basket ball game when he wa young . he might not abl to play it anymor , becaus he doe not have enough strength . but he can rather watch the game which hi grand son play with hi friend . also , it might be a good time to do what they want to do , but not abl to do , in their young age . some peopl still doe work even they get old , but usual they retir the work and have entir day that can spend freeli . i think most of peopl have some hobbi or favorit thing to do , and thi is the perfect time to spend all the time , just for do what the one 's realli want to do . for exampl , there might be a old coupl that realli love to travel to other countri . they woulnd not abl to get time so often to do so , when they are l young . but they can get a lot of time do it if they got old . they might even abl to travel aroud the world i they wish to . so , by 2 reason , i disagre with the statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more thatn older peopl do .
