in today 's world , it is highli advantag to know a wide spectrum of knowledg . sinc the chanc that you may switch into anoth field increas day by day . what 's more , a mr know-al seem to be welcom everywher . in my eye , howev , it is better to special in one specif subject rather than to splurg too much effort on unrel subject that may have noth to do with your futur life . firstli , everi human be 's energi is limit . believ it or not , even a geniu like einstein could onli dabbl in other field than physic , how can an ordinari do too much in a short lifetim ? focus effort do not pay off for everyon , not to mention scatter time and energi . secondli , to surviv in thi fullli competit societi and earn your bread in the rat race , you 'd better have your strenth . special on one specif subject can make you an expert , broad knowledg of mani academ subject may not most the time . thirdli , brought up by our countri , we are all eager to do someth for her in the futur . but without a deep knowledg in one specif area , how can we contribut larg to her ? take my major , ocean-engin as an exampl , without special devot in the style and design of ocean-structur , we ca n't go ani further in our futur . what 's more , there are too mani thing worth ponder over , if you are given the chanc to pick some from an ocean of academ subject , which one are you go to selct ? you may probabl get lost in the immens subject , or achiev noth wander among these subject . what i have argu abov is base on my own experi , but we can neither go far when be tightli enclos to a singl subject . it is better to have some know-how about your relat subject , but our major time and energi should go to one specif area . `` roman wa not build in a day '' , so wa the knowledg . dedic more to your target , and you can achiev more .
