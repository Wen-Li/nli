a world with fewer car ! sound preposter now . but i think thi is go to be a realiti in twenti year from today . there are variou reason whi i hold thi opinion . these includ popul growth , fuel crisi , and popular consciou about environ . the popul of the world is onli grow by the day . natur , we would expect more car to roll on the road . but , we do not realis that land is not grow in proport to peopl . with limit land , there will come a time when we will not be abl to find more space for our car . then the recours is mass rapid transport system , which discourag car-us . thi ha alreadi been seen in delhi , india 's capit citi where delhi metro rail system ha been creat to deal with the stress that increas vehicular popul wa creat . now , we see that the number of car have inde come down on the road becaus peopl find it more conveni to take a train to offic , at a negligibel price , rather than maintain an own car . anoth reason whi the number of car might go down is the shortag of fuel . oil crisi is here for real . it is becom increasingli difficult to satisfi the energi need of the world . veri soon , the price of oil are go to increas veri highli . earli sign can alreadi be seen . in such a case , run a car can be veri expens . research on altern fuel , like biofuel or solar power , is still in nascent stage . thu , it will be veri difficult for the common man buy fuel for hi car . in india , the price of petrol ha been increas steadili and my famili now goe out in car , onli when it is realli necessari or when all the four of us have to go out togeth . otherwis , we use bike or , simpli , the public transport system . the last reason whi i think that car are go to be fewer is popular sentiment against environment pollut . car use fuel which increas environment pollut . therefor , some countri , like those in the nordic region , encourag their citizen to use bicycl which are more eco-friendli . they are also a healthier option in comparison to car as they keep the rider fit . thu , conciou citizen support such idea . thi trend seem to be catch up , which make me believ that it will in futur becom veri popular . in that case , the prospect for car look bleak . to conclud , i believ that car are go to becom rarer in the year to come becaus of a varieti of factor . these includ shortag of two resourc : land and oil . these are go to be scarc becaus of grow popul , in which case car will not be viabl . final , when peopl becom more eco-friendli , they would look for option other than car , which will affect the prospect of these automobil .
