i definit do agre with the statement becaus of sever reason . firstli and most import , i suppos that learn just fact without understand the idea or the concept behind , you do not have the context and the basi to keep singl fact in mind for a long time . in addit , know the idea and concept alway enabl you to learn the fact later , for exampl when you need them . in generel , peopl do rememb what they onc unterstood but do forget what they just learn without understand it . on the other hand , it is sometim easier for student to learn the fact , becaus they get easier and faster access to read materi and book than to lectur and learn event which might better explain the idea and concept . in the short term , it might also appear more effect to learn just the fact in order to get a proper prepar for test , becaus it is often more effici when test just ask for the fact . but in the long term , as i alreadi said , it is much more effectiv to understand the concept which serv you as a valuabl basi to put relat knowlegd on . therefor , proffessor , ought to attract student to attend the learnig event in order to get an overwiev of the topic and understand the concept and backround . from my own experi i know that i do not rememb ani fact of subjet , of which i did not understand the concept . but in case i understood the idea and the context , i know where my note are to get the demand fact quickli . overal it becom veri clear that in the middl - and lorg term , understand the concept and idea of a subject in order to learn effect and keep thing in mind , is much more effect than just learn the fact .
