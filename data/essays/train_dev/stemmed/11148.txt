in my opinnion , successful peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i regard thi statement as true becaus i have a quit differ definit of success . if somebodi is realli success , he/sh should not onli manag someth that he/sh is suppos to do but she should alway improv his/herself and have an aim to make innov by the mean of self-optimis . thi ha a vital role on someon 's career becaus it would help the person to be realis by other other and promot . on the other hand i do n't state that should alway take risk and alter the way he/sh know . the time and the place that a person would tri new thing and take some risk is also veri import . if it is a wrong time or place the thing can get wors and wors . for exampl if your boss give you an import project that should be prepar soon you should n't take a risk at thi situat and you also do n't have the right to do that becaus you can harm the prestig of the compani which you 're work in . to conclud , i think that one should tri new thing and take risk after gain some experi and feel readi about chang which would make a person sucessful and admir .
