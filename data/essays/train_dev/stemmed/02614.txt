i disagree with the idea that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . ther main reason i support the idea are time and money . first of all , we the youg have to do thing to do even though we do not want to do . for exampl , high school student have to go to the school everyday , or do homework of their dislik subject . on the other hand , the elderli can spend their time on way their own . nobodi blame their way of use their spare time . secondli , older peopl have money that thay have earn for a long time . they can travel with their close friend or neighbor , or start the second busi spend those money . howev , youg peopl ha limit of their money , becaus most of their money come from their parent . it make them think about on what they they should spend money , in short , thay can not afford to travel abroad . anoth reason is satisfact and comfortabl . elderli peopl who had finish the role as a worker are confid to their skill that ha support thair countri 's industri . at the same time , they might feel camfort with the dedic . these feel make them happi , so they can enjoy the rest of their live . in contrast , the young alway feel uncomsort , and are under the pressur from their parent or teacher . they they think thay have to do manyth to their countri or famili . it caus mental problem . for those reason , i think older peopl enjoy life than young peopl .
