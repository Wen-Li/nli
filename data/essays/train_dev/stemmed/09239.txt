i do strongli agre with follo statment , i think it is veri import for the student to fulli understand the idea and the concept of the subject or the topic befor learn the fact . i beliv thi way for sever reson , first of all , learn the the concept of ani topic will allow the student to learn the fact of thi matter in mani differ way and memor them in better way , for exampl in a mathmet class , if the teacher start give the student a formula to solv some problem without explan to them how we got the formula with approv , it would be veri had for the student to learn the best way of solv problem , eventhough somtim student can get the answer right , but give a fact without the maim concept will not add to the student inform . anoth exampl whi i think is good to know some of the concept about the topic befoer learnig the fact , it is more enjoy to know the whole stori 's concept befor you get to the end of it , for instanc in you are take a histori class , it is more fun to go hear about mani stori befor you get to some fact happen in the past histori . learn the idea and the concept of ani subject will also improv ani student way of think , it will devolop a wider imagen and skill of think which help them in their real life . in conclus , student will enjoy , memor , devolop the skillesof thier think and learn the materi much more better by go through some of the idea and the concept befor learn the fact .
