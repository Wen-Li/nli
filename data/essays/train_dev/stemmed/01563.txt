car are one of the most use and import invent . there are million and million of car in each countri nowaday , but for the continu incres in the number of peopl live on earth and technolog reason i think that there will be less car to use in the world in twenti year . the first reason is that the number of peopl live in the plant is increas everi day . i read an articl onc that said that over 100000 babi are born each day , but onli less than half of that number of peopl die each day . it will sure be veri cowd by 2026 and much more peopl will be live on earth than now . hous will be built and more build will exist . park lot will alway be full and there will never be enough space to drive a car on the street . the second reason is that in twenti year car may not be as use as they are now . littl , cheap airplan might be invent and on the roof of each hous there might be space to park it . on top of each buid there might be a park lot on the roof for plane to land . citi might all be connect with underground train and no car would be need . it is amaz how everyth is chang in a short time . 100 year ago there were no car at all and we can not imagin how peolp use to live , and in a short term of time there might be a new invent and peopl would imagin how `` we '' use to live !
