i agre that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . i say thi becaus of the follow reason . 1. young one will be have a lot of time to have fun when compar to the older one . the older peopl will be busi in work and they will not be have that much free time which the young one get . even though it sound rude it is a fact . 2. the young one obvious will have less respons and work to do . but the older one will be have more respons and work to do . they have to maintain their hous . do their work without rest inord to surviv with the famili . here the young one dont feel thi respons . they are free they can enjoy in their own way . it is obviou that as age increas respons increas and also the burden of work . 3. statist say that young one are veri energet and enthusiast and it obviou that there is adrenalin rush more when compar to the older one . but the older one are not that energet and not that enthusiast just to mention not in all case . there are also healthier old one who are enthuisiastiv and energet but i mention on an averag basi . 4. a older guy will be restrict mostli to offic door , research lab , industri and other organis 's . they spend a lot of time over there . but come to the young one they enjoy lean in school becaus the educ is combin to entertain to make edutain . in colleg also the learn would be interest make the student to say `` wow '' where as the older one say `` oh no '' with the burden of work . again i mention mani of the old one enjoy their job and work they get involv . 5. kid enjoy their time in school they play , learn with noth to feel respons and they are the free bird they can do what they wish in proper sens . teen enjoy their time in colleg by learn , play sport , have chat with friend , they make love with peopl around them . they have parti , club activ and mani more to enjoy . they have a lot of free time to develop their skill , involv in their subject of interest . they are free bird . in the case of older guy they can do thi onli on one condit `` if there is time '' . conclus : ************** i do believ that anyon can enjoy their life at ani age if and onli if they have the heart to do so . i have written in favor of young one becaus i felt that it is happen most in my societi . one should have the heart to enjoy everi moment . one should feel that life is beauti . everi moment is preciou . life is preciou gift .
