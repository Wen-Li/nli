these day , there are lot of exsitd place around here and there for young peopl such as ammusu park or play some sport . but at the same time , there are lot of amaz place for older peopl . therefor i do not agre thi statment . i have two reason for it . first , i think it is much differ that the point which young peopl like and the point which older like . for exampl , for young peopl , they realli like to go ski , but for older peopl it doe not matter . it mean , they do not feel attract about that . on the other hand , for older peopl like to go to the place there are hotspr . but for young peopl , there is no valu to go there . in my opinion , now they are equal . second , it is natur that older peopl ha more money than young peolp doe . therefor older peopl can spend mucc money for their fun even if they can not have enough time to go somewher becaus of their children . they can buy their favorit dvd , and enjoy by watch them at home . lastli , even though they can not go outsid whenev they want to go becaus they are mother at hous , they have more time to do their favorit thing rather than young peopl who ha to go to school everyday . therefor i think older peopl can enjoy their life more freeli than young peopl do .
