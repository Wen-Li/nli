i total disagre the follow statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i disagre thi becaus i am a young peopl who pay enough time to help my communti . whi am i so sure that young peopl give enough time to help their communit ? first , i would like to say that in my univers , there are numer club of devot . i am the one of these club member . we go to some retir associ to chat with old peopl . some of them have children , but their children are too busi to go to meet them . so we go there to acompani with them and to clean the enviro . sometim we go to meet childern who lost their parent . most of them are still veri young , but do have enough love from famili . so we becom their brother or sister . we go there for teach and give them love . moreov , everi student in my univers must help for the commun . thi is the cours we must take , if we do not serv , we will not graduat . although some student are relunct to do thi , but after they help the commun , all of them are happi and will to do the servic by volunt . final , i do not disagre that some peopl say we do not give enough time to help . becaus all of the member in my club like to do thi servic . actual , we do not think that we are help peopl , we think that we learn a lot from them . all of my friend like to do thi , and we think we are not give . in fact , they are realli give us a lot when we help .
