i can see a lot of advertis when i walk on the road or drive the road . also , i can see advertis in tv comerc . i agre with most adbertisemebt make product seem much better than they realli are . there are a lot of reason that i think . first , when i wa in japan , i went to shop with my friend . we were veri hungri at that time , so we went to have lunch then we saw a lot of advertis of food such as sweet , humbergar , spaggeti , and japanes food . afterward , we decid to have lunch in one restour , but when we order lunch , it didi n't seem it that we saw advertis in front of the shop . we were veri dissapoint that thi is veri diffrent between advertis and real one . second , neari 2 year ago , i got in america to studi my major . i am an intern student from japan in the unit state . i see a lot of advertis on tv hambergar in particular . now i cook japanes food by myself becaus when i saw one of the hamburg shop comersh , it look realli delici , so i and my friend went there to eat ; howev , it wa jut too big , and tast wa not good . as a result , i do n't believ the kind of advertis . advertis in the unit state is more aw than japanes advertis . they make food delici or beauti , but it tast horrobl . on the other hand , in japan they also make food delici , but it is veri delici actual , so compani in america should improv thi kind of thing . thrid , the compani should tell realli thing to custom becaus that kind of happn occur everyday , almost all of custom might not believ compani . there are onli 2 exampl , but i have gotten more problem about these thing . i agre with most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are becaus i have gotten kind of problem , so i do n't realli believ in advertis especi food . compani should make good advertis then show custmer . if they do n't do it from thi time , almost all of custom might not believ it anymor .
