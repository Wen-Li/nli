although it is hard to admit , i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i support it becaus even though i have mani friend , i know nobodi who is or ha been involv in activ in their commun . there are , in my opinion , two main reason for thi . one of the reason is becaus young peopl , especi student , are busi with their school work or afterschool activ . when i wa in highschool , i got up at 7am , studi until 3pm , then practic tenni ( becaus i wa in tenni team ) until 6pm and got home at 7pm . thi i did for 6 day per week , and had onli sunday to rest . all i want to do that day wa stay home and relax , not be involv in activ for the commun . the same can also be said about univers student , most of whom studi , be involv in activ , and work at the same time . there is , i think , just not enough time for young peopl to cast their attent to their commun . that is one of the reason for their not help their commun . the other reason is becaus young peopl are just not interest in their commun . their interest is in their friend , game , parti , hobbi : in other word , themselv . they lack the voluntari spirit or the will to cooper and help the region they live in . when i wa in univers , i had a lot of friend . they had high goal for their futur , and studi a lot ; be seriou , they were interest in econom and polit , read lot of book too . but even they were not involv in ani activ for help their commun . young peopl , be much more energet and activ than elder , should be particip in help their commun . but for the reason state abov , they are not . therefor , i support the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun .
