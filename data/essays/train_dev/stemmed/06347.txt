studi , idea , concept and fact are veri differ way of teach . accord to my experi , studi in idea and concept is more effect . idea and concept are , opinion , they are not object , they reflect the thought of a person or someon , if we studi them we will get to know sever point of view . for exampl , sudi idea , in histori is import , we can defferenti the point of view , and tri to explain what a certain politician want , or believ , that will open a big , door , for convers , and dialogu , and comprehens . or even in philosophi , tri to interpret plato , or socrat , in a logic way , is better to understand whi do they mean what they said ? learn idea and concept , give a better chanc to the student to undersand , and think , for exampl ; in a biolog class , studi an expriment , and give the result , these are idea , if the student can manipul these result in a certain way , first it will give him a chanc of think , and when he will get the point , or interpret the result in the right way he will be abl , to bring the fact behind the experi , himself . but on anoth hand , studi fact , give you less oppurtun to think and tri to develop , a certain intellig way , to understand think , and thought , of other peopl . therefor the class will not be fun , it will allway be straight to the point , the teacher , will be here in front of the student and they will just be , tell them what haoppen , whitout give them a chanc to brows there mermori and brainstorm . in conclus it is import , to give the student , a chanc to think , and give hi opinion over someth . but the teacher mu n't let the student mislead himself , they must allway leav him on the right track , even if it need , to correct him , it will still be better than learn wrong stuff .
