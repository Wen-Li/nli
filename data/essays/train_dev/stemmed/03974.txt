i disagre with the statement that student to understand fact rather than idea and concept tthere are two reason for thi statement : time and knowridg . the first reason whi it is more import to student to learn fact lather than idea and concept is that they can learn wide varieti of knowridg . thi way student get more knowridg . the second reason whi it is more venefici to student to learn fact lather than idea and statement is time . student can use the time more useful . if student understand idea and concept for each fact , they have to spend so much time and energi . for instanc , when i wa elementari school , i learn mathmat formura without concept . in order to rememb all the formura , the teacher gave us a song for the formura . thu , we can easili rememb thi formura without spent exstra enersi and time. , and it is still useful to me . i disagre with the statement that student to understand idea and concept than fact , becaus student to can use time useful and get more knowridg .
