i agre with the statement given . there will be decreas in the number of car in use over the next twenti year . thi is becaus of sever contribut reason which includ grow traffic problem , deplet petroleum resourc , invent of newer mode of transport , and sever other reason . firstli , the traffic problem in today 's roadway is a major contribut factor . the remedi for such problem would prove more costli than invent a new transport method or develop an altern transport method . the possibl cure for today 's traffic hazard and traffic jam could be build more overhead bridg . the build of bridg in exist citi premis need a lot of fund and plan . on the other hand if these effort were made in the direct of improv railway commut facil or metro train facil , it would be more fruit . the invent newer mode of transport like small rang air vehicl or helicopt for transport in the citi would facilit easi as well as faster solut to such traffic problem . deplet of petroleum resourc also ha a major role to play in retard the manufactur of car at thi rate . petroleum good are use for variou other purpos like industri usag and cook etc . but today most of the petroleum resourc are use up in automobil industri . to chang thi scenario , the number of car would have to be drastic reduc . altern energi sourc like hydrogen fuel cell car , electr batteri car have not been veri success . therefor the number of car after twenti year would certainli be a small fraction of the present number . the technolog and develop which enhanc the effici of car ha almost come to a point of satur . car now are bought more becaus of their beauti in design or brand of the maker , rather than becaus of their effici . even thi support that if there are newer and more fashion mode of public transport , more and more peopl will want to commut by those vehicl . therefor by look at the present trend of car design and keep in mind the deplet resourc , i strongli feel that the number of car in use after twenti year from now would be veri few . new invent could easili substitut the automobil in the near futur .
