it would be logic to think that as popul increas , the number of vehicl on the road would also increas as there exist a correl between the two of these variabl . for exampl , the number of car on the road ha definit increas sinc the last twenti year . whi ha thi been ? firstli , it becaus the number of peopl who can use the car ha increas . secondli , the technolog advanc have brought about a reduct in price of the averag car as such . so , if we go by the abov reason , it should also hold good if we assum that a similar trend will be observ in the come twenti year . howev , a question to evalu the abov assumpt would be : is thi growth scalabl and sustain ? it is a known fact that pollut level in the atmospher are increas and a major compon of the pollut come from the car ' exhaust pipe . there ha to be an obviou drive to cut down on pollut and one way that could be adopt in the futur will be to reduc the number of car on the road . the second obstacl to increas the number of car in the futur will be the space crunch . if the number of car on road keep increas at the rate which it is now , the road and the park lot would not be suffici to accommod the car . in fact , an occur in japan is a testament to the abov statement . there are zone in tokyo , the capit of japan , where privat own vehicl are not allow to pli becaus of the space crunch and onli vehicl like buse , or car pool which can accommod mani peopl at onc are permit on road . in thi case , the number of vehicl on the road ha in fact reduc in tokyo . henc , i would say that the number of car on the road will increas in the next few ( 5-10 ) year , with all the advanc in technolog and the incraes purchas power of the consum . howev , i also believ that becaus we are bound to hit the ceil with respect to space avil for the car and the pollut caus , i do not think that the increment in the number of car can be sustain over a two-decad period . to conclud , i agre with the statement that in twenti year , the number of car in use will be fewer than there are today .
