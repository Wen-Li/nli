in my opinion , i agre that travel with a group of peopl led by a tour guid is the best way to travel . there are sever good reason whi i agre with have a tour guid dure the travel . first of all , when you will decid to go to a foreign countri that you have not ever visit it , you will face some difficulti and a littl bit of fear . all of these troubl that you will be face becaus of the worry and anxieti for thi trip . also , may be becaus you do n't have enough requir inform about that countri . so you need some one to help you about the place , shop mall , good restuar , lacat of some hotel and so on . accord to these challeng , the bast way to keep away these troubl is to travel in a group led by a tour guid who have enough inform about the counri more than what you have . second reason whi i personali prefer that becaus i think it is safer for you and your famili . i rememberd when i and my famili travel to itali , we encount some crimin and drug peopl who we do n't know how to deal with them . howev , although my father had solv thi problem , i think if we had a guid with us that will be more easi for us . the third and last reason is we choos to travel to have some relax and have a rest away our work , duti and respons . actual , if you want to do that you should be away from all these troubl that , of cours , you will be face it such as ask some citizen peopl to have some inform about as i said in the begin `` where can i find thi hotel ? '' , `` where are the recreat center ? '' , `` what is the best restuar do you have here ? '' and lot of these dum question . you may also do not know how to speak their languag sinc you are not a nativ speaker . in short , person i prefer to travel with a tour guid to keep away all of these headach .
