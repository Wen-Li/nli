whether it 's better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject , it 's a complic issu . therefor , i 'm go to explor reason that support each kind of knowledg . on a hand , i think that have a broad knowledg is veri import today , becaus the job is veri flexibl . one day you work in a field , and the day after you work in anoth one . for exampl , thi happen to my father . he studi electr engin at colleg , and after the graduat he start work for ibm . it wa quit predict . but after a small period he accept an offer from an alimentari compani , and he becam they intern market director . i agre that it could sound strang , but it realli happen . fortunatli my father had a basic knowledg of market , otherwis he would have miss thi opportun . on the other hand , i must agre that if you want to work in some compani , as , for exampl , gener electr , or microsoft , or again ibm , you need a specif prepar . otherwis , they wo n't choos you between all the other peopl . moreov , you have also to be the best in do your job , if you want to be sure to find a good one . for exampl , one friend of mine ha graduat in biolog , and he won a lot fo award for hi experi . obvious , he found a good job immediatli , while mani of hi schoolmat are still look for one . after show the advantag of each choic , my opinion is that even if you have to be special in one specif subject , is also import not to be focus onli on it , but you must have a wide mind , becuas you ca n't even know what will happen to you in the futur . therefor , you need to be prepar to everyth .
