i agre with thi follow statment becaus it is clear that there is not much young peopl help thier communti , they rather go out and do thing that they prefer or enjoy more which is kind of fullish becaus in the end we will all be a part of thi commun . in the other hand some young peopl might some time want to help the the commun but dont now how ? there isnt ani place or leaftlet that tell them how . there ha to be someth done to show or make a propaganda so that more young peopl are awar of it and can do someth about . with that and the right guidenc i believ mani young peopl would be delight to help the commun . i suggest that young peopl should spend more time help there commun in thing that will also benefit them for exmapl help clean beach or help do work that in the end is good for them and in return they be pleas there selv and thier commun by show and contribut to it . i think i a youth center should be establish to help young peopl learn and lead them to help their communt in vari way depend on thing need . for exampl they can have a garag sale to make some money and use the money for chariti thi way they give the commuinti alot and in the same time they them selv benift . in the end i would like to say that it not the young peopl problem completli becaus no one direct them in the right way and so thi lead to the do what they see is best and as young peopl some see that what the enjoy is what the want to spend there time do while with the right direct im sure there will be mani peopl who gladley want to help the commun and so i agre to some degre with that statment .
