i actual think that it is true : a product look usual better in the advertis than in real . but i also think that it is normal and i 'm go to explain whi . first , advertis exist for two reason : it inform you of everi new product that come out on the market and it encourag peopl to buy it . when you look at an advertis in the street or on tv , the advertis want you to need thi object and to think about buy it , to desir it . obvious , you will see the product ( materiel or not ) in it best aspect , sometim present with other product that improv the imag of the product . that is the case for all the food product : for exampl , meat will often be present with some beautiful veget or a charm sauc . and you will never see a parfum present by a normal man or woman but by one or sever top model . in thi situat , it is not the product itself that is more beautiful but the context and you have the impress that the product is better than in your hand . besid , advertis is a kind of art , and sometim help research for the cinema . you can test new techniqu , tri to film some place ( the film `` the lord of the ring '' wa film in new zealand after the landscap wa test or remark in an advertis ) . that explain also whi such money is put in advertis and whi they are often so develop and beautiful . but the product seem better to a certain extent and they can not be physic differ between the product on tv and in the supermarket : the consum is protect by a law that forbid to make fals advertis . so i will conclud say that advertis enhanc the imag of the product and it is better like that . it onli concern us to be awar of that and not to be foul .
