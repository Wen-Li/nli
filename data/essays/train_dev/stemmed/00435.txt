success sleep in realiti peopl who are in the search of new thing and like to take risk rather than do in well-known form may be consid success when it is heard . howev , i total disagre with thi idea of desir toward new thing and risk for sever reason . the first reason that support my idea is that time is the most valuabl concept in human life , and it should n't be wast . it mean that someon should run after empti dream or the idea that increas the slope of life , for human life is short . for exampl , when the histori is examin , one can easli see that there were lot of mad scientist who dream lot of mad thing includ `` navig in time '' , but if one look at the result , there is noth to applaud . descart , mathemetician and philosoph , can be consid a nice exampl for life , for the he wa so success although he did n't dream or take risk . the second reason , that one should n't tri new thing and take risk , is the comprehens of the primit knowledg ; that is to say , peopl may tri to learn the theori or method that have been alreadi accept by the author . befor creat or comment , the knowledg should be enlarg as much as possibl . by the way , instead of tri new thing or take risk , one can profit from it own knowledg or tri to be satisfi in hi border . for exampl , if an engin learn the current progress in hi major and improv himself , he doe n't need to tri new thing or take risk to be succes , becaus he is aldreadi succes . all in all , as the reason are shown , i think that the idea of rest in peac of it border , and follow my life as it flow is better idea
