life is a rollercoast ride experi , which ha it up and down , it high peak and slow curv or fall , which mean that each stage of thi ride carri with it valuabl experi , each which we have to live at a specif time and period . i believ both young and older peopl enjoy life equal the same , the onli thing differ is that they find themselv in differ stage of their ride . one in which there are franctic curv twist and turn , and the other in the calm and sooth final stage of their ride . older peopl have alreadi experi what wa like to be young and wild , to have fallen in love or have their heart 's been broken , while the young are those will learner want to experi life at it fullest , simpli becaus it is their time to wild , be allow by their young bodi to do so . meanwhil older peopl have alreadi experienc everyth they could in their younger year for which they now have a time to reflect and realiz that there is no hurri in life , that one as a youngster wish for everyth to happen fast . which is whi natur is wise in give us that stage in life where we are abl to reflect on our past mistak and give us a final opportun to mend them . therefor get old is a way of say that we have to matur , which wise enough come hand in hand with our physic trait . both of these stage in life offer thing which the other doe n't , one wisdom which a life experi ha taught you , and the other the inmens curios and uncertainti . therefor both of thi stage in life have it charm , which appeal differ when be in a certain age . therefor while older peopl rejoic in the comfort feel of have accomplish their goal , the young search for their own . howev the mere fact of beign old or young doe not mean one can can or can not have an activ and wild spirit , be that some young peopl have what is popularli known as an old soul , be thi a way to describ their matur attitut toward the world , wherea older peopl may still have thi child like spirit . a perfect exampl of thi is my grandfath , who despit the fact of be 76 year old is a veri activ man , who still love to play with hi grandchildren and will continu to . in conclsuion i do not beliv that younger peopl enjoy life better than older peopl , it is simpli that they are in two differ stage in their life , which therefor mean that they both have a differ way of appreci and embrac each and everi life 's experi as it present itself .
