although it is import to gain knowledg of mani basic fact , i think that it is realli better to acquir understand of concept and idea which are given in lectur and class . there are three reason whi i agre with thi statement . the first point i have to mention is that you can look up everi fact which you want to know about in book or the internet . in addit , thi process doe not take a lot of time . for exampl , when you are ask about a special date , you can use a histori book or an internet site which deal with histor date . second , it is veri help for your futur profess when you have understand the concept and idea which are often use in the profession life . when a special problem occur you have to solv it use your abilitit you have learn dure your studi time . think of an instanc in mathemat . when you tri to solv an equat to finish the calcul which are veri import for your compani it is absolut necessari that you have understand the concept of solv such equat in order to avoid mistak . to continu , there is still anoth reason for my opinion . when you are confid with the underli principl of ani topic you are , as a result , enabl to unterstand and , probabl , to solv new problem . imagin the case of a special problem which onli emerg in your section . thi problem ha to be solv but no known way of approach thi problem is appropri . so your combin abil are veri import . you have now to combin concept and idea you have alreadi learn and the new . consequ , when you have acquir a great varieti of principl to solv problem you will probabl be prepar well in creat own , new idea and concept . in summari , from my perspect , it is better for student to gain knowledg of mani concept to be success in their futur profession life .
