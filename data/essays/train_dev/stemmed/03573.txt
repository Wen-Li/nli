the issu of special is difficult to deal with sinc plenti of differ view have been express on thi subject . on the one hand , one can be tempt to think that a great varieti of knowledg allow somebodi to enlarg hi view of certain matter . howev , we can not deni that a deeper knowledg in a specif subject can sometim be requir to solv some technic problem . take all aspect into account , i am strongli convinc that special doe have more advantag than broad knowledg . to begin with , special sure allow a better effic in problem solv . who would ask a mathematician to read molier while he can ask an actor ? as far as i am concern , i am firmli convinc that each of us ha one or sever special skill , that make him differ from the other : one play the piano , hi brother cook well and i see no reason whi the pianist should learn to cook ! on the contrari , he should continu learn piano to improv thi particular skill . anoth way to justifi my point of view is to consid it under the profession aspect . in relationship market , one make the differ between the ` wait time ' , which is the time the client wait befor it problem is taken into account by a firm , and the ` solv time ' which is the time need to solv thi particular problem . by choos specialist , the firm consider reduc it ` solv time ' . furthermor , the more differ these specialist are , the shorter the ` wait time ' will becom , sinc a great varieti of problem will be thu quickli taken into account . lastli , special may requir from a firm to have a good intern organ . inde , without such an effici organ , special skill of each employe may not be use as well as it should be . howev , if a firm doe settl down such an organ , and doe prefer hire special worker , it effici will sure improv . to conclud , my strong belief is that special is a key answer to some persist econom and polit problem . a major stake will thu be to accept the fact that one could not do everyth perferctli . afteral , billi wilder wa probabl right when he wrote that ` nobodi is perfect ' !
