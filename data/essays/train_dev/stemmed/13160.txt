i think that it better to special in a specif subject , becaus you will have the chanc to be the greatest in that subject you choos , instead if you make mani academ subject , it doe n't matter how good you are you will not be abl to perform as great as if you studi a specif subject . i think that if you studi mani subject you will not make your best in ani of them , form difer reason . first you will not have time to dedic youself to an especif subject for a long amount of time , that make more dificult for you to explor all the aspect of that subject . then you also will have to past mani year at univers stude , and almoast ani time to work our burn other part of your life . i think that special in one subject is a great way to get a huge amount of knowledg , thi will help you in the futur by make you a great worker . also thi will help you to find a job easili becaus campani will search for worker by and specif subject and not for haw mani subject you know that are not compleatli specifi . for exampl if i am lokook for a comput enginn becaus i have a wireless network in my compani , i will go to a job center to find the employe i need , and i found two comput enginner one with a with a comput engennir degre onli and anonth with a comput enginn bdegre but with a special in wireless network . i will choos the one with the special becaus he fit perfect in what my need . in conclut a specil worker will enter earlier to a compani that will use him acord to what he studi and like , make him a product person that have a big chanc of success in live .
