my neighbour famili had a car for all the famili . when i wa visit them last time i saw three car in thier garag ! i realli surpris and i think after twenti year they will 8 car . i beliv that in twenti year there will be more car in use than there are today . i think that becaus of two main reason : econom and popul . first , i think that we will have more car for econom reason becaus the world is becom a idustri world and all of peopl have a higher salari than befor so they will spend more money in buy car . as mani rich star do if they have moni , simpley they buy new car . it is kind of luxsuri . mani peopl beliv that if u have money , you have to buy a car . becaus of the money that peopl will have and becom bussniss peopl they must have a modern and more car than the peopl had . also , the car factori will tri to satistfi the consum and they will produc more car than ani time . second , becaus of increas in popul , mani peopl will need car to do thier daili job and thier work . as a result of thi increas , peopl tri to satistfi themselv and thier famili so they will buy more and more car . i notic that my uncl famili have five car becaus their famili is grow and if we imagin what will happen after twenti year , we can clearli relas that there will be more car in the futur . if mani peopl are tri to have a higher level for salari and the popul number will grow i think we will have more car than the number of peopl and the name for the next age will be `` car-person age '' .
