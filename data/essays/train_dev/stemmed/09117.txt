i agre entir with the opinion that it is more vital for student to comprehend idea and concept than it is for them to learn mere fact . whi studi fact , or even wors , learn them by heart to pass final examin when you will forget most of them shortli afterward , anyway ? therefor , it can be far more benefici to focu on teach the gener understand of idea and concept . research in psycholog ha proven that you will rememb far more easili anyth you have understood instead of learn it by heart . and normal , you learn fact by heart becaus there is not much to understand . moreov , in an increasingli dynam environ , both in profession and privat term , the learn of fact could be in vain . circumst chang more and more rapidli . what wa import to know now could be replac by complet other fact who have to know in a coupl of year . that is the case , for instanc , if you have to chang your profess as a result of structur chang of the employ market . as a matter of fact , expert say that these kind of structur chang will occur more and more frequent , so mani peopl actual will have to chang their profess sever time dure their life . the understand of idea and concept can also be help in ani profess as it offer a larger flexibl . you can not studi all kind of solut to a problem by learn fact . becaus the problem is , that as a student you can not possibl know what kind of concret problem you will have to face later on in life . as a result , it is far more import that you learn and train a certain approach to solv problem , by concentr on studi major idea and gener concept instead of invest too much time into learn fact . in conclus , i would like to state again that the understand of idea and concept is more import becaus it is in everi respect more benefici to the prepar for a increasingli dynam environ . it is easier to rememb idea and concept than it is to rememb fact and , last not least , idea and concept are more use as they allow are larger flexibl to new challeng .
