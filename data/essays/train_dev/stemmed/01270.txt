knowledg is not measur base on the amount of gener thing you know , but on the qualiti of the inform you count on . mani peopl consid that wise be are those who know a small amount of inform about everyth . howev , true knowledg is measur by the deep of thought and idea . by have a broad knowledg of mani differ area , we wo n't be abl to go deep into a specif topic , and therefor , we wont be abl to creat a valuabl conclus . natur is develop in such a way in which each trait is special in one singl action . just as natur , we must use our knowledg to special in certain thing , rather than to have a gener idea about a wide varieti of thing . the human bodi , for instanc , is divid into differ organ that are special into specif fuction . as a result , all organ work togeth to be abl to form the bodi and to work properli . the purpos of natur is effici , and the purpos of knowledg is to be abl to appli it to draw a conclus . the world in which we live in is divid into differ area of work that perform certain task . just as well , thi is carri out in such a way to be abl to perform certain action and conclud idea . if we limit ourselv just to know about gener thing , we wont be abl to strengthen on specif thing . in order to emphas in one specif subject , a gener knowledg of other thing is need . thi is whi for exampl , in real world , we first go to school and then we special into a specif area by go to colleg . we all make part of a big idea , but we must all carri out specif action to be abl to make a global chang in the gener ensembl . in conclus , the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' is not appropi , sinc it is better to have the abil to domin a specif subject than to know gener aspect about it that wo n't permit us to go beyond what 's obviou .
