there are mani way or system for educ . some system prefer to educ as teach idea and concept , and some system are teach the fact . i strongli agre and support the idea that learn fact is alway the most import thing in an educ . lectur and teacher mu encourag their student to face the fact instead of live in a dream world . in our day there are mani research about physicoligac condit of young peopl . big percentag of the young peopl involv in these research are unhappi and complain for their live . the reason for thi is , they are not at the posit they demand to be . becaus they were live in a dream world when they were teenag . nobodi told them the true and the fact of the life . on the other hand if you tell a student alway about ani ancient greek hero or scholar live in a histor time and alway support the idea that the hero state , the student will begin to thing with the charact you present . but the student can not seper and understand the conflict between the idea of thi charact and the fact of our decad , due to hi \ her young age . the other problem is our life is differ than befor . when you make a mistak , the result ha wors impact than befor . that result may lead a terribl effect to the student futur life . the best idea to avoid these bad result , teacher must perform the meet of the student with the fact as soon as they can . the worst thing is ani bad experi that is impossipl to correct .
