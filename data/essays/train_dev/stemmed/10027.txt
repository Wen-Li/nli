i fulli agre with the statement , becaus it 's just what i 've alway done in my life , everi time i had to learn a new thing . i alway tri to focu on concept and not on fact , so i can understand the reason whi someth happen and not simpli how or when it happen . in thi way it 's much easier for me to rememb the huge number of thing i need to rememb for my studi or even for my job . i think that thi way of learn let you rememb thing for the rest of your life , becaus onc you learn how to ride a bycicl , you can not forget it anymor . even if you do not use it for mani year , your brain can still rememb how to ride it . mayb you need some minut to reviv your techniqu , but after onli five minut , you are abl to ride it again as mani year befor . in the same way , you can learn theoret concept , like long and appear complic formula , just tri to understand what is behind them and how to re-creat them from scratch , start from the concept that they repres . instead , if you just concentr on fact , like sequenc of event , date or other `` useless '' inform , you may be abl to rememb them for a certain period of time , but definit not as long as you live . actual there may be import fact to rememb , but thi is not the point . in a few word , i would say that the most import question we have to ask ourselv as student is `` whi ? '' .
