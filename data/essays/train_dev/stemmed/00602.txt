the question befor hand is that whether young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their communit . i am in complet disagr with the aforement statement . i beliv that young gener activ particip in the function of the commun . the youth now are more interest in commun work then ever befor . the follow reason will further buttress my belief in the acitv involv of the youth in commun work . firstli , nowday young peopl are involv in mani commun work by associ themselv with variou polit parti which are dedec toward commun relat work . these polit parties/organis requir the youth to effect rais there voic and the youth inturn get involv in it so as to make a mark for themselv . for exampl , there is a polit parti call shiv sena in india which is mostli compris of young student . secondli , non-government organis which are cheifli control by young student are establish to allow the young peopl to rais there voic on commun relat issu . for exampl , an organis call the youth parliament is control by some colleg go student who want to educ the school go children by discuss all commun relat issu . it open a discuss forum over all issu center our commun . thirdli , mani student specif take time out of there busi schedul to be a part of an old age home or ani protect home for the special children . a survey conduct by a popular magzin , ` india today ' show a inclin of the student toward commun work . the survey rate the commun work conduct by the young peopl more effect then conduct by the peopl of more matur age . final , young peopl are also associ in rais there voic on commun relat issu by fill public interest litig in the court . recent studi show that the slap suit file in the court regard commun work are carri out by the youth . to conclud i would like to quot jacob arnold a renown author who onc state that , `` the pillar stone of ani commun is not the work carri out in it , but it is the particip of the youth in carriy out the commun work count '' .
