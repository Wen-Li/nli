some peopl claim that sucsesful peopl are onli work hard , while other like me fulli agre that success dependt on tri and search . the first point i would like to make is that there are strong advantag to work in a same way . one benefit of work in the same way is not becom ani risk . you wo n't fall down . for instanc , my father who is a mechan mechan engineur . he work 30 year for one compani so becam enough money and promit . he start as a basic engineur and he becam hi promot with hi hard work . he had n't got ani stress becaus the compani doe n't care him he care onli hi work . undoubtedli , not take risk mean a healti , relax and safeti life . though there are strong advantag to work in a same way there are some even more compel advatag for me to work with risk . when you take risk the incom will be more . for exampl , i 'm a mechan engineur like my father but i want to have my own compani so i can take more risk for make my compani bigger . thi risk will be enjoy too becaus i like thi style of life . more than that , i can learn a lot of thing with my risk . the incom will be alway bigger with risk . in addit , without risk a person could n't be enough creativ . with the help of the stress our bodi ha got more adrenalin which mean more creativ and better work . thi is a biolog truth and would make us success . in conclus , i fulli advoc to take risk will make someon more success . everyon can work hard on a same thing but success depend on creativ which is the result of risk .
