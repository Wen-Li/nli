human never found out the respons of thi question : ` is it more import to see the idea and concept or to learn fact for new brain ? ' . both of these two pole have their proper advantag but is one of them more essenti than the other one ? for student which one is more effici ? idea are alway need and as a result they are import becaus they are the start point of all developp , of all achiev . student have to understand these idea and concept becaus they are in a great thirst to knowledg which is lead by these abstract form . more precis , a student must see the mean of the idea and concept to go forward , to have new vision , to develop hi creativ . thu , understand idea and concept are realli import for student which are thi world 's futur . on the other hand , student can not do without fact becaus these show the result of idea , these clear the realiti for us . student can not continu just by use idea and concept , without know fact they wo n't be abl to corpor their abstract view . moreov , fact are the light of the past , of the present and with them of the futur becaus as in histori we can not go on without knowledg of the realiti in thi world and for student ' educ realiti pass by fact . also student will encount fact to test their idea and concept , ifnot thay ca n't know if they are correct or not . in conclus , with these advatag showen , it 's imposs to say either learn fact or understand idea and concept is more import for student . in my opinian , we do n't have to compar these two side becaus they are go alway togeth by complet each other and both of them is realli essanti for student .
