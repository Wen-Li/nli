the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid i am agre with the statement becaus when you travel with a tour guid you have the chanc to go to the most interest place of the countri you are visit . you can also meet the bether cultur , histor , and repres place , that you would n't know if you dont go with a tour guid . for exampl , when you go to bueno air , argentina , is better that you do it with a tourist agent , becaus they would take you to the most histor and repres place of the citi and you will know their histori and learn special inform about them . when you go there you cant miss the neihgborhood la boca , the place in wich is locat the stadium of the best club team in latin america , `` club atletico boca junior '' . it 's a veri beati place to walk but you have to go with a tour guid becaus in other way you would'nt appreci all the histori that is behind it . if you travel alon , you will miss the chanc to learn someth new , and to live experi like meet new peopl from all abov the world . it is difficult that when you go into a trip by yourself , you wil meet all the popl that you can meet in a guid tour for the citi . in that way you could not just learn about the countri you visit , but also about other countri in the world that you could go on a later trip to visit . the advantag of go on a trip with a tour guid are huge . you can not miss the chanc of do it , becaus on that way you will live the best vacat experi of your life . you can learn about other countri custom and live for some day like a person of that countri .
