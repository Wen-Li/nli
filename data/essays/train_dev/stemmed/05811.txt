there are sever reason whi i think that young peopl nowaday give enough time to help their commun , most of them base in my own person experi , that make me complet disagre with the statement set . in first place , we have to distinguish between period help to the commun and flunctuant help to the commun . the first one is help of young peopl almost in a weekli basi and with a veri high grade of compromis . the second one is help given when certain natur disast such as tsunami or flood aris . look back throughout what i have been wit in thi particular topic dure the last 10 year , it is pretti clear for me that young peopl are involv in their commun in a period basi . just a small exampl of thi may be a program hold in my univers which consist on young peopl live with old peopl who live alon and need help . of cours there is an advantag for the young peopl from the program such as not have to pay a rent , but the realli import thing of thi program is that they are help the commun , help the old peopl , help their famili and in gener , help societi to becom much more involucr in the need of the commun . there are also mani exampl of non period help such as those of natur disast . when that happen you alway see plenti of young peopl move to get food or cloth but not onli in their own countri , but also move themselv to wherev the disast ha occur . an exampl of thi is the tsunami held in asia a coupl of year ago , again in my univers , you could see everi singl student organ move in order to get money , food , cloth or medicin . so , to sum up and as i have argu befor , young peopl make lot of effort to help their commun and they realli give mani of their free time to help other .
