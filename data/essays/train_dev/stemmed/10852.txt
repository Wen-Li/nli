i disagre with that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becasu the follow reason . to enjoy life , first thing we have to realiz is how preciou our live are . the life doe not have to be a special one such as celebr 's or politician 's . the normal life itself is alreadi special enough . without apprici our live we never realli enjoy neither youth or life . howev there are mani young peopl who seem to loos their interest in thier live . even though they are mani thing from they can take advantag , such as educ for all children , develop of comput system , easi access to all around the world , aval of social support and so on , they do not seem to be happi . they rather seem to take all advatag for grant or do not realiz how lucki they are . one of the reason whi young peopl lost their will to live thier life more activ is that they are not abl to picturel how they would be in ten year later . becasu of bad economi , polit mess , untrust politician , strang teacher etc. it is not easi to keep their dream and ambit for children . instead they learn the word `` that 's life '' or `` that 's the way it is '' with a feel of give up . so , those chirdlen grow up and becom young adult who ha no vision for the futur . on the other hand , even though older peopl is loos their physic abil they still have will to live . especi old peopl who have war-experi know how to apprici what we have . life becom enjoy as long as peopl apprici it . if life is simpli to consum time , it could be aw time for waitng the end .
