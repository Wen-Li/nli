for thi question , i would like to say that the quantiti of car in the world will be greater than what we have in these day . the reason whi i think thi way are base on three altern reason which we will see in close futur -- econom power transit , improv our technolog and as a primari reason , the transit of econom power is strongli arguabl . as we can see on the news , the econom power ha been chang to mani place where there were not much power last centuri . for exampl , when it come to transit of ecomom power , we can not get rid of the imag that china ha found in last few year . accord to a statist , china will have been get much more econom power and will be consid as the most econom power countri in the world by 2010 . not to mention , the popul in china is well known as the biggest one in the world . also , mani peopl of them are still consid as lower class peopl which can mean they have no transport by themselv . in next , twenti year , it is clear that those peopl can afford to buy a car , at least , they will be dream about own their car for sure . as anoth reason , the cost to make a car will be fewerd in next decad . as our techniqu are consider develop in our societi , the cost will and time will be decreas . moreov , it is possibl to think that human be no longer requir to make a car . all role can be done by robot or remot control . surey , some peopl might doubt abour the fossil energi that we have becaus of it limit . solv the problem seem to be uneasi ; howev , in mani way , we have alreadi accomplish to substitut some other natur energi such as solar system or electr motor . those are much cheaper than fuel our gage with ga , more importantli , those energi are consider good with our earth . in conclus , as long as recent econom transit and world technolog we have are exist , i assum the quantiti of car in the world will be greater than what it is now .
