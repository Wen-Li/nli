when we know a specif topic or we discuss an argument , and we are well awar of what we write or speak about , most of the time we bring idea , concept and fact . the idea and concept are necessari to be abl to defin and describ a gener concept . if we start ani descript , it is necessari that first we have a clear and defin gener inform about it and that we can put it abov all the necessari explan we have to give in support of it . mani time we have to use mani idea or concept to describ a specif argument , but it would never be clear to describ ani topic , without the use of more detail and clear explan of the element , that can onli be brought with fact . let 's think about histori and let 's tri to reli onli on gener concept about the histori of roman : it is certainli veri import to know that the roman have been conqueror , but it would n't be use if we do n't support the inform with more specif inform , such as the time they pass teh alp or went to the sea and had the punic war . in order to be clear , it is necessari to have a wide and clear vision of the element of the discuss and that would be certainli repres by idea and concept , but in order to go deeper in the descript , it is necessari to bring specif exampl of what we are speak about . in a literatur class , it is necessari to know the main element of the romantic period in term of concept and idea , but it would be imposs to understand the mean of the genr if we do n't bring specif fact to surround the idea , like who wa the main repres of the period or what wa written . student actual would use mani of the fact to rememb and support gener idea and concept , that otherwis might be difficult to rememb . i think that a stuudent should be abl to understand fact and concept , but it is necessari that he support those gener element with specif fact .
