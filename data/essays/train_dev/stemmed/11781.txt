we live in a societi in which the enterpris and the industri can product everyth becous they reach a veri import technolog level requir for the product . so their problem is how to sell their product . to aim thi pourpos , industri use the power instrument of market . they have to convinc peopl to buy their product instead of the product of the other . so they use the promot to show their product to peopl through tv , paper , radio etc . then now some societi have been reach a great visibl and these are well known by peopl . so costum known what they want and what they want to buy ; they want to buy the product that they know and that they have watch on tv or seen on a poster on some wall . but most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in fact , mani less industri , to be abl to sell their product , use all the system to product with the minimun cost . so the qualiti of their product is not so good . so to hide the low qualiti they use most advertis to seem their product better . i think that advertis are import for a societi to show it product to peopl , but i m even sure that if the product doesn t satisfi him , the costum will not buy it again . then i think that thi fenomena had brought to anoth danger problem , the counterfait . the societi that promot the counterfait product use the advertis of some grat industri to sell good with a veri low qualiti .
