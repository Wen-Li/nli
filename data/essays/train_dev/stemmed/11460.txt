becaus i have onli been young so far , i am convinc that young peopl seem to enjoy life in more depth that the adult or the grandpar do . i believ that when we are children or even teenag , we have the chanc to discov all the pleasur of the life and not have enough distanc or experi to find reason to not enjoy everi minut of our live . first of all , learn by discov bring us so much pleasur that it is hard not to be excit about . for instanc , when i think about my youth or the imag i have from young peopl , i alway see smile and imagin laugh on children face . secondli , when i look and hear about older peopl experi , i rare observ so much good mood and pride to live . i more often see some sad . thi situat may be due becaus of today societi that tend to make thing becom more and more complex . in thi kind of chao , older peopl often go too far to get some pleasur . older peopl tend to think too much rather than just live the moment and find a way to enjoy . furthermor , when we compar an adult who alway find someth to complain about hi work , hi famili or hi social statu , to some younger peopl who are not awar of those problemat , even if it by ignor that they seem to enjoy more , they still show it . moreov , and in order to fulfil part of my concept of enjoy , i strongli believ that young peopl , becaus they want to learn , take more risk that their older gener . take a risk is in one a way , the proof that we are enjoy the situat and that we do not tri to find difficulti or reason not to enjoy where they do not even exist . global , even if children enjoy differ their live sinc they can not have the abil to fulli think about what enjoy realli mean , they just enjoy by make life as easi as it just is .
