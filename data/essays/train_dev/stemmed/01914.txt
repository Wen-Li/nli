some peopl , especi sciologist , often discuss whether we will use less car than today . although some peopl may agre with the statement , i disagre with the statement becaus we have invent use and high-tech car , such as hybrid-car that are not occur air pollut . and dure twenti year it is hard to invent new one such as fli car . we have invent use and high-tech car . it prove the abil of car industi . so , we will be abl to drive more use and high-tech car . as everyon know , car are not alway advantag becaus they can caus air pollut . howev . car are one of the effici transport . for exampl , now we can buy and drive hybrid car . it doe not make air pollut serious . i agre with the opinion that it is expens . howev , compani will dereas hybrid car ' price as soon as possibl . becaus the gover help them by support money . in twenti year there will be more car on the road , also , these car are definit hybrid-car . or someday we do not have to worri about pay for ga or insur . it is hard to invent new one , such as fli car . we usual watch fli car in the movi . hower , it is just movi . we should distingh from fantasi and realti . twenti year are too short to invent new one . when i wa seven year old , i dream about trip to the moon and i believ that i will be abl to trip to the moon after twenti year . of cours , today we can go to the moon and i heard about news that an american woman visit the moon recent . i also heard that the expens that astonish me . in thi way , someday there are probabl fewer car than today but not after twenti year . i think that it will take almost 100year later . take all of thing into account , we need more attent and inventori when we want get rid of car on the road .
