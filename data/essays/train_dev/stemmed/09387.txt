i almost agre with thi statement , but i think some critic can be infer . actual for some context it is obvious better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , like in colleg or with other student but also to be abbl to choos what you want to do . while to be special in one specif subject can close some possibl , but it wil be easier to be outstand in one specif subject . on the one hand to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is the system of all school , when you are young you do n't learn just french or math , you have learn everyth in the same time . there is a reason of thi system , he ha been creat to be allow the student to be open mind , the histori show us how is import to be not focu on onli one thing , even the great geniu wa n't focus on onli one subject . let take an exampl , leonard da vinci wa a geniu in paint so dure hi life he ha develop thi qualiti , but not onli he wa also interest by the biolog , more specef how the human bodi work . on the other it allow to choos what you realli want to do . for me it is import to have choic between difer special , i mean i have to know a littl bit of everyth if i want to make a good choic about my futur . for exampl when i wa young i wa realli interest by litteratur , i start to read realli earli so i thought mayb the best thing for me is to take litteratur class later , but i realiz how wrong i wa when i discov my love for biolog . so i decid to not make choic between two thing that i love , i decid to tri anoth academ subject , to know a broad of everyth , and mayb later i will special . now , i studi in law colleg so i am special but it 's ok becaus i made some difer thing befor i choos law . so i just to improv myself in law , which is alreadi hard but more easier than if i have all academ subject .
