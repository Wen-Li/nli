ye , i total agre with thi term of travel in a group led by a tour guid . it is mainli becaus as we are a tourist so we dont know much about the place in a particular place . we will visit onli those place which are known to us . but if you travel in a gruoup led by a tour guid you will be abl to see more new place that u have neevr imagin to see in that particular place . the tour guid play a veri import role in make our tour veri intrest and adventur . he tell us about the stori of the differ place of that place and make us feel more and more excit to visit that place . i visit agra ( india ) . i wa travel with my friend and we all plan to hire for a tour that is led by a guid so that we can visit more and more place and can come to know about the histori of those place . as i know , agra is a citi of histori . it have lot of histori in it and i want to know the proper histori of that place . i wa sure that onli a group tour guid can onli tell us about it and i wa not wrong at all . he told the whole group about the histori of all those histor place in that town . as we know one of the seven wonder ` taj mahal ' is also locat in that citi . i wa touch by listn the histori of that wonder . not onli me but the whole group wa touch by what all he told us about it . i think i wa not in that group with that guid i would have never enjoy my trip to agra . as i would not have come to know all wat he told to the whole group . the histori of great taj mahal . sinc then i love to travel in a group which is led by a tour guid . actual what i think one should must visit new place in a group led by a tour guid . im say so mainli becaus you come to know about the place of that town and everyth about that town . if you like it then you can come again on your own without a torurist guid . but if you are visitng a new place for the first time then you have to travel in a group which is lead by a tour guid . if you have a tour guid then you need not have to take ant tension for accomod traveel from one place to anoth . all these task are done by a tour guid onli . we dont even have to buy ticket again and again . in all when we are travel in a group led by a tour guid we are in a full mood of enjoy . no work tension noth . onli enjoy and enjoy . so i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
