while some peopl have a deep and specif knowledg of one subject , other have a broad knowledg of mani subject . the question aris which of those option is better . i persoal agre with the statement and think that a broad knowledg is better . if you have a deep knowledg of one specif topic , you sure are a specialist in your specif field of interest . you may call yourself an expert . you can work on one topic that you like and that mayb ha becom part of your life . howev , the disadvantag is that you onli have specif knowledg , which in the worst case could lead to a lack of understand for other topic . as life ha lot of facet , it would be use in my opinion to have a broad knowledg of topic which concern the world we live in . although with a broad knowledg you are never excel in one specif topic and may not see your own academ develop in your field of interest , you gain an insight in variou subject and , which is most import , you can also use your knowledg in daili life situat . that knowledg can in a way widen your horizon and mayb it could as well be veri use . if you can speak lot of languag for exampl , thi could be handi for you when you go on holiday and find yourself in convers with nativ speaker . in thi daili life situat it is more use to speak a few languag in an averag way than to speak one languag perfectli . i think you can not say in gener if it is alway better to have a broad knowledg or a specif knowledg . it appear depend on the charact of the person and hi or her prefer . nevertheless , mayb you could also make a compris . you could have your own specif subject but at the same you could confront yourself with other subject in order not to lose yourself in one specif topic .
