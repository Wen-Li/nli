i do not agre on thi statement . i do not think it is best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are a lot of way to travel in our life . for exampl , to travel alon , to do with your friend or famili , and pack tour with stranger ( such a way in the statement ) . in variou way , if i could travel anywher , i would like to travel alon . it is best for me not to mind other even if it is my famili , friend or boy friend . when you walk with someon , you should catch up with him or her . and , fllow , you can not the thing you want to look if you have someth you want . it is too unpleas for me . so , when i want to buy someth , i will go shop alon . thi is same in case of travel . i want to go place i want . if someon and me want to go to same place , mayb i will concid well . on oppsit , the demerit that i thought when you travel in a group led by a tour guid . it is semilar to the case of my former reason that i do not go shop with someon . a tour guid alway can provid with a satisfi content to each us . a big tour can not respons to each need of each custom . it is problem for me .
