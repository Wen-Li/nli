i think that almost everi advertis make the product it support better than it actual is . there are three main reason for thi opinion . firstli the main use of advertis is to sell the product . the second reason is that if for exampl contract are advertis there are mostli print or shown on screen littl paragraph with the flaw of the contract . the last reason is that everyth ha not onli merrit but also flaw , which are typic not display . in order to sell product the produc ha to display it in a good light , becaus otherwis similar product from other compani will be bought . thi situat make a better exposur of a product than it actuallt is veri like . an exampl might be cream that should improv the look of human skin . studi prove that they show no effect , but in contrari even sometim hamr the skin . if thi would be told in an advertis nobodi would buy the cream . a good exampl for the second reason are contract of phone compani . they often announc some but not all of the cost a special contract may produc . becaus of legal statement they have to write these flaw on the advertis but they do thi in veri small letter . so if you do n't look care you might get the impress of a much cheaper product . in advertis flaw of product are never told , expect there are special right as with the phone contract . but everyth ha side that are better or wors especi if compar to other similar product . advertis do not speak about these thing where other compar product can prove better result . so they alway hide some side of the product . to show thi hidden characterisitc almost everi product is test by independ magazin or someth alik . for exaampl comput magazin that test hardwar and softwar . so you can not reli on advertis .
