if one consid the question of whether it is of more advantag to have a broad spectrum of knowledg in mani differ area or whether it is more advis to concentr it in one small field , one import distinct need to be made . the answer to thi question is differ depend upon whether one consid a person with the ultim goal of pursu a profession career in busi or whether the focu is on someon that intend to stay in the academ field in order to perform research and teach . the answer to the former case is that ye , for the businessman it is more advantag to have a broad knowledg ; for the latter subject , the academ , a more narrow focu is preferenti . the reason for that shall be illumin below ; the two type discuss shall be refer to as the `` profession '' and the `` academ '' , respect . for the profession , it is crucial to have a broad knowledg in differ area sinc in hi everyday life , he will constantli be face with situat involv veri divers topic . in order to understand these , and more importantli , to link these togeth , that wisdom will duli serv him . imagin for exampl an execut at a multin compani : how is he to understand the need of hi custom ( and hi employe ) of differ nation if he doe n't know about their cultur background ? the second main point where hi broad know will assist him is in gener problem-solv . whenev one learn about a new subject , no matter which field is concern , one is subconsci expos to the techniqu of attack problem in the respect field : the more differ field one ha seen , the broader the base from which one can choos the tactic to solv one 's own problem . when a ceo of a larg compani make a strateg consider , the process that take place in hi mind subconsci wa obtain in some random academ area he had onc studi at school , and that structur of thought serv him veri well in that situat . howev , also the profession need to excert dilig : if one exagger the amount of differ subject studi , one will end up with unconnect , loos , random fact that serv neither for common knowledg nor for problem-solv . the second type under consider is the academ : hi or her ultim goal is to perform success research and therebi creat entir new scientif knowledg . thi process is conduct at such an immens high level nowaday that everyon want to have widespread success in a field need to know absolut everyth about it . at the same time , the subject have reach such complex that an occup with a differ field simpli is n't possibl for the ambiti research : in order to onli even stay up to date in hi own field , he will have to invest well over fifti hour a week . due to thi , in academia thi focu on one specif subject is an absolut must . for the sake of complet though , it should be mention that also for academ it is advis to first gain some more spread-out knowledg : if for exampl a quantum mechan physicist want to appli hi principl to biolog , he need to be abl to alreadi refer back to some exist knowledg from hi own educ process in order to see the basic connect . in conclus , it wa demonstr in thi text that depend on the work of the person under consider , the answer to the introductori statement differ : the prefer a broad knowledg base , wherea the academ goe with the narrow one .
