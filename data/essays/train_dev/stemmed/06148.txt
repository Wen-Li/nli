i agre to the statement , that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them learn fact . first of all , the motiv of learn should be to know the thing , to fulfil the thirst of knowledg . thi ambit should be the reason , whi somebodi decid to studi at an univers . second , if somebodi learn onli fact , it will be even harder to keep the fact . the human memori ha evolv by natur in order to better surviv on thi planet . at these time it wa help to understand idea and concept , for exampl , understand natur in favour to use it . therefor the human is not suit to learn fact , in comparison to the comput . it could be ask , whi student have to learn fact at all ? the reason is simpl . fact are need to be present in the mind to construct or to follow a theori as much as brick and stone are need to construct an hous . if student don `` t learn ani fact , they can '' t follow ani theori , which reli on fact . therefor it is neccessari to learn fact , but the motiv for it should be to understand idea and concept . learn fact ha to be view like a tool , which some peopl like to use and some peopl don `` t , but the reason to use the tool doesn '' t lie in the tool itself . as i describ abov , the human mind is not intend to learn fact . but to develop a complic theori , it is neccessari to know fact . therefor the societi creat reward for use learn fact . a teacher reward a student , if he learn well and if he learn fact accur . some student are attract so much by these reward , that they onli learn fact to achiev the reward . everybodi of us experienc them in the school class , where some pupil learn veri ambiti and accur , but it wa easi to see , that they prefer receiv the reward instead of satisfi their thirst of knowledg . as a solut to thi phenomena at school , i propos to reward the understand of idea and concept much more then just learn the fact . the pupil need the disciplin to the learn fact , but they also need to see , whi the are learn them .
