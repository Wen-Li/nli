travel around the world and discov new place you never seen befor is the most pleasur thing to do for a lot of peopl . for me when i deci to travel i will prefer to plug in with a group which led by an experinc tour guid rather than travil alon for mani reson . first , when you visit a new place definitli you do not know what the famou place to go and visit . so , the tour guid will provid you with a variou place and recommand you with the best of them . for exampl , last year i travel with my husband to california and we did not join a tour group led by a guid , we wast our time just for search for place to go . while other visit save thier time by join a tour group with a tour guid and visit mani place than we did . second , join a tour group will give you the chanc to know inform tell by the tour guid that you did not know them befor about the place you visit them . for exampl , last month my parent went to eygipt and they decid to join a tour group and when they came back from their journi they told us a lot of inform that we did not know about the pyramid . all these inform were told to them by the tour guid . third , a tour guid save your time and make it more enjoy by take you to the most famou place and the most interst one too . by thi you do not have to go to everi place and look for the interst one . for exampl , when i went to london for the first time with my sister we went to everi where just to find a good place to enjoy our time there and when we found the nice one we were exot and we could not realli enjoy our time then but if we were with a tour guid thi will never happen . so , for the three reason i disscuss abov i will never travel without a group led by a tour guid . and i wish to travel soon with a good tour guid and have good vocat ,
