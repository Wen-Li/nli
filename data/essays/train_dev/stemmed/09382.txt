as it is said that high return can not be gotten without high risk , it seem to be true that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they know . howev , i disagre with the idea becaus of follow reason . firstli , success can be achiv if you continu do what you alreadi know how to do well . for exampl , in japanes tradit art like kabuki or nou , the perform repeat the practic of the same stori everi day from the day they start the practic when they are 3 year old or so to the day they die . howev , we all admit that they could succeed in fulli express the tradit art as part of japanes cultur . the same also appli to tradit craftmak or even profession basebal player . they improv their abil by repeat the same thing which is the most familiar to them everi day . these exampl are enough to deni the statement abov . besid , even if tri new thing bring you the chanc for success , new thing must mean the thing which is new to everyon , not to the person alon . someon who alway chang their focus can not have a chanc to get success .
