i do n't think that learn fact is less import than understand idea or concept : both are demand skill of our societi and are use in differ situat . there are situat that requir the abil of understand idea like those in which a student is ask to solv a new problem . but there are also situat like a scientist in a laboratori where either he know how the chemic reaction is be evolv or he risk seriou damag . in other word , sometim it is essenti to know fact . we can captur anoth aspect if when compar thi two activ we argu that learn is not so expens like understand . i do n't believ that . for some peopl it is veri difficult to keep in mind even a telephon number , so i think that the cost of learn may vari from one individu to anoth . in conclus it depend from the situat . mathematician are notabl ask to understand idea , but are we sure that they also do n't learn fact ? no .
