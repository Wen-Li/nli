do i think that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well ? as far as i am concern , regard my job ( i work as lawyer in a financi law firm in pari ) , i think that i have a pretti good understand of that question . in my essay i am go to give you and to explain my opinion . in order to support thi opinion , i will tri to illustr my point of view by personn experi at work . the first point i would like to make is that , regard my own experi , when you work in a law firm you can find the two opposit . some lawyer are the best in their special and do not want to practic in anoth depart of law such as tax law , busi law . .. and some other prefer to discov anoth type of law . though , they are strong advantag and disadvantag in both , i think that it is alway more interest to perform in differ way . for thi reason , regard my personn , i am rather in agreement with the subject statement . if you want to progress , in your work or in your life , you often have to test someth new , even if it is more riski . moreov , when you make a mistak you have to draw conclus , and therefor your experi can be use for posit thing . to conclud , if i step back , i realis that , in my job , i am alway regard the risk . on one hand i have to make sure that my client doe not run the slightest risk , but on the other hand i alway have to test new thing in order to be more attract . nonetheless , like i told you in my essay i have rather a personn that conduct me to tri new thing . i do realli think that , if it is not tooriski and if we do not expos somebodi els to a risk , to experi life is also take mani risk .
