appar , young peopl have much more time to enjoy themselv . howev , it is difficult that to say that young peol enjoy life more than older peopl do . there is a problem somewhat too colplic to speak easi way . everyon enjoy their life . inde they enjoy their life in their own way . so young peopl and older peopl both enjoy their life , but in their specif way . older peopl , of cours , have more time to work in their field to make money for their famili . sometim they can not have a break all day long . even , in asian countri , older peopl can not have a vacat all around year . they have great royalti to their famili . although they may complain about their life like thi , they will not leav it . sometim they enjoy thi situat , to have chanc to support their famili by themselv and to grow their children in better circumst . thi is the life actual they enjoy everyday . young peopl can not help enjoy their time everyday . they have no respons to work for someon except simpl homework . so young peopl have much more time to spend for themselv , in my experi , more time doe not mean more joy . in fact , young peopl spend time useless more often than older peol do . but it is obviou that if young peopl can manag their life valuabl , they have much more chane to ( realli ) enjoy their life . in conclus , the critic point of about thi question is not the quantiti but the qualiti of life manag . although older peopl have less time for themselv to enjoy than younger peopl , they can manag their life more valuabl , so they can enjoy about the result .
