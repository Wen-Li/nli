ye , i am total in agreement with the notion that it is better to travel in group instead of travel alon led by a guid . actual , in today materialist world their is more safeti concern then ever befor . so it is wise deces to travel in group . for ex , if a person travel in a new town or countri and he doe know not anyth about the new place . then it is better for him to travel in a group becaus it lessen hi chanc of be confus in an unknown place . a person could be face a lot of defficulitio ion new place like where to stay , have food and some time he may encount langaug problem . so travel in group with guid will be help option . . travel in group led by guid is veri good choic , becaus the guid is familiar with local languag , cultur which help a lot . actual , travel with a guid enhanc your joy of the trip becaus he can tell u a lot about the the place you are tour . further it is also cheaper econom to travel with mani peopl . beaus in group everybodi is contribut in the whole cost which is mostli less then the cost of travel alon . explor a exil place in alon is not a good option becaus sometim their are few minor prolem regard to secur which may encount by an singl travel . for instanc like a person is go to catch a train in a railway station and someon steel hi purs , then he feel that he is in critic dillemma . actual , there are few thiev who attack on alon and new travel . but if you are teavel in group , they can not dare to steel your thing or you can con = mpliant with your group member . basic , travel alon in a new and unknown place is alway a riski task , one should have to be veri care about himself as well as hi luggag too . on the other hand travel in group secur a person from these minor problem . at conclus , it is a good and intellig idea to travel in group with the guid . it make you safer and allow to enjoy journey .
