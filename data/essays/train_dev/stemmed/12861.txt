as far as differ concept for educ in school are concern it 's still a great issu if learn fact or understand idea should have the main prioriti . the given statement say that to understand idea is more import than to learn fact . i person agre with thi statement . these are my main point : at first fact can be read in book , thu also be look up . in our age , when inform is so easi access ( one could mention the internet here ) , i think the import of rememb fact is much lower then it perhap onc wa . on the other hand it is veri difficult to read idea in book becaus it is part of the essenc of idea that one must have understood them onc if he want to rememb them an use them later . that lead me to my second point : fact can onli hardli be rememb . i person often had to learn a larg amount of fact ; and i forgot them onli a few day later . concern idea , that is not the problem . onc unterstood , ( thi is truli necessari , as alreadi mention ) certain idea can be rememb a long time after one had learn them . but there is anoth import point that ha to be mention . learn idea help to creat own idea . onc the structur of a certain idea or argument is understood , the student might be abl to adapt those structur in hi own way of think . in the end thi is definit one condit for matur and respons . just learn fact wo n't help you to think on your own , perhap not even to use those fact in a new situat . to put it in a nutshel , i definitey agre with the statement . thougt there are certain case in which know fact is quit essenti , e.g. as histori as a subject is concern . i think it 's not possibl to dicuss thi issu argu just for one of the mention concept . but refer to the thesi , just say that it is more import to understand idea , i can agre .
