there is no doubt that car is the mainstream of transport in modern time . although still car are incred increas nowaday , i believ that use of car will decreas in the futur time . i will present briefli two reason to support my opinion . first of all , polut problem it occur is a seriou issu in the past and also futur time . gover are make a strict schedul to control car and pollut it made recent year . mani experi and result alreadi show that seriou air pollut caus by car can caus lung cancer and lead human to death . it is a problem that conflict with human health even to human surviv , strong limit of use car will made in the futur time . it is not a matter of onli human matter of earth 's . furthermor , new transport that is more conveni and do not make ani pollut will invent in the futur time . alreadi mani scientist and expert of car start it ' invent . recent invent electron and hydrogen transport is a fine exampl of thisinvent . they use electr or water for their fuel to run which doe n't make ani pollut to the air . one problem is it 's price but develop of technolog will solv it natur . invent of car wa a revolutionari one to human kind . howev it threaten human live recent time . limit of it 's use and invent of new transport is necessari . i believ that human will chose to stop use car natur in the futur time accord to abov mention reason : it 's pollut problem and appear of new transport .
