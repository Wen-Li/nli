i am so agre with the statement . thi is also what i like to do all the time , be a creativ peopl . i think thi is veri import to be a success peopl . i think if peopl want to be sucess , you have to take risk , tri someth new that peopl do n't know veri well . becaus if you keep do the thing peopl alreadi know a lot about it , you ca n't be better than the peopl who are veri profession on it . there are a lot of famou peopl in the world . whi could they be so success ? becaus they keep tri new thing . for exampl , bill gaz , the rishest man in the world . but do you know he drop out of the colleg in the second year . do you think if he did n't take the risk of drop out of the colleg to tri someth new or you can call the comput revolut , he would be so success like thi . i guess it is no . howev , if you keep do the microsoft ware now , you would not be success on it , i am pretti sure it will not . becaus no bodi can produc the microsoft product better than he do . that is whi you have to produc someth new , someth quit differ and more conveni . a lot of peopl are be normal , becaus they do n't rather to take risk , even if he is veri good at it and have veri good oppurtun . of cours we ca n't ignor those peopl who want to be normal . thi is whi success peopl are usual few in the societi . i bevel success peopl 's life should be veri excit , and they are the kind of peopl who like excit . becaus they take risk , and nobodi would know what is go to come out . and sucess would be one of the result . is n't it excit ?
