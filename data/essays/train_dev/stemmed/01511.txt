gener speak , advertis make product attract and desir . let me start from scratch , what is the point of an advertis ? it is of cours to make sell . and whi would someon buy an object if it seem useless and uneffect ? as a result , advertis natur tri to make a product look interest . it is true that consequ , advertis sometim make a product seem much better than it realli is . sometim advertis lie . yet it is not necessarili in it own interest to lie to consum sinc they are not so stupid , and onc a consum find out that he had been betray , he will not buy the product of the advertis anymor . it might get even worst : the betray consum may not buy ani other product of thi compani . that is whi , advertis must be care about what they are claim , and they ought to win the consum 's trust by simpli tell him what the true advantag of such or such product are . yet , it is also true that advertis tend to emphas the pro of an object and to hide it disadvantag . thi is the implicit rule of busi . unfortunatli , in occident societi thi rule is a gener principl . one can not avoid it . so one must not be gullibl . for these reason , i am not shock by advertis even if they are fals . one must simpli be care and read magazin about product that he want to acquir . besid , i believ that advertis is a everyday enjoy . it is part of our life , and i do think that they are some advertis that are veri well done and that are veri enjoy , even if they lie a littl . i prefer an intersest but lie commerci than a realist bore one . anywaym the main goal of advertis is to ; ake a product known right ? and what is ; ore strike that a beauti advertis ?
