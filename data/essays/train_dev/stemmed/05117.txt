i strongli agre becaus i believ that if you manag to understand the main idea of an event , it will last in your mind and you will be abl to rememb it for a long time , and that if you just learn the fact of the event they wo n't last in your mind that much . an exampl that i believ can be given is when high school student learn about hystor event , if they just memor date , name and place they will be abl to rememb them just in order to apli them in a test , unless it 's a super import subject of histori . but if they anal the situat , anal the event that ocur and comprehend whi did that event ocur in the first place , they will like the subject more , they will feel a littl bit smartter and the date , the name and the place will be left in a second place , so thi will even help them when they will have to memor date and such , becaus they will be abl to associ the purpos and reason of the event with the number and the name . i believ that is not necessari for learn to be bore , if you just memor everyth and studi just becaus you want to get a good grade , you are not do the real purpos of learn , you 're just deal with a lot of problem and get yourself tire and bore . studi can be fun , if you understand everyth you will feel smart , if you just learn the fact without actual understand what they mean you will feel bad and less intellig , so i think that teacher should encourag student to exceed themselv and to develop their intellig and not to memor a thousand book without understand anyth or withouth even learn thing that will truli be help in your life . peopl that are truli smart can solv a problem without the necess of consult someon els who 's suposs to be more intellig , and if you need to read someth a thousand time to actual get ahold of the idea you 're just a mere puppet and is pointless to live as a puppet becaus at the end of your life you will feel bad for have restrict your true intellig .
