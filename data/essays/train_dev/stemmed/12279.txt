idea and concept prepar the base of someth that want to be learnt . lear from fact mean to experi someth and so it mean to have a deep knoledg . thu , from my point of view it is more import to learn from fact rather than to understand idea and concept . if not , you do not realli know what you have learnt . in order to learn someth , the understand of the idea and concept is an import thing . for instanc , if you are lear about literatur dure a cert period of time , it is veri import to understand the concept that it ivolv such as the social context , the differ author and the style of write . thi creat an import background of knoledg about the literatur but you do not learn everyth becaus you do not read the literatur . in contrast to the abov , if the fact are learnt a better understand can be obtein . for exampl , instead of tri to undestand the idea and concept of thi literatur centuri , the option of read the main book of thi centuri should be taken . if the book of the main writer are read , the student will be abl to infer a great deal of thing so that a better understand is reach . most of the thing that are learnt by isol concept and idea can be drawn by a care read of the most import author . therefor , if you tri to learn fact you get the concept and idea that you would need to understand someth while with the other way around is not possibl . thu , i think it is more import to learn from fact rather than idea or concept .
