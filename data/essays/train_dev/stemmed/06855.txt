young peopl feel life insid , while old peopl loos their energi . thi is the main differ i think . an old man ha a lot of experi insid him ; he could feel tire sometim : thing are n't even more new , they do n't commun the same sensat they were use to do in the past . in fact a young person know that he ha a whole life to live . he enjoy live look at the futur , while an old man live look at what he ha live in the past . a young person ha the enjoy to creat hi futur catch each singl sensat come from the outsid ( the world ) . a babi is usu to enjoy everyth becaus everyth is new ; a veri old person may feel like he ha no more reason to live , and so hi life becom someth like `` wait for godot '' , wait for someth tri to find some distract to spend life . we have to underlin that physic condict is essenti for enjoy life too : normal young peopl feel better so they can do a lot of thing that old peopl ca n't , like sport , that rappres an import way to satisfi ourselv . the preoccup of healti is anoth main attitud that contribuit to make old peopl to life in fear . but thi is n't alway correct : it depend even on the societi . i explain : in thi year i can see that mani friend of mine ha lost their way of enjoy life ' like they are miss someth . they are just live wait for a better futur condit . my grandfath instead wa use to have fun in each singl moment of hi life ' even when he wa said he would have die . it 's wire i think . in my person opinion i think we have to enjoy life alway bacaus it ha given to us a great opportun and we must not let it go away .
