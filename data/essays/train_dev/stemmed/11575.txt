thi statement impli a doubl respons for me . inde in my essay i will give sever reason to show that i agre with thi statement but there is also some reason which make me think that older peopl can enjoy life more than young peopl . when we are young we have less resons so we make thing without think of the consequ . for exampl , if we want to act danger , thi is our own decis , we have not a famili to protect . in thi sens , young peopl enjoy life more becaus they have nobodi to worri about . if they desir they can just have fun . we can also say that young peopl are more lead to do extraordinari thing such as leav a famili and go in a place they do not know , just becaus it is a new experi . inde most of the time they do not plan what they will do , they do not spend hour think about the consequ . they just live the present moment . howev what is also true is that old peopl can enjoy life too . inde they do but in a differ way . they are happi with veri littl . for instanc listen the bird sing or stay in their home with their grandchildren . they have a greater matur than the younger one have . so they do know care about detail . they have live a lot of thing and pain . they are abl to see the world with a distanc so they can see what is import or not . thi enabl them to enjoy life . as a conclus what i want to say is that we can not realli say if young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i would say that it depend on the context of our life . it depend also on the experi we had throughout our life .
