well actual i can not say wheter i agre or disagre , becaus it depend on the situat . for exampl when i want to travel without my friend and my famili i would propabl choos a group led by a tour guid . becaus then you are not complet alon and you will see a lot of the countri you are travel to . but on the other side it is sometim realli annoy to be with a group of 20 peopl . you alway have to wait till everybodi is back in the bu and so you wast a lot of time wait for peopl . and of cours you are not as independ as you would be travel alon . becaus the tour guid ha hi programm to do . for exampl i have been to england with my mother in june and we did not want to drive by our own and so we decid to travel with a group . but sometim we realli miss to do the thing we want to do . becaus someday we were in thi realli nice villag but we had just 30minut there bevor the bu left again , but that wa just not enough time to enjoy thi . especi not , when the place you visit after that is absolutli not compar to thi nice villag . so normal when i travel with my parent we do not travel with a group , becaus it is more comfort . and then my father alway prepar veri good so that he take the part of the guid and show us everyth , although thi is sometim more exhaust than travel in a group . becaus my father ha a realli strict timet for the thing he want to see and so we have to get up veri earli and come back to the hotel late in the afternoon . so in my opinion it depend on the situat . normal i would not choos travel by a group , but when you travel alon it is the best way . for exampl i am now in australia and when my languag cours finish i also want to travel around , but i do not want to travel by my own , becaus i think it is comfort to now that you are not alon and will not get lost . so i realli can not say wheter travel by your own or travel by group is better , becaus both kind of travel have their advantag and disadvantag .
