the mind bodi : a peculiar paradigm i think that special in one specif subjcet is better . specialis you can give to your reserch a peculiar prospect and than increas your field of studi . let give us some exampl base on my experi as anthropologist . i think they could clearli illuster what i mean . dure my anthropolog field work in cameoon , west africa , i argu that there were lot of intrest aspect of thi african societi ( for exampl kinship , econom or religi sistem etc . ) . howev i decid to foucu my reserch on witchcraft and sorceri . observ life in a small villag i saw that i colud note phenomena of witchcraf in all social fabric . the occult power wa use a socil and econom levellhood . moreov when i wrote my ba 's thesi i use a specif prospect and a peculiar method of analysi . i use the post-modern prospect on hidden cult of japanes chirstian and i demostr how these hidden cult influenc the modern japanes chistian and other religi movement . i tri to anliz just one aspect of the african or japanes societi and i tri to explain how these particular aspect reflect on whole societi in differ level . i think that have a broad knowledg of may academ subject is not good or useful . a man could not be omnisc - as god - so is uneus tri to accumul mani mani notion about differ argument and topic . thu men , student , professor and so on need to recogn their limit and to work - as better as possibl - on within their field of studi . thi are the reason whi i think that special in one specif subject is the onli way that men could adopt to costruct a brand new paradigm about knowledg .
