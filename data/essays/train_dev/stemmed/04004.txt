nowaday it 's a veri appropri question becaus our life are caratteris by a lot of form of advertis that tri to induc us to buy someth . our economi is in larg part base on thi metod use by industri to show to the world their product . i think that thi big quantiti of pubblic is n't good and i 'm in particular disappoint by watch it on the televis . dure a tv program or a movi peopl must watch a lot of advertis also if they do n't like it and it disturb reali much . to appreci someth on the tv is veri difficult caus of all the pubblic interrupt . i agre with the statement caus in the pubblic everi product seem perfect and is shown like if everybodi need it also if in realiti it is not true . so the pubblic is a disturb and also a sit kind of lie . peopl , in particular children an old peopl , start to think what the pubblic induc them to think and feel the need to have someth that they do n't realli need . for exampl if a child see an advertis of a game a lot of time he start to want that game onli to show that he ha it and becaus mayb he think that he will becam more happi have that game also if he never like game like that one . i think that in the advertis everyth seem good or helpful but we must think if we realli need it and befor make the decis to buy someth we have to compar similar product in order to tri to buy the best product and not the one we heard about in a pubblic . advertis are good to show product and to have an idea of that exist in the world but we must look at them care in order to avoid to take decisiond without think .
