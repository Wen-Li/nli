travel is a good choic to spend weekend and vacat . howev , one is usual face by the decis : `` is it better to make it on my own or within a group led by a tour guid ? '' . apart from the extrem point of view that are either `` individualist '' favor do everyth alon , or `` extrem sociabl '' favor have everyth done in a group ; i believ that the correct decis to thi problem depend on the situat . to clarifi what i mean by thi , let me cite an exampl . suppos that you are plan to go to egypt or greec for instanc to watch the ancient monument and museum there . thi kind of travel is known as cultur tourism . then , it may seem reason in such a case to travel in a group led by a tour guid . after all , be alon may prevent you from make full benefit of the trip . for exampl , you will not be abl to know exactli what the most import histroic site are , and what their histori wa . in such a case , a tour guid will provid you with a valuabl experi ( let 's assum he is a knowledg guy ! ) . without explan from somebodi , you will most probabl be unabl to understand and henc appreci the monument . but doe thi impli that it is `` alway '' better to travel in a group led by a tour guid ? absolut no ! in mani situat , travel alon will provid you with a space of freedom you might need . suppos , you are go to washington d.c. to watch the signific histor site there . sinc the site are realli divers , rang from musuem of scienc and technolog to museum of modern art , it may seem unlik that you can realli enjoy it if you travel in a group . peopl have differ tast , and what the tour guid will probabl do is to divid the time evenli between all the site to cover everyth so that no one will be unsatisfi . the problem as you may infer is that , thi way , in fact , nobodi will be satisfi , sinc everyon will find himself `` forc '' to go to place he almost hate , then spend onli 5 minut or so in place he realli like the most . so fianlli , in make the decis of travel in a group or alon , one should consid the situat ! have an ex ant point of view might not be object !
