i agre with thi statement `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . there are two reason to support . first of all , it will be bore for them to learn onli the fact . if the student just onli learn the fact , they will be satisfi with their knowledg and wo n't tri to think ani more . think is a import process to improv their knowledg . if they just learn the fact , they do n't need to think whi it happen or how it happen . they will just know the answer right away without think . in fact , think is excit . when they learn an idea , they will tri to use it in mani situat . for exampl , when student learn about static electr , they will tri to make electir shock by rub object and find out which object make the most electr . they are think and also enjoy the method . but if they know the fact , they will just chose the right object and done . that is veri bore . secondli , understand idea and concept are veri import . from my experi , i realli think so . when i wa play basketbal in middl school , i just did as the coach said to me dure practic . i did n't realli think about whi are we do thi practic and just did as we were told to do . but as time goe by , our team becam weaker and weaker . we search for the reason . final we found out the reason . everi practic we did had a mean . we were n't just run , we were run as if we are in the game . we were n't just shoot , we were shoot as if there are oppon block . we were just do the fact that the coach said but we should have understand the idea and concept of the practic . after we notic the fact , we start to work hard and we becam the second place in the competit . i wa realli happi and thank the coach for teach us for not tell the answer and made us think by oursev . from thi experi , i learn that understand idea and concept are far more import that learn fact . thi is whi i agre with thi statement .
