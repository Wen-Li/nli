i agre to the statement where i believ most adverstis make product seem much better than they realli are . such statement can be support by my own person experi and my friend 's experi . through media , such as magazin and televis , mani product are advertis . mani of the product seem veri cheap and good in qualiti from the way they are present . one day , i wa watch an advertis channel where they sold a hair remov spray . the advertis show how anyon can remov their hair by spray on their hair and simpli wipe it by a towel . the show also show a person remoivng her hair through wax veri pain , tri to get across the point thi product is better than ani other method to remov hair . strongli convinc by the advertis , i bought the spray and excitingli wait for it arriv . when the product arriv , i tri on the spray immediatli . i wa dissapoint when the spray did not work at all . i kept spray and wipe but my hair never came off . from thi experi , i realiz how advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . anoth exampl that support my opinion is through my friend 's experi . my friend order a cosmet magazin sinc she wa interest in buy some make-up for herself . when she took a look at the cosmet magazin , she wa surpris at herself for not buy all of her cosmet through magazin . the product were much cheapter and seem better than buy at store . she told me how she wa never go to buy cosmet product at sephora or other cosmet store . my friend order a pack of lip stick through the cosmet magazin and she wa busi brag about it to her other friend . howev , when the lip stick arriv , they were so much smaller than they appear in the magazin . the lip stick were onli about 1 inch long . from then on , my friend learn to never order anyth through magazin . from these two experi describ abov , it can seen that most advertis do make product seem much better than they realli are . we should all be causiou of the advertis and look into it care befor buy ani product .
