in the present gener we are awar of learn so mani new thing . so i think it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . there are sever reason to explain the statement . for exampl , if you learn a comput languag skill say like ` c ' languag . the tutor will say about all the content such as pointer , string , array and so on is thi mean that you are a proffesion in ` c ' languag . no , not at all it need lot of practic rather than know the fact . with out gener idea we can do noth with the languag eventhough , by know the fact anoth exampl is , if you take an experi in the chemistri lab eventhough , if you know the fact about the chemic that how they will chang their colour it will not be helpful in answer the question in the practic exam . therefor you should know the concept behind the chemic reaction then onli you can answer the question final , in some compet exam they will ask the reason for whi you are choos certain answer ? so it can be done onli the student who is perfect in the concept rather than know the fact so , the abov all point will conclud that idea and concept are more import than to learn the fact . moreov , by learn the concept it will be more fetch to the student in sever aspect . in some case it play a major role in student career
