the given thesi is highli controversi , especi when we take into consider that the german academ program were recent reform toward that direct . have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject goe hand in hand with an extraordinari wide spread educ which is use in variou differ way in everyday life . knowledg in term of biolog , for exampl , can be easili appli to everyday experi dure a walk in the near forest . question pose by children may be answer appropri and correctli in an enorm amount of field . on the other hand , today 's econom and societ develop of our societi result in an increas differenti concern work task and work skill . it is requir to adapt to these new circumst in a world which is on it way to becom a global villag . in order to cope with thi high-spe develop , it is import to specifi on a veri small aspect of an academ disciplin . in order to bring my point across , i would like to give a short exampl : small knowledg of econom in gener is less ask for in today 's global world than knowledg concern the solar energi market in china . from thi it follow , that i do not agre with the given thesi . at least not with the way it is formul . from my point of view , a good gener educ and knowledg is the basi for more differenti and specifi knowledg in a certain field . wherea the first help in the privat sector of an individu ( for exampl when it come to hi social statu or social prestig ) , the latter is necessari in the public sector , name the field in which the individu is work . it is absolut essenti , to be an expert in that particular field . otherwis , a high-qual perform is not provid . to sum it up , a broad knowledg and a veri special knowledg concern a certain topic should go hand in hand and lead into a compromis .
