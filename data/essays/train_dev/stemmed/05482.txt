i think that is more import for a student to learn the idea instead of learn the fact . there are an enourmo number of fact . all these fact ca n't be learnt by a student becaus if it were true a student spent all hi life onli for learnt someth that not alway is useful for him . the idea are veri import and they help you not onli to understand how someth occur but they help you to understand whi someth occur . for us is more import know how or whi someth occur ? in my opinion i think that know whi is the best . the idea are at the base of ani event and they can be appli to all other fact that we do n't know . if we know the idea on which a phenomenom is base we can also understand other phenomena that we have n't ever been studi . for exampl in the engeni branch i studi the fondament idea that explain mani phenomena like the move of a motor or the way like the current arriv into everi hous but these idea are veri import for mani other cours like the safeti in the home or the electr field caus by the high voltag line . if idid n't understand veri well these idea i must learnt all the other topic and mayb i must take some of those in memori becaus i do n't know the basic idea . final i prefer idea becaus are less difficult than the whole concept . the concept can be recogn step by step start from the idea and make some logic passeg that bring us to the correct conclus that explain veri well the fact .
