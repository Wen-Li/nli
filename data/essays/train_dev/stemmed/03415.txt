i whole heartedli agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . advertis are the sourc for the compani to reach the custom and sell their product . advertis play an import role in form an opinion about ani product . if the advertis is convinc enough , the custom will go and enquir about the product or will tri the product . so , to leav a mark on the custom 's mind , the advertis is made veri catchi and most of the time the advertis becom veri mislead . the product are advertis to have so mani featur but when you actual see the product or use it , you come to know the real featur . when you see an advertis , you tend to get fascin by the featur mention in the advertis but when you actual see the product , it lead to disappoint . but the advertis actual help the compani to bring custom to their product . .. for exampl , i read in a newspap about a life time free credit card from a lead bank and i actual sign all the document to get one . i got my credit card but later i came to know that some money wa deduct from my account as the charg for a magazin subscript . when i ask the offic of the bank , he said it come as a packag with the card . that instanc drove me to frustrat . anoth instanc is when i bought a shirt of a top brand . the compani advertis the shirt as wrinkl free but when i actual wash the shirt , it wa just a normal shrt with lot of wrinkl on it . instanc like these happen mani time . advertis are mostli mislead but these at least help to bring custom to the shop or to sell the product . advertis is a way by which the compani can reach the custom , tell the custom about the product and final make their market . so , the advertis should tell onli the real and true qualiti of the product . the mislead advertis have led to the declin in the number of peopl watch or pay attent to the advertis . in thi way , the advertis will lose their charm and import soon .
