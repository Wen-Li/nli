in the context of constant competit between product and trademark , what make them differ ? is it the product , the advertis or the trademark ? we 'll see that `` fals '' advertis is necessari for a compani and is control by the rule od competit . at last , we 'll see that advertis is n't the product underneath but much more a identifi suggest for custum . first , a compani that launch a product can not possibl find a larg scale of custum without promot it . therefor , a compani need advertis to exist or to continu exist . with the law of competit , the advertis is in a way self-control . as we saw last week with `` l'oreal '' , a compani can not say anyth in an advertis . they have to be abl to proov their assert in an advertis campaign otherwis other compani will sue it for a lack of accuraci that dammag the market competit . second , the compani usual `` lie '' about their product becaus they wo n't tell you immediatli the side effect or problem you might encout with the use of the product . advertis will sell you the good effect of the product . but , i do not think the real matter is the product underneath . i mean more and more advertis do not sell you a product directli but an underground , an atmospher or a celebr . in a way , advertis are here to held you identifi a trademark , the one you want to look like or lifestyl you want . and , a advertis campaign is more like a dream maker , suggest that you need the product if you want to achiev a certain lifestyl or look like a celebr but it did n't tell you that you will achiev it . advertis just show you the way becaus : `` you worth it '' and `` just do it '' . to finish , advertis might lie on a product becaus they onli show the good side of the product but they ca n't be exager and the real challeng of a advertis is n't to sell you a product but to keep you for life .
