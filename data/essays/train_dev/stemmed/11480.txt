i disagre with the statement say `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use , '' bacuas it is unrealist . car are essenti item for peopl to live with all over the world today , and it is imposs that peopl invent someth substitut to car . in japan , for exampl , peopl can get around onli by puclic transport onli in the major citi , such as tokyo or osaka . anywher outsid of them can not function without car which transfer good and peopl from and to the place . my famili doe not own a car , howev , thi is becaus we live in the tokyo area where train come everi three minut . thi sotuat is expeptin compar to other citi in the world , and peopl still have car in tokyo to step out of thi area . in america , the situat of public transport is even wors . sinc america is such a huge countri where the popul is scatter , peopl have to drive wherev they go . it is true to almost all the major citi , such as lo angel or wahington d.c. onli new yorker can afford not to have car . in most of the part in the coutri , peopl can not even go shop or school without car . i onc live in the san francisco bay area , which is known for it great public transport repres by bart , yet i still wish to have a car in order to go out safe at night . bart doe not run as late and frequesnt as subway in tokyo , therefor peopl need car anyway even in the citi in the state . there is no plan to expand public transport servic either . even if so , it is not realist to accomplish it in twenti year . thi provid the vision that the world remain to need as mani car as it doe today . there is noth that can caus declin of car in number . moreov , more and more countri are develop it ecomoni and industri nowaday . china is a good exampl of a quickli develop countri . when the nation develop , there will be more popul and movement of peopl and good , which requir the cheapest mean of transport ; car . more develop counti will need car for it develop , and peopl who have never the need for environment consciou car technolog will be in greater need in the futur , howev , the need for car itself will not declin .
