i agre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . now i am work for a japanes compani in japan and usual the holiday i can take is realli shorter than other contri . to travel effici , travel in agroup with a guid is the best way . i do n't need to spend mani time to find a restur and to worri about the lose way . and the other good point is that travel in a group , i can meet mani peopl who i can share the atmosper of the place . i will explaiin more detail as follow . the first reason is that travel in agroup with a tour guid help me to travel effeci . as i mention befor , i can not take a long holiday as a usual japanes compani . therefor , i do n't have enough time to stay the same place . to visit mani place in the short term , i need a guid to help me to go around . in addit , i do n't so worri about emerg situat such as lose way , traffic jam , and train delay becaus a tour guid usual know how to handl the situat . the second reason is that i can share the impress of the trip with group member and exchang our opinion . even though travel alon can make more free time , i would like to share the atmospher of the place with other . for exsampl . i will go to a restur dure the trip . if i eat alon , i can not enjoy the meal . i will miss someon who can talk to me . consequ , i agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i can travel mani place dure my short holiday if a guid lead me . moreov , i can share how i feel in the place with other peopl .
