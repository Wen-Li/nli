i agre with the statement as i think there have occur variou societ chang dure the last decad which have influenc the attitud toward community-help in gener and especi for young peopl . in my point of view an essenti step is taken in the earli childhood . influenc by the fact that more and more parent are work , even mother return to work earlier than year ago , children have to occupi themselv also in young age . for sure , children choos activ which occur attract and interest for them . thi point lead to a further factor which influenc the decreas in community-help of young peopl . the new inform technolog , for instanc internet , computer-gam , ... appear more attract and challeng to young peopl compar to community-help . also influenc by the fact that mostli both parent are work , they do not have time to help in commun . consequ children do not have anybodi to look up and follow . further i believ that young peopl do not want to spend too much time for activ in commun , as they are much more interest in a variat of differ thing and want to explor the world and it divers . thi is support by nation and intern polici which is present attract the advantag of go abroad , make self-experi in other countri and cultur , learn foreign-languag while stay in a countri where thi languag is spoken , and so on . further think on my own experi in my home countri , univers and colleg are more and more centralis . therefor young peopl have to leav their home-villag pretti soon after finish highschool if they want to attend higher educ . consequ peopl are at least local separ from their commun . to sum up , i regret that community-help is decreas , howev i can see reason lead to thi develop . and deep in my heard i hope that young peopl reflect on thi develop and put more emphas on communtiy-help in futur .
