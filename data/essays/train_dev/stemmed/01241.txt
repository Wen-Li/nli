nowaday , we can see a lot of car in all street of the world in spite of the growth of th price of the oil . i think it wo n't chang in twenti year . i think that peopl want to be more and more indeped and the car is one of the sign of thi independ becaus you can go where you want when you want , you just have to pay the oil . the need of move is veri import for the man and peopl prefer take their car instead of the bu for exempl . and it 's whi i think car will not disappear with the time , but the oil , will do . it 's a big ecolog problem becaus oil pollut a lot the ozon , and we must find new way of car energi in the futur like alcohol , it 's alreadi done in some countri like brazil for exempl . it is also a polit conflict , as i said after , poorest countri than franc , like brazil , had alreadi adopt new energi but for richest countri , it 's a way of earn money becaus there are a lot of tax on the oil . the societi of consomm and benefit we live in is also a preponder factor , becaus peopl are attract to buy more and more , they are touch by the advertis done by all manufactur , and if you close car manufactur , it will have big consequ on the market , and creat unemploy . but by the same way , if you reduc the use of the car , you must creat new underground structur so it will creat temporari worker which can be helpful for the unemploy of peopl who are not qualifi for anoth job . howev , a thing that we must know is that for the 2006 year , the statist show that the sale of car have dicreas for a lot of big compani like renault . to conclud , it is veri difficult to predict the futur of the car market , but from my point of view , i can not live whithout my car , i am keen on drive . so i hope car will not disappear . ..
