i certianli , disagre with the statement that it is import for student to understand idea and concept than learn fact , as we know that we can not creat a wall without a base . therefor learn the concept and theori behind it is veri import . concept will automat show the fact in the futur . for instanc , if i want to learn a new languag then i will first learn alphabet . i will learn them to pronunc and even to write . pronuc and write letter will introduc me the fact of the languag . how hard it is to learn ? and how easi it is ? implement the idea practic will show you the fact and result . first we will learn what color will be produc when mix it with the other color . for instanc , we will learn in book yellow plu blue turn green . now , in order to learn the fact of thi idea we will do it practic and we will find it true . thi is how it is import to have an idea befor implement it . after learn principl and theori from book and expertis , we find them in field whether they were true or not . we learn fact through experi and it keep chang . howev , concept doe n't chang . therefor , it is import for student to learn fundament skill and basic then start learn fact .
