i agre to the statement that most of the advertis make product look better than they realli are . first and the import thing we should know is that the advertis which is be made on a product highlight onli the advantag not the disadvnatag . so most of them go for the product by see the attract ad and then feel bad about it later . while buy a product first we should read the review of the product and gor for it or ask a colleagu or a friend who bought it . we should make sure about the product befor you buy . i like to discuss one exampl which i face . i saw an ad in my telivis about the face tone cream . i got attract to it by the way they present in the ad and result given by some user . then i order the product for $ 50 after some day by watch the ad daili . then when i reciev i saw a small tube which is my littl finger size . i got shock to see it . then i call the custom servic and they said the bigger tube cost $ 75 . so i end up make a note in my mind that no more order by see ad . one more exampl i like to discuss is about my friend daughter . the cute littl girl saw in the cartoonnetwork an ad and start ask her mother about the toy . that toy can be puchs onli through onlin ar by phone . so my friend orderd the toy . when they receiv it the girl start cri that it not the toy she saw . later they found from other famili that the same thing happen to them also . so i like to say that there should be a law to make sure that the info in the ad befor advertis a product is everyth true and aslo they should make sure that they advertis the disadvantag also .
