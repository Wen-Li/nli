the question whether is it more import to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in just one specif subject is not easi to answer . person , i am the opinion that a broad knowledg is worth more than a narrow but special knowledg . howev , the busi world call for specialist all the time . back in the past allround were highli appreci but nowaday there are just a few left . well , thi doe not appli in gener but at least to the busi i know , the law busi . as a lawyer it is necessari to be special to ensur one achiev the best solut for the client . but still , i believ that broad knowledg open new horizon . now i am not onli refer to busi but also to privat life . have knowledg in variou area also mean to have more inform . inform one can use to make up one 's mind and to see thing in a total new perspect . thi actual is whi i believ broad knowledg is worth so much . onli with thi knowledg it is possibl to understand differ cultur , to enjoy foreign music , art or simpli to have an interestin talk with the neighbor who come from a differ countri . with these new possibl a total new world is offer to the one that are open to inform on differ subject . and get back to busi : who doe realli want to talk to a lawyer who onli understand the law but not the real problem ? i doe not . therefor i am the opinion that broad knowledg is more import to to be special on just one subject . although , it is not easi to obtain knowledg in differ field , if one ha a full-tim job , it is worth to spend the spare-tim to gather inform on other topic and subject , provid one is interest in them . summar i can say , that i tri not to becom to special too earli and to obtain a broad knowledg . i think it is veri import .
