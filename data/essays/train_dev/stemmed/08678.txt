the issu at hand is , whether there are more car in use in twenti year than there are today or not . thi issu is veri import becaus of the global environment pollut . i belief , that there will be much more car in use in twenti year than there are today . there are sever reason whi i state thi mean . at first , almost nobodi who actual ha a car will sell hi or her car or reduc the number of car or will chang gener on the public traffic . even if the car is crash , peopl normal make it repar or buy a new one . the reason for thi behavour is verz simpl : peopl are comfort . use the car is the most comfort way to move . furthermor , china and india ( emerg market countri ) are countri with a huge citizenship . actual , in these countri , there are not a lot of car becaus most of the peopl live there have not enough money to purchas car . these countri are emerg market countri , i.e. the economi in these countri will increas enorm . therefor , the peopl will get richer and in some year , a huge number of indian and chines peopl will have the abil to purchas car . even if a lot of european and american chang their behavour and get more sensibl to the environment problem aris out from the individu traffic and sell their car or will not pruchas new one , the number of car will increas in the bext year . a third reason is the world economi . the product of car is an import economi subject with al lot of employe . futhermor , also the gaz industri is import . these two industri togeth will show that the number of car will not decreas beacaus of their busi interest . they will also take influenc on the polit that they can sell their car and their gay cheapli ( e.g. no high tax on these product ) . as argu , i believ , that there will be more car in use in twenti year than today . but i am also sure , that the car will pollut the environ in twenti year not as much as today . in cinclus , in twenti year there will be more car in use than there are today , becaus of peopl behavour , the peopl in the emerg market and the car and gaz industri .
