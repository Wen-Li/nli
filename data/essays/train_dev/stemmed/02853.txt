a veri common question pose by student revolv around what it is better , either have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject or special in one specif subject ? ground can be held to support ani of the two possibl answer . in fact , both have advantag and disadvantag , but as far as i am concern , to special in a singl field seem to be the right answer . i will give three reason to back up my choic . first af all , it seem undeni that nowaday the labor market is demand for veri young and capabl employe , usual alreadi hold a master 's degre . neither thi young peopl nor the educ system can disregard thi fact , and the univers must encourag their student to special and focu specif on certain and well-defin subject . moreov , we have to put special emphasi in the fact that recent psycholog research are show that acquir expertis on a specif field of knowledg , is a way for peopl to feel fulli happi with themselv . a third point refer to the fact that studi a subject serious and at great length take a great deal of time , and make it veri difficult to deep in ani other subject . we do not want our student to becom second-r proffession in their career . to sum up , given the current expect on the entrepreneur ' part and thu , in the labor market , it is import for societi in gener and for academia in particular face up to realiti and encourag the student to follow the right direct : special . nevertheless , argument hold the other way round , that is , the import of acquir a broad knowledg of mani academ subject can not be complet swept asid either . in my book , well-educ peopl need to have a veri high level of acquaint of a certain field ( law , scienc , literatur , etc. ) , but at the same time , it is veri satisfactori to devot some time to differ activ ( cultur activ , sport , and so forth and so on ) .
