if i can choos the answer whether i agre or disagre with that the best way is in a groop led by tour guid . i definetli choos the answer that i disaggre with the statment . i would not like travel by a tour guid . folow i will take specif reason whi i dislik trabel by tour guid . first , there is great restrict of time if he or she travel in group by a tour guid . in my case , now i work veri hard in daytim and i might be order accid by the boss to work horiday . so as is often to the case with travel is in a grop by a tour guid , when to travel and where to trabel is alreadi detamin and is not avail for me . therefor , i prefer to trabel alon or with few friend by coordin easi to suit my own work time . second reason i dislik travel by a tour guid is that guid can decreas opportun to commun peopl in the destin by use foregin languag . usual , a tour guid can some foregin languag and in travel , a guid translat fore languag of destin and we do not have to use foreign languag . that is nonsens for me becaus i want to studi foreign langag especi in my travel . i beleiv that travel alon , without tour guid is good for improv my speak foregin langrag . last , if i travel abroad alon without a tour guid , i can discov someth in my travel with my oun effort . that is presur for me ! all abov of that , i prefer travel alon or with few friend to travel in a group by a tour guid . of cours , there are some advantag of travel in a group . for exampl , the price of travel tend to be lower and more econom if we choos travel in a group . but , as i take all abov of that. , in my opinion , advatntag of travel alon withotut guid is much greater than these of travel in a group led by a tour guid .
