is our young gener egoist ? the question is alway the same , i think . befor i will wrote my answer to thi statement , i will ask : had parent the same mean about the young gener in the 1950 ? i think ye . it is not the time , which make such thing . it is the gener , which make , or here which not make , thing in their commun . it wa so and it will be in futur . the young gener is not egoist , it is their lifestyl . if somebodi is young , he or she have to meet new peopl and make new experi . they do n't want to stay at home or in their villag . they have to go in the world to see new thing . it is import and so they ca n't help their commun , their first and right choic is to help themselv . the right choic i think . but when the young peopl come back , in their villag or in their famili , they want to help . in my environ , there is a friendli partnership between the old and young peopl in my small villag . almost all peopl in my villag go to the church on sunday . it is a nice day for everybodi and i do n't want to miss it . latest survey show the increas of famili valu in the last ten year . for most peopl the famili is holi . they defeat them against all . in a communitiy there is the same situat . either they fight against peopl who want to hurt somebodi in the communitiy or they will stand togeth if somebodi is ill . i do n't know how is the situat in south asia , for exampl , but in my environ the world in complet . here is thi statement completli wrong and everybodi around me would agre . the sport club , the church club and everi other singl club in my villag have enough peopl to help . the statement is in my eye onli a typic prejudic of old peopl .
