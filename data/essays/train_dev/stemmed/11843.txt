i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to unterstand idea and concept rather than just learn fact . i believ thi , becaus student will gain a higher level of educ that they need in their job and they will also have a higher motiv to learn . the first point is that i think student should understand academ model , idea and concept in order gain a higher educ level . when understand a theoret model , a student will be abl to appli it to the real world even if the real world doe not exactli match the theori and it assumpt and implic . for exampl , when just memor and recal fact , a student might not be abl to make a proper decis in the real world becaus some assumpt or condit have chang sinc the fact were learn . thi way , a student will not be abl to custom hi decis to the new situat when use her knowledg . so , a student who understand the theori and get react to new develop can achiev by far more in her job , which is ulitm the goal of educ , name to prepar for the work anoth good reason for understand idea and concept is that student will most like have a higher motiv to learn and therefor learn more . in contrast to memor fact and recal them , understand an idea is less bore than a process of memor , which is repeat over and over again . when i wa in school i did not like to just learn fact , and propabl everybodi els i knew did not like it , we all learn far more thing when understand a theori , which support my point here . to sum up , it is far more import to understand the idea and concept of the matier that should be leard , rather than just fact . the reason are the higher level of educ with a significantli higher chanc to suce in work and the better motiv of student which will yield to more knowledg .
