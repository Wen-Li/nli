most product , regardless of their brand name , depend on advertis as a main mean of promot . the question is : are these product as good as they seem ? some of those product have been in market , and peopl have been consum them for long now . these product have been abl to maintain their qualiti and thu their name ha surviv until these day . we still even repeat their brand name , which prove that qualiti ha outdid ani role of advertis on the other hand , some new product have emerg , and manufactur have tri their best to draw a resembl between differ product . nowaday , if you are watch a commerci on tv , you can hardli notic the differ between product . they look the same , the way the product is introduc would also sound familiar to you . for exampl , in their commerci , they depend on show the best of thi product by get it featur by a good look model ! onc the audienc view the commerci , he / she would temptingli go and tri out the product . but the problem that we are face nowaday is that some product are not as good as they seem . tv , newspap , comput , and other mean have facilit some way to make all of these product look just perfect ! so peopl would go , buy or tri some of these product , and later get disappoint by the result or the outcom . in my own opinion , i think that there should be certain committe to be held respons for the qualiti of ani product , especi when it come to advertis . they should make sure that the qualiti of product would look as real as it seem ! technolog ha a major role in make these product look better , but definit it should not determin our judgment , insult our intellig , or deceiv our eye !
