well , i have sever reason to believ that the amont of car is even gonna increas . first reason for it 's how import car are for us nowaday . i think car have realli got in our way if life , ( as tv did at it time or cell phone just did ) , modif deepli transport and the way human are move , so i realli wonder what could suppli car . there are even famili who have two or three ! i think the end of all thi will be one car per person , mayb smaller , but increas in amont in the citi , never decreas . .. anoth fact that it 's realli import to take into account is the price of car . new market , as the assian one , are offer good car with lower and lower price . to have a car is not anymor someth that show luxur , everi famili can realli have at least one , and if price keep go down , peopl are gonna bye more , and that onc more mean more car in the futur . polici are also import . it 's true that , some citi have start to restrict the amont of car allow to go by the citi , but i do n't think they are enought nor good . there is not a real restrinct for car in citi , and in my opinion , non mayor would forbid them serious becaus peopl woul 'd vote him anymor , to forbid thing is never realli wellcom . .. final , i do n't thing the lack of fuel will be a problem . mayb , there will arriv a day where the fuel will be realli expens , right , but that 's not mean that there will be less car drive in our citi . i guess there will some other energi which will sustitut the fuel , so what will mayb chang would be the way in which our car are work , but not car themself . besid , all expert say ( if they are not lie ) , that there is still fuel enough for sixti year over . so in twenti year , car are gonna keep be the main way to move for human , and there will be even more , from my point of view . i would love to think the opposit ( becaus i do not like car at all ) , but i 'm reral pesimist in thi field .
