a success person is a person who succe in probabl everyth life throw at him . some peopl say that success peopl are limit to do what they alreadi know how to do best . as for me , i think a success person is one who is not afraid to take risk and and tri new thing . as mention abov , a success person is one who succe in life , and that ca n't be prove unless that person tri new thing andtak the risk , otherwis , if that person is afraid to take risk , then what 's the point of hi success ? mean while some peopl say that a success person is the one who doe onli what he doe best . there i strongli disagre , becaus for a person to be success , he/sh should take risk and tri new thing even if he/sh fail at complet the challeng he/sh is face . that person -- in my point of view -- is a success person ; not the person who succe in everi thing he doe , but the one who take new risk , face new challeng , tri everyth in life and face the concequ ; which may be tough but in the end they will be reward in everi thinkabl way . on the other hand a failur would be the person who is afraid to tri new thing , afraid to take new risk , and afraid to face new challeng . a failur is the person who think he is success but is actual limit to thing he/sh think he/sh doe best . in conclus , poeopl who succeed in life are niether afraid , nor meant to be afraid of take risk and face challeng and so on . while those who fail are the one who think that they are success but do n't tri new thing and do n't take risk in life . those are the true failur .
