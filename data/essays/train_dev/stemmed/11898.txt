what make a person success ? is it the amount of money they make , the car they bought with it , or the hous they live in ? i believ that success is more than just have a lot of money . to be a success individu a person ha to go through mani obstacl without stope , and ha to have a clear vision of the futur . we may find someon that is realli good in a certain task . but success is not just be good at someth . i believ that it mean to be the best at it . in the present time peopl go through life tri to grasp anyth they can get . there 's no such thing as easi money . becaus of the dificulti of get a job , pay bill , and have enough money to pay for your child 's $ 30,000 per year educ , mani peopl have found themselv absorb by life 's preassur . they stope think about the futur and have focu in the present . i believ peopl have becom conformist and mani mediocr . they are tire of work so hard and not improov , so when they final find someth that 's ok , they 'll stay with it becaus they are too afraid of loos the littl someth they 've got . most human do n't feel confort in an unknown environ . thi make it hard for these peopl to take a risk and move toward the unexplor . they do n't care if it 'll bring someth better . the fear of chang disabl them to becom better . so a success person is not the one that stay with what he or she alreadi know how to do well , but rather that other person who take the risk and search for self improov . it is not enough to have one goal in life . what are you suppos to do when you acomplish it ? are you done ? is there no other reason for you to keep on live ? i truellli think that a success person will alway have someth more to acomplish . mive from one object to the next will make you go higher than be passiv and stay in the secur zone .
