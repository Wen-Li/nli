in my opinion , in twenti year , it is more like to find a larger number of car on road than we see today . car which were a luxuri a few decad back , have becom more of a necess today . as more and more job oppurtunii are be made avail to the peopl , standard of live are definit on a rise . thi is the case , special in the develop nation , as the economi are grow . with more money , more number of peopl would be abl to afford car and thu , be use them . also , most of the famili which are financi well off , have more than one car for the famili . typic , each member of the famili own a car of hi own , as soon as he or she can drive one . thi trend seem to be catch up , late . moreov , with the rise in popul , we need more and more land to live on . thi ha result in reclaim area , which were not in use befor . thu citi a becom bigger and bigger , with their suburb get densli popul . as peopl prefer to stay in the suburb , for reason like , cheaper resours , more area etc. , most of the major offic are still found in the main citi . thi requir , peopl to commut long distanc . travel by public transport is not an idea a lot of peopl consid , when they have a car at home . thu , the use of car is increas further . with advanc technolog , mani car compani are come with cheaper and more afford model of car . such car , sinc they need lesser maintan , have contribut to the increas number of car that we see on the road today . atleast for the next decad or two , thi seem to be a possibl trend . also , traffic problem have been often associ with the increas in the number of car on the road . to avoid thi , mani compani have also come up with two-seat model . these car which are small , make manoev in the crowd street a littl easier . in the year to come , we can definit expect to see a lot more of these car , flood the street . thu , in the next twenti year , the number of car in use , are most like be higher than what it is today . it is a bad news , consid the fuel shortag that is expect in the veri near futur and not to forget the pollut that so much traffic would eventu caus . we need to be prepar to handl it or the govern need introduc law to control it effect , befor it too late .
