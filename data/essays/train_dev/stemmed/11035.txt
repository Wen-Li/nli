i agre with thi sentenc . the most import thing for a student is to understand how and whi event happen respect to the singular fact . in other word , i think that student have to learn a method of work to analys fact and phenomena . thi is also the highest challeng for a teacher . for exampl , in molecular biolog is more import to understand the sens of a step in a protocol respect to the concentr of each reagent in the same step . the concentr of the reagent is written , it more import to know whi you have to use that reagent . when a student ha got a method ow work , presum he/sh ha a clear view of his/her work . the idea and concept are someth you will never forget . they give you style of work , in a logic manner . instead the fact are suitabl to be forgotten . for exampl , i have forgotten a lot of specif date of civil war in itali dure the centuri , but i know quit well the entir stori . is not import the singl fact , but the gener structur of the subject . i 'm a biologist . when i do an experi , i ask to myself : `` did i prepar the good condit to obtain somethig interest ? '' littl thing mean a lot : temperetur , steril , comfort posit to handl my instrument . thi is the first step of a method of work . then a scientist must have clear the reason of everi step of the experi . even though mistak are alway possibl , if one ha a good method of work , clear idea and concept in it mind , he/sh could discov soon the error .
