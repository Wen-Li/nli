the prase quot `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' is a factor that lot of adult think may be true . but , i total disagre to thi . youth of today is veri enthusiast of their given respons , there job & their concern regard the work that they need to put forth . in thi fast pace life of today , with sever competit that come along from everi corner of there life , thi make it impos for the youth to dedic much time toward there commun or to say ani social caus they wanna do . they are so engulf into the work , they alreadi have veri less time to just be by themself . well one may consid that these are the reason for a youth to not do the helpag requir . but , i would like to say that inspit of the hardlif they have develop these youth never forget where they are & what they stand for . mani youth take time out of there busi schedul to dedic time for the commun they live in . these youth have actuali even start make there voic be heard . for exampl , the recent medic quota that the govern had propos for the beneficieri of the so call lower class of the commun at the expens of merit wa greatli put forward by the medic student . not becaus they did not want the uplift of the commun , that wa social bias by are ansestor , but for the the fact that they just want these seat to be given to the more deserv student who may be in a veri econom challeng & brilliant student . today youth are more about gener develop than a develop in a particullar area . they just love experi in life . the youth of today ha gone ahead of voic their opinion , to stand for themself in the purest of all the heart that is need . inspit of the on go corrupt that eat our nation from everi corner they stant to erad them for the better futur . there live in the fast-lan shown that they want to be quick in the decis make to solv problem . today youth is about practic approach toward life that theorit approach . so , accord to me today the youth is there & they are give enough time to the commun for a better futur . they will alway be there .
