i realli agre with thi topic . when i see the advertis , i becom to want it or eat it or drink it . i have a experi about it . when i wa watch tv , i saw the commerci about `` taco-bel '' . i had never eatten it . it seem realli good . then after school , i ask my host mother to take me there becaus i serious want to eat it . then we went there . and i order it . i wa veri surpris when it came . it wa just like my finger size . when i watch the commerci it wa much bigger than real . and it wa warm , not hot . i alway becom to want it when i see the advertis . so i wa glad it wa not like machin . becaus it wa not so much expens . sometim i realli want to get someth expens when i see the advertis . but i can stop feel that i want it . i think becaus i miss the `` taco-bel '' 's meal . as we can see there are mani advertis in the world . i do n't think it is good to make priduct seem much better than they realli are . it is kind of trickster . it is kind of illeg thing !! howev if i becam someon who wa sell someth , i would have the advertis . and i would say someth which make product seem much better than they realli are . so everyon dose it . i think it is like lace , and someon who male gppd advertis would win that lace . we have to search what it realli is form hid in advertis . it is hard becaus everi advertis hide the truth . we have to think about it deepli befor we get it . but i alway becom to want it . i would like to chang it .
