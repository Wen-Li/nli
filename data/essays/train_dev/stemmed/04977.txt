i support the idea that most advertis give wrong inform to make product look better by three way . firstli , compani use mani pictur which is not about the product . custom notic the advertis by the pictur which is not about the product . it mean that custom give first impress by someth which is not the product , and then they misunderstand that thi first impress is about the product . thu , advertis give wrong inform for custom . secondli , compani use mani techniqu to stand the product out . for exampl , a silver watch stand out in black backglound , and it make the product veri cool . howev , when the watch is use , most of background color is skin color . in thi color background , a silver watch stand out less than in the black background . thi kind of techniqu is often use for advertis . thirdli , compani use word which make the product veri good . they often use the word , such as new , cheep , and good , but these word do not describ the import characterist of product . for instanc , a cheeper comput alway ha less perform , such as amount of herd disk . howev , compani tri to hide thi fact by use the word cheep becaus the word cheep attract custom . in other word , they tri to give wrong inform for custom . to conclud , most advertis tend how to sell more instead of how to inform the good aspect of the product . the main purpos of compani is make more money , so the custom have to understand that most inform from advertis includ lie and be clever .
