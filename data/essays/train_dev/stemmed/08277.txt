nowaday , the compit between the compani becom more and more serios . everi compani want to find the best way to reach the custom . one of the best way to reach them is the advertis . in my openion , even though the advertis is import to sell the product and to let the consum know about it , i believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . if we take loos wieght as an exampl . everi day you will see diffrenet advertis about the diet food or about kind of exercis or even open new gym . you can see thi advertis almost everywher . in the street , tv , and movi . .. et . howev , if thi product like they say it is the fastest and the easiest way to loss wieght so whi there are more and more product about loos wieght ? and whi the fat peopl are increas everyday ? some of thi advertis are not honest . they present a person as an exampl in the advertis about how is the product is use . howev , in the real life there is no relat between the product and thi person , and he is just an actor . for exampl , my friend ha a soft skin sinc she wa child ; howev , mani cream compani tri to convinc her to show in thier advertis and say her soft skin come from thi product . in addit , the advertis use a famous person and how he use the product and again in the real life meyb you will find that thefamous person did not tri the product befor . in short , the compani in order to sell thier product or serves , they have tri whatev they can to sell thi product . therefor , i realli think mani advertis do not reflect the realiti , and there is a differ between the advertis and the realiti .
