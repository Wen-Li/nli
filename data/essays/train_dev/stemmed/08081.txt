over the last centuri , advertis ha becom one of the most develop and i ; portant activ in humankind . it suuround us everywher today : on televis of cours , in the street , in the subway , on our car . .. we can not avoid it . some may say that : `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' . do they ? is advertis that simpl ? do they not take into account the risk it creat when the custom will be disappoint ? first of all , the question seem simpl , of cours they do , they sure will not make their product seem wors . they are paid to sell someth to peopl who did not even want to buy it in the first place , who did not even need it sometim . they must creat a need in custom ' mind and a will to buy precis that product . how could they do that without make their product look good , even better than they are , to kind of sell dream to peopl . it is not what they do it for but in the end they kind of give hope to peopl , like when one see an advertis who would make one believ that the product it defend is exactli what one ha hope to find dure all these year , or tht it is so much better that all it competit . that is whi in all soap spot , the laundri is whiter and smoother than ever or in all shampoo spot , the actress ' hair shine more than ever . howev , is it alway like that ? do not advertis fear peopl to stop buy a product becaus they were deceiv by the differ with the ad ? actual , even if it is not to be more honest with peopl , some advertis use other techniqu to sell their product . they can choos to critic their competit in order to make their product look better by comparison . it is what is importat in the end that the buyer chooss your product over the other . it wa use by coca cola in a spot in which a littl girl show her deceiv with thw voic of a godfath when she is given a pepsi cola and not the coca cola she order . advertis could also use revers psycholog , mayb to play with peopl curios , like the campaign use do not go and see that movi , it is bad for instanc . to conclud , i would say that wherea other techniqu exist , most advertis make product seem better than they realli are . nowaday , eventhough peopl know all they see in advertis is not true , they fall for it anyway and that is how tha consumpt societi got thi far .
