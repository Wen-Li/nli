i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the purpos of the adverstis is to convinc peopl to buy the product in a shot time . in the modern world there are so mani messag tri to catch the attent of the peopl that reach thi goal is not easi . the advertis ha to be realli effect in order to be read and to drive the purchais behavior . overst the function of the product can be a mean to reach thi goal . if we think to some advertis and to the relat product it 's easi to find the differ between the pictur and the descriptin of the product and the product itself . that mean that we are awar of the `` overst techinqu '' use by the advertis and that we do n't fulli believ in the messag that they convey . i never expect the kitchen 's clean soap to clean my kitchen as they do in the advertis ! and i never expect the breakfast 's biscuit to have the perfect shape they are show on everi paper page an dure everi commercia ! we are all use to adopt a certain `` discount ratio '' while evalu the advertis messag . the difficult think for advertis is to balanc the realiti with the overstat in their advertis becaus if the messag are too distant from the realiti the risk is loos the client after the first tri of the product .
