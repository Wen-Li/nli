some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reach death . therefor , life doe n't onli end when one get old . peopl usual think that old peopl are bore and lifeless becaus of their weak and lack of physic action . howev , older peopl tend to develop their mental intelig and imagin . tha't whi most of the philosoph and mathematician reach a peak a their carreer when they are old . as a consequ , they do enjoy life by use their mental power in order to succeed in differ field , or by writ and think about life in gener . but do young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ? i person do not think it is the case . young peopl tend to look at life in a more materi way , play in park , have a girlfriend , practis sport , therefor , they do not appreci the deep mean of whi they are live . it is mainli due to the lack of cultur and experi . by grow up they will develop their sens of observ thing and therefor , trulli appreci the mean of the life they are live . i saw onc a film by a canadian director ( deni arcand ) name `` the barbar invas '' that talk about all of the barbar invas that come to meet us in life . the main caract , an old man , look past hi life : the differ book he read , the differ women he slept with . . therefor , becom furiou of not be abl to enjoy the thing he use to do when he wa young , he final decid to commit suicid . thi if a good exampl to show that there are old peopl that do not enjoy themselv , and to support the idea that the peak of a lifetim is when be young . i think that everi person can enjoy life to the fullest , whether young or old , by do the thing he enjoy do the most . that is when he can reach a mental satisfact , by dedic himself to the true mean of life that is to enjoy life .
