i total agre with the statement that nowaday young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . they pay littl attent to the need of their commun , act as if they were not involv . i think there are three main reason which explain thi opportunist behaviour . first , the govern and the school do not promot enough the import of help the commun . i know onli few school which make the social servic as part of their curricula . i think that as soon as possibl peopl must learn that the commun servic is a civil duti . we all belong to the same societi , and therefor we must share the task . that is whi school and univers should consid the comun servic as a prerequisit to be admit , and also should induc their student to do it dure the accadem year . the second reason whi young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun is that they do not have time . the modern societi is mostli base on some valu which do not includ the commun servic . the main purpos is to make profit which mean that the main valu is money . nowaday the competit is radic increas and therefor the effici is becom crucial . the sooner you are graduat , the sooner you start to work , the sooner you get promot , the sooner you make more profit . from thi point view , it is obviou that young peopl see the commun servic as a wast of time . that is whi , in order to resolv the problem , the way of think should chang . unfortun i think that thi will never happen . the global economi promot by most of the govern inevit lead young peopl to act in an opportunist way . the onli chanc they have no to be left out is to be effici . effici do not leav time for help the commun .
