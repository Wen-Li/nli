who doe n't know advertis for for sport articl , like nike or adida or for car , like the new merced or simpli for food , like milk ? in these advertis the product are look alway good or are n't they ? so the question what i want to discuss now is , if the advertis make product seem much better , than they realli are . on the one hand i think that the product that are advertis are veri , veri bad , becaus it is often shown onli the whole articl and in most of the case never the detail . you onli have to look at the case of food , becaus there are often pesticid found , when thi food get test in labor . i think everybodi can rememb the chocol chao at the big supermarket hofer in austria . also the advertis of car look alway superb , but in realiti there are so mani failur , as i have seen on the car of my father . with thi car we alway had problem , becaus the electr wa not well work . as a result of these failur there will also be danger for human be affect , from the bad technic , as well as from the underaverag bad food . but on the other hand i think , that the product , which are shown in an advertis are realli as good as they seem , becaus behind thi product it is veri often a lot of innov . who doe n't know the nike air system in shoe ? it wa a simpl develop in the past , but today still work , becaus the peopl know , that thi is as good as in the advertis . moreov i think , that product , which have been test for long term by the compani , will increas more and more on qualiti and final it is possibl to itentifi thi product with the advertis . as a conclus i would say , that neot everybodi should look onli at the advertis .
