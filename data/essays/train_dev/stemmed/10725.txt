my educ life chang total in the univers . at the high school , student are educ smoothli about the lesson . teacher ignor to provid the fact of the subject , and teacher explain the lesson onli about understand idea and memor the date . especi in the histori lesson that is veri import to understand and learn fact . student should describ the histori on hi or her aspect . in my opinion the most import point of educ is that educ is provid with it fact . the first point i would like to make is that learn subject with it fact is excit . for instanc histori ; in my countri there wa a great leader who is mustafa kemal ataturk . i heard too mani thing about him dure all my educ life . but at the univers , student learn all fact about hi life . therefor i wonder about him and whi he dedic hi all life for turkish nation , so that i am excit and wonder , then i investig about him . the second point i would like to make is that learn subject with it fact is effect way of understand . without clear and real reason ani subject , especi histori , could not be understand . it is the effici way of educ make event clear with all it fact . thu i would conclud by say that learn fact of the subject provid excit and interest in subject , furthermor learn fact make peopl understand and more concern to subject .
