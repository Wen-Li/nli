i agre with the statement , `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . '' if we have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , we would be abl to `` think out of the box '' when come to convers with other peopl who are may not be relat to your one specif subject . it will also be and advantag to us if we have a broad knowledg over mani academ subject when we are appli for job , make a decis in our futur or mayb it will even help us to meet and make new friend . if we are onli special in one specif subject , the job which we can be appli or be do would be limit . for exampl , if we are have a discuss with our old schoolmat , natur not everyon would be studi or work on the same subject or carrear . so if we onli have a knowledg of onli one specif subject , then we may not be abl to join in a convers , and we might be complet lost . i think that if we have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , other peopl would think that you are a more intelleg , even you may not be good or perfect at each and everyon of the subject , you would at least know the basic of it and it will be a lot better than peopl who are realli good at one particular subject . we may be better than other , in that one particular subject , that we hae knowledg in , we may not be as good and as use from other point of view compar to the peopl who have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . therefor i think that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject .
