i agre with it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learm fact . bucaus today at everi school , everi student onli learn fact . even they do not understand what teacher talk about . i think it is not good for young student . if teacher read and teach what is on the book , they would think about same thing . in addit , it would make children 's free imagin down . get down student high score is one of the big problem in the world . especi in japan , i heard on the televis that there is no student who read a book often , do not like learn new thing and they do not know whi is so imprtant to do studi . i think all teacher must teach children to get interest in to know new idea , not onli the fact . children should think about their own idea . it will make them more intellig and interest person . other big problem is most of japanes can not speak english . and i saw the graph on the news , they said japan wa worst . in the high school , student will learn english form teacher who is not nativ speaker . they studi such as grammer and how to talk . i think it is not veri use for student . they have to learn listen , write and need chanc to talk to peopl who speak english . it will also make student to interst and easi to undersatnd in class . i do not think onli learn fact is bad but i guess if student learn that , they would lose their indivisu idea and sens of imagin . that 's whi i think , to understand idea and concept is more import to learn real fact .
