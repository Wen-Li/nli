knowledg is someth that peopl have to have in order to have ani academ career . whether or not it is for one subject , knowledg is vital in order to make peopl awar and readi to make ani career develop . in my oppinion , i think that specialis in one certain area , would mean that peopl can focu on one subject onli , and that would provid more time for peopl to spend improv that subject and therfor make him an expert . howev , it can be a danger way to head to , becaus there are some issu that need to be thought of . for exampl , in the futur peopl may think that the career path that they have chosen is not what they want to contniu do , that would mean that they will have to start over again , and studi everyth from the start . thi can be veri frustrat and overwhelm becaus it would mean that they would have to put a ` paus ' in their live for the moment to tri focu on other subject . have a varieti of academ subject give a person a wider rang of job and even a better qualif becaus it mean that a person ha studi more than one subject and is capabl of handl respons . in the end , everi one should think of their live and if studi more than one subject will mean that they will not be capabl of handl mani thing at onc then they should focu on one subject without regret , but if i wa to make a choic , i would prefer to have more than one academ subject to studi becaus it would open more door in the futur and would make me feel proud of what i have achiev and i would have mani job offer to chose from and i would also benifit from that becaus i would choos the carrer that most suit me .
