i agre with the statement that say that `` in twenti year there will be fewer car than there today '' . in fact i have to admit , for my person experi , that in the last ten year thi wa the tendenc we are achiev , even if it is not a good result . i think that in twenti year there are go to be fewer car becaus of sever reason . first of all the citi are get bigger . i have read last week that most of the peopl now live in citi . that mean that they are go to have to move insid the citi , and as bigger the citi becom , as more peopl will need to have a car ( unless the state will offer the possibl to move with an altern transport ) . secondli citi are often overcrowd , and peopl who do not have much money are oblig to find anoth place where to live out of the citi . thi mean onc again that they are go to need a car to get to the citi for work , for exampl . also there are peopl that dislik the style of life that often a citi offer . they would probabl tri to find a place where to live that is out of the citi , but from where they are abl to get to the citi by car . morov i think it also depend on how the state , or the local commun would act . there are sever exampl that demonstr that when a local commun do not want to have too mani car in the citi , some solut can be found to resolv thi problem . the first thing is to make a good citi plan , that can realli help . if a citi is plan in a smart way that consid differ thing , as where to put major road , or how to plan altern transport , then to move in the citi is definit easier . secondli the state should tri to sensibil more and more peopl that live in the citi , who often do not care about thi topic becaus they are more comfort by move with their own car or becaus they think thi problem doe not affect them . which is not true , becaus they do not feel comfort at all while tri not to get stuck in line or when air pollut reach realli danger limit ! final i agre with the statement , even if i think that it will be a huge problem if thi actual come true .
