i agre with the topic given in some case . becaus of the follow reason . firstli student should understand the concept and idea . so that he can rememb for a long time . and explain whenev you ask a question about the topic which he had understu . for exampl a student is listen ti math lectur with interest . he can abl to solv the problem whatev you give to the student if he understand the topic onli . anoth reason is that if the student understand the topic then we can say that he is listen with concentr . so concentr make student to understand ani thing from the lectur . anot exampl is that if the student is learn or just read about the topic then he may or may not abl to grasp the whole thing in that topic . for exampl if the student is learnig that is he is just read or someth like casual read will not understand the main topic or the main idea of the topic . for exampl student is read the magazin or the newspap he will not concentr to rememb the whole thing just he read the paper and throw it out . if the same thing happen in the class room topic the student will not understand the main idea of the topic . i disagre with the topic given in thi case becaus of the follow reason if the student is child student he may not understand the topic of hi class the teacher may teach him in differ way that he will not understand the topic so teacher may tell to student that you byheart the question and the answer which is relat to topic . so i conclud that childrean student can abl to understand the topic by byheart that and adult student will understand the topic by themself by concentr on the topic .
