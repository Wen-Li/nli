in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today and i am strongli agre on that statement . current the world is chang in extremli fast speed than what we expect . especi technolog is the part where human are realli concentr on and that will bring lot of influenc to the futur car . also environment problem will give influenc to stop make car . accord to the news articl , the world gasolin will run out in next 10 year . if there are n't ani gasolin left in the world then the car wo n't move . current most of the car are move with gasolin and it is in seriou problem . lot of car compani are feel thi is seriou problem , and they decid to make hybrid car . instead of make new designed-car they thought make hybrid car will be more effici car in the futur . instead of gasolin , they will use altern energi such as crude palm oil or the sunlight . next twenti year will come realli fast and probabl they ca n't produc lot of hybrid car so number of car in next twenti year will be fewer than now . second lot of environment issu had been brought by car and that will reduc the number of car in the futur . at present , due to air pollut , the global warm is happen . the ozon layer ha the huge hole due to air pollut . the main reason can be co2 which is come out from the car . to save the world , lot of countri will reduc the number of car to stop global warm . anyway as i mention in abov inform , the car wo n't go becaus there wo n't be ani gasolin left so car which is run with ga will goto junk yard or develop into other tool machin . with two abov evid , in next twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . due to car which are run with gasolin are caus lot of problem to the world and that will reduc the number of car in the futur .
