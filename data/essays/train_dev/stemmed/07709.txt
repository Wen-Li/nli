everyon want to succeed in live . the question is onli how to do thi - doe one ha to tri new thing , doe one ha to take risk to be success ? a problem about tri new thing is of cours the possibl to fail . just to tri someth new garante by no mean to succeed . on the other hand , it seem pretti obviou to me that one should n't stay insid the given border if one want to succeed . firstli , tri someth new mean to have courag . peopl who take risk are self-confid . it is veri import to have a certain degre of courag and self-confid to succeed . then other tell you that you had no chanc doe n't keep you from do it . and if you are steadili kept from do what you acctual would like to do , after some time you will probabl develop a certain passiv attitud toward life and you will even no longer succeed in thing that are n't new at all , that you are familiar too . take risk mean to be activ and to keep go even if there are obstacl -- what is veri import for everyon who want to succeed . furthermor , tri new thing mean to explor unknown area , area where noon or onli veri few peopl have been befor . especi in econom it is one of the most import thing to be the first one on the market . one ha to be creativ and invent to succeed and what is more , one then ha to realiz one 's idea . i heard of a veri success woman sell a new sort of bath shoe , and she wa realli the first to be interest in bath shoe as someth that could make it way into the nation 's fashion magazin . but just the fact that she took the risk , that she start her own busi although her counsel probabl told her not to do so and the fact that she wa veri creativ in design the form and pattern of the shoe made her to succeed . if she would have remain in the pattern of daili life , if she just would have gone on the way she wa use to do thing , she would never have reach what she did . so to my mind , success peopl acctual tri new thing and take risk although thi should never mean to loos the ground or to be unrealist .
