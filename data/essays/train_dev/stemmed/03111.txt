honestli , i believ that it is a better to be a virtuoso in a particular field rather than be a dilletant . a person who tend to grope at everyth at onc , ultim end up with empti hand . to cite an exampl , i would like to take up the case of doctor . how preposter would it be to have a doctor repair your dentur and at the same time tri to perform a cardiac surgeri on you . i for one would definit not want to be at the merci of such a person . the new age world demand special . it make more sens to perfect a task , rather than to jump from one thing to anoth . in today world profession are in great demand . as the titl suggest , one expect a person to be profession involv in a field and not just pursu in as a hobbi . i would not like to go to far to adduc anoth exampl . my grandfath , who happen to be an undergradu in liber art , post graduat in market , and a diploma holder from iift chose to enter an industri as alien as the shoe industri . quit predict he could not get a firm foothold in the industri and within a year , he switch over to an equal absurd field , construct . my grandfath who wa not even close to be an engin wallow meaninglessli in an arena which tacitli requir a minimum of 4 year of engin . quit understand he could not surviv in the cut throat competit among the architectur fratern . i regret say it but he now sit idl at home , next to a die hearth with hi numer degre lie straggl around him . he still ha 4 year till retir but unfortun not a compani to approach . in today world , competit requir you to be an ace at whatev you do . the kind of in-depth experi special lend to a person can not be achiev by mere scrape the surfac of a particular subject . to sum it all up , if one lay wast hi power in tri to dabbl at anyth and everyth , he mere end up be a jack of all trade for who thi world , bless with specialist in their own field , ha no room .
