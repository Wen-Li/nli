i rather agre and disagre with the statement that ` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun ' . well it depend on the peopl on how they take the situat . young peopl who are more enthusiast toward form a commun can tend to help more . and they would rather give enough time to dedic on help their commun . on the other side , some of the peopl show less concern toward help their commun . perhap they would be rather busi with their day-to-day activ . they would be more selfcent and they would never even bother about help their commun . it is not necessari for the younger peopl to dedic much of the time help their commun , infact a littl amount of can help much better . sideway poepl with posit view toward develop a commun are more concern to help their communti and dedic their suffici work to help them get the commun better . they will organis more effect program to help their commun . they will arrang more and more effect plan to take their commun in a straight way . the young peopl should be motiv about help their commun and effect program are to be implement to motiv peopl . moreov some or more young peopl are more than enough for a commun to develop . howev format of the commun help most of the thing to grow in a straight way . it will also give suggest to most of the problem . commun should be develop in such a way that they should drive the peopl 's attent toward them . they can do thi by organs some cultultur activ in some occass . by do so , most of the young peopl will be motiv to help their commun . so by all of the abov point , not all young peopl are not concern about help their commod . it depend on the peopl on how they are . and the activ taken by the commun which drive the attent of young peopl .
