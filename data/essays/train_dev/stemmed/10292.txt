in these day young peopl want to grow older while old peopl want to be younger , the young peopl think that the older peopl live a better life then they do , but the older peopl think that the younger peopl are live a better life then they do . i think that young peopl enjoy life than older peopl do , three main layout is that young peopl have no resppnsibl , they have more fun and they are get care of from older peopl . younger peopl enjoy life without ani worri or ani responsibilti , oppisit from older peopl they have worri in their life and need are respons for everi thing they do . younger peopl don have to worri how to gain moni for their life so that they could eat or drink they easli get what they want , while older peopll need to get a jobe to support their live . anoth thing younger peopl play have fun and enjoy life while older peopl work and get exost from the hard work and responsibilti . secondli , younger peopl have more energi than older peopl , they run play lahp , but older peopl are old for these thing you can see them just read newspapp or watch the new on tv . also yonger peopl can play some sport and do some exersid while older peopl are too old to move that fast and have less powwer than younger peopl . thirdli , is that younger peopl are get care of from older peopl , if they get in ani problem they get some help from the older , also if they need some suggest they get it from the older , but the older don have ani one get care of them they take care of themself . in my opinion i want to stay young forev to alwaay have fun and natur life without ani responsibilti or worri on get old , in short word no worri for young peopl in life .
