i total disagre with thi statement . whi there would be fewer car in the futur ? now i 'm explain my opinion . firstli , after a littl time from it creation , the car ha becom the most use , and use , way to go from a place to anoth . even if there are sever way to move , for exampl the public mean , like the train , the bu or the aereo , everi famili , or mayb almost everyon , ha one on hi own . a car , in fact , allow to not to have limit of time when you move and then , use it , you can go pratic everywher . furthermor i find that 's a veri import thing that you have the possibl to buy the one you best like : you are allow to choos it colour , it seat , it type , ( familiar , cabrio or ani you prefer ! ) , so there is n't the problem to take a journey on a mean you do n't like . the onli limit is the money you can spend , but thi is anoth problem . and for thi there 's a solut , too : at now everi car-sel give you the opportun to pay your buyment on rate . last , but not least , i think that the onli idea to own a car , give you a sort of sens of indipend : you 're abl to move without the help of someon els , it can be a great satisf ! for these , and mani other , argument , i think that peopl will continu in buy car , and in use them of cours . in my opinion , if there would be a time when there should be fewer car , it 's right now , becaus of the high ( to use an euphemysm ) prize of oil , and especi becaus of the knowledg we have that more car are the equival of more polut in the air all we breath . so , i think , if peopl do n't stop buy and use car today , whi should they do it tomorrow ?
