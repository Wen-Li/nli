sometim the econom busi doesn t tell the true , in particular with advertis . everi day i can see a lot of product that the enterpris describ us veri good , but when you buy those you can have a bad product . i complit agre with that statement and for me the best exampl is with the food advertis . when you can see that kind of advertis it seem to be the best food , veri delici and attract , and you are involv to buy thi food , but when you eat thi , it is veri bad . i think it with the exampl of the food , becaus you can t tast , and onli if you tri you will know if the food is good or no , you can not make the same statement with cloth or tecnolog thing becaus you can see those on the advertis and when you will go to the shop you can read , see , touch and ask inform . i mean also with these kind of product happen to buy bad thing . so i think that the enterpris take advantag under thi profil , but if i see the situat under their view i can understand them becaus they need to sell the product and they have to involv peopl to buy their product . actual i think that thi way to sell the product is wrong not onli becaus the enterpris sell a bad thing to the public but it will lost a client in the futur , becaus the consum will not buy other thing of that brand .
