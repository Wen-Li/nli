i 'm fulli agre that we should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specfic subject . thi is will grow up the knowledg and it will increas the educ part in the person of the peopl . for exampl , if you are invit in a conver that is talk about somth that is not realt to your special . then , you will be unabl to talk and discuss ani point that might be mention or rais in the convers . from my point of view , read mani book and articl that are not reat to one specif subject will help you to be more sophost person . anoth exampl , sometim when you are special in one academ subject such as comput scienc and you read about other subject is not relat to comput scienc such as math . you will see in some point there are some smilirati . as a result of thi , the knowelg will be widli increas in the two subject not onli in one specif subject . have a differ career in the bachol degre from the master will also increas the knowldg and it will be better to have the bacholar special with the same master special . final , i encourg and motiv everi person that should enlarg hi knowleg and know mani acadm subject rather that stik in one specif subject .
