in the next few year the technolog will develop more than today . so i agre with thi point of view that in twenti year therr will be fewer car in use than there are today , becaus in futur becaus of develop of scienc and technolog the train will develop more than present day . and it is to travel by train than by car . becaus train are much more faster than car and it will develop more . we can take the exampl of metro train of present day . these are much more faster than the old time train . we can reach in few minut to same place on which it will take mani our by reach with car . also in car there is a pressur of drive . if our famili is go on a place then one ha to drive . if we are go on night then also some one ha to drive which is veri danger . also the person who is drive can not enjoy like other peopl . in train there is no pressur of drive and all of the famili member can enjoy equal , becaus of the develop it will becom easier to afford the plain also . so everyon prefer plain rather than car . as we all know that it take onli few minut . also in car there is a veri conjust space which make it uncomfort . it is veri difficult to travel long distanc in car . it is veri expens to travel in car . becaus of the rise price of the fuel . i think thi is the big reason to the decreas in use of car . we all know veri well the fossil fuel are declin day by day . there is a big deceras in the natur resourc from the last few year . so everyon must tri to control thi . and we can do thi by control the use of fossil fuel . anoth reason for decreas in the use of car is that it increas the pollut in the atmospher . which is a veri seriou problem . as pollut creat mani kind of problem like mani kind of diseas like skin diseas and also breath problem . mani children are suffer from these diseas in there young age . so thi problem can be solv by controll the use of pollut creat vehicl . there is a lot of traffic on the road also . which is veri irrit . so we can avoid thi by use train and plain . so in next some year peopl will prefer less use of car than today to all of these problem like pollut , traffic , longer time durat and also the pressur of drive .
