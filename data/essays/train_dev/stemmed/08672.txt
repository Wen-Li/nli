i think educ is a combin between the understand of concept and the learn of fact . concept are import in the way they are the essenc of the knowledg that the teacher need to transmit to the student . they are the structur , to built that strong construct that support all the academ task . without concept we will live in a world that doe n't worri and take the time to penetr the deepest part of the understandiyng and mental capac . sometim educ can turn to squar and bore the learner , becaus everyth is about idea and how to get them . to pill the onion or to get to the center of the point , we need detail , littl fact that decor our live and the way we learn to see and understand the univers . good educ are the one that can awak their studendt throught a simpl fact as a date o a number ( that can be eassili fogotten ) use it as door to walk and search into an unknown univers full of posibl that let her/him to understand the idea that onc we introduc we never forget . it is like a game . when we play to find the treasur we can not forget our object , but we have to be careful of the fact and the extra inform that we can collect dure the search . the middl way is the best way to educ and help student to understand differ disciplin from mathemat to art , becaus is the perfect combin between bodi and what is insid it . when we fallow thio way we find the gold , the wisdom .
