do young peopl do n't give enough time to help their commun ? mayb , but do older peopl give enough time their commun and doe n't - to speak a bit epic and controvers - everi commun get 's the peopl it earn ? in time were individualis and the quest for profit are predomin , how can one expect from young peopl to give time in the old altruist fashion to their commun . all they learn through the media is that it is cool to be rich , cool to be success and that the best method of acquri these goal is to stay focuss and not to wast their time . and if one consid thi ration one ha to accept thi reason . if the kid wo n't be good in school becaus they give to much to commun they wo n't be abl to go to halfway decent univers and thu wo n't get a good job - which is still one of the most import thing to get ( not onli in young peopl eye ) . and after all , do older peopl realli give a lot time to the commun . well i do n't think so . adult also tri to make career and tri to get the best possibl outcom for themselv . so to whom could young peopl look upward ? so i conclud that it 's not the young peopl who should give more of the time to their commun , it 's everybodi . the acquir , tradit structur of commun are valauabl and at some situat in life everybodi will remark that he is need them . so everybodi should invest a bit more in them . but are young peopl realli as individualist and profit orient as put forward abov . i think there are good reason to doubt thi claim . one can observ an import backflow to tradit valu within the group of young peopl . nowaday younger peopl do becom involv in social activ - or how could one explain the rise in number of ngo . and what about the larg number of young peopl volunt in social project in underdevelop countri ? if young peopl are thu not give enough time to their commun mayb these commun should think of chang their offer in order to attract young peopl . young peopl are sure will to give their time to the commun . to conclud i think one ha to state that one should not blame the young peopl rather the commun for not adjust to the young .
