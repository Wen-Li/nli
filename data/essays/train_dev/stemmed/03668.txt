ith import and popular of travel is still rais , everybodi is interest in get to know other countri and contin but the way how to do it , are veri differ . i agre with the statement that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guid . if you travel in a group and you have a tour guid you get to know the most famou place and you get to know interest thing about the countri you decid to visit . the tour guid would organis everyth for you , so the onli thing you would have to do is to go to the appoint with the group . anoth aspect is that you would get to know a lot of interest peopl . when you travel in a group it is veri easi to get to know other peopl becaus usual you sit in the same bu or you sleep in the same hotel like the other do . that is whi you are never bor when you travel in group . if you decid to travel in a group and you visit a countri which is dangerous then the tour guid can inform you about thi dangerous and he can say you how to avoid risk . sometim there are special rule or other thing which can bring you in troubl when you do not follow them . furthermor a tour guid can help you with commun problem . when you are not abl to speak the languag peopl in the countri you visit speak , then the tour guid can help you becaus he ha to be abl to speak it . so if you have to visit the doctor or you have to go to the polic becaus someth happend to you , then you can ask your tour guid and he would be abl to help you . these are the reason whi i prefer to tavel in a group with a tour guid .
