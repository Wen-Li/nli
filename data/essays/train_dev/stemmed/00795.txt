nowaday , peopl start to begin frighten about the fact that pehap in the next centuri , there won t be enought oil or petrol and so that it will be imposs to use car anymor . i believ that it is probabl that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i think the most import fact is that peopl strart to pay more attent at how and when they use their car becaus there are a lot of problem with countri which have the oil . and anoth import point is that the ressours of oil have decreas consider these last few year . in addit to that the govern of my countri tri to sensibil citizen to the fact that car pollut a lot and it is veri bad for the environ . natur begin to take an import place in a lot of goverenement decis which could also deacreas the number of car . howev , for some the idea to not use the car is someth unrealist and unbeliev . these peopl do not care about the environ , and for them it doesn t matter if they pollut . so they are go to use their car . futhermor , perhap , some new energi could be creat such as electr or sun energi , which don t need oil and don t pollut and so that they could be use by the driver . in both point , there will not be a decreas of car in the street , becaus it would be new one with new kind of energi . in conclus , i think that there will be the same amount of car in the street . nevertheless , i believ that with the new technolog and the decreas of oil in the wolrd , it will be new car which don t need oil as energi . i also hope peopl would tri to use less their car even if they pollut less . it would be better for the environ .
