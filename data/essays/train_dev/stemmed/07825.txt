i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept then it is for them to learn fact . in a student age it is veri much essenti to get a idea and concept on the subject befor learn fact . for exampl math is a subject where we shoud have an idea and the concept ie logic think of how we should do the problem . if we dont have concept of how to do addit then how can we proceed furrter . concept is like a root to devolop furter . when a student can understand about the idea and about the concept it is veri much easi to learn about the fact . the student if he start understand the concept and idea he can never forget the thing . witout a concept studi is simpli muge up . when the student start understand about the idea and the concept of a subject it is veri much easi for him to learn . at the student age onli our main idea and the concept start . if a student is learn anyth without a concept is someth like root without a stem . whenev we want do someth we shoud have an idea of what to do in a similar manner whenev a student is studi or do ani practic he shoud have an idea of wat to do and concept of it and then think about the fact . mani student loos the oppurtun becaus of lack of devolop idea , and lack of concept in the subject . i feel if we have an idea and concept on the subject it is veri much easi to learn . secret of success of mani student becaus of there conceputi way of studi . i conclud that it is import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
