the present statement is a fals dichotomi on an essenti academ topic : is breadth of knowledg better than special knowledg ? i will develop the reason whi i consid that build broad and special knowledg are both essenti and complement each other . to have a wide knowledg of mani academ subject is essenti nowaday and will be even more import in the futur . the world we live in move fast and new technolog have enabl an exponenti growth of network connect between peopl from differ background and cultur . therefor have a broad understand of differ cultur and industri is key for an individu to understand and evolu in our world . convers , specif and special knowledg is essenti in order to contribut to the develop of our civil . to master all the aspect and challeng of the disciplin is essenti in order to contribut to it develop . have insight on a specif topic is a strength which could infer numer job opportun . one of my scienc teacher at univers use to say that the more special a disciplin is , the more broad knowledg you need to understand the mechan of natur and physic . he use to think that somehow mani scientif disciplin converg toward a uniqu truth ( an old scientist dream ) . as a conlus , i believ there are no reason for contend that broad knowledg is more essenti than special knowledg ( or vice-versa ) . as a matter of fact , i consid they complement each other . i would even add that what is essenti in our today world is to learn how to learn in order to be abl to adapt ourselv to our ever fast mute civil .
