first , i must say i complet agre with the statment . it is quit relev in the educ of a countri , and about it and it consequ a huge controversia ha been open at the spannish univers . i think everyon accept that understand the concept and far more import , be abl to get to the fact by yourself use that concept you 've learn at class , is what univers should use for . in other word , they should teach you how to use your capabl . in the profession area , what you will need to do is appli what you have learn into complet differ case . you will never find the same specif of the problem you got when you were studi . you could pass your exam , but you wo n't be prepar for the real world , you will feel complet nake when you 'll find your first problem . in my case , that i 'm an engin , it is complet useless to know how to resolv a specif problem . what i need to know is how to face it , what step i should take and then work throught it to get it done . each time i 'll need a differ techniqu to resolv it , but i should alway take the same step , analyz , decid best option between a brunch of possibl and final use it . then , what is the problem ? whi do n't teacher work that way ? basic becaus it is much more complic to teach concept and actitud that fact . the fact is written and it doe n't chang . they just need to read their ` magic ' teacher 's book and copi it . someon els did the investig befor . instead , to teach concept , first you have to understand it properli , investig , you need to get involv in the classroom . all thi mean complet dedic and a huge prepar . and what is more import , i think you need to love what you are teach . anoth aspect i think a lot of teacher are just there becaus they did n't have the opportun to develop their career in their real area .
