i strongli agre with the statement `` it is import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' student are requir to understand idea and concept . the main reason for thi is the idea are go to increas the way they think and the concept help them to implement their taught . the lectur should teach student for get idea for new thing from there childhood . they should give some question and tell them to implement their taught . such that their brain get more idea when they see or come to know about a perticular point . suppos for an exampl let us take a topic in mathemet , there are mani way to solv one perticular problem . here come pictur of idea the , student think in mani differ way to solv a perticular problem ani how , these can be implement onli by concept but not fact . and puzzl con be solv by implement differ idea . suppos a puzzl ha mani way then onli idea can help him to find the right way . fact are that which have alreadi taken place . fact can be learn by there own . one can gather fact from newspap , magizin and mani other place . fact are implement earlier , befor fact idea and concept are develop , with these develop of idea and repeatli occur of the same thing they were record as fact . some fact may help the student but with out concept these fact may not be understood clearli . fact are those they are alreadi implement . these can be read and know about them and can implement onli up to a certain level . but , when an idea is strike it can be implement by their own knowledg use concept . for exampl , scientist would read fact and keep in mind but they implement or invent new thing by their own idea and the concept they had learn . final , we can conclud that fact are develop from the implement of idea and concept .
