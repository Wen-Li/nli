i do agre with the statement , but i can not be complet sure about it . it is a fact that oil price are higher than ever befor . also the polut show a lot of econom and enviroment problem and it is enough a reason to stop use the car becaus of their leck of use in the citi . oil price is a princip problem for western countri which have n't their own oil suppli . for exampl in europ , it is almost imposs to have a car without pay car tax , insur and enorm fuel cost . also the leck of space in major citi make the price rise up . one can alreadi see mani trend in a lot of citi in europ , e.g. the gover in vienna is make bike rout in the citi and also provid cheap rent-a-bik place for it habit . holland is for sure a good exampl and show that peopl are still mobil without a car . a citi design in london said that car should n't design the citi . he meant that citi are not made for car but for human . thi statement ha it truth , when one compar citi in newer countri with older one . european citi have a natur structur . the old part mostli the center are n't design for car but more for human . american citi like caraca they have major problem with mobil of human . of cours they have a metro but the car made form the appear of the citi . they have in the middl of the citi big highway and it is complet imposs to walk from one point to the other .
