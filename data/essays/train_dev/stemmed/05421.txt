ye , i defenetli agre with that statement . i 'm finish my studi for mediadesign in berlin and dure them i got some inform from differ advertis agenc . if we take a model for exampl , which will be on the next `` vogu '' cover ( a fashionmagazin ) , so she or he , the model will be the product for thi magazin-cov at thi time . thi magazin want to sell ani kind of imag , so the model ha to look pretti , modern or somehow , so the peopl who work in these advertis agenc are go throught a pictur which ani photograph have shoten and they are work over it , sometim even day , so if the model on the pictur ha for exampl a spot in the face , it will be remov in the comput , by programm like photoshop , which make it possibl . even me , a student who often design brochur and invit have to make some pictur look better than they realli are , like the light , the color , contrast etc . so i can unerstand whi these advertis are do that . pictur or object in gener will be caught by our eye first , so if there is a banana on a poster in a busstat for exampl , we ca n't realli smell it , but we can see it and if there is a banana which is look green , as they often do at the begin , we will mayb not buy thi brand , but if you imagin a banana on the pictur that ha a beautiful strong yellow color , we as human be would think in our mind `` thi banana , that is from jamaica , semm to be tasteful , i guess banana from thi brand are qualitativ , healthi and good '' . thi is how we normal think , but of cours there can be a lot of disappoint of it , after by these advertis product .
