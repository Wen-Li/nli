of cours mani peopl might think , that the youth ha becom more egoist and at a certain point i agre with that . if you take a look on the big citi , you see everyon live on hi own , mayb addit care about hi parent and hi girlfriend , but that is all . in my opinion thi is just an brief impress . if you take a deeper look , you would find out , that there are still a lot of benefici club , who do spend time help the commun even without be paid . and that 's whi i think the situat ha not chang in the recent year , there are just more youth live in the citi and the peopl tend to see onli that one , that do not care . especi in smaller town , there are a lot of young peopl , who want to help other for exampl in sport club or at church . i know a lot of peopl at my age , who are interest in these thing . concern myself , i am member in the footbal club in my town , where i do the train for almost 20 kid togeth with a friend . sometim thi is veri hard and exhaust , but it is just such a fantast feel to do someth for the kid . especi becaus i know , how i appreci the footbal train the time i wa in their age . moreov i am also member of a youth group , that belong to the church . with thi group we often organ trip for younger member to the zoo or bike-tour . onc a year we have a one-week camp , sleep in tent . thi is realli excit , becaus instead of shop or watch tv , we are sing or play game in the natur , which is realli someth total differ from the dayli life . sometim we also organ someth for the older peopl in our town , like drink coffe or play card . in my opinion there is noth better than a simpl `` thank you '' or even just a smile on the face of a young boy or girl . so in addit , especi in smaller citi or town there are still young peopl , who are encourag in help other .
