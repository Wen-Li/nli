i will talk about my own experi when i wa a student in the colleg . i rememb that when i wa attend a lectur or my lab i had to understand everyth told to me and if i didnt understand ani part in the lectur i wa go to my teacher to ask him to explain to me again , becous if i didnt understand the idea and concept of one subject i would do bad on my test and my grade will be lower than if i understood everyth and that is more import to me than a fact becous a fact doesnt want me to understand just to learn it as it is . i will give you anoth exampl if the concept about the sun as it rise everi day from east thi is a fact it doesnt make a sens to understand onli what do you want to do is to know thi fact , but when the object about the solar energi you have to understand the concept veri well to be convinc you have to understand that it consist of heat and light and they can not be separ ye it is onli one beam but two compon so if i told you that without explainig you will not believ me becous you have to understand first then you will be convinc . you can put anyth els on that measur as for exampl the human heart consist of four chamber that is a fact but how those chamber get fill of blood and how they process the circul in the bodi that is imposs to learn or just to know without explan till you understand the idea and the concept to believ . i think in my opinion i can not believ anyth without understand except for the fact i have to take it as it is . so i agre with that statement it is veri import not onli for student but for ani bodi to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact
