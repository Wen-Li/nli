it could be said , it realli depend on what kind of type the person is , therefor , i agre with thi opinion . some peopl success with onli do what they alreadi know how to do well but i hardli believ that the kind of pepl could success onli in limit of level . no risk but no big return . i think that success peopl tri new thing not just to money but they like to tri new thing . as a result of their action , they earn a lot of moni and find a differ way to success from other . think about our computer life , when i wa a junior high school student , nobodi know what the internet mean . onli few peopl show their interest on it and start some internet busi . nowaday internet busi is the one of most success busi but they alway have to tri new thing and develop their knowledg and technic . if they do n't , no longer becom to success peopl ! also if peopl in thi world are do onli they alreadi know thing , our cultur and industri have no chanc to improv . we alway need to seek someth new to us . of cours there are some risk all the time to do new thing , but if we do n't tri , we ca n't gain anyth includ the mean of success . i do n't want to think all the time to becom success person but i alway want to tri to be a challeng person for everythin . and someday , i may becom one of a success person .
