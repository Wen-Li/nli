in my opinion , there are both , advantag and disadvantag about tri new thing and take risk . some peopl might feel relunct to chang method of a success compani , other might feel more open about it . i use to be the person who doe not take a lot of risk in the past , but recent my attitud ha chang . i think that be success in life , just can be achiev by tri new thing and take risk . for exampl , a member of a footbal team . if he just react and play safe mean make no fault , he can not get a better soccer player . he just stay at hi level , but doe not becom a profession player one day . a soccer player who want to achiev somet , ha to take risk . thi risk can be chang the soccer team where he ha stay for five year to a successul , better team where he doe not know the member , the coach or the surround of thi team . take risk and tri new thing can also have some neg aspect . if you take risk , there will alway be the opportun to make it wrong , to loos someth . but if you do not make fault , you wo n't learn about thing and decis you made . an exampl for a sport where you can not take ani risk is the formula one . the race driver can not take risk , becaus everi fault can caus death for them . so , the level of take risk for car pilot in the formula one , is veri low . they have to drive success , mean drive fast , but it is veri import for them and their team to drive safe . to sum it all up and to summar my opinion about the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onlz do what they alreadi know how to do well '' , i would say that success peopl have to take risk , but there are some situat or some job where zou have to do what zou have learn .
