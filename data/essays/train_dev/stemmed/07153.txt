someon might say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i person agre with thi statement . i know that there are mani exampl that seem to prove the contrari but i think that they are absolut not the norm . a young person is far more athlet and healthi than an older one . and , thing not to undervalu , it ha less respons . when you get rid of all the thing you have to worri about , life becom instantan more enjoy . so less respons , less thing to worri . anoth reason is obvious the atlet stae of the bodi . at a certain age there are just a lot of movement you have difficulti to do , so even a simpl action like , for exampl , ride a bike or run becom hard to do . and when you can not do such basic movement you can not accomplish more complic task . health is anoth import factor . who enjoy go to the pharmaci or , wors , to the hospit ? older peopl have to take care of their bodi contin , mayb take pill or other medic treatment of some sort . and when you are not at that point , you know that sooner or later you will . but the bodi is noth without the mind . it 's scientif prove that at a certain age the mental abil of an individuo start to decreas dramat . thi ha consequ on the whole bodi activ but let 's just concentr on the mind aspect . even those activ which do n't involv physic activ are preclud . a chess match , crossword , and ani other kind of that stuff . thi problem list here are all problem that a normal person would n't have if he or she is young . so the conclus are that when you are in the middl of you youth ( and do n't have ani seriou problem of other sort ) , you have all the door open and that these door keep close while the year pass by .
