in china , there is an old say that say , ` if one have one hundr subject , all of them are poor and nity-nin of them is in the air . ' thi say well describ the relat between the quantiti and the qualiti of the subject . i 'm for the statement that it 's better to have a special in one subject than to have broad knowledg of mani academ . first of all , nowsday , the sociati need expert that mean devid work into mani part and ask the expert on thi aera to solv the problem he 's good at . there is one good exampl around me . in a comput compani , there are mani part of the aera . some do with the comput , some do with the machin such as coffe offer , the air condition , or the car . onc i went to see my friend work in thi compani , the coffe offer wa broken down by accid . i ask my friend , ` whi do n't you repair it , it is so import in the daili life . ' howev , my friend said , ` the cechan is come , i think the job suit him better and i am for the comput . he 's absolut right . he 's job is work with the comput , he do n't need to repair the coffe offer becaus he is n't profession about thi . in thi way , a person do n't need to know everi thing . devid job can make work profession and in thi way , the effect will increas and the qualiti will also get higher , therefor , peopl can safe a lot of time and finish work well . in anoth view , it is becaus we are not good at everyth that our life is colour as we meet mani new peopl when we are work in a new field . one of life 's good is that we can commun and coopert . to sum up , it 's better to special in one specif subject than to devid a limit period of time into so mani subject .
