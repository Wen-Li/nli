in my opinion , to agre or disgreewith it is a matter of balanc the pro and con . becaus everi thing or do ani thing ha it advantag and disadvantag . just like a coin ha two coin . for thi titl statement , mani peopl think success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do it while other do not agre . for my person perpect , i agre with thi statement . from countless factor with influenc my choic , there are three conspicu reason list follow . the most import benefit is that the person can gain experi which other peopl can not when one tri new thing and thake risk . both common sens and our experi have inform us that when can combin our knowleg with practic , and also make us know more about the thing or risk . then we can do better next time . for exampl , my father is a succ businessman . he alway tri new thing . about 10 year age , he tri to do someth about seweg project . he had no experi at that time . but he said thi preject would be develop in the futur . so he work hard on it alon . after 3 three year , he combin hi knowleg with hi work and got lot of experi . now he had a big factori and the bussi is pretti good . he often tell me that if you want to be success , you must have the courag to tri new thing and face challeng . in addit , anoth reason can be present to develop my idea is that it can boarden your view , make you health strong and you will get confid when you comeov the risk . it is obviou that it is good for a person to grow up . for exampl , when i wa child , i wa weak . and i tri to practis box . although i had never tri befor , after i tri and kept , i am stong now . what 's more , tri thing and take risk can make you realis and know more about the societi . it is particularli benefici that you will know more about the life and societi . you will know life is differ and you will work hard in you life which is necessari for a success peopl there are still mani other reasonsthat can account for my agre thi statement , but the obviou one have been present as abov . onc again , i would like to stater my opinion to thi issu that i agre with thi statement .
