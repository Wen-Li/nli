i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus in the modern technolog life you need to know the concept which are essenti to complet a research , project or anyth to be solv . the concept are the main fudament point which would explain the whole process in a mehcan way . idea are the one which should be understand befor go to begin the work or process . for exampl as i am be a comput student , to write a program in ani program languag i should have an idea about the concept of the program languag befor start write the program . i need not know the fact . becaus fact are result if we doe one work . if student understand idea and conecpt then onli the student could step forward and get success in that process . in thi comput modern life student will not give much prefer to learn fact , which rather take up time . so everi student want to first understand the concept and idea then be involv into the project . in the older day student are suppos to learn the fact and get grip on the subject befor go to start the process . but after comput ha been introduc , the whole process ha been chang , becaus student are expos to use the internet , which rather made student to understand the concept and swept away the process of learn fact . internet give freedom to student which price help directli to get the concept of subject with out much effort to learn fact . for exampl if a student want to do a project use ani comput languag , now a day student would rather use the internet such as googl , with which he could get all the inform in world for that project , automat he finish the project by understand the concept and idea with out learnin te fatc . i agre thi statement becaus student should grab the opportuin of technolog as we have inthi 21 centuri .
