i strongli agre with the statement , as i person experi the feel . in life we need to enjoy everi part , though it is relat to money , adventur , drama etc . elder are alway frighten as they alway think of futur than present . but youngster are dam bother about futur . for an exampl when i am in school i need to go for a tour but my parent are veri scare to send me , but final they sent me with more caution . after com back , they have seen my video of my bange jump in tour and start scoldind me though i safe came back . they are alway more coutiou in life and they never tri for ani adventur . i feel adventur is also part of enjoy . spend money is economi for elder but for younger money doesnt matter for enjoy . when i start earn , i start spend for my own expenditur like restur , outing with friend , enjoy weekend , but my parent dont like thi as they want me to save money for my futur . i feel that we need to enjoy when we have oppurtun , as time never come back . we can earn money through out our life . youngster like dress in modern way as per there comfort wherea elder feel that young one need to maintain their tradit but i feel dress in modern is not mean that we are loos our tradit . final i conclud that think of all these elder are loos all enjoy wherea young peopl are enjoy more than them .
