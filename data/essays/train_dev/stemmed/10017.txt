as the say goe `` everi coin ha two side '' , some peopl think that we should broad our knowledg of a varieti of academ subject , but other peopl believ that we should special just in one specif subject what we master in . in my opion , i agre with that we should master in few subject what we want to learn instead of studi a lot of subject . there are sever reason whi i agre with the idea . first , althought some peopl talk about that we should studi a lot of subject that could enhanc our fundat knowledg , i think that if we do n't have ani master subject , we ca n't distinct from other . and everyon should show our differ from other . for exampl , if everyon just know a littl in everi subject what we studi , we colud not ask other deeper question . in the long run , it could not advenc in our societi and our world . second , althought you do n't have a varieti inform of everi subject , we can reach the top in the subject what we master in . and if we have deeper inform , we could get better job what we need . for exampl , although i 'm not good in english , i master in math and it could be the best way for me to teach math . anoth exampl , my friend , john , althought he know everyth a littl in our life , actual , he still get no job now . to sum up , thi is more import to master in a subject than know a littl in everi subject . there are a lot of adventag to master a subject what we want to choos . and thi is whi we have to select major subject in univers .
