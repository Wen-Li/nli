in my opinion it is better to special in one specif subject in studi life . thi ha a lot of benefit than tri to learn a lot of subject in fact it is imposs to have a deep understand of variou subject . first of all you can choos your aim easili and it bring you to reach your destin at the shortest time possibl . also one specif subject would be helpful in your busi career . in the busi life , executor look for more specil individu . for exampl it is not enough to graduat from busi administr to acquir a good posit . one also should have the specif knowledg of financ or market in order to get good salari . for instanc i work in forest industri and i graduat in foretsri so now i know a lot of thing about timber , plant , solid wood , and like thi . secondli , in today fast grow'ng world if one want to be employ with a high posit in one compani and have enough salari to have high standart of live , he must concantr on one specif subject and be expert about that posit . take into consider everyth one should prefer special obout one specif issu and util thi inform to have high career throughout hi life . that is whi i am choos .
