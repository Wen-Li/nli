i agre with thi statement becaus i believ that who dare win . i basic think that do onli what we alreadi know can be the start point of a career but if we limit ourselv to it for our whole life , we can not achiev success . there are sever reason whi i agre with the abov statement . firstli , i think that success is the outcom of creativ . if we see all the most import busi men , for exampl briator , we realiz that they had to risk and start an activ without think about failur . all thi obvious start from an interest , in thi case briator wa interest in formula 1 , but in my opinion he need creativ to make an interest becom a busi . secondli , success is not a daili goal , on the contrari it is someth realli difficult to achiev , therefor it need not onli knowledg but even the abil of a person to take risk . as a matter of fact , success is someth that probabl last for onli a certain period of time and for thi reason , i think that all the success peopl are not scare of failur , they are awar of it . the pleasur of success is probabl more import than the fear of a failur . thirdli , success peopl have often some difficulti in their privat live , becaus they do not have enough time to dedic to their famili , to their friend and partner although these are some veri import aspect of a person exist . thi reason support the opinion that a success person must have the abil to take risk . as a matter of fact someon that doe not want to run ani risk , will unlik manag to achiev success . in conclus , success peopl must have the curios to tri new thing , and the habil to take risk from an econom point of view but , abov all , from a person and privat point of view .
