is it the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guid ? some peopl might say ye to the subject . howev , it is my view that it is not the best to travel in a group led by a tour guid . in other word , peopl can not fullfil their desir and need dure the journey if they were in a group led by a tour guid . the exampl of leonardo da vinci , thug ( or horse-rid buglar ) in rural area of china , and herman mervil valid my statement . when peopl talk or read an articl about the grace and gloriou day of renassi , peopl soon encount a familiar name call leonorado da vinci . leonardo da vinci ha renown from those day of renassi for hi ginuin intellectu accomplish over the variou subject : art , sciensc , herbalog , anatomi and so forth . howev , not mani peopl are awar of leonardo da vinci as a travler . da vinci made all hi trip alon ( or with a servant at hi servic ) through out the european contin as one of hi favorit activ when there wa a demand for hi cun hand at variou subject . da vinci also took a lot of shor-trip to fullfil hi desir for more knowledg and observ which meet hi interest . da vinci wa the man who know the tast of travel alon . it is not veri common ( or well-known ) fact that there is still horse-rid buglar in rural area of china . and peopl feel more arkward when it come to their ear that thi is someth go on as a current event . what doe thi do with the well of the peopl who frequent goe to china travel alon ? noth pretti much unless you are a ever-wonder who alway seek the scarc inhabit land . moreov , these buglar are mostli caught for the safetli of lone travel who even want to travel undevelop land of china . there is a great guest from literatur , herman mervil when you talk about the one who seek out the wilder of natur . herman mervil made such great deed on hi work of the whale ( or the mobi dick ) after whale although he travl not alon and rather accompani and guid with experienc one toward whale . howev , whale or sail ha been alway the subject of great travler whether they like to travl alon or not they accompani and guid with more experienc one sinc there ha been alway no choic sinc travel on the sea ha to have a group work ( in most term ) unless you are a lone sailor with a small boat which goe not far away from ashor . herman mervil would have not been recal as a great writer if he had not been a great sailor as he ha been renown . all the instanc from art , histori and current-ev valid my statement . it is alway the best to travel lone .
