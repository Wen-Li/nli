to be a wise enough person peopl should know lot of thing from differ field . howev know everyth is not possibl even for the machin have a larg capas of memori . in my opinion , it is better to special in one specif subject becaus one may do not have a conclus while deal with detail , it is not possibl to be good in all field , fill the memori is not necessari . firstli , if one tri to investig and make a knowledg of mani subject then he will not have time to make hi conclus or even he may not have a conclus . if he special and investig the other field just when he need , then he must go in detail so the possibl to have a conclus is higher . for instanc , as an academ research area mathemat is so wide even in the branch . it alreadi take so much time to learn one field . if one tri to know all the detail in other branch then it is imposs to have an articl about hi research . secondli , it is imposs to be an expert in everi field . final , human memori is not so wide to keep everyth . the thing that is not use anymor will be delet after a time . so fill the memori with the thing that will not be use is unnecessari , sinc it is not necessari to know everyth . in conclus , it is better to work on a specif subject than to work on mani subject .
