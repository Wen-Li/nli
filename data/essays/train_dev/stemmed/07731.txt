when appli to univers , there are alway mani choic of studi offer to student . some will be more like to get engag in a field such as litteratur , while other will choos medecin . i think , these two field are realli differ from each other accord to what you learn in each of them . for the first , you will have to understand idea and concept , and for the second , you will have to learn and deal with fact . in my opinion , it is far more interest to studi fact . first of all , when you are engag in a field such as medecin that impli human life , you have to deal with new thing everyday . i think learn fact allow you to understand how thing happen , and eventu to solv problem . of cours , at the begin of a medic degre , you will have to learn rudimantari skill , which are somehow relat to wordi idea and concept , but then you will have to practic them , so that you will understand better what you were talk about befor . i think learn fact lead to more concret activ . not just medecin is concern . take the exempl of law . usual , the begin of law studi impli a lot of paper cours , lot of concept . these could remain veri obscur for student if he doe n't have ani chanc to practic them and to make them real . secondli , i think it is far easier for a teacher to commun with student and to get their interest about a topic when it impli fact . of cours the undertstand of idea and concept is veri import to succeed in a class , but the lack of fact could make the previou work just redund and less interrest . it stimul the student 's abil to understand better , and even more , to look foward to other subject or disciplin . to conclud , i think the understand of idea and concept , and the studi of fact are both import factor in the process of onc studi . howev , it is way more interest for student to learn fact , becaus it enabl them to have a better understand of what they alreadi know , and it also allow eventu them to put their vast rang of knowledg in practic .
