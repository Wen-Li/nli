mani peopl hold the view that product are as good as they seem to be in advertis . i do not agre with them and i am go to explain now the reason that support my point of view . as far as i am consid , advertis use to emphas too much their product . they tri to show it as it were the best onj of the market . let take televis advertis . normal , they present their product with relax music , show their best characterist , in a nice atmospher , to name a few . peopl at home imagin himself with thi product and say : '' oh ! how beauti would be my life if i buy it . .. '' we do n't realiz that they are cheat us . howev , peopl are not silli either stupid and know that the product it is not as good as it appear . from my point of view , children are not as strong as adult and tend to believ that true . that is whi befor christma there are som mani play and doll advertis . take mi sister for exampl . she is nine and last summer said that she want a new doll she watch onj t.v.for her , it wa the best one . it wa fantast . my parent bought it as a bithday present . after some day , she realiz it wa not so fantast as it seem in the t.v. adevertis . in conclus , i found unfair peopl 's behaviour supli their product but , i can also understand them . in a suppli and demand market everyth is allow they need to earn money to live and that 's a differ way to do it . each one surviv as well as it is possibl .
