the problem of the pollut is one of the most one of thi centuri . one import caus of thi problem is the substanc that the car trasmit in the air and so it is necessari to find a solut . accord to me , twenti year are not suffici to reduc a lot the number of car but thi is the onli way to solv the problem . in itali the public transport are not alreadi the best way for go somewher . a lot of student or worker have infact to use the car becaus the mean of trasport are not effec or there aren t ani . to see few car on the road so , the governa have to do a seriou politici to increas continuosli buss , subway . .. nowaday in fact the traffic is get higher and higher also becaus everi famili ha two or three car , to reach the place of work or studi and onli with adegu and not much expens mean of trasport the car will left home . so , as the traffic is increas from past to today , will continu to increas also in the futur if the governa wouldn t be abl to stop thi cycl . but also the behaviour of common peopl have to chang to solv the problem . if someon have to reach a near place may go on foot or use the bicicl instead use the car for do 100 metr . moreov special in the biggest citi as milan , where the public trasport are effic , peopl sholdn t use car to move in the citi . so , accord to me it will be veri difficult to see less car in the nex futur becaus the goverman have not onli to increas the public trasport but also to chang the mental of a lot of peopl .
