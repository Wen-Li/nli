i disagre that succes peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know . becaus tring new thing are veri diffcult . if peopl get a lot of money from success someth , they should n't tri new thing . they should expand a job which same categori from befor they success . first , i would like talk about whi it is difficult that peopl who sucsess own job tri a new job which they do n't have ani skill and knowledg about it . i think if autal diffar categori job , peopl who tri to new categori 's job need much time to make a base . now , our world wa develop with technolog , so speed is veri import for work . if take a much time , it might br bad effect . second , it 's difficult to paticip new categori 's job , becaus there are mani compani alreadi . of cours , those compani have had better skill . thay also have good relationship each compani even though they are enemi . for exampl . my friend eho ha a own compani which is it success on hi job , but after that , he build a new compan which is model product . he lost hi money . becaus he did n't know the relationship about other compani , so other compani hit hi compani . therefor , i disagre that succces peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than doimg waht they alreadi know .
