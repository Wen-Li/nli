there are to much product in the world . so it is impors to count them . although some product are use in the same way , they made by differ compani than they will look differ . i strongli agre with most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , i have some exprienc of my own . for exampl , one day i wa shop with my mother . then we see there is a mp3 player it look veri cool . of cours , i will ask my mother to buy it for me . than my mother said it just look cool , it not use than you think my son . but i still not give up , i said we can ask the seller the mp3 is good or not . of cours you will get the answer - the player is good to use . than i get the mp3 . after i use it 3 day , it does't work ani more . i told my mother than she said am i right ? whi do n't you believ me that time . so , if do n't want to buy some just look good ? we can get some inform form your friend whose have a product you want to buy . becaus your firend ha use the product for mani time than he/sh konw it is good not not . and if you do n't ha some friend have some product you want to buy . you can buy the product by some famou compani , like soni , microsoft and ani other compani . becaus they famou , that mean they make good product . so , buy thing do not just look they are face . ask help for the seller it is good or not is also not a good way . we can ask the seller some inform from it . but do not ask good or nor
