one could wonder if , in twenti year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i person think , that becaus of a lot of factor we will explor , thi statement is not ag on my way to thi test thi morn i wa abl to read a copi of the ` le mond ' newspap . insid it , an articl state that the state of california ha decid to cut down on co2 ga emiss by take car manifactur to court . the reason i mention thi articl , is that it state that there are about 36 million car in california for about 35 million houshold . in my opinion california is one of the best exampl of a region in which the use of the car is essenti in order to be abl to move around it vast territori . but california is also the most prosper of all american state and therefor can demonst to us the type of situat that could aris if a countri develop to such a scale and therefor had thi type of need for car . it ha becom common knowleg , or fear , or inde both for mani peopl , that in twenti year , china will be a lot more prosper that it is today . if we just consid the fact that it gdp grow of 7 % a year , we could say that by 2026 , china would have equal california 's prosper . what make me tend to refut the propos statement , is the fact that china ha a popul of about 1 billion , thi would probabl equat to about 400 million household and therefor potenti about 350 million car need by a new prosper popul to wonder through their vast countri and citi . i am of cours not state that china is a car free environ at the moment but the increas with the volum of car the countri experi today would be monument . furthermor , one would have to consid other grown economi such as india . europ is satur with car and effort are made in order to diminish pollut by increas altern mean of transport . but thi is possibl becaus the territori are rel small in comparison to immens such as india or china . one could also say that , as demograph are increas , there will alway be more peopl on earth , until we final destroy it , and therefor more potenti car driver and buyer as a whole . it must also be point out that , sinc the apparit of the ford t model in the 1920 , the first afford and mass produc car , the car ha becom an object that simbol liberti . no indic seem to show that , in a near futur , men will invent a new symbol and vector of liberti to replac the car . if they do , the psycholog aspect gone , and onli the practic aspect of own and drive a car remain , we might wit an increas in altern transport method and therefor car usag would slowlz decreas . howev , it is veri ulik that thi will happen dure the next twenti year , and even if it did , that twenti year will be enough to wit a drop in car usag . a chang of peopl ' psycholog take time . final , one ha to point out that the arguement that petrol will not be avail in a coupl of decad is not valid . firstli , thi theori ha been enounc mani time and new petrol reserv are be found day after day . secondli , new energi suppli are be develop , such as the biometr fuel or the eletr car . the car may be cleaner and even potenti out of date in twenti year , but , as far as the propos statement is concern , there will not be fewer of them on a global scale , as long as there will be more human and more econom groath on thi planet .
