fewer car in twenti year ? do you realli think there will be fewer car in a time of a rais economi ? i do n't think so for 3 reason . firstli , the world ha 60 billion peopl and it wo n't stop rais . the number of peopl all over the world will increas . the economi will also increas . my person infer is that more peopl need more car , and the graph of the world popul support my opinion . secondli , peopl have to be more flexibl , it 's a major point in everi job . in today job for exampl you have to travel from berlin to munich daili . you do n't would like to fli becaus it 's to expens , so you have to drive . in my mind there is a big import in bee flexibl , therefor you need to have a car . if you do n't have one you could easili loos your job . do you like loos your job ? thirdli , the car manufactur are aim to sell more car as they are do right now . that 's the goal of everi entrepreneur . they are do everyth to increas there car . they will design and manufactur new model . perhap a new brand will start up . they are reach new potenti custom in third world countri . so for exampl lancia did , they produc veri cheap car for poor peopl . all thi lead into a increa number of car . in conclus , i say that it 's nearli imposs to decreas the amount of car . there is onli one big problem , the oil ressourc , but we have veri good scholar to invent new altern mobil without the need of oil . i am veri excit how the futur is go on .
