i person agre with thi statement and hope to justifi my opinion by the follow reason and exampl . firstli , the idea and concept are the origin of the fact . for exampl , if some one understand idea or concept then he can make a research and experi . if thi prove that thi idea appli the real data then he can argu that it 's a fact . secondli , when we talk about fact , in effect we talk about constant thing . in other word , no one ha the encourag to search in thi fact `` the door is close '' . but if he ha an idea he ha the freedom to extent it into anoth field . thirdli , the person who interest with idea and concept ha the abil of think more than the person who just keep some idea in hi memori becaus the first one do n't know what is the end and he will contenu tri to find thi idea . for exampl , when a profesor talk about nonotechnolog , he alway mention the idea micro-robot and the scholar who interest in thi idea endeavor to use thi idea to treat the cancer by some way . final , special or major of a student in some field or scienc need to idea , becaus if he want to write hi thesi or project in thi field must do some new but who can gain acadim degre by discov some fact , if thi method of graduat will have a few profesor . butif you like to have thi acadim statu you must interest in idea becaus they are the key of futur and way to invent .
