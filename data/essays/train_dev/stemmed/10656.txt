i total agre with the statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . in our life , we have a lot of chanc to face to the delimma situat . sometim we will follow the indicat by peopl who have the same experi and know the best answer . howev , sometim we just take a chanc even we know it might have some risk . in my opinion , i support that we should take chanc in tri new thind . first and foremost , everyday we will meet numer of new thing . if we alway just fellow the rule that were given by other , we would miss a lot of chanc to learn thing by ourselv . for exampl , when i wa child , i alway copi the essay from my sister , becaus i know she alway get high grade than me . but after i grew up , i tri to write by myself , to my astonish , i found that writ is a such interest thing . moreov , i can learn new vocabulari and skill from writ . if i did not do it by myself , i would never find the fun of writ . second , we will never know the result , it might be good or be bad . it is life , is not it ? it is more impress if the result is came from ourselv . we can learn from the bad result and never do it again . also rememb the good result in mind , next time when we meet the same situat , we know the answer . futhermor , after tri new thing and get good result , the feel of satisfi is the most wonder feel in the world , everytim i make a right dicis , i will veri proud by myself and talk to everybodi to share my joy . even some of my friend wil be encourag . in conclus , i think take chanc when tri new thing carri more weight than do what they alreadi know how to do .
