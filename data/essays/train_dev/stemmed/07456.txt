today , mani advertis are in the world . therefor , i agrre that most advertis make product seem better than they realli are . i have two reason . first , advertis are cheaper than real product . it is becaus they are not real . in addit , they are easili to make them . if i could not buy real product becaus of money , i could buy advertis product . in china and korea have a lot of them . therefor , mani visitor to asia think that they can buy mani of them with low cost . second , they look like similar to real product becaus they mimic real product . for exampl , when i have a advertis product , nobodi notic . paticular , young peopl in japan want real brand good , but they are veri expens , so japanes young peopl buy mimic product . they do not care about use them , and they thik onli visual . for these reason , i think that it is good that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
