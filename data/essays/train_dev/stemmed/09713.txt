i agre with the statement porpous in wich is stablish that for student it is more import to undertand idea and concept than learn fact . i do have to be clear say that fact are not as import as concept and idea are , but fatc are not secundari thing without impot they are realli importat in ani learn process . i say thi becaus i am student and i can now be sure that when a teacher begin explain fact without a theori befor that includ differ concept and idea , the class is realli a lack of time , becaus student mayb understand the fact but do not realli learn the theori that it is behind of it . althouht it is also inconvini for learn , when whe as student onli reciv concept and idea but no fact or exampl that explain what the teacher is tri to explain , becaus in thi way possibl we learn a teori but we wo n't be capabl of uss it . a clear exampl of thi matter it is when you tri by yourself to read a law , for sure will be veri difficult to understand what is regul , but when a teacher give you some fact it is much clear and you realli understand what is that law tri to regul . final i do have to accept that when a teacher use fact that realli ecourag student . so i think i is clrear that concept are veri import but thet sholud be accompai
