i agre to the statement that young peopl nowaday do not care much about their commun . the chang of how peopl think is the major reason for thi problem . first of all , mani youngster nowaday spend much of their time do their own thing , therefor they do not have time to think about their surround . for exampl , mani young peopl want money , so they spend a lot of time on do job . so , they leav home earli , and they come back home late . moreov , young peopl today are becom extrem lazi . they would rather do someth which they can be satisfi in the short-term , rather than the long-term . there are mani home today with televis and comput , so young peopl stay in their home reffer to watch televis than help their commun . these new technolog keep the young peopl in their home . final , the new gener of peopl are selfish . they would not volunt to do anyth if they do not reciev someth . even at school , a child would not help teacher move book unless they get a candi . a young teenag would not do chore if he doe not get an allow . overal , young men and women today must be satisfi with themselv befor think of other . it will take a fortun to be satisfi with oneself , so eventu , young peopl will end up do noth to help their commun .
