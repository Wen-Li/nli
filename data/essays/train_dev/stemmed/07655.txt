i strongli disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . eventhough organ tour are usual cheaper and more conveni , i think travel by your own is a richer experi for sever reason . the first reason of my belief is that organ tour bring you to the most tourist site . these place are over-crowd by other tourist , and as a matter of fact , attract also mani local merchant that sell small commod at expens price on all your way . for exampl , in my trip to china , the tour guid show us a part of the great wall call `` badal '' . the place wa full of peopl , i could hardli walk up the wall , it wa veri unpleas ! on a second trip , i went myself to anoth point of the great wall , which wa further to the citi than badal , but there were much fewer peopl . also , the sceneri wa much more spectacular . the second reason whi i hate organ trip is that you do n't have the choic of the timet . everi visit is precis schedul and we should not stay overtim otherwis the bu or tour guid would leav you at the point it drop you . a visit of the louvr museum in pari is not worth if you can onli appreci the `` mona lisa '' paint , and not contempl the other , less famou , paint . last but not least , i strongli believ that the most interest part in travel is when you make contact with the local peopl . in my trip to foreign countri , i learn a lot through the visit of the countri , but i also learn mani thing about the cultur through convers with local . it may be disgust to see chines peopl split in the street . but onc you understand that they do that to reject bad element ( such as those come from pollut ) instead of keep them in their bodi , you may find it smart or at least understand . commun with peopl , that is how you begin to respect their cultur . to conclud , as per my experi , i alway recommend peopl to make a trip by their own and not with a guid . thi is the best way to discov , understand and respect a cultur .
