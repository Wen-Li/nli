i agre partli . the whole situat chang from time to time and through the global there have been a lot of import chang in societi . young peopl definetli have more possibl to spend their free time for thing they realli like and therefor one could easili say that there is a big chang in the behaviour of young peopl . furthermor life becom faster and that is whi everybodi , not onli young peopl have to think better how and whi they do the thing they do and if it is the best they can do . besid that it differ from age , religion and place in societi how activ or passiv young peopl are in their commun . my own experi are that i myself help a lot in my commun and lot of my friend do so too . an other point one have to have in mind is how the young peopl feel in the commun . if they are happi with the world around them the help of the young peopl is logic , but if they have no friend and fun at work it is logic that they are not will to help the commun and prefer to sit in their room next to the comput or televis . besid that the govern could tri to make help and work of young peopl more public , so that the young peopl can see , that they can help and perhap can have a better feel throughout that , what they have done . for me it would be import to show which goal young peopl can reach . final it seem as if young peopl are lazi and do not give enough time to help their commun , but in my opinion noth chang and noth will chang . there will be young peopl who help and there will be young peopl who doe not do so .
