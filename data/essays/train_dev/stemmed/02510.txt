in my view the success depend on the area where he is work t. so , i beliv `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi they know how to do well '' is true in some case and it is not better in some other case . firstli , take a sport man in to concider he should adopt some new method to improv hi skill in hi game rather than tri for some other game . so here the sport man is suggest to carri hi carrier in the same field without go to other field and take risk . on the other hand , let us see how the success come from the new thing . for exampl , white brother invent aeroplan as it is new to the world they were prais by the world . and later sever peopl have made some improv to that and those peopl who made improv to aeroplan are not so much prais as the white brother . thi is becaus the basic and the idea is given by the white brither and the other just have made some modif . those peopl who have made some improv also may get fame but not to the extant the white brother got . the peopl those who follow the procedur given by other may not get suc as much as the peopl who give the basic idea . we should note that go for new thing give succ but it may or may not be chang the field of intrest . in softwar field they need to chang their domain frequent to give their best output . so here they need to tri for new thing and take risk . they need to chang from one domain to other veri frequent . in conclus , the thing give success if it is new and it dos'nt matter it is hi new area or not . so , in some case improv their field is prefer and in some case goin for new thing is prefer
