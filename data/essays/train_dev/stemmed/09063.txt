i agre that the most advertisemnet are actaulli make product seem to be much better than they realli are . one of the reason which it make are when the market system are cover up with larger and better advertis , then peopl will buy them more and more that make the higher protest and so as their compani and also store . the other reason is in our live almost commerci are make peopl to think of someth or buy depend , so each commerci are tri to catch your eye and catch your attent , and that is whi mani compani in theseday are say onli good thing and show out too much lie becaus of make more money . i realli do n't understand how thi societi ha becom like thi , liyng just for money and alway peopl talk about bill how it goe all those kind of stuff . what if peopl figur out that , they wo n't buy product anymor becaus thier quiliti is n't good and it 's diffrent than what commerci say . howev then comani will make better advertis to catch their attent again and when peopl do n't buy those product anymor then they will be do sameth again , over and over . as i said . ye i do agre for thi statement and therefor to me compani should make fair and true advertis so the societi can stop wast money on bad product by cover up advertis .
