i disagre with travel in a group led by a tour guid . scins i would rather be alon than do someth with other , i wouldnot like to be in a group . first , i would rather go wherev i want with what i feel that time . i love to adventur to the place where i have never been or had never known . tour with some tour guid are gener plan by them . it may prevent me to do someth i want . plan thing do not suit to me . moreov i am not a veri time person . therefor i am afraid that i would not be abl to be on time . second , i like to enjoy by myself , which doe not mean i do not like peopl though . of caus , there are mani benefit that as be a member of tour group . the tour guid may explain a lot of infornm abd detail such as what kind of place they are , or these histori and what is famou for . i am sure it would greatli help my tour fantast , but i would rather than find new thing by my own . i believ that it is so much excit and i can enjoy my tour more as discov . as be in tour group , i might feel like i am watch from other peopl everi time . i might not enjoy much becaus of thi feel .
