there are two common way to travel now . one is travel in a group led by a tour guid ; the other one is go by oneself . they both have their own advantag . the choic might depend on travel ' own abil and person . i know travel with a group and a tour guid ha been mostli accept by peopl . peopl who chose thi way are like travel to the place with long histor or curtur back ground like china europ without the knowledg about them , so they need a guid . they may have no special need such as the diet of food , the room condict , the schedul of plane or stay at one place they most like for more time . moreov , travel with a group will help peopl , especi lazi one , to get rid of book the hotel , find some where to have meal or even which place they should go . compar with the way abov , as a person with more person and need , i reather to travel by myself or with my best friend . firstli , i think the most interest step of a whole journey is not stay at the place you travel to but the process of plan for the whole trip . imagin that you can sit arround a tabl with hot coff , think of how love the period of the trip will be and discuss or argu with your friend about where you guy should go . that 's veri attract to me . secondli , i love natur view more than histor build , so i can total go to a place that doe n't need be far , done n't need a guid there or even doe n't have a name . i can enjoy the view and take pictur of that , and share thatwith my friend . i can stay as long as i wish to and go anywher i like for my next station . without feel hurri , without feel be contral , the two word in my mind are relax and freedom . that is the mean of travel , is n't it ?
