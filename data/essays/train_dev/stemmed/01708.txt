i am disagre . i see those advantag of travel with a group use a tour guid : - you do n't have to lost time in move from a place to other place , - you can share your own experi with other peopl with the same object , - do n't get worri about get lost or be in danger place , - do n't have troubl with the languag , - make your day easi , becaus somebodi els is explain what you have in front of your face . advantag about travel by yourself : - know peopl from the citi , - see more the villag , walk next to the peopl , take the same air , eat the same food , - tri to learn a languag use some of their word , - be a travel where to learn their cultur will be the first object of your travel , - ask where and how to know more about the citi . i travel as part of a group use a tour guid and wa just a bad experi . you are so rigid to ani wish or activ you would like to do by yourself , for exampl : when you are travel with a group you have all the activ and the time depend of other person . there are travel organ by time where you onli get a citi go to tourist place and go back . you are travel as as tourist . i will prefer alway to travel as a travel , that make you more fun in your travel , you know more the citi , the peopl , the cultur and brief more the air of the citi or place you are visit . i wa travel a coupl of time in rome , the first time wa with myself , i took a guid then i wa walk around the citi and see all the tourist place and eat in italian small restaur . that wa wonder , i meet italian that then invit me to eat to their hous to see an italian hous , how they were live . with a group you will onli listen some experi but not livinng those experi . i like to travel a lot and alway i tri to travel with myself or not more to a friend in thi way we can enjoy and share our opinion . onli we need a backpack , camera and document . .. oh and money will help a lot .
