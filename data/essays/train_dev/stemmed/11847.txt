in my opinion it is not simpli to say , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i think it ha to be analys by differ view . clear , in gener the student should understand the idea and concept . becaus if they would not understand the idea and the concept , it 's to expect that they wo n't be abl to practizis the think , they should have learn . when the student get into the job , they have to reproduc what they learn in the univers or school . and if they onli know someth about fact , they can not be veri success in what they do . everi student should want to be success in hi job or in whatev he doe . if they do not care about what they do , they normal can not expect a life , what other student could have , caus the did a littl bit more . so i think , that it is the better way for all student to understand more then onli the fact of an individu topic . but there is anoth point of view . dure the time of school or univers , there are often time - period of test . some univers have test - period , where the student are forc to wright ten test a week . in that case , it is not possibl for everi student to understand all idea and concept . it is necessari for the student to finish all test in the best way it is even possibl . therefor , it could be a better choic to learn all fact , that you are abl to finish all test . i think thi is a typic problem for student , studi in the first semest . afterword , dure the main semest , the student have found their special theme , they want to work on . in that case , it is much easier for them to learn more about the idea and concept . in the main period of studium , it is much more import to understand the idea and the concept . so again , to understand the idea should be the task for everi student but it is to accept , that there could be moment , where it is better to use the fact , to get a better result .
