i realli agrea with the point that say most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in fact tey have to do that to attract the custom . as a custom , we have the choic to buy the item or not . as i said most of the time the usual product look much better than the are . everi comani or shop doe that . it is just part of their busi . the more they sell mean the more they are successful in their work , and in their busi . these kind of adertis becam normal and common in these day , even though there are a few copani say the right thing about their product as they seem . anyway , sinc we know that issu , and we are so famili with it , we should buy what is good for us . as we know each comani ha it own plan to attract the custom . in these day they even tri to call you , and introdus their item to you . you would see alot of advertis on internet , in newspap , in magazin . sometim you might even laugh , when you see someth is free . that thing happen to me , when i wa go to buy a cell phone , which ha a sticker on it say free . i wa supris , then i ask the seller he said it is not free , you just pay monthli or weekli as you like . we see strang thing that ha to do with markt , becaus everyon want to be the best . sinc that they tri to do anyth to show their item as they want . in my openion they have the right to make product seem much better than the realli are .
