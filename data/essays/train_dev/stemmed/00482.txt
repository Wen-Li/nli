i agree thi statement . first of all , consid with the physic aspect , young peopl have more energi than older peopl have . thi is simpl differ . the biggest differ between young peopl and older peopl is experi . thi experi is the most impot element for enjoy life . older peopl experi the life process for exampl , school , graduat , work , marriag , to have children and so on . needless to say yound peopl have not exprienc such kind of life experi . therefor everi singl thing toward them are complet new for young peopl . they are veri exsit to be exper them . the first time to exper someth is alway fun . howev onc peopl experienc someth . thi someth never be the first experi . to get to be familar with new thing make us to remov the feel of fun . by use anoth word , older peopl are surround by the thing which they had alreadi experienc . in thi circumsatnc it is difficult to find out ani passion and new feel . it is just normal for older peopl .
