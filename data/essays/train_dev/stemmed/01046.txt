enjoy life and profit of life are veri import . enjoy life for me doe n't depend on a specif age but it depend on will , circumst , money , health and a lot of other thing . if we take the point of will or look forward to enjoy life , we will get variabl situat and variabl result . for exampl there are young peopl who are full of fresh but they don ' have the will of enjoy life and i am one of those . iam 28-years-old , i am think all the time about problem especi my problem and my ambit without pay attent that i am lose a lot of time in stress and calcul with no result and in the same time i am not enjoy at all my life . in the same time i am astonish from my grand father who is 82-years-old and he is enjoy everi singl moment of hi life . sometim , the circumst of the life doe n't allow us to profit from life . for exampl i know some peopl who can not enjoy their live due to a uniqu reason which is : ( work ) , the word seem so simpl and we can ask ourselv how can work can block like thi the sens of enjoy life ? it 's so simpl when you work between 9 and 12 hour per day you ca n't realli enjoy becaus you do not have time and your brain becam format onli to work . i think that there are a lot of young healthi peopl who can not enjoy their life due to their work . in the same time there are other young and old peopl who have the prioriti of enjoy life without think in work . other point that can influenc our sens of enjoy life is money . some peopl , enjoy life for them is depend essenti on money , becaus for them they can not enjoy without travel , without buy luxuri car and hous and thi part of peopl is includ young and old peopl so it doe n't depend on age . the last and the most import point for me is : health . a person who is sick or with bad health condit , can not have a good qualiti of life and as a rsult of thi he can not enjoy life even if he ha the will and money . on the contrari of a person in a good health can enjoy hi life easili with littl bit of money and will . to summarize-up for me enjoy life doe n't have an age but we can say it ha a soal .
