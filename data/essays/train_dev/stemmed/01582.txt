befor decid which side i will stand , i would like to querri what is defin as success peopl . if success peopl mean peopl who made a big advanc in our life , i agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk . howev , if success peopl mean peopl who live well do their job well , i think success peopl are those who onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . first , you should know the histori of human 's first explor of the moon . i think the peopl who were involv in that moment event are those who are success . unless did they plan to travel to the moon and enact their plan , we could have made no progress in our knowleg of the univers and our technolog in relaion to aironaut . with respect to human knowleg advanc , i believ that success peopel are those who tri to do what ha not been done . second , i even can observ how peopl move toward what they want . for exampl , my husband make seemingli unfeas thing possibl . when he face a barrier , such as dealin , facil unavail , and job open , he tri evey mean . he call to compani that do not announc ani jod \ b open . but , he advertis himself and get a posit . he enjoy hi way of life , which seem to make him as a success person . howev , i also can find peopl who live well without a big challeng . for exampl , medic doctor seem to live well follow well-defin path . although they have to studi had in roder to get into a medic school , i think they do not have to tri new medic procedur . on the ready-establish path , they are consid as success peopl . in sum , it is difficult to devid peopl into success and unsuccess peopl accord to whether they tri new thing and take risk or not . rather than , i think success peol could be defin accord to whether individu live the way of life they valu . if a person who pursu take a risk live by tri new opportun , he would be a success person . if a person who pursu a challeng live in a way that is alreadi establish , he would not be consid as a success person .
