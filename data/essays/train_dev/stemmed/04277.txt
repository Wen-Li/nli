i complet agre with the statement that it is more import to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact . the follow reason explain better my opinion . i think that understand idea and concept present some advantag . in fact , if you learn the fact but you do not understand the concept behind the fact , probabl after no mani time you will not rememb the fact yet . inste , if you realli understand the concept , in your futur probabl you will not rememb the specif fact but you will rememb the most import idea of the argument . so , you have to learn fact onli after you understand concept . the fact that student do not understand concept ha two differ caus first , usual in the exam student ha to explain onli the fact ; so learn onli the fact is easier than understand the concept . then , i think that to understand the basic idea student need a realli good professor , becaus it is difficult to understand them by textbook . final , i believ that if you realli understand the concept behind the fact , you can put them in practic better . if you learn onli the fact , you can not therefor i think that you can understand whi i believ that student first have to understand the concept and the idea , and then the fact . in conclus , i think that thi statement is true not onli for student , but for everyon in gener . usual it ha more valu for a student , but it is a right statement for everyon becaus i think that it is alvway better , in everi situat , understand the concept than the detail .
