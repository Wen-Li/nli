in my opinion the best option is to have knowledg of mani academ subject . it mean to belong gener cultur that could be use in a day-lif time . it mean you can speak and keep a convers on differr varieti of topic with a lot of peopl , even if some of them are not belong to your class or to your cultur or religion . even to find a posit on the job market is easier becaus you are not connect to specif compet area . in exampl i can mention the profess of the doctor and the dentist 's one . both have kind of prepar about medic notion and acknowledg of the human anatomi , but the doctor can choos hi special after the studi . befor , he gather mani inform about all the subject of link to the human bodi and then he will focu hi choic to work in surgeri , radiolog , gynecolog or ani other depart . dentist know from the veri begin what will be work on and their studi are focus on specif subject regard the mouth . and they will work as dentist , no other choic . you are tie up to the format you have receiv . on other hand , have a special knowledg of one subject allow them to be much more profession in shorter time . and probabl to reach the goal befor the other . but in a world where everi compani ha the need to get differ hi product , probabl they will requir a featur of suitabl in the mind of their employe . pass through a depart to anoth one with differ task requir an elast mind and could help you to better understand the interconnect problem between the product area . to conclud i would like to support my opinion with a strang person exampl . i am a n averag player of mani sport : tenni , volleybal , footbal , swim and mani oter els . i am not a pro in anyon of them but i can continu choos friend to play with . never say , sorri : i ca n't join you becaus i am not abl .
