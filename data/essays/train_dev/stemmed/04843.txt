to understand idea and concept is veri import , but not more import than to understand fact . at the contrari , i would say that the order in which they know both thing is the real point . i think that if you want understand fact , you need to know befor well idea that are at the base of them . behind the fact there alway are concept . that is whi when the student go to school , they need an educ from their parent befor . mainli the educ in famili is the base which teacher can build on . exactli like when it need the hous to built the roof . so , concept and idea , learnt when they were children , and improv by go to school , and read book and studi , must be strong and veri clear , to build the fact on . a veri good exampl is to studi histori . when a student studi histori , he/sh would need to know some clear idea , to understand well which are the caus of a war , which think and feel were involv to caus a war . when they know the idea , they will figur out easili the consequ of the act of the war , caus by idea . but especi , to understand the veri central concept of every-day life is import to live in harmoni with other peopl . they should know which are the right behaviour to live in their societi , and these they should learn by their parent , and by grow up with their friend . as a consequ , they will be abl to appli the idea to their life , and to transform the concept in act . howev , if they had understood onli the consequ of idea , the fact , they would not deepli have comprehend what there is behind them . in other word , if they know the caus , they can use them to figur out the fact . to sum it up , i think it is import for student to have a deep and strong background of idea and concept about central point of which are the right and wrong behaviour , and about evryth about the life in gener , to be abl to use them and transform in and understand the fact , for all the durat of their life .
