in my opinion , i think that a person ha to take some risk to reach a new posit : do thi , it ha the possibl to reach a new level of well , that could be reach onli by courag peopl . on the other hand , when a person tri new thing , is not shure that what is do is go to be the right choic , and in mani case he fail and , sometim , he lost everyth he have alreadi reach with fatigu . i think that a person have to go on and , mayb , could becam import , famou or rich , onli take risk : if someon choos to continu do what he alreadi know how to do well , certainli will not make mistak or big error , but it will rest a common person for all the life , ask himself what could happen him if he had choic the more difficult way . a latin poet of the third centuri b.c. said that everyon ha to pass sever problem and difficulti that we find in our ( short ) life to have the possibl ( not the shure ) to reach our right way and our happy . if we do not thi we 'll be forev a common person . in my opinion , we have to tri new thing and to take risk , becaus our life is realli short , and if we do not tri thi we 'll live forev with the doubt that mayb we had the possibl to becom someon import . do thi , even if we becom not an import person , we 'll be in peac with our ownself , and we 'll not have the doubt that mayb we had the opportun to chang our posit and also our life . so , conclud , i think is better make mistak and lose everyth we have , but , in everi case , tri to reach what we dream .
