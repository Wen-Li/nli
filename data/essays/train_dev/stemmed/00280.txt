i do not agre with the statement , state that broad knownledg of mani academ subject is better than to specifiy in one specif subject . i think it import to special in one specif subject . from my point of view it is import to special in one specif subject for mani reason as describ in the follow . first , if you specifi in one specif subject you will have a lot of knownledg of a specif subject in contrast to peopl who rather have a broad knownledg . so when a compani is look for a person who can solv a specif problem they would rather hire a specialist than a person who onli ha broad knownledg of a specif problem . anoth reason for special in one specif subject is the develop of our societi and the busi world . sinc there is increas competit between compani in all sector of busi . compani have to start specifi in order to gain all possibl ressourc avail on the market , for exampl . for thi reason , compani start look more for specialist on a specif subject rather than look for peopl with broad knownledg . howev , it is import that specialiy peopl do also have a littl knownledg of other subject too . for exampl , if a compani is look for a new employe it doe not hire the most special person . the compani wolud rather pick the most special person with the most broad knownledg . in my opinion it is import to know that broad knownledg of mani sectors/subject is import but it is even more import to specifi in a specif sector/subject . as a conlus you can say that it is not onli import to special in one specif sector/subject . at the same time it is also import to increas one 's knownledg in other sectors/subject .
