young peopl nowaday tend to play more than to work for their commun in almost develop nation like south korea , becaus they live under their parent ' roof . i think that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . firstli , they have to spend a lot of time studi , and secondli , are more irrespons than befor . first of all , in univers or colleg , the period of profession cours requir more time . for exampl , in order to be a doctor , you have to spend four year in univiers , anoth four year in graduat school , and last two year for a degre . for men who have to go to armi in certain countri like in south korea , men take a lot of time to be a fulli finish doctor . becaus the requir time had increas , young peopl can not help their commun until they finish their educ . furthermor , young peopl these day are more irrespons than befor . i do not have right to say that young peopl are not respons becaus i am still in middl school . howev , i can still see mani problem result among the young peopl . they tend to play more than work or studi their profess , and that is the reason whi there is so mani un-employ colleg student . my cousin sister said to me , for exampl , that major of student in univers play around on weekend , when they can use that time do use thing , such as commun servic program . becaus they just tend to play around , they do not get to be help with their commun . for these reason , i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . howev , i do not mean that it is their entir fault , yet they have to fix their behavior to play instead of to studi or to help their commun . becaus of the requir of men go to armi , men have to sacrifis their precious time of youth . i think that the south korean and other countri that requir to forc men in to armi have to make the polici voluntari instead of involuntari . then , i think the young peopl will give enough time to help their commun . thu , i think it would involv a lot of chang to let the young peopl to give enough time to help their commun .
