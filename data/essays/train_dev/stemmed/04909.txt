there are differ way to enjoy the life also you can enjoy the life in differ way at differ age . the youngest age is a wonder time of our life where we can live almost without worri or they are minimum . as a teenag the onli worri they can have are : what dress i am go to wear for saturday 's parti or whi my boyfriend doe n't call me yet . in contrast when we are adult the life came with differ respons : take care of our own famili , spous , kid , school , bill to pay , mortgag , car , famili vacat , ill of ani member of the famili , the list is huge and we can fill the full page with all these respons on an adult shoulder . but those are no reason to no enjoy the life on their way , live with all those worri . there are million of way that we enjoy life : get a new hous for the famili , we have to pay more , but the happi we give to our famili is priceless . we can take a famili vacat or a vacat just by yourself or go with a friend to that countri you alway want to go . simpl thing in our life make us enjoy and appreci everi minut we live , celebr a birthday , go shop with our favorit friend , go fish or golf in our day off . as a child life is easier to live and enjoy , but that depend where do you live , who do you live with , what do you do for your life . for sure , children live in a problemat home , with parent or brother alway in problem , they wo n't enjoy their childhood . from my own experi and person opinion , there is no age to enjoy life , it is not necesari to be young to have a happi life . i came from a well form famili where i could see the happi in my parent 's face . some young peopl live in continu parti , but . .. are they realli live and enjo their life ?
