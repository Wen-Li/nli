though some peopl think that it is more import for student to learn fact , i , person , perfer that for student to understand idean and concept are more import for the follow reason . first of all , in the math class , it ha a lot of formula that we need to use when we are solv the problem . yet , some student just mermor the formula and they do not realli understand whi thi formula come out . therefor , they will confus , when the question chang to which they are not familiar . in contract , student understand the idea and concept of the formula will help them easili to solv the question . that is whi most of math teacher spend a lot of time on teac the concept of the formula . second , student will easi to forget , while they onli know the fact ; becaus they onli mermor it . they do not know the idea or concept of the mea . for instanc , the comput program is a veri hard cours to some peopl , and they memor all the code in the program class and when they are type they onli can type the basic stuff . if they meet a more complex question then they can not do it , and they will forget the code veri soon , becaus they do not know how to use it . last but not least , the idea and concept are all made up from peopl . therefor , we can not just know the fact . onc we get the concept or idea , we will veri easi to know the whole thing , and we do not need to studi day and night for memorr whole book . although , thi is not to say learn fact are without the merit , i firmli beliv that it is import for student to understand idea and concept rather than just learn fact .
