everi day we can see a lot of success peopl in the street , in our school , in our place of work , in our hous . i think that success peopl have a lot of courag becaus gener they take their success from tri new thing , new solut , someth that nobodi have tri befor . it is a great risk becaus no one can know if a solut is good or no . the success of that peopl belong to thi courag . they have no fear to tri someth new . it is good but it is also danger becaus in some case it is more danger than pleopl can think . a lot of businn men are famou , rich and success becaus they tri someth new , and in a lot of case danger . in fact a lot of peopl lost everythink they have as consegu of their take risk . in the other hand do what they alreadi know is more simpli . some peopl prefer do someth that they alreadi know becaus they prefer to do it veri well even that do someth that they do n't know . if they do someth that they do n't know the ca n't do it veri well . in my opinion it 's import to find a compromis of these two idea . it 's import to tri new thing in order to becam success and it 's not suffici to do someth that is alreadi known . but it 's also import be careful and not to take risk that can be too danger . it 's import to think a lot befor do someth import for our success , and it 's also import to think about all variabl than we can find , and all the problem that we can find when we tri to do someth that we have never do befor . i say these thing becaus i am veri careful . i do n't be the kind of person that tri to do someth new without think about all consequ that the action can produc .
