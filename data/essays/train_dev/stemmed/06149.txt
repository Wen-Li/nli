overal i would disagre with thi statement , i believ that travel on an independ basi is more reward even if it is more challeng . i usual like to do my homework beforehand about place i want to visit and plan it myself to a certain extent . i am veri much interest in the histori of place i am visit as well as the local cultur of the inhabit , therefor i prefer a travel formula that maximis my interacion with these local resid . thi plan and interact with peopl will enrich the trip mani fold versu go with a group led by a tour guid where the inform one would receiv is prepar and digest and then present to the travel . i have travel to southern spain mani year ago , i had plan my trip to a certain extent onli and i discov mani locat that were not point in tourist pamphlet , just by walk down the street and talk to peopl . thi is what i call the surpris effect of trip , see the unexpect by go place not necessarili frequent heavili by tourist , thi allow me to interact in a more person way with local resid of area i am visit and have a better feel of the life of these peopl . travel indep give me more control over my time , i can manag it the way that work better for me , i can stay longer in a place if i deem necessari , or i can just pack up and leav to `` greener pastur '' if i get bore in a particular locat . also there is the financi aspect of it , i find it more cost effect to travel on your own than with a tour guid . i can choos to settl in less expens hotel and have my own agenda as far as meal are concern dure my trip . of cours go on a loner basi may pose some challeng and mayb some risk in certain situat but overal it is a much more interest and reward approach .
