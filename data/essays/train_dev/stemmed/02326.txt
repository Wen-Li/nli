unfortun i am not total agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . it is for sure that success encourag peopl to discov or invent new thing but if there is risk i am not sure that everi peopl would be courag enough . after know how to succeed feel some peopl would like to live with it instead of tri new thing and have risk to fail on it . it is obviou that if you can not take risk you can not success . but risk is someth you can take mostli when there is noth you can use . for instanc think about a director who had won oscar prize . now he did the best at hi work and now peopl all over the world know him and expect a lot from him . the hardest movi he can make is hi next movi . sinc he alreadi is known as best and he ha to be the best for rest of hi live . but what if he want to direct anoth kind of movi than he alway do ? and what if he fail ? you think he can be that courag to risk hi famou for just to do hi ambit . i think not mani peopl would do that . .. but on the other hand if peopl keep do same thing then who go to discov or invent or tri new thing ? onli the young peopl or the peopl who never had got award yet ? but what about experi then ? experi is import to success someth . to put it in a nutshel i would like all success peopl tri other thing than they had alreadi done . that is how creativ can improv i think . but also i dont believ most peopl can take risk .
