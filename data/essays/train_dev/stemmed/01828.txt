today in japan , i think some young peopl dont help their commun . i think it is becaus they are not interest in their live . some peopl say that they dont have much time to spend help commun but i think those are just the reason whi they dont want to do it . so i think they should be interest in their commun and give enough time to help their commun to see their live again . some commun have some problem . i think the most biggest common problem is the environ . i am interest in these environ so i do want to know about these problem and want to think what i can do for commun . these environ problem are veri import today i think , becaus those are depend on our live and they are rel to our futur live . so i think that peopl have to consid about these problem again of cours , but young peopl should be in mind these problem becasu young peopl will make our futur life so that they should give enough time to help thier comminuti . these a littl help can make our commun better . have siad that , some peopl against my idea becaus studi or play sport or do what they like are also import . howev , i think young peopl can give more time to help consid their commun becaus young peopl 's infulu are veri big so that if they more pay attent to their commun , i think their commun will be better . in conclus , young peopl should see thier live again and they should consid what they can do for the futur . so i disagre with thi statement .
