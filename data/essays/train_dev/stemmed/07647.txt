mani peopl think that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . after weigh the pro and con , i will argu in favour of thi opinion . first of all , i believ it is necessari to mention the main purpos of an advertis : it is use to sell a product . in that way , the advertis ha to be origin , that is what i person think , color to involv peopl to pay attent to it and to the product , and sometim humourist . today , there are a lot of agenc which creat advertis . thank to the develop of comput , the agenc can use new effici techniqu to launch an attract ad . but they do not care about the truth . .. secondli , the messag said in the advertis is also veri import . for instanc , agenc tri to prove that without thi product you can no longer live ! you must absolut buy it ! they also aim to prove with a well-inv sentenc that the product is not expens when refer to it incred advantag ! a messag that i realli hate is the follow : `` more white than white '' . natur it is use to describ the effect of a powder . i can not help think that such an ad is a lie . in thi case , the advertis make the product much better than it realli is . .. i find use to underlin that a great number of `` discount product '' in supermarket have a veri good tast , for instanc , and yet have not necessari been the object of an ad . after close examin the abos argument , it is clear that i do not agre with everyth creat by advertis agenc . ye they have to develop a good imag of the product , but unfortun , it goe too far . i like watch ad on tv or even in the street , but i alway be reluct to buy product whom ad seem to exager .
