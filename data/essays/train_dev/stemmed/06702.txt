i think it depend on individu 's prefer . someon like to trip in a group led by a tour , and other do not . i 'm a person of the latter type and i disagre with that statement . i do n't like to travel in a group led by a tour guid , becaus travel in a group led by a tour guid will depriv flexibl from the trip . it is true that reli on a tour guid is comfort . someon should think that even plan where to visit is bother . a group trip led by a tour guid is suitabl for such a person . tour guid are profession to plan and to travel safe . the trip led by a guid should be easi and safe . travel in a group led by a tour guid , howev , lack flexibl in the plan . in some citi , there are too mani famou place , and travel are forc to choos some from them . in london or new york , for instanc , we have to spent three or four day in a museum if we tri to see everi thing exhibit there . in such a case , travel should obey the plan of the tour if they particip in a tour led by a tour guid . a peopl who are especi interest in art and want to stay longer at a museum should prefer travel freeli . sometim i chang my plan dure a trip . when i visit germanani when i wa an undergradu student , i plan to visit five citi dure the one week trip . at the first place i visit , howev , i wa so impress by the beauti scene of a river and castl that i chang my plan and stay there for one week . consequ , i visit onli one citi dure the trip . when we travel , we often encount impress scenari or event at the place we visit dure the trip . travel in a group led by a tour guid do not allow us to chang the plan stay there for longer time than we plan befor .
