i agre with the argument that within twenti year the number of car in use will decreas compar to the current situat for a varieti of reason . to begin with , almost all of the peopl who are use car and even public transport to go to work , and surprisingli even the one who rare goe out , complain about the overabund of car on the road . a lot of car mean a lot of traffic and nois , henc a lot of time spent while tri to get to one place from anoth . those factor put stress on peopl and so make use of car an undesir thing for them . secondli , peopl are awar of the fact that extens use of car caus air and nois pollut . that probabl explain whi some citizen had alreadi left big citi for out-of-c area where there is few pollut and nois . as peopl becom more consciou about the environment effect of extens use of car , i guess they will give up drive and shift to altern way . anoth reason , which is connect with the reason i mention about so far , is the increas invest of local govern and municip on public transport . subway in that sens is a good solut as it bring the heavi load of traffic underground and allow for quicker and safer transport for peopl . as public transport network becom wider , peopl will give up drive for a shorter and safer time on road . and the last reason i want to mention is the rapidli increas price of oil . for the last coupl of year there ha been a sharp increas in oil price becaus of global econom situat and the iraq war . furthermor , the oil resourc are not as much as to meet peopl 's demand for mani more decad . as a result of those , the increas in oil price becom inevit . becaus peopl 's budget do not increas at the same rate with oil price , they will use their car less , eventu caus a decreas in the number of car . in the light of the reason i mention abov , i believ that peopl will shift to public transport and final the number of car in use will be fewer than today .
