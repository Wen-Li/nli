i believ that is more import to understand idea and concept . i think so becaus it is import to learn how to handl problem and not to know everyth . the first reason is that in later time there is everytim the possibl to look a fact up in a book . so for exampl if do not know a special word you can look it up and it will take onli some minut . so it is not veri import to learn all the fact in school or in univers . an other aspect is that in real life especi in work there are normal other problem as in univers . so it is possibl that you have learn all fact but can not solv the given problem . so you will not get your work done well . but if you understood the concept you are abl to handl the situat and find a new solut . third the work in later job is so special that it is not possibl to learn these fact in detail at univers . for exampl in geolog you can not learn everyth you need for mine . the concept is the import point . it is also possibl that a student will work after univers in an other sector . it is today not unusu to get get a job for exampl in a bank if studi law befor . in thi case you do not need the special knowledg but structur how to work effici . final univers should give student the possibl to do research on new area of scienc . there will be no new project or e.g. a new medizin when onli fact are import . through understand the main idea , concept and structur student can reach new possibl and goal . so to conclud , of cours , thi doe not mean that fact should not be taught . but in the later life the structur and main idea will be more help . so it is more import for student to understand thi then learn all the fact .
