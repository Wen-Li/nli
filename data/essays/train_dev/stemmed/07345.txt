there are , inde , a vast number of way to succeed in life . some may make attempt to immit what the previou hero have done in order to be as success as they were , and some may do onli what they alreadi know how to do well . howev , there may be some other who tri new thing and take risk in their action . although all the way of becom success in life mention previous may seem reason , i believ that the genuin success peopl tri new , uniqu thing that no one els ha ever done in histori , and thi can be support by use the exampl of some sport , and how some new idea can influenc the success of the team in it entireti . firstli , do what peopl alreadi know how to do well mean that it lack in origin and uniqu . thi impli that what peopl are do is not onli familiar to the peopl who are use the method , but also to the peopl around them . it is possibl to enhanc the understand of thi point of view with an exampl of a soccer game and strategi that the coach use in order to win a game . if the coach decid to use the strategi that he or she know well , it impli that the other soccer team would know how the player are go to approach the game , mean that it would make the player on the oppon team easier to predict the action that the player are go to take . thi propos that there is less chanc of succeed for the team that is use the familiar strategi to win . secondli , tri new thing can make not onli the peopl themselv confid and content with their own action , but also , the peopl who are watch them . in my opinion , the act of tri new thing is truli abl to caus a greater inspir on the audienc . although the act of tri new thing may be perceiv as be too adventur and experiment , i sincer believ that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well , base on my own experi in the real-lif situat .
