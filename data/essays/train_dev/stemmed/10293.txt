to a certain extent i agre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . in order to equip oneself with the basic inform on life , scienc and peopl , the knowledg about all the area is mandatori . i also beliv that after gain breadth of all the subject , one should persu some area of her interest in order to gain special . it is highli import to have broad knowledg of mani subject as most of the subject are inter-rel . the knowledg about one subject is need to understand the other subject . for exampl : scienc , in order to understand the concept of scienc the basic knowledg of mathamet is mandatori and thi knowledg of mathemat give a better perspect and vision of scienc . also , knowledg about mani subject help to understand other area of educ . a student special in mathemat would remain unawar of hi histotr background or would remain unawar about the law of natur if the basic educ of histori and scienc is not impart to him . the broad knowledg of mani academ subject also give an individu an opportun to identifi her area of interest . lack of knowledg on a subject would never expos a potenti student to that subject and he would remain unawar . when the broad knowledg of mani subject are import , it is also import to special in one area of interest to sustain in today 's competit world . in today 's era , peopl are highli competit and just the basic broad knowledg of subject would not earn a respect live . it is requir to special in one area and at the same time have the breadth of inform about other subject .
