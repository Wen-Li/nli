the relat between young peopl and the commun depend by the educ that they recev , and by that depend if they feel correct help their commun or not . the educ is made of experi and situat that a peopl live and of the peopl around her , so the commun in which she live . in the past the structur of our commun wa differ than the actual commun . i think that the structur of famili and the context in which it live have great import about thi theme . in the modern age with the develop of great citi , the group of live is n't more the villag , but a littl group that is the famili , it is now restrect . so we live in a world where there are a lot of famili in contrast each other , becaus all want the better for them . in thi situat we can see how the young peopl born and growth but overal how those one are educ . when a mother said hi son that he ha not listen what the stranger said him , and he ca n't go out alon , the child learn that all out of hi famili hi danger , so who live out of the famili ? , the commun . the church , for exampl , play an import role , infact it educ young peol in help the other , but in the modern societi , young peopl do n't believ more in the church , i think it is lose hi influc , and the commun is lose the educ that church can doe . final , as i said , the fact that young peopl help or not their commun depend from the educ that they recev dure their life , and in the modern soceti thi educ doe n't allow them to matur a feel of commun .
