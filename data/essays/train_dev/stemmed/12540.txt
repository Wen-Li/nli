it is often said that sell product honestli is the most import commerci norm . howev , i would like to maintain that effect advertis help the product approach to custom becaus i believ that packag product is more import than the product itself and advanc promot of the product must be crucial befor their launch in market . first , outer appear which can be describ as packag or design is realli import for custom . some of them may think highli of it rather than inner element . for instanc , we can wit modern econom concept of market . it give differ valu to product except the actual product qualiti . when we see the advertis of appl 's ipod or starbuck , we do not onli consid it flavor or tast , but their design , logo , symbol etc . for modern custom , design must be one of the import criterion . therefor , great advertis are realli import to custo second , a new product can not be welcom in market without appropri advertis . custom can not purchas the product unless they know it is now avail . it is a fundament function of advertis of a new product . on the other hand , i rememb a fall motor compani 's advertis dramat chang the compani 's fortun . that is korean kia motor compani . although it wa about to face a bankruptci , the compani 's advertis of a new model stimul custom ' buy desir . we can simpli see how effect advertis provid the compani with the opporun of surviv in competit market of motor compani . in summari , i would like to emphas how advertis are one of the fundament step as well as of the import choic of commerc . i am also confid that appropri advertis would result in unchang loyalti from custom .
