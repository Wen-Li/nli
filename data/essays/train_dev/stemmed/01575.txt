i do agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk . firstli they tri to reach new goal , but they also never refus to do someth . first , success peopl alway tri to reach new goal . thu thi is not becaus they are use to do someth well that they wo n't do anyth els and wo n't tri to find new achiev . for exampl , a man like antoin de saint-exuperi , who wa a famou french pilot dure the xxth centuri , alway tri new thing . he contribut to the open of the first french aircraft line , he risk hi life by search new road , by cross the atlant ocean with small aircraft , by fli on unknown area . .. he never thank that it wa profit for him to stay in franc teach how to drive a plane to student . that kind of person , who is for me veri success , alway tri to achiev new goal . moreov success peopl never resign to do somethimg when they have a precis aim , and that is one of the main reason of whi they have success . let us take the exampl of the member of a mountain rescu patrol . mayb for those who live in town they are not the most success person on earth , but it is not the same thing for those who live nearbi mountain , or for those who have been save by them ! they are take risk everi day to save peopl , they have a heavi train dure mani month , and if they do n't succeed to do one task , they will be ask to do it again and again , sometim in some extrem condit . they never refus to go search for a person , even if they have to risk their own life to achiev it . we all know that mani rescuer in mountain die by save peopl , which show us that they have n't resign . to conclud we have seen that success person are mainli the one who take some risk in their everi day life but moeover who never resign to achiev a task .
