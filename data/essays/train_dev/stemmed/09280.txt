accord to the statement , there should be knlowdg on the academ subject and should gain more knlowdg on special specif subject . ` i disagre the statement . accord to the passag there should have some knlowdg on other subject , than the special subject . for exampl take an electr student hi subject are total consid of electr , powerst , grid , capictor , insul , and etc .. , if he ha knlowdg o9n thi subject he can move forward for higher studi . if the subject for electr student he have materi manag , environment scienc , and etc .. , wat the use if he gain more knlowdg on thi subject . he cant for social subject r statisc r bank . i wont tell that the student should not have knlowdg on thi subject but he have to know som knlowdg on these subject . if he gain more knlowdg on the special subject ho will move on hi cours go forward for ani compit exam he will perform good and he will get score in that exam and he dont want to jump into other bank exam . and he keep hi intrest on hi special subject rather than hi the unspeci subject , he will becom topscor i ani xam and he might be famou all over the world and he is king of all contin . if he work same for the board knlowdg of mani academ subject as well as special subject he lost hi much time on the board subject . if he spent that time for special subject he gain more knlowdg and he can score top in that subject and he can be school first for ever . from conclus i give messag that keep knlowdg on the boar subject , but dont neglect that subject and keep hard work on the special in one specif subject for more knlowdg .
