undoubtedli , thi is one of the most trite debat that have taken part in the last decad . after dedic a big part of my energi to deal with thi so intric topic , i reach the conclus that the elect between special or multipli knowledg depend on a more deep debat , which is choos between good educ ( and here i refer to good with capit letter ) and econom success . postmodern era ha brought with it the problem of defi tradit view not onli about the organ of the world but mainli about the virtu of certain kind of knowledg . while in the ancient era it wa easi to grasp differ disciplin , the huge increas in the mass of scienc product that took place dure the xix and xx th. centuri realli difficult the possibl of deal with differ type of knowledg . today , it seem to be that certain disciplin are clearli priviledg in the market . special is not onli veri valu in compani ( that may need engin or market profession ) , but in the academ world . although it seem to be reason in term of effici ( the more you mechan know anyth about someth , the faster you find a solut or give a respons to a certain problem ) , it doe not appear to be the same when face unconvent or even life challeng . in thi last sens , i think that multidisciplinari knowledg can add valu to one 's educ . holist vision of situat may help to deal with more complex problem and may provid peopl with mental framework for act in differ scenario and in front of differ kind of peopl . my experi ha shown me that the more special you are , the more difficulti you find to understand problem that may go a bit beyond your perspect . moreov , you tend to see life through the len provid by the disciplin you are expert in . thi wa veri frequent for me at univers , where i use to talk to professor that tend to refus or discard theori that took idea from other area of knowledg . typic , for polit scientist all problem aris from polit , and from economist everyth ha to do with econom . it appear to be veri simplist my statement , but i realli had to pass over those situat when pursu a multidisciplionari degre ( intern affair ) and deal with phd professor from veri differ area . unfortun , thi surplu i perceiv in broad knowledg is not valu by market and , as i said befor , it may be almost legitim in term of rapid efect . howev , i do not think the debat is over . on the contrari , i think it will evolv in tandem with the evolut or cycl of human advanc . in the while , my curios and eager for realli understand all thi lead me to buy book on astronomi , zap between nation geograph and histori channel , or listen to religion lectur . so far , it ha been veri fruit for my life .
