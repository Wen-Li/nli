in the past , scientist use to special in a specif subject and keep go deeper and deeper in thi subject . nowaday mani scientist tri to learn more than one subject . for exampl , biologest tri to learn more physic and chemistri . i total agre with thi . scienc ha mani branch and these branch may interact with each other veri often . if a chemist want to make a new midicin he ha to know someth in biolog . otherwis , he will not be abl to make thi midicin . the same thing goe with physic and biolog . by studi more than one subject and tri to appli one subject in anoth one , scientist can make big devolop in differ field of scienc . new branch of scienc ha been discov by combin to or more branch of scinec togeth . biochemistri is an exampl of those new branch . biochemistri is give a big contribut in the frield of midicin . moreov , make new midic devic and artifici organ need knowledg in biolog and physic togeth . special in on subject onli will , definitli , narrow the contribut of the scientist to the societi . contribut as much as they can to the societi is the scientist goal . thef can have better chanc of reach their goal if the combin the knowledg of differ field of scienc . i also think that a scientist can speacial in one subject and he can also learn someth from the other branch of scienc . if thi scientist work with anoth scientist who ha anoth field of special , they togeth can make larger contribut to the scocieti . work in group and unit the knowledg is veri help in devolop the differ feild of scienc .
