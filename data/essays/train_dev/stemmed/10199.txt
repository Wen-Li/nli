the issu of whether young peopl nowaday contribut enough time to help their commun is a controversi one . while the observ of the behavior of a few individu might indic so , i believ that the opposit is true firstli , as a nativ of a underdevelop countri , i wa abl to observ poverti and felt the need to do someth about it . both colleg and univers , i join a group of student that regularli went to local shanti town and help in differ way . someth i especi recal from that experi wa the fact that whenev i share thi interest with other friend , they also express their interest and were , in mani case , will and abl to contribut and help . the same happen to me a few time with adult , but in gener thi wa not the case . i acknowledg the fact that the world of adult ha usual stricter time schedul that make these sort of particip more difficult . nevertheless , i believ that eventu one help other becaus ha an inner desir to do so , and no time constraint are valid excus . secondli , i would like to correct the percept of young peopl as selfish individu , onli concern with their own welfar . i also came across mani young acquantainc who were not will to spend part of their time help other , but is n't thi attitud widespread among adult ? i believ so . inde , i believ there are two main reason whi peopl do not help : lack of interest or the belief that particip is useless in the sens that it will not solv the `` real problem '' . while mani young are not interest in help other , i had the impress that the belief that help peopl is useless is not as widespread among youngster as it is among adult . as a result , young peopl are more will to particip whenev they face the opportun . in thi sens , young peopl are more gener to their commun than their adult counterpart . in conclus , i believ that mani young peopl are will to help their commun . the observ of a few who do n't should not led us to believ thi common misconcept .
