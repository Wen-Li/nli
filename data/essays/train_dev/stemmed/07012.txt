i agre that young peopl do not give enough time to help their communit in korea . first , young korean peopl ( middl and high school student ) have to studi hard to enter the good univers . becaus they and their parent want to be success in life . we , korean , think that the good univers is the first step to be success in life . when i also wa a student , i just focus on the studi . so i did n't think about our commun . second , when we enter good univers , we have to also studi our subject . for exampl , i studi dentistri at my univers . i alway take a test 7 to 10 time per month . so i just concentr on studi . sometim we have free time , but we alway sleep . and other student ( law , economi , .. ) tri to get good score at toefl , toeic , .. etc. they alway live in librari . so if we tri to help our commun we have to contribut our time . final , when we were student ( from elementati to univers ) we did n't have much experi to help someon . i think our habit can not be chang easili . we alway think much of ourselv . in conclus , if old gener in korea want to chang the mind of young peopl not to be individualit , they have to tri to chang their own mind . we learn that my success wa more imprtant than anyth els . so we are so veri privat . we learn thi for more than 15 year , so we ca n't chang easili our thought . of cours , all of them is respons for old gener . we , young peopl , have to chang our thought . i 'm also grow , after few decad i 'll be old gener . that time i and my friend have to chang our environ .
