i disagre with the statement , that , young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . the four reason in support to my view , are discuss below . the first reason , is that young peopl , are spend more time on variou field of educ like medicin and technolog . it is with their persist effort in these field that , latest invent and develop like mobil , internet , vehicl , vaccin , medicin etc. are be made possibl . thi , in turn make the life of the commun more comfort and happier . the second reason , be the involv of youth in chariti programm and protest . young peopl , are have the energi and potent , and thu use it to do some part time activ like stage show , market exhibit etc . the money that would be collect in these activ , is be divert to the poor and the needi peopl in the commun . thi way the young peopl are util their leisur time for help the commun . also , the youth are involv in protest , against unjust law of the govern , like reserv for backward class , improp municip condit etc . thi way they are repres the problem in the commun and protest for it amelior . the third , is that the young peopl organ sever get togeth and public function like new year function , christma , anniversari etc , which help bring the peopl of a commun togeth . thi , not onli help in improv social contact , but also improv cordial relat among peopl of the commun , so that each of them can help the other , in time of need . the fourth , is that the young peopl play mani kind of sport . the talent palyer from a particular commun , are select , and they repres the commun , in inter-commun sport competet . thi way they repres the commun and hold up the prestig of their commun by play well and lead the team toward success . thu , the youth do spend time to help their commmun .
