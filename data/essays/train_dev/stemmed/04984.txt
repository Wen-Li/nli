i think that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are becaus that is the way that the buyer can show interest in the product and ask more about it . neverthel , it is a danger form of public becaus some thing that are say about the product are not true . i think that the advertis that more use thi kind of `` lie '' is the telemarket when they show a lot of peopl say that one product or anoth is the best that are in the market , and the problem with these product is that we ca n't see it or touch it befor we buy it . so we take a risk buy a product that we realli do n't know . althougt the advertis for other product that we can see and touch are more realist , some time show better thing that they realli have . public is the best way for a compani to show it product , but the buyer believ more in a compani when they are tell alway the truth and when the show a product with it real characterist , and for a compani the loyalti that show their client is the most import thing . some time , it is not that the advertis seem much better than they realli are but is the custom who think that the product is better that it realli is .
