i have been a student in an educ system , which give import on learn fact rather than understand idea and concept , for 16 year in my countri . therefor , i have the abil as a student to discuss on the advantag and disadvantag of learn fact . on the other hand , i will mention about the signific of understand the idea and concept base on my knowladg rather than my experinc . in my educ life , i have learn so mani fact especi in my biolog lesson . learn fact are necessari for a student in order to extend hi or her knowladg , howev , memoraz is not a good way of learn fact sinc you forget them in time partli or complet if you do not studi again . for exampl , i do not rememb some of the fact that i have learn in my high school about biolog . in addit , learn fact without understand them take too much time sinc you tri to learn a new thing that you have no idea . in thi case , as the time you studi increas you get bore and usual stop studi . moreov , learn fact onli also diminish your creativ . when you memor the fact and then do well in the exam , you do not even think the rest of the fact such as ; what is the behind thi fact or how thi fact is relat to other fact . understand idea and concept rather than learn fact is a second way to studi . firstli , understand a topic complet is a time save method sinc you can guess on the method that have nearli same work principl . furthermor , understand idea make you feel confid befor the exam , yet you can use your mind and find the answer though you do not know the topic total . to illustr , in my machin element class , although i had not studi the helic spring , i could have find the answer by use my knowladg on the linear spring . as i have mention befor , i have learn too mani fact up to now in my student life . howev , i have come to the conclus that understand idea is better .
