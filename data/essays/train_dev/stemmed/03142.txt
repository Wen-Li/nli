sinc the begin of 90 's , technolog is develop with an incredebal speed and it ha been develop with thi speed in mani area . we talk about the technolog 's speed . but what about the real speed ? for mani year technolog 's main concern wa alway speed . in our modern world speed play a key role in everi field . speed mean time and time is cash . speed mean effici . speed mean so mani import thing nowaday . so what did technolog do about speed ? we began our journey with find the wheel . and then everyth ha chang . we invent train . and then car and then plane and now we have even space shuttl . but from all of these vehicl , car are the most import one . the use of the car ha increas dure the year and now , nearli everi peopl in the u. have at least one car . car help and made the thing easier for us . but what will happen after two decad from now ? are we go to use same old , slow car ? are we go to use that kind of vehicl while speed will be much and much import ? i dont think so . first of all , as i said befor , speed will be much more import . and there are enviroment problem too . there are so mani car and they are pollut our air . also there is a energi problem . our planet 's limit resourc wont be enough to support that much energi in the near futur . from my humbl point of view , the car will be useless within twenti year . we will find and we will have to find much rapid vehicl , we will have to find ecolog vehicl and we will have to find vehicl that transport larg mass and use less energi . simpli , we will and we will have to find more sustain vehicl . becaus we have to improv our selv and civil and in the meantim we have to protect our planet .
