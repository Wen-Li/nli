the world is on a rapid pace . everyon is determin to tri someth new and employ larger and larger risk . it sure get result to some and failur to mani . in my opinion , peopl who have achiev success can defin tri and work on more thing and get involv with the element of risk . they would be better off do thing they were into all thi while but the crave to achiev more will not help them settl for less . firstli , success peopl can employ better brain and skill man power to help work on new thing and explor better avenu . with their past success they sure start believ in more thing and are confid in their way of execut . eg : someon like bill gate can employ far better intellect in hi busi and afford more risk which isnt a trait for someon who is still strive to achiev big . anoth import thing one should think of and consid when get into a newer thing is hi past experi . a succesful man stand more chanc for better and vari experi and i believ can handl critic decis and polici better than someon who is a fresher or less experienc . come to our same exampl , mr bill gate today with hi hard work and experi is in better posit to make new busi work and employ risk . through hi detemin he ha explor mani more area sinc from where he start . moreov , there are lot other priviledg that follow a success person . not to deni hi achiev but he is social and polit more sound and strong to stand for hi new risk and adventur . the urg to tri new thing might also come from peer influenc . lastli i would like to emphasis and support my opinion for success peopl but would'nt want to neglect or limit the potenti of ani candid or person on basi of hi success . he sure can make it big but a succes person in my view stand a better oppurtun and chanc .
