in the modren wold , it is a fashion to enjoy life . all of peopl have right to enjoy life . the yong have lot method to have a pleasant day . as well as the older peopl , they also have the method . but the older peool , have some limit . among countless factor which influec my decis , theer are three conspicu aspect as follow . certianliy no reason in my decis is more signific than the cultur impact . the older peopl absorb the thought long time ago , are old and formal . they will have a futrher influenc , due to their experic . the young , appeal to the newest idea in the world , they have no so much experic to guid them . as an exampl , the chines peopl , the modern young peopl like to enjoy some leisur . to travel , with a appearac to the natur . no matter some thing happend , no money , the fund and so on . most of these are follo the principl . as opposit , the older may be have a lot of money , and the rest have enough . under the solut , they will have enoutgh save to futher developm for their familiy or children . the anoth reason everi one can be seen is that the technolog . young peopl take the technolog quickli to help to enjoy life . but for the older , the technolog , for him , is harder to manag . like the newest mobil phone , the young advanc with the rage . their phone have too funciton , with the advanc pho , you can photo . in anoth use , yon should listen music no matter what time as you ever . for the older , the phone , the onli funciton , in some mean , is a job , a project , a imper wich master call on him with the relat to the job . it is essenti to the job not a suppjlemtn to the enjoy tool . the next point is for my penchant is that the educ . all of student have a appeal with the internet . it help student to learn futher knowledg , as the same time , the student gain the idea all over the world . they are modren , in some extend , is self-centr . they will not concren the rest and the hurri . like the credit card , a b ank allow to additon some money ,, you may give them at a special time . the older may think , thi is a troubel . they will worri about it . howev , the yong wil not get troubl with it . , directedl propefrli , the young peopl enjoy their life much more than the older peopl . fore the older peopl , they have theri own method to enjoy theri life , like with the childeren , wihtout borrow fund . howen , in my opinion , the young peopol enjoy life more atha older peopl do .
