in my opinion , young peopl definit enjoy their life more than older peopl . there is no doubt that there is an old person who travel much more than young peopl . but gener it 's not easi for them to just enjoy their life . i have 3 reason to support my opinion . first of all , old peopl ca n't use their time and money or time for just themslv . normal old peopl have their kid and even grand kid . let 's suppos a mom decid to go travel to europ . she will absoulut consid of her kid first . she ca n't leav her kid for a long time by themselv as a mom . even if she decid to go there with kid , the cost will be the way more expens than what she goe alon . and also she might have a problem with make schedul which is hard to make a common break time between sever peopl . then now she would start to consid about the plan of trip again . compar to thi mom young peopl can go anywher whenev they want to . although old person ha no kid , it 's still not easi to make leisur plan . if he/sh want to go fish , they need to go for a walk to the lake and sometim drive long distanc or cross the mountain . then he/sh should face on their limit health abil . even the time to wait for fish , he/sh will feel tire . you would think that 's a teeni tini thing . but it infer to everyth that they want to do . final the old peopl is not will to take risk . they enjoy to be stabl statu which they do n't need to experi harsh happen . that make them not to be abl to do what the young peopl do . i 'm sure thi fact is follow to person . but i think young peopl enjoy more .
