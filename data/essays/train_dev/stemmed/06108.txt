i fulli agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know . take risk to achiev someth big is what these success peopl believ in . they have big dream . they feel that without take risk they can not fulfil them . they are not afraid of fail and they expect posit outcom from these risk . typic the peopl who fall under thi categori are the bussinessmen . for exampl to sell hi product a success businessman would use a method like thi . he doe the entir campaign and advertis of a new product that he ha to sell in a differ way . he keep offer for hi custom like `` buy one and get one free '' .so by do thi he attract the custom to hi product and therebi increas the sell . he doe n't think about the money that he is go to spend by keep such offer but he think about the money he is go to make by use thi `` buy one get one free '' offer . so the risk here is to give such kind of offer . so thi is the outlook of a suuccess person . they see the posit side of everyth . they actual do the same thing but they do it differ and that what make them differ from a ordinari person . now if we think about a not so success businessman in the same situat he would n't have taken the risk of give big offer from the fear : what if the custom dont buy my product ? i will be doom . so he would follow hi usual way . even if there is no loss there is no extra gain is what thi businessman think . but the success businessman doe not fear about the loss and consist think the big profit incas hi idea succe .
