the point of content is wether young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i do not agre with thi statement and believ the contrari . the gener percept might be that young peopl enjoy and live life to the fullest as compar to older peopl becaus they seem the more activ of the lot . i agre that the activ which younger peopl can indulg in are much more than the activ that older peopl can indulg in . howev the time requir to enjoy these activ would be a factor tilt toward the older gener . young peopl gener lead a veri hectic life and may have a veri hectic studi schedul as the earli year of their life are more form and demand more time toward their academ . older peopl on the other hand have more of leisur time onc they retir . even peopl who are work at an older age have much more financi independ as compar to the younger gener . as a result older peopl have a higher degre of freedom to indulg in activ they enjoy . a person matur over the year and an older person can make better choic about activ that excit him . an older person is thu more like to deriv a higher sens of content from the activ he or she indulg in . a person who is old and , mayb retir is like to have lot of free time and can learn more about the thing he or she enjoy do . if for exampl a person like to play golf then he ha more time on hi hand to learn the intricaci of the game . a young person who enjoy play golf on the other hand may be hard press for time . becaus of thi the older person will enjoy the game more for the reason that he ha more time to get involv . as a result it might be the case that young peopl indulg in more number of activ but do not do justic to each one of them . thu in my opinion a person who is older would be lead a more content life and would enjoy hi life much more for the reason that he ha time to pursu hi passion and also the financi independ to do so , both of which might be a hindranc in the case of young peopl .
