i do agre to the statement , that the undestand of idea and concept is more import than to learn fact , but onli to a certain extend . concept and idea are structur , which are veri versatil , what mean that the student is abl to solv problem by himself use these think pattern , that make him independ . understand of idea is in my opinion also veri import when it come to have own one 's , becaus if a scientist had never undestood formular , instead of just learn them , their could have never been ani progress . anoth exampl is the way of think , that student learn in school , and when i say that , i mean the critic think , to question thing , and to take noth for grant , which is a concept , a concept of think , which allow the student to work with in everi job or part of life , it is the basi . therfor i do agre , that concept and idea are of great import , but they could not exist without fact , that have to be learn simulanti . question is good , but we need a knowledg , to be abl to question someth , and that knowledg of fact need to be learn . for exmapl , how could someon dicuss the mean or the intent of literatur if he had no knowledg about the time , the piec wa written in , or about the author or the genr ? in my opinion , concept , idea and fact do onli unfold their full use and reasonabl , when they go hand in hand , so that the owner of these abil can creat idea , base on fact and work out with concept .
