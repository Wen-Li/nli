i strongli agre with the statement of `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . some may disagre with what i say that they ( especi the young poepl ) think they do help other in their commun . i do agre that young peopl do help , but the point is they did not give enough time on help . mayb they just spent a few minut for donat some money or give their seat to the elder in the train or bu . that is total not suffici . regard to that issu , there are a few reason that cuas thi issu . first of all , young peopl are too busi . they need to face more challeng and difficulti in thier life compar to last time as the world are improv and developimg so fast . if they are student , they need to concentr on their studi and get a veri good result to get a place in a univers or a posit in the compani . if they are worker , they may need to concertr on their work so they could get more salari or better posit in the compani . nowaday , peopl may need to know much more infom compar to last time to sucess in the societi . thi includ comput skill , speak skill , writ skill , and expert in more than one languag . thu , young peopl nowaday are busi for learn or work that they did not have time for other thing . moreov , the parent did not encourag their children to pay more attent in help other and their commun . nowaday , parent mostli concern on the result and perform of their children in school and job until they ignor the import of teach their children about the moral attitud or behavior . therefor , the young peopl are mainli lack of the awar of the import of help behavior . they do not give enough time in help their commun as they were not teach to do so sinc they were young . in conclus , i agre with the statement of `` young poepl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' as they are too busi and their parent did not encourag moral attitud and behavior in their children .
