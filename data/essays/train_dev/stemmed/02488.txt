i disagre with the statement that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year from now than there are today . my answer huge depend on the countri about which we are talk about . in a develop countri or an under develop countri , the number of car increas day by day . as the develop take place in these region , more busi activ will follow and make the peopl richer . as a result of thi they will depend on the car as a mean of transport rather than on public transport . thi fact is evid from the countri like india and china where the number of car on a road are increas day by day , challeng the infrastructur of these countri . as the economi of a countri develop . more peopl would prefer to have a conveni mean of transport at their dispos instead of run for the public transport . we can argu that two wheeler might increas in these countri in place of the car , but car would alway be a safer mean of transport than a two wheeler . so peopl would prefer car to two wheeler when they have enough money . but in countri such as us , uk , australia which come under the develop countri categori , there can be a fall in the number of car in the futur but i 'm not certain . as the number of car is alreadi more in these countri , peopl might be look at some other mean of transport which is more comfort than a car . the air network is so develop in these countri that peopl prefer to travel by air rather than take a car when they have to travel long distanc . whether it be a develop or an under-develop countri , the number of car will alway increas provid that the infrastructur keep up with the increas number of car on road . so the main thing is the infrastructur develop ie the road , bridg etc . increas usag of car also mean that the world major car manufactur compani can look forward to expand their busi and provid employ opportun to mani peopl . so , the number of car are set to increas in the futur as the economi around the world continu to improv .
