nowaday , there are mani peopl beliv that onli do what they alreadi know how to do well is true . nevertheless , i absolut disagre thi point at all . i think that a success peopl show tri thing and take risk to beom success . there are mani success person also take mani high risk befor he/sh beom success and well-known . bill gate is a typic exampl in thi situt . when bill gate wa still a student in univers , he realiz that he would be a great man and hire by a big compani with great amount and stabl salari after he gratuat . although he realiz that situt , but he still decid to take a risk to abandon hi studi and start to invent some softwar . moreov , he ask ask on of hi friend to abandon studi and go with him to creat a busi . nevertheless , he reject eventu . a few year later , bill gate becam the richest man in the world with sever million of dollar . on the othr hand , although hi friend wa graduat from the univers of oxford , he wa onli a manag of a small compani . an other exampl is my father , he ws not skill in studi when he wa young : therefor , he start to creat hi own busi instead if studi or work for a compani for mani year . now he becom a veri success person and my idol . in conclus , i think peopl should tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . it is becaus if we are not skillful in studi or work for other , whi do we have to wast our preciou time to do the thingd without ani result . moreov , i think peopl should tri new thing when they are young , becaus it is use to regret when they becom old .
