even though joung peopl usual like enjoy themselv more than older peopl do , thi is not necessarili true . for exempl , you could meet a realli cool 60-years-old man that doe everyth in hi power to have fun and make life worth of be live , and a veri bore 20-years-old boy who will never step out of hi hous except to go to school . on the other hand , iif it 's true that joung peopl do enjoy life more , it could be becaus of the belief that one would better take advantag of it youth befor it is too late . i do not total agre with that statement , in fact i think that peopl should have the courag of enjoy their whole life , without wast all their chanc while they are just teenag or wait too long to start follow their dream . talk about real fact and peopl , i could nomin as mani teen as older peopl that are enjoy their life . today 's world offer chanc to have fun to peopl of all age : there are a lot of park and resort where a child can go and enjoy a few day and where it parent would have a great time too . holiday resort where my grandpar would love to spend a few week can be found almost anywher , and of cours there are a lot of structur that offer amus to teen between 15 and 30 year old . so , if a person want to `` enjoy it life '' , there is noth keep him from do that . nevertheless , we will alway meet someon who is not want to do ani of these . and if we realli pay attent to it , we will find out that thi kind of behavior is present in peopl of all age , there in not a real averag . if one want to have fuun , he will do it , and if he doe n't he will not . mayb it 's just anoth way of enjoy life , even though most peopl consid it bore and worthless .
