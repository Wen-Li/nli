let us begin by defin `` suceess '' and `` success peopl '' . success by far is someth that ha differ mean for differ peopl . the measur of success , the time period to get there and the import of it are thing which are distinct to everi individu . the world might view a bill gate or a laxmi mittal as a success person but for me my father is the most success person i know . so i proceed on the assumpt that we are refer to a success person with refer to the econom of it and not to the essenc of it . success peopl seldom think of the consequ of risk as they have seen and endur the climb up the ladder of success and know exactli what it entail to get there . the sweat , the toil , the experi in itself give them the energi to dream further and those dream accompani by the passion to get there remov all apprehens to take ani risk . they take risk to tri new thing , thing that probabl intrigu them or thing that they have alway dream of achiev and did not have the capac to achiev earlier . have achiev a level of perform in what they alreadi know how to do well they aspir to ventur into new avenu and if the same involv take a calcul risk they would not abstain from it . risk are essenti if one need to evolv as a profession or as a person-thes are not the word of a luminari but view that i person ascrib to . to discov new thing , new world , new prospect and new ideolog , take risk is someth that should not be seen as a neg attribut but a posit one . apprehens or fear can bring in a life which will alway lack the drive and passion that make busi baron like laxmi mittal and ambani achiev their statu . come back to the topic of thi essay , i would state that i do agre with the statement that `` succes peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' to the extent that it is not a restrict statement . success is someth subject and i strongli believ that ani person whether `` success '' by worldli standard or not would aspir to do new thing and will take the risk to get there
