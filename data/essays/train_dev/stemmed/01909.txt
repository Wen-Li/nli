i think that a person must ha a broader knowledg , that mean that you know someth about everi thing , but also he must to concentr on a specif subject to know everi thing everi problem that thi subject could have . when somebodi start go to school he studi differ metter , and hi theacher theach you somet about that but not everi thing about that matter . i think that thi first step of child studi ha a lot of import becous he can listen and studi differ lectur and after that he will decid what he will do in hi futur life . for exempl in the past when i went to school i studi differ matter such as philosophi or latin that somebodi could say that are futil matter . howev i disagre with thi statement , in fact , even if now i am stude architectur , thi matter help me in my work . if somebodi studi phiolosophi he read easier an architectur book becaus in some book you can find some concept difficult to understand . howev it s also import that somebodi special in one specif metter . in fact if you know everi thing about a subject you can foretel the problem or the effect of someth . thi will becam import in the futur work where a person will have to decid himself . in particularli she will consid her konowledg and if she ha not the specif knowledg she could onli fail ! . in conclus i can say that the both tipe of knowledg are need in our societi and
