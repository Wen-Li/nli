i do n't agre or disagre with the statement . i think that there are benefit as whell as problem relat to travel in a group led by a tour guid . some of the benefit of travel in a group with a guid in my opinion are : if you have a profesion guid he might shown you place that are not so common for tourist and that otherwis you would n't know of ; he could also tell you some histori behind a place ; and the most import for me , normal local know the best place for have a great lunch or dinner . some of the problem that one might have while travel in a group with a guid are : you need to follow a schedul , so there is not to much freedom ; the guid will show you what he think is the most import site , but that doe mean that you will agre with that or that you will enjoy that ; there is also the econom aspen the guid might not be cheap enoght for you to pay and final there is the group issu , the group may not the type of person that you would like to share your vacat with and thi could make the trip less enjoy . in conclus i think that you need to evalu befor get into a travel group if that is reali the type of experinc that you what to get out of a specif vacat . if you are go to a place for the first time or for shorth time a guid could be good idea . on the other hand if you are vist a place for the second time you might alreadi know what do you want to do for the trip and whell as when , so not be with a guid will probabl be better then .
