a tour guid have a lot of inform about travel , but my opinion is if we do n't trip with a tour guid , the trip will be more excit . there are two reason . for the first , tour guid know veri well about where to stay at night , what to eat , what to buy as a survenior and where to visit . on the other hand , group memmber have limiti inform about the area where they are tavel . from thi point , it seem better that travel with ` well inform ' tour guid , but if we travel with guid we depend everth on the guid . without a tour guid , a group can tri ani thing . ofcous sometim the group may wrong chois , but that is more excit than just do as the guid said . travel is know other food , scene and even air which we ca n't see ordin life . forethermor , travel in a group without a tour guid will strength relationship of the group . sinc the group doe n't have a person who know what to do , such as leader , they have to think each other for their group . everi group member must use hi brain and discuss in the group about where to visit , what to eat and where . thi way might take more time but the more the group talk each other , the more thier relationship will be strong . from these two point i prefer travel without a tour guid to that with him .
