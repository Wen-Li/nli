in my opinion , what express in the statement is not completelli true . i think that the fact that for a student , idea or concept are more import than to learn fact , depend on the differ attitud the student ha . in my opinion by the way , it 's realli more import to understand idea and concept behind a fact . the best exampl i can use to add valu to my assumpt , is my own experi dure the univers studi . i 've studi engen and for most of the exam i did , to understand concept wa the most import aspect of the studi . without that it would have been veri difficult to pass the exam . becaus you need that to approach to a brand new problem , that you have not seen befor . i can studi the fact that a construct can collaps if some project aspect are not respect and i can learn thi fact . but if i do n't understand the concept or idea behind structur 's phisic i could hardli been abl to project it properli . on the other hand it is obviou that for someon els result are more imoport than the caus that ha produc them , and therefor for those student , fact should definit be more import than the idea behind them . i 'm reffer for exampl to those student interest to histori subject . those student are mainli interest in fact that are the basi of their studi field . but even for them i think schould be import to know and to understand what wa behind a specif period or event . to better rember what happen due to a logic cause-effect process .
