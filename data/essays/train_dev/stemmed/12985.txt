i srongli agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better then they realli are becaus i think in some case thi is the basic purpos of the advertis . there are sever exampl to justifi thi statement . firstli take the exampl of shampoo , now a day everybodi ha the problem of less hair and fall hair . in the market you can find a larg number of shampoo that will help you in reduc the problem . in that case the advertis will gave you the idea of which shampoo you should buy . a well direct advertis in which a girl is have less hair start use the product x regain hair by use it for say 14 day , thi kind of advertis will provok you to buy the same product but the realiti behind it may be differ . onli after use it you will came across the actual . the advertis main aim is to attract more and more custom and it doe not to give the real inform all the time . it the case in most type of cosmet too . second take the exampl of yogurt , or ani other food product , if you see ani thing in the advertis then you will sure tri to buy the same thing becaus you would be curiou of know whether the product doe the same as shown in the advertis , but my person experi suggest that the advertis are the ostentaci present in case of most of the thing . they are not what they look in advertis . final i believ that if you take the exampl of politician you will find that in order to grab maximum vote they present themselv to be most promis among all other , nobodi will show himself as a demagogu , so basic the purpos of advertis is to make everyth look perfect which could be far behind the realiti . to sum up i can say that in most of the case the real purpos of the advertis is to make product look good , benefici and worth buy .
