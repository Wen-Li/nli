nowaday car a the most import medium of travel larg distanc and therefor they are use often and regularli . nevertheless , the develop of technic could lead to fewer car to be use in twenti year . for that , howev , polit and social circumst still would need to chang . first , due to the fact that also in futur peopl still will need to travel , it it veri import that the govern of today support other medium of mass transport like train or buse . if financi support from the polit , travel by bu would be cheaper than travel by car and peopl might chang their habit of use their car everi time they need to go somewher . in case a person want to visit a friend , live in anoth countri , and the less expens way to go there wa by train , i am convic that he or she would buy a train ticket instead of new petrol for hi or her car , that is whi politican could chang the cirucumst of transport and therefor the number of use car in the futur . second , also the social circumst concern the attitud of peopl toward their car would need to be chang . these day a car not onli repres a medium of travel but also show the charact and the social situat of it owner . the car of a veri rich man , a bmw with a chauffeur for exampl , differ complet from the car of a poor famili father , who ha to pack hi four children and hi wife into an old mini-van . if a car quit to be a part of a person reput and of a way of present social welfar it mean and it use would chang likewis . howev , altough i would appreci these circumst to chang for the better , i do not believ that neither the politician nor the peopl will chang their attitud toward the use of car . in addit to that , chang circumst alway demand a lon period of time . no polit nor social develop in the last ten year , howev , indic a similar chang in the attitud both polit and social . in conclus , that is the reason whi i do not believ that fewer car will be in use in twenti year .
