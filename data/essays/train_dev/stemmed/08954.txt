doe success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do noth what they allreadi know how to do well ? in my opinion , answer of thi question is ye they do . first of all if one person know everyth about one issu and he ha done lot of achiev befor he wouldnt scare or worri about tri new thing or take risk . for exampl after world war1 , ottoman empir lost war than all our countri had been occupi by anoth countri . in that time onli one person , call mustafa kemal , had came up and took all the risk to surviv our countri . he wa gener in ottoman armi and had lot of achiev previou war . altough there were anoth gener in armi he wa the leader of new turkish . whi ? first he wa confid , knew everi detail about hi puplic and hi enemi . he wa organ and had analysi everyth . he didnt scare to tri to organ young and start to independ war against the countri that occupi our land . he didnt have ani oppurtinuti to get back our freedom again except fight . he had a lot enemi even from turkish becaus they didnt believ him . in 1919 he came to anatolia to organ new turkish armi and establish new repupl . besid all neg econom condit and for some peopl onli ha 1 % chanc he did it . ye it took more than three year and cost mayb million of dead but he gave our freedom back . he establish republ of turkey on 29 octob 1923 . in that year presid of unit kingdom said one of hi speech `` everi age one geniou come to the world unfortun thi age ha come to turkey '' . like he said mustafa kemal wa a geniou and it mean a lot to me . to conclued if one person success and alreadi know thing how to do well
