we are live in an age of inform , where the human knowledg of it surround ha boost and continu to acceler even more rapidli . one can tell that today an averag high school student , with an averag level of educ , know better physic than newton . with so much inform accumul , the urg for the scientist to special in one area to contribut to that area get more and more signific . there are two major point relat with thi isu . first of all , as mention abov , the accumul of knowledg in a singl area ha increas so much that it is imposs to have some discoveri on top of it without have the grasp of all prior inform . for instanc , while most peopl still have difficulti understand einstein and hi rel theori , scientist are introduc theori that even extend it , have given a lifetim of studi in that subject onli . special in a specif topic seem to be the onli way of studi scienc profession . secondli , one can say that it is requir to have a broad knowledg of mani field to be abl to work on specif topic sinc scientif field are highli interconnect and interdepend . thi is of cours true to some extent . there are mani gener topic to cover until one ha the capac of advanc to a special topic but that doe not stand against the fact that academ subject are now so complex that one can not afford distribut hi effort among variou subject . in fact , the current educ system in most of the countri in the world is so : an introductori undergradu program cover all the requir subject as a baselin , and then graduat studi special in a specif subject with the purpos of academ research . in conclus , whether to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or to special in one specif subject is an import question . while each one ha advantag over the other , it seem that special is nearli an oblig of modern scienc regard it depth and complex . special is inevit and must be pursu by everi academician , but also not ignor the background knowledg of the prerequisit subject .
