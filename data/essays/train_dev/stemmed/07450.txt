accord to me i feel that it is the best thing for a person to have better knowledg about special subject rather than seek knowledg about sever subject for sever reason . firstli seek knowledg about a particular subject can make him a master in that subject . he can expertis soley in the subject . for exampl if you are interest in gener scienc . you can concentr on that subject onli and know the subject studi the subject deeper . secondli a person can studi the sub jecft and know the deeper strength and line of the subject . the person can get a chanc to know and studi more detail about the subject . in contrast if we concentr on all subject we may not achiev perfecton in ani of them . thirdli there is a say that a person can do onli one thing at one time . for exampl if a person dream is to becom a scientist , it is of no use if he concentr on other subject such as econom or art etc . although they are onli import for him to have a basic idea about thi subject not ani thing thing more becaus they donot contribut him to reach hi target or hi destin . fourthli a person may get sever opportun in futur which may wecom him or her . for exampl if a person attend an interview he or she may be ask that in which subject or area you are specialis , or interest . base on hi specil of subject the interview may ask the question . a person get an opportun to be an expert or master of hi subject be specialis . to sum up although other academ subject are also basic import to seek knowledg but it is alway a good idea or beneficiari to be an expert in ani particular subject . it is bett to lspecial in one rather than mix of all other subject .
