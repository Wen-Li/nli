to my mind the statement at hand is a veri import issu to discuss . from my perspect , it seem reason to say that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know how to do well . the first point to support my view is that onli if new idea are put into practic , new field of studi and area of busi can start to exist and emerg . suppos , bill gate had not taken the risk to start hi busi at the start of hi career . if he had not taken the step to tri a new thing and to take up a busi risk , he now would not have been the famou and rich person that he actual is in the presenc . due to these circumst ( hi statu and the amount of money that he ha earn ) , bill gate is now consid to be a veri success busi person . thu , he is a perfect exampl to show how tri new thing can determin the success of a person . anoth argument to support the statement is the fact that in today 's highli competit market it is not enough anymor to be good at what you are do . competitor who will offer the custom better and more innov servic will steal the custom from busi which are onli good at what they are do but which are not improv and innov their servic . an exampl of thi can be seen in the fast food industri . if mc donald had not react to the custom ' wish for healthier product , mc donald would have lost it own custom to it competitor . therefor , one can see that success busi peopl contin think how to excel and how to outcompet their competitor . thi , though , they can often onli do by offer new servic and good to the client . when tri new thing , the risk taken doe not onli includ a downsid but in particular an upsid potenti . thu , when talk about rik of tri new thing , one also talk about the great outcom that a new idea can gener . as success peopl are usual convinc that their new idea will be success , the upsid potenti is veri high in contrast to a low downsid potenti . success peopl , one can add , tri new thing and take risk consid the potenti outcom beforehand . to sum it up , the abov mention argument support the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they are alreadi good at do . one could add to the statement that success peopl consid the risk to be taken beforehand and thu decreas the downsid potenti of tri new thing . thi combin make peopl success .
