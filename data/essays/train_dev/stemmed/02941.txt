the issu at hand is that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or to special in one specif subject . the issu is import , becaus specialist are nerrow view peopl , who can hardli transfer knowladg from one subject to an other , and becaus of that who are limit within their academ subject . therefor , i beleav that it is better to be a generalist than a specialist . at first , the generalist have a brider view of their academ subject , which allow them to transfer knowledg from other field . sinc they have knowledg about differ subject in one field , they can transfert knowledg from one field to the next in order to solv existimg problem faster . hanc , specialist on the other hand can not do that , which support my opinion that be a generalist is better then be a specialist . an other point ist that , generalist are abl to compar and contrust differ subject in a field . therefor , have mani more inspir field than a specialist , which allow rhen to improv the . thi is an other reason whi i think that specialist are better in a senc they are more success . as last , generalist are not restrict with the boundri of their field of studi like the generalist . they have the opportun to improv their knowledg in differ dicert and aven after jear of studi , they still can improv their knowledg in their field of studu . generalist on the other hand , are strictyli capselt in their world , which hold them back of improv . becaus specialist are restrict and close to improv after some time of studi , i thing that be a generalist is better . as a conclut , i believ that be a generelist meand have a bride view , be abl to transfer knowledg between differ subject - in order to solv probl in faster way - and have the opprtun to improv yourself , which make it better than be a specialist .
