i am agre with the statement that affirm that in twenti year will be fewer car in use than there are today becaus i think that in the futur there will be a lot of differ way of move . in other word i hope that someon will invent a new product or a new idea for move on air . the first reason is becaus today we have a lot of problem of traffic and is also imposs basic in the big citi to move for work , for plasur , for everyth . there are too mani car today and alway we are in line for hour and hour wait to arriv . the second reason becaus i am agre with the statement is a problem relat at the enviro and not onli also at the person . there are a lot of ga on the air that are danger for us and for all our enviro . for thi reason i think that is absolutli necessari to do someth for the futur , for the util of the car . for exampl it will be import creat a new product for the futur market that can be solv thi kind of problem . the third reason is that in twenti year will be bore of thi problem and mayb it will be possibl that instead use the car we will use anoth kind of trasport . for insanc i think that a good solut could be that a governa forbidden more than one car for famili . i know that is not so easi but i think that is for ourselv , for the enviro . it ' s imposs to immagin a futur like a present . final i want to underlin that it will be more confort live in a `` clean citi '' without all thi chemic ga that everi day are around us .
