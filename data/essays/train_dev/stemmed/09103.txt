travel in a group lead by a tour guid could be a good choic for travel . say or state that is the best way to travel will depend on both the destini of the trip and the kind of person the travel is . let 's suppos that you decid to travel to some unknown far away or inexplor place . in thi case , you should evalu the possibl to travel within a group and with a tour guid . for thi case thi should be the best choic . that 's obvious becaus you do n't know where you are go to , you do n't know the cultur , landscap , commun and transport resourc avail among other characterist that must be known when you travel abroad . but if i know or i have an idea where i 'm head to , i prefer to travel follow my own plan and my instinct . i do n't know if i can be call an adventur spirit or someth like that . but sinc i becam an adult everytim i travel i do it by my own and with my own schedul . that way i can choos where to visit and how much time i can spent in each locat . and not onli to follow a leader wich will decid for me where to go and how much time spent at each destini . a good idea is to save some part of your budget to buy some small tour in order to make your trip a littl more complet and fascin . beacus when your alon you 'll let your predilect control your impuls and you may lose the opportun to know some special place that you will like but is not , somehow , part of your vacat purpos . for exampl i spent my last vacat in new york and the subject and main goal of my trip wa to visit the yanke stadium and enjoy new york night 's life . of cours i visit the stadium and enjoy some open microphon bar . but a rel told me about a tour to a pennsilvania amus park and i tri . it wa n't part of my plan but it wa an unforget experienc . in my opinion travel with a group and a tour guid ha it advantag but you must know when to choos thi option . for the moment let me travel alon and follow my own plan .
