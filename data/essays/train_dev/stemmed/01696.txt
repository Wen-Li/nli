the statement refer to a veri impot and also problemat question in our modern societi as traffic and connect to that environment pollut incres . at thi point of time in histori it is in my oppinion difficult to make such a prognos about the futur becaus technolog progress acceler . as a consequ we can not know what and more import when a new vehicl will be invent which is abl to partial substitu a car . accord to me their will not be fewer car in twenti year becaus the present trend of increas car number and traffic doe not chang it direct . car have been an essenti invent in the past and are now an import part of our daili life . thi is shown bz the fact that especi in the industri countri nearlz everz famili ha one or more car . we use the car to go shop , to go to work , to go on vacat and often just to visit a friend a few street away . with the invent of car human mobil increas . as nowaday a life without a car is hard to imagin and unsubstitu i think also in twenti year thi fact will not have chang . on the one hand car have simplifi mani thing in our life and increas our mobil , but at the other hand have contribut to mani environment problem such as the emiss of carbon dioxid which damag the oyon lazer and contribut to global warm . govern ha made restrict and law to control the use of car like tax and there might be stricter law in the near futur but in my opinion it will take more than twenti year for the peopl to react to such law . even if oil resourc becom scarc and oil price will rais an adapt to thi will be veri slow . a reduct of car use when oil price rais will in my opinion onli be short term . as a conclus you can say that accord to me in the near futur there will not be fewer car becaus car have becom an unsustitut part of daili life . as pollut increas the reduct of car will be necessari to reduc environment destruct but thi will perhap be achiv in in more than twenti year .
