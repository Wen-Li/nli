i would agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl do . i believ that younger peopl are usual less burden with the hardship and stress of life , that come at a later stage . also , younger peopl have an attitud to not take thing too serious and so , they tend to enjoy life in more situat . further , older peopl usual lose out the patienc to enjoy and experi adventur and fun in life like the way youngster do . when we take the exampl of an old man , who becom weak due to age , it veri obvoiu that he doe not have the stamina to enjoy ani adventur in life . also , he would tend to becom more subdu and mellow . in drast contrast , a youngster is usual fill up lot of energi and enthusiasm to take on new task , adventur , visit interest place and so on . also , younger peopl tend to hang out a lot with friend and share lot of fun moment togeth . for exampl , if a young coupl were to make a pleasur trip , and an old coupl come along too , it is highli possibl that their view and sens of fun would n't match . the older coupl will usual prefer to stay indoor even while on tour , wherea the younger coupl , i believ , will explor the place , in and out . i rememb an incid when i had to go out on a tour alon , and i ask my grand mother to accompani me . she just did not want to go with me . she said she would get exhaust and doe n't take interest in travel anymor . when i ask the same to a friend of mine , she immedi oblig ! thi show the clear contrast between the view of an old person and a young one . i believ that we all usual get a matur and proper understand of life onli after face some seriou troubl . thi kind of a view develop over time , and can not be seen among the youngster . youth therefor symbol more of energi , ideal , innoc , etc . ad to all the abov mention reason , i feel that mayb biolog also , younger peopl have higher level of adrenalin , which expel higher level of energi . thi can further explain whi youngster tend to enjoy life more than their older counterpart do . howev , i admit that the same youth will eventu turn out more matur and get more seriou about thing , and fall in the categoti of old peopl .
