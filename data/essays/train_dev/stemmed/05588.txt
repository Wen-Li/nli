each educ peopl need a academ knowledg in order to be effect in hi futur work and in societi . hereaft , i 'm go to analys the pro and con of the broad knowledg and the specif knowledg befor drawn ani conclus . first of all , have a broad knowledg may be veri help sinc you can talk about or understand ani subject . thi abil is veri import sinc we are live in a multicultur societi where the rang of skill is veri broad . then it might be use to get that kind of knowledg becaus everi one is go to chang job two or three time in hi lifetim career and be awar of other issu tham those relat to your major is import . howev , broad knowledg is veri time-consum . you will probabl meet great difficulti deal with differ subject and thi may caus you to have veri superfici view of those subject . what about the specif knowledg then ? it improv your capac to master one subject . one strike exampl is well-educ peopl known as expert . expert are basic the referr on one field . they are like referre in game becaus their statement are doubtless and must be absolut true . thi is becaus they are suppos to possess all of the current knowledg humankind have on the subject . the wrong side of thi specif knowledg is that you are not awar of what 's go on elsewher and you can not just chang from one job to anoth . that can make the differ in a chang world . for exampl peopl special in buld old - fashion televis call cathod televis can not move on to the next step and deal with new high technolog flat screen . in my opinion , to be effect and to social fit in , everi one need both kind of knowledg . thu , one can at the same time adapt to ani situat and be veri skilful in the field in which they will work and achiev their goal .
