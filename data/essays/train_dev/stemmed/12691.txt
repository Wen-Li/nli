ye , i complet agre with thi statement . and , thi is the whole idea behind get the product advertis to lure the consum and compet in the market . in today 's competet world everyth is all about present , especi if you want to sell your product in the open market . you realli have to prove and show to the peopl that your product is better than other . advertis help seller in market the product and in the process sometim it show the product better than they realli are . in the age of cut throat competit , advertis compani tri to show the best of the best thing about the product which is sometim incorrrect . i have a real life exampl to further support my thought - i wa watch a coca cola advertis some time back where it wa show that a person drink the soft drink saw a girl drown in the deep ocean . he jump into the ocean to save that girl and later on they highlit that the person is so brave and courag becau he drink coca cola . ofcours , thi is nowher near to realiti but still good enough to gener interest in the soft drink . everi year million and million of dollar are spent to get a thirti second slot in the super bowl game in unit state . there is no harm in show your product as a perfect one but at the same time one should not make it look like total differ than what thay are . for instanc , in us we get flier everyday in our mail box about variou deal but you reach the store onli to find out that the deal is gone or that commod is out of stock . but , the advertis accomplish what wa intend there most of the time - gener traffic for the store . most of the advertis compani promot themselv by say that they can chang the look and feel of the product . they know the trick to charm the consum and in the process they make product seem much better than what they realli are which is uneth but unfortun true .
