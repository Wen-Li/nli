i personnali agre with thi statement . have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is not that easi , it is true . but let me tell you thi ; albert einstein ha a quot : `` knowledg is power. '' which is complet true . think of biolog without chemistri ; chemistri without physic ; physic without geometri : geometri without math and so on . .. a chemist can not explain whi the electron make an orbit shape around the nucleu without physic , can he ? or a physic master can not measur the shadow that a candl make when he lit it , can he ? anoth import point can be thought of easili when we think about the import peopl who major in their field and that we still know of even if they live centuri and even thousand of year ago . take pascal as an exampl . he ha a lot of proven theori in math , physic . . is n't it odd for him to have more than one field which he major and made himself known of ? the answer to these question i point out are simpl and true : the law of natur , the languag spoken , peopl and all the other that we know of are on onli one place : here on earth . no one can prove that the fact about it are n't link to one anoth . the link between the fact are so tight that if you start learn at one end , you will end up in find yourself at the other . so , learn physic , learn chemistri , learn literatur or ani other topic is not that import to worri about . you will find yourself at the other hand if you studi hard and learn a lot . the onli question is where to start the adventur . but do not stick to the beggin becaus you will have a lot miss if you do n't finish it until the end . do n't be stuck in a subject of life , tri to get to know the whole piec .
