do you peopl enjoy more than older epol , that is a veri diffivult question , take in accoubt that most peol would think that young peopl might have more fun than older peol , just becaus they think that they are healthier , faster , stronger , as my mom use to tell me , teenag think they are suoperman , they take risk that older peol normal wouldnt takem , theti stay up all nioght , go to parti , drive fast carsm , and mayb even do illeg drug , but that doe not mean that young peopl ha more fun , i onc read a veri good book `` tuesday with morri '' . it a book about life , it show the experi of a young man , interact with an elder , the elder ha gone through variou experi , and the youngster want to learn from thoe sxperienc , and eventu , the teacher tell him one thing , `` you first need to learn how to die , thenm you can learn how to live ... '' that tell the student that he ha to absorb all that he canm from hi experi , and then let go of some of hi emot and then , he can know how it feel to tast succ , or love , and even pride . morri , who is the teacher on the book tell the main caharct that onc you know how if feel how to die , yopu know how to live becaus you learn how to enjoy life even more . the point i am tri to make is that older peopl know how to take more and more from each new experi , and they probabl enjoy life even more , although there are a few except , some young peopl are evri matur and find a way to have fun even in the worst cituatuion , like peopl that dont have as mani econom resourc , they learn how to take advantag from the few oportun they have to go out , or parti as we say nowaday . i honestli think that older peopl have mopr fun , becaus they have learn how to enjoy life , and young peopl are just live at a hundr mile an hour , tri to do too mani thing to have fun , and not get a lot out of the experinc that they6 go through in their daili life .
