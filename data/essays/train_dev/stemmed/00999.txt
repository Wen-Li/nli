i do not agre with the statement that `` it is more import for student to understand idea and cocept than it is for them to learn facts. '' , becaus thi statement gener that idea and concept are alway more import than fact . as a student there are alway class that contain for huge part of fact , for exampl histori . other subject , for exampl psychologi , concentr on idea that have to be prooven later on . in deed it is import to alway have a gener idea what somebodi is explain and to understand how a concept work , but use a concept practic without have the knowledg of the import fact around and behind the idea is mostli not possibl . for exampl : it is good to understand the concept of a war , but that includ not from when till when it actual happend , what the factic conseq were . a concept is alway just fifti percent of realiti , the other fifti percent are the fact that set it into context . on the otherhand would it be almost useless to collect all the fact about for exampl the second world war , if you have no idea about the caus ; the idea and concept each parti of thi war had . with onli one , fact or concept it is neither possibl to completli understand someth nor to make the step from the idea to realiti . therefor my opinion is , that understand a concept is for student as import as the fact surround the concept . both must be understood to realiz a topic .
