i disagre with thi statement . i do not think that the help their commun of the young peopl is decreas . that is whi i know mani student around me tri to attend commun and help them . for exampl , one of my friend attend the commun of volunt for hansensi diseas . he went to china and saw the facil with hi own eye . he now also keep tri to help the peopl who are segreg from the societi becaus of their diseas . other friend attend to the commun of help the forign student . onc a week , she attend a class with the foregin student and help note take and assign . i understand that the student are veri busi becaus of class , assign and commun with friend and love . howev we can make the time even how hard it is . on the other hand , i think that nowaday there is a problem with commun around the social commun . it is not becaus of the lack of the time . it is becaus of the lack of the relationship among the social commun . for my exampl , i do not know the neigbor . i do not know wether he is student or not . it can be whi i stay alon , but it is strang . i think that make the relationship among the social commun strong lead to the safeti world . if know each other veri well , the crime is go to smaller . what i mention is the young peopl tri to be aggress to attend some commun and help them . howev we need more commun among the peopl of social commun . it lead to the safeti world . i dissagre with thi statement . i do not think not give enough time to help their commun . we can make time even how busi we are . the problem is the lack of commun .
