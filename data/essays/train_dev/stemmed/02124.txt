i agre thi idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are two reason : reliev and expart of the guid . to the begin , i 'm reliev when a tour guid lead us . becaus she know everythingfor exampl , i travel to a foreign countri . if i can not commun in english and not mother languag , i worri about it . i may not to abl to listen guid and not to see the direct . then i may get lost . in my case , i travel in london alon . i have a map and book which is written the detail about that citi . i walk around the citi while i look the book . but i got lost . i wa so nervou becaus i could not find that there were no japanes and peopl who could speak in japanes . then i thought . if i belong to a tour group by a tour guid , i did n't get lost . next and the last , a tour guid is expart of introduc . becaus she or he know the imform better than ordinari peopl . for instanc , in thi case , it is also a foreign countri . last summer , i went to itali in a group led by a tour guid . thi is my first time to visit itali and also the first time to travel led by a tour guid . i want to visit variou place , so i often ask a tour guid like thi . where should i go in order to eat dinner to cheep restaur ?? or which place is the best to go to the church ?? a tour guid alway told me . and also she told us the histori of the citi , countri . furthermor she show us the secret place where it is not written in the book . i felt it wa happi to know . for those reason , i agre thi idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
