the topic that young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their commun is veri controversi one . but i believ ye , these day young peopl dont give enough time to help their commun rather i believ that in today world the approach of present gener ha becom global than to be limit to just one 's commun , societi , or nation . in today world the mental of peopl have bnecom broader now the peopl are not just work to put forward their nation but are struggl to get all peopl at same level and posit . the young gener of today do not believ in word like commun they embrac everi person as their famili member and is work ahead to help them out . for exampl now day a social worker is not onli interest in deal with the peopl of onli it commun but rather peopl of everywher no matter if they are racial differ or social statu of these peopl differ the basic purpos is just to serv . for exampl in countri like india where there are number of differ religi group , when a destruct happen by flood a group of sikh commun went to help these peopl no matter these peopl were not of there commun , religion or region . in today world number of scientist are work toward deal with environment problem that are degrad there atmospher . research are work hand in hand not onli to bring up their societi but to everyon . there is also a vast number of young peopl who join the social work group on part time basi and work at old age home , societi for help sufer from catastroph and against illiteraci etc.infact , there there is a wide number of young ppeopl who join the organ establish by mother teresa on full time basi . nowday even in school to lean student toward help the peopl now project are assign to student for a day or two to serv in orphanag , or old age home etc . student organ chariti function and fair to rais the fund and donat them to needi peopl . infact i believ that scenario is chang now from `` me to it ha becom we '' . peopl are realli work toward equal and it the reason whi even when a famin or natur destruct occur at ani place peopl special troup of colleg go peopl with everi possibl resourc reach there to help out these peopl . so i think i think young peopl do spend their time in serv but not their onli commun but whole world .
