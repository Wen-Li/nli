the develop of mass media wa the begin of a new era of avertis . virtual all compani make use of advertis use the possibl given by the new form of mass media as for exampl the tv or the internet . i agre with the statement that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . first reason for my point of view is econom . given the fact that firm take their decis on the basi of ration there ha to be an econom icent for them to invest in advertis . and so it 's quit obviou that the firm intend to increas their sale by the way of advertiz . and the consum are now buy more from the firm 's product for one simpl reason . the firm 's product seem to them much better than it realli is . and the firm know thi fact make use of thi by advert . anoth argument is psycholog . i person have made the experi that the way one consid the valu of certain object is highli influenc by the way that other peopl talk about these object . for exampl , onc most of my friend bought a new video game . and wherea i had n't like thi certain game a short time befor , from thi moment on get thi game seem to be the most import thing in the world . and thi process is now link to the effect of advertis , becaus the advertis for a lot of product is made by veri popular peopl like a tenni star or show master of an tv show . and thi effect how peopl think about the product . the product seem in most case much better than it realli is . even if advertis often convey true inform about a product awaken the interest of the peopl . i believ that there is mostli a strong effect influenc the peopl in a way , so that there is differ between the true valu of a product and the valu the peopl think . and thi mean that there take place an alien of the peopl prefer . and from an econom point of view thi ca n't be good for the welfar of the societi .
