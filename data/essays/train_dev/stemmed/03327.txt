i agre with the statement that advertis often make the product appear better than it realli is -- but i would claim that thi is hardli surpris if one consid the function of advertis . basic , advertis serv two purpos : to inform the consum of the product 's exist , and to motiv him or her to purchas the product . the advertis 's intent is to sell the product , not to provid comprehens detail about pro and con . thu , advertis will away focu on the positv aspect of a product and omit ani neg one . truth-in-advertis law and consum protect organ will prevent fraudul claim and gross misrepresent of the true product , but advertis usual still take a few liberti . a famou exampl is a scene from the movi `` fall down '' in which the main charact is enrag by the fact that a fast food restaur depict a hamburg as larg and succul , while the product he get is flatten , mushi and disgust . of cours , the film exagger , but seldom doe one find process food to look as appeal in realiti as it doe in advert or on box . usual , small notic such as `` serv suggest '' exempt the manufactur from liabil . anoth mean by which product are made to look better in advertis is the modif of context . for exampl , mani car advert show the car drive at high speed through a desert or such , with the driver be complet relax and casual . while thi make the car look more appeal , realiti with it speed limit and heavi traffic make it unlik that one will actual max out the vehicl in such a manner . thi all might seem like a consum watchdog 's nightmar , but one must alway bear in mind the function of advertis , as i have alreadi mention . it just is , by definit , a one-sid view with a certain purpos -- sell . to assum it to be someth els -- a valid , unbias sourc of inform -- would be fallaci . it remain the consum ' respons to compar and evalu , base on independ review and the like , when choos a product .
