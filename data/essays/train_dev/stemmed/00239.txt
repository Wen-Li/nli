a number of peopl maintain that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . while the first reaction of some peopl may be to disagre with thi statement , there are conpel the reason to explor thi issu more in depth . form my point of view , i find i agre with thi statement for two reason . one reason that i can support is that i can control the time by myself . for exampl , last year , i came to japan with my friend becaus we are too crazi on shop clother . then we wa lost with our tour guid . howev , the last reason whi i can agre with thi statement is i can do everyth i like to do . for instanc , my parent want to visit my aunt when they came to la with a tour guid , but they can not go . they need to follow the tour guid 's schudel . all of these reason had influec me more in depth . of i know there may be some peopl disagre with me , but
