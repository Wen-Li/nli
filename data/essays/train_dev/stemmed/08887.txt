young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i agre and disagre with that statement becaus sometim you can see an old person is enjoy hi \ her life and that depend on hi feel , money , health , and think about how he \ she is go to spend the rest of her life either in joy or sad . there are alot of peopl who enjoy life in differ way , i mean that each person ha hi own and differ way to enjoy life . sometim you can see old person who enjoy life more than a young person and sometim you can find young person who enjoy life more than old person and as i said joy in life differ in each one and also it depend on the person feel , money , health , and hi way of think . you can see alot of young peopl who suffer in life and wish to die , that becaus of lack of one of the four thing i mention abov , and sometim you can see alot of young peopl who enjoy life becaus they are still young and be old is still far away from there life and that they must spend each second of hi life happ and joy . sometim you can see old person who suffer in life and that is 70 % of them and that becaus they are afraid from death or they feel that they are too old and can not handl and do anyth and they want other peopl to take care of them like small children , but still we can find old peopl who are happey and they enjoy there life alot becaus it the end of there life and they have to pass everi minut happi and that will caus the old person to live longer . in my opinion the statement could be both agre and disagre as i mention abov and joy and happi can be made by the person him \ her self .
