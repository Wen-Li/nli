fist , i want to say that i am agre with the idea to travel in group , but not to have a tour guid . i think that travel in group is a veri good idea becaus , when you travel whith some friend you can increas your ang spirit . in fact , when you do a travel it alway happen some bad thing that you do not hope . thi bad thing can increas the partnership of you and your friend . i have in my head the exampl of the boy movi . the boy hockey team want to have a better team spirit befor a big tournement so the team decid to go at < < la pourvoiri > > and the team also decid to not drink alcool in thi trip . the < < pourvoiri > > it on a a veri big forest not veri far so they hava to take a plane . but the day when tha plane ha to come for drop the team at the arena . the plane is not there . so the half of the team decid to wallk in the forest toward the arena and the other half decid to wait for the plane . but the guy that go on the forest do not ha the good map and they are lost so they have to work in team . i think to travel with a tour guid is not a good idea . becaus whith the tour guid you a have a veri strict schedul . so if you want to take more time for a thihg you destruct all the schedul and after thi the rest of the day it bad . so when you do not have tour guid you can do all that you want , you do not have to respect a schedul . but when you do not have tour guid you can lose some good place to see and the tour guid can have an interest approch about he 's citi or countri .
