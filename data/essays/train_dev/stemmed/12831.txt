i agre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i think the trip will be well-plan , enjoy , and econom in thi way . a tour guid usual know the resort well . therefor , he or she most like ha a good plan of where to visit , where to eat , where to take pictur , and where to stay for the night . i went to the niagara fall in a group led by a tour guid . the guid talk about the histori and format of the fall on the bu . we stop at a small and good restaur for lunch . in the afternoon , he took us directli to the best spot of view . i did not spent ani time look up a map and figur out where to go . it is enjoy to travel with a group led by a tour guid . we can talk on the way . we can also make friend with each other . we can help each other when need . when i went to the smoki mountain last summer , we were talk and sing on the bu . it wa one of the best memori of my vacat . it is also econom to travel with a group led by a tour guid . peopl can share the expens of rent a bu or a car . they can share the expens on ga and toll as well . sometim it is cheaper to buy bulk ticket than to buy each ticket individu . for exampl , if a ticket cost twenti dollar for one , it might onli cost fifteen dollar each if you buy ten of them at the same time . these are the reason whi i think it is a good idea to travel in a group led by a tour guid .
