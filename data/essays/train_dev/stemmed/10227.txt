in my opinion , it is true that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . firstli becaus in today 's societi , consumpt ha becom a way of life where advertis ha a big impact on consumm 's belief . what is import current is not necessarili the tast or the qualiti of a product . the surpris trend is that peopl are increasingli affect by the imag of the product . and the big compani have understood thi trend and take the opportun to develop their good by creat solid brand . therefor , they play on the peopl belief and in some case even cheat on them by argu with pseudo scientif concept . for instanc , we will probabl buy the pack of milk with the metion `` special omega 3 '' instead of the one with no advertis . besid that , we have to be consciou that there is no link between the qualiti of a product and it advertis . the proof is that it is a total differ compani which is in charg of the advertis . and thi last one ha often much more money to fund it advertis than the first one ha to make hi product . final i think that it is veri danger today not to take enough into consider the way good are product . some ball are for exampl made by poor indian children we are not awar of . and they will becom high qualiti ball as soon as a brand will be written on it .
