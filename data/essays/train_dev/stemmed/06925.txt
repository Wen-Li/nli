i 've alway been interest in all the environ arund me and everi unknown thing it would be a subject to be discov . if you are intrest in onli one subject you could have a great improv of the knowledg of it , but it 's a problem for everyth els . i think that bigger is your knowledg as better it is . in fact , if you have some troubl of ani kind you can know what you are in front of and you could studi and solv it . then , if you know more than one subject , you can discuss or argu them with other peopl and you could improv your self knowledg . mani academ subject are also link , than it 's easier comprend them if you know all a bit of all of them . an exampl of my istitut ( and mani other ) are histor art , modern art , antropolog and product design . anoth exampl , in the music , all the style are link and mani style born by the knowledg of other style . also , in order to have a nice life , you are advantag becous you have a big rang where you could find a job that you can enjoy . and in thi societi the our job is the basement of our life . i have no other opinion for the discuss , but i hope that i 've explain all you need for the comprenct of my idea .
