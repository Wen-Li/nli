i agre that there will be fewer car in use that there are today . sinc the oil is run out , the car , in the futur , would be less valu and sought than in the past and present , also there are increas demand for privat helicopt or airplan by which peopl can save the time of wait for the traffic congest . furthermor , the public transport would be incred conveni and easili access to the extent that peopl onli prefer to use the whole of them . first of all , in less than twenti year , the oil would run out and the oil-requir car would be complet replac by the electr car . howev , the electr car have ton of problem associ with their speed , effici of the electr , and so on . consid thi fact , i think that mani peopl would prefer to find other way of access to the place they want . second , more public focus and interest are be given to the privat helicopt or airplan . somewhat wealthi peopl might alreadi possess one or even two . there are sever reason whi peopl prefer to own privat helicopt or mini airplan . in recent societi , the most preval is the vehicl on the road and the most rampant one is also the vehicl on the road , which caus lot of traffic congest and sometim even the high way are jam . there is no singl famili that doe not own their privat vehicl . also , the traffic accid are incred increas and mani peopl are deceas without ani guilt . some or mani peopl are toxic or drunken dure their drive . no matter how bad condit the person hit by their car is lie on , or no matter how softli the car were crash with each other , the up-com consequ are strikingli huge that they even can drop the person down the hell , or toppl the person with hi all author and properti . third , the public transport are remark advanc as the public interest on them are focus more and more . mani peopl prefer the public transport to their privat vehicl , becaus they do not have to be late in their work site due to the harsh traffic congest . the well-design schedul , which doe not chang from time to time but stay the constant , guarante them of the time of arriv to their work place . to sum up , i think there would fewer car in use in twenti year becaus of the reason i mention abov . in my person case , sinc i tend to be late at my school and i 'm not the typic student who are veri organ and schedul in time , i prefer to get my privat helicopt in the futur .
