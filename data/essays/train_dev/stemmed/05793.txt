it is difficult to say whether it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject or to special in one specif subject . first i will say that it is import to have a broad knowledg . but then i will show that it is not easi or even possibl to do . have a broad knowledg is veri good . thi is whi , at school i have learn about a lot of differ topic . to know as good about histori as about biolog or astronomi is fantast . if i had thi broad knowledg i would be abl to speak with a biologist or an historian . but it is possibl to have a broad knowledg of mani academi subject without be special in one particular topic ? in fact , my knowledg in biolog would not be as accur as thi of a biologist . that is to say that , somebodi who ha a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , is special in noth . so , in that case it is hard or even imposs to find a job . i think it is import to special in one specif subject in order to find a job , or to be abl to provid accur inform about a precis topic . in conclus , in my opinion it is better to special in one specif subject . but in that case it is import too , not to forget that other subjet exist . so , it is necessari to read book about other topic . for exampl a biologist must know about histori even if he will never be as good in histori as in biolog becaus the may need histor inform to explain sever phenomenon that he is alreadi studi .
