the use of car today is almost `` automat '' in our societi . most household have at least one vehicl and peopl use their car for ani purpos , from major trip to go to pick up groceri down the street . howev , the use of car is be threaten by the lack of oil the world will be face soon . on the other hand , the use of car threaten our environ , contribut to the pollut of our atmospher and to global warm . what will the consequ be in twenti year ? will there be fewer car or just higher pollut ? what solut will we find ? so mani question to answer , so littl time , and so much of our everyday life and comfort affect . .. i think that our societi , in order to be abl to have the mani car we have today , will need to find solut to our biggest problem . first of all , we are alreadi face the problem of the decreas amount of oil lead to the price explos of gasolin . exploit oil becom more and more expens and rare , and it is start to affect everyon who own a car . ani trip or use of the vehicl becom prici , and as a result , more and more peopl consid use public transport . i think thi will eventu lead peopl to a better understand of what the societi as a whole can do : if there are fewer car , it reduc the pollut and help the environ . from an individu point of view , use public transit will becom cheaper as gasolin price will go up . for those reason , and becaus i want to be optimist , i think there will be fewer car in twenti year . peopl will realis how much money own a car repres and most household will simpli not be abl to afford it . nonetheless , if govern and innov corpor start to work hand in hand , solut to find better environment-friendli resourc to replac gasolin will appear . as a result , peopl will be abl to buy vehicl that work with elecr or natur ga , and will be abl to keep use their privat mean of transport . in thi case , we will tend to see more car than today , as the world popul tend to grow . some solut have alreadi start to show up and enabl us to keep confid in the futur . howev , i do believ that we are reach the highest point of consumpt today . i doubt there will be more car in the futur , and i realli hope peopl will consid public transport as a great altern , for the sake of everybodi as well as for the preserv of our environ .
