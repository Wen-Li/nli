dure our last few school year , we are face with choos subject which we would like to specialis in , in the futur . some student choos a small number , while other take almost as mani as possibl . the student with the more subject will be more skill than the other , and will have better career opportun later on . when one specialis in one specif subject , he or she can excel at it perfectli . thi can benefit us in mani way . for exampl , if a person is so good at someth , he or she will be so skill , and will be abl to perform the task success and effici , save time and energi . on the other hand , when specialis in onli one particular subject , we are limit ourselv and are unabl to reach our full potenti . have a broader knowledg of mani academ subject is more use than excel in just one , as not onli doe it give you more skill , it also increas your chanc of success in the futur . think about it logic ; would you rather employ someon who can onli perform one task , than employ someon who can perform dozen ? i would choos the latter . studi a variat of subject also keep us more fulfil , and less bore . if you studi the same subject over and over again , for a vast period of time , you would get extrem weari of the subject , and therefor would make it seem veri uninterest . you are given so mani opportun in thi life , so what is the point of wast them . you must alway strive for the best and want to learn more . whi limit yourself to just one thing ? although sometim it is use to excel at someth , i disagre with the statement ` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject .
