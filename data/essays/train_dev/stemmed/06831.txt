gather new knowledg and understand process of someth is of high valu at everi time in a person life ; especi dure studi . but how should a person get new inform ? in my opinion the most import possibl to get new knowledg is by understand idea and concept of someth . by learn fact , you can get onli a small impress of how someth work , becaus it is veri complic to know everyth in detail . so by understand the concept of the solut it can be assum that thi knowledg is aquir by the person . when some fact are onli learn they are not aquir . by know concept of someth the thing , miss by not learn everi fact , can be dedic from the knowledg . in a lectur wa say that a person forget everi seven year the half of it learn fact . therefor it is veri import that peopl are abl to dedic fact from their knowledg . so a huge knowlegdeg of fact can be made by understand thing . but the other direct is not easi . anoth point is , if mani thing are conceptu understood , the abil of understand new thing is higher than by peopl who learn fact . so , if understand of new topic is inceas , the compet in a sector rise faster and the specif concept can be also use faster . after studi , mani student will be confront with research new thing and concept . by know and understand other concept it will be easier to adapt the search concept from other concept . thi abil make research faster an more success .
