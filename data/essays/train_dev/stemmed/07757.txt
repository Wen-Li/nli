in the recent year , the number of car ha grown up to a level that wa never reach befor . nowaday , the traffic problem are get more and more seriou . the question of reduc the number of car will be one of the most preoccupi matter of concern . there are the argument that sustain my opinion . first of all , sinc the number of car ha ben grow up fastli , the societi have to face with a major problem : how to regul the trafic and to deal with the queue that happen everi day on major highway and in major citi . it is now get more and more difficult to circul at the rush hour . if the number of car still grow like it doe nowaday , the risq to face total block of the circul will be real . anoth argument is that the oil and ga reserv are get rarer everyday . as a long term consequ , their price will increas in a huge proport . scientif know the problem veri well even if they do not know when the reserv will be over . if we ca n't find a substitut energi , we 'll have to chang our habit . one of the consequ is that we 'll have to live in area close to our job or to choos for anoth medium of commun . both of those situat will lead to a decreas of the number of car use by the citizen . last but not least , use the car is one of the global warm 's major caus . the consequ of the phenomenon will be desastr for the futur gener , such as the increas of the level of the ocean , climat 's chang , ... i think peopl are get more and more awar of thi concern . sensibilis will make peopl chang their own mind and consid to choos for new media of commun , such as bike , roller , ... in ani case , i think that , accord to those argument , there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today .
