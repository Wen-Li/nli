some pepl like indivisu travel , other like to travel in a group led by a tour guid . in my opinion , i prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guid . i would like to show three point refer ration and exampl . first of all , a group trip make us easi to go unfamili spot in the famou sight see place . sinc tour a guid ha profession knowledg on the place , they can advis us to see unknown but good spot . in my experi , when i went to china in a school trip , i could find beautiul scene of forest and river from unknown spot . if i had not travel in a group , it mutst have been impossib sinc i wa unfamili with china . also , a tour guid can help us to commun effici with foeigner in a foeign travel . in gener , a tour guid , especi who often goe to foegin countri , ha a good command of the ingeni languag . therefor , we can commun with ingeni peopl through their languag help . if we do not have tour guid , especi in foreign countri which we have not learn the languag , we can not directli commun with them . sinc one of big advantag to go abroad is to commun with nativ peopl , and to learn the life and cultur , no languag support doe not bring benefici time . lastli , refer to an advangag of a travel in the form of group , it ensur to commun with other peopl who are in the same tour . it is a good opportun to see other peopl , becaus , in my case , i do not have much opportun to meet other unfamili japanes . sinc i am a univers student , i alway meet same peopl such as classmat or friend who belong to the same club activ . if i could meet someon who have same the tast , i would be abl to have etern relationship with them . thu , due to three point : go to unfamili spot , commun with ingeni peopl , and have relationship with peopl in the same travel , i prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guid .
