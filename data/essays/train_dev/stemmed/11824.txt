accord with the previou statement , young current peopl do not have a activ role in the societi , and i think that is true , but is not a big problem . in my countri is veri common that young peopl do not have ani interest in the nation economi , polit or cultur that surround themself . they do not want to spend time help other citizen in their commun . they have the time , is true , but not for help . their `` real '' interest are friend , video game and entertai . in my opinion , societi ha the respons to catch the attent of thi young peopl througt to differ way that it ha . here in spain , gover prepar special event for young peopl : cultur event focu in young peopl , gover worker are help in the school in order to have more implic young peopl , etc . we have to creat some essenci valu in the young peopl in order to they understand the enviro in which they are live . but i sure that is not a great problem for the societi , becaus peopl start the interest in the commun when they need it . i would liek to explain it with an exampl : if we take a young boy of a develop countri , we have to ask us : which think need thi boy from the commun ? noth . he ha a home , love parent , cabl televis , friend , video game , internet , etc . .. they do n't need anyth from the commun , so he is not go to colabor with it . thi situat chang total when young peopl start uppergrad studi or start in hi first job . they start the contact with the societi . is in thi moment , when young peopl understand that they are live with a lot of peopl and we have to talk , work , studi , etc , with them in order to develop themself in their live and in the societi . when young peopl reach thi level , they want to start the colabor with their commun .
