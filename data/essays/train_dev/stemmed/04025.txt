i believ young peopl nowaday do give enough time help their commun and i do not agre with the statement . in thi centuri , the number of elder are increas continu . by that , it becam more import to maintain elder in the commun . the point is that it is usual those teen and yuong peopl in 20 's who help old ladi on the street or go to nurs hous to serv the elder . i had volunt mani time with friend to take a walk whth elder who live alon . adult are not do these work say that they are tire of work or they do not have much time to do so . adult are also use young peopl to do addit work . school teacher are a commom exampl of thi situat . teacher order student to pull out grass and pick out small stone out of school garden after school . i rather believ that adult are the one that doe not tri to help their commun . i also saw mani young peopl volunt on their own and they were will to do it . in korea , young peopl work as helper at subway station and mostli at the nurs hous . they also go to polic station or post offic to clean up the place . as univers are put a rule on addit score to those who volunt for the commun , more young now have chanc than past . accordingli , more peopl will tri to help the commun . although it is not an activ way , it is good to the commun consid that adult are busi work and there is not much peopl to work for commun . for the reason and exampl abov , i disagre with the statement and young peopl put enough time to help their commun . howev , i think there need to be more improv to both adlut and young to activ help their commun .
