i disgre with the point that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . of cours , no doubt understand idea and concept is veri import . we need to appli idea and concept to realiti . idea and concept are basic stuff . but it is a littil bit hast to conclud thi result that understand idea and concept is more import . the object of understand idea and concept is to practic . then the practic yield mani fact . i think no idea and concept is perfect which is alway impecc . though learn the fact , we can complement idea and concept . take an organ chemistri lab for exampl . absorb of the solut . at first , we must look at the manual of the lab and grasp the principl of the lab . then we began to do the lab . sometim we found it wa not true that the absorb wa proport to the concentr . it seem against the rule . that wa a fact . we need to find the real reason lead to the result . last we found absorb wa affect by mani factor . tempertur and humiti can control the result . idea and concept are veri deep and hard to understand which are forgotten quickli . by fact , we often easili understand idea and concept . fact are vidid . most student are tire of lot of studi . face to textbook is a hard thing for a long time . but fact give us a direct feel which inspir our interest and imagin . sometim it is amaz that we grasp idea and concept so easili and quickli . and mani new invent are gener by fact . for instanc newton principl . if newton did not see the process of fall down the appl , newton principl will not exist . we do not deni the import of understand idea and concept which is most basic . if we do not understand idea and concept , we can not learn anyth from fact . fact , idea and concept are indispens . if we can do well by them togeth , we will do better .
