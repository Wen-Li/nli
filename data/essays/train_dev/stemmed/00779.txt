i total agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . as we all know , creativ and courag are veri import qualiti that lead a person to success . as in nowaday 's intens competit , well-round develop also play a crucial role . success peopl are not a major in the societi . the reason they outstand other is that they find a new way that other have not found or dare not to go . the famou exampl of bill gate shed light on thi point . bill gate went to a prestig univers . howev , he did not stay in school until gratuat , as most peopl usual do . instead , he quit school after two year and devot to a new field interest he -- comput , which wa then not common . the courag to tri new thing eventu brought tremend success to him . as one anoth contemporari success entrepreneur , donald trump say , sinc you are to think , think big . thi infer dare to take risk is also a stepston on the way to success . if one onli doe what he alreadi know how to do well , he can do noth other than thi field . that is to say , even if he is second to none in thi categori , in other , he is noth more than a greener . howev , to be a success peopl , expertis in a singl , or limit rang is far from enough . one must be well-round , at least knowledg in gener , to get to success , which is not an easi case at all . after all , we can see tri new thing and take risk reveal a person 's extinguish qualiti such as creativ , courag and well-round develop , which are all indispens factor to success . therefor , the statement is complet true .
