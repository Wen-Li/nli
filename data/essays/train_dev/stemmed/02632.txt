success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i can onli support thi statement , becaus one will never be more successful than other , if one doe not tri out new think . and for tri out someth new one ha to take the risk to fail , or to get hurt . thi impli the fact , that success peopl have to be veri confid . confid mean in thi case to be abl to keep your head up and go on , eventhough someth did not work . becaus thi is what happ all the time when you risk someth , sometim it might work , sometim you will fail . of cours be success doe not onli mean have a big job career , one can be success in sport , school , famili , organ life ect . but in everyth you want to succeed you have to be open for new thing . if you alway walk the same path like the other you will never step out off the mass . but walk new path ask for alot of courag , which peopl can get when they get older and more experienc . so finali i want to say everybodi ha the chanc to be success , they just have to be will to take the risk .
