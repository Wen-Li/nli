some peopl think that yong peopl nowaday give enough time to help their commun . but , in my view , i think young peopl nowadi do not give time to help their commun , becaus of three reason as follow . first , i think young peopl nowaday have a tendanc to dislik thier commun . perhap the best exampl to illustl thi point is that when i , member of comuniti festiv , want to have a meet in the citi center for preper of festiv , and call the member of my commun , onli seldom yong peopl assembel . most person are elderli person which do n't enogh power to do the job . in other day , when i happen to meet one yong person in my commun , i heard the reason whi he did n't come the meet . hi answer wa so simpl that i ca n't tell anyt - he dislik such a meet becaus it is bore . what is more , i think yong peopl nowaday have a lot of thing to do , compar to the peopl 20 year ago . for instanc , wach tv , play video game and use a comput and so on . what is wors , to spend the time in do these thing , yong peopl nawaday have littl time to commuc with thier famili . and as aconsequ , they also do n't have time to commun with the person in their commun . nor help their commun . third , comun power itself come to weeken it power these day . long time ago , commun play a import roll in keep it sequr . but , these day , i think comun fanction itself is weeken theseday with the progress of civilaz . therefor , i think young peopl nowadi do not give time to help their commun , becaus they have tendanc to dislik their commun , they have a lot of thing to do , and commun itself come to weeken it power .
