some pupil often claim about the fact that they have to learn so much fact on thing that they are not realli interest in . but thi problem is sometim onli base on the thing that pupil just have not understood the idea of the theme . therefor i think it is more import for pupil as well as for student to get clear with the idea and how these idea are develop than just to learn about the fact . i agre that theori is import but all the other thing should be then strengthen by practis . the most import argument is that without have understand the idea or the concept of the special topic that is be work on in class it is just useless for the student to learn the fact base on the topic . in a certain test the student may can list all the fact that he ha learn but doe absolut not understand in what context they are . secondli , i think it is more import that the student learn about the theori in the lesson and than practic it in the world . if there is for instanc a student of medicin who ha alway learn veri care all the factor that have someth to do with anatomi it is the best way to strengthen hi skill by give him the opportun to have an exam on a real dead bodi . lastli , student may just be overwhelm by all the fact they are suppos to learn and can therefor just forget the real content of the idea . look behind the facad is veri import for a student so that eventu he can realli cope with all the factor and of cours also the problem connect with thi concept . in conclus it is absolut more import for a student to understand the idea than to learn the fact , becaus practis is more import than theori and student should not be overwhelm by the fact of a certain topic .
