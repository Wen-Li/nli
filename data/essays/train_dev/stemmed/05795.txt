i total agre that most advertis make product seem better than they realli are . profession use good packag , good imag to make that product attract to us . furthermor by the help of commerci we get use to them . good packag make product seem better . we are alway affect by the big , color , fanci and bright thing when we are tri to make a choic between two differ thing . we also choos what look nice as a packag , but sometim the result can supris us . when i wa a chind i wa given a chanc to select the presid i want from two differ choic . i chose the red one and then when we open the box i realiz that the light yellow ugli wrap one wa a better presid . packag in advertis may make you select wrong choic . see good outcom of that product in advertisi campain may not be correct . we are all afect by the imag of that product but infact there may be noth to do with that imag and the product . for instanc , we sometim see an advertis about a product and we think that if we wear that shoe we can jump as much as the basketbal . but infact it is not true that what advertis show as , it show us that product is a super product and it can help you jump more ofcours it is not true . profession in advertis busi are use media to show us and remind us that product more often then we get use to that product . as the time pass we slowli start to think that , it is shown everywher , everybodi is talk about it so it must be a good product . i rememb when i wa affect by a shampoo adertis becaus i wa see it on everi wall and watch it commerci each night . when i bought that product i realiz that i wa not ani better that the regular shampoo furthermor it wa not make my hair i smooth as i use to have . in conclus , i believ that profession are use advertis as a danger and powerful tool to influenc peopl 's opinion in order to make them believ that the product is better in one or other way from it competitor .
