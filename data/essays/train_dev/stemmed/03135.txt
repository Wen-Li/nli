nowaday young peopl have mani differ kind to happi and they are n't the problem that their parent had . in my person opinion is not true that the young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . i disagrr to thi statement . further , i want to say that the young peopl have a respons and the possibl to studi , then they becam adult leater . then , they are few time for help their comun . i reali true that mani no profit organization ( onlu ) can do their activit becaus mani young peopl work free for their . at thi day , for a young person , is veri difficult chose to go in africa , or in anoth pure zone of the world , for help the popul . but a lot of young peopl do it . also mani organ of citi , for exempl churc or cri , have help by the young peolp . anoth point that i think is it import to mention is that in a world full of elettron intrateni , money and when the possibl to travel and enjoy yourshelf are more it is veri difficult fill the need to help the comun . in my person own opionion for improv the number of the young peopl that decid to help their comun is more import educ and teach to children the import of frendli , cariti and love .
