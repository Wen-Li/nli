vehicl prefranc in order to travel is usual a problem for the peopl . peopl use anim like hors , camel for travel but with the rapid growth of technolog nowaday peopl are in love with car . in my oppinion peopl will reduc the usag of car in twenti year becaus the air that we breath is get dirtier , the oil that we use in order to get energi for car is reduc and technolog is still improv rapidli so there will be more appropri vehicl for transport in the futur . first , with the usag of car the air is get dirtier day by day , the carbon monoxid , emit from the turbin of the car , is pollut the air . in some countri like the netherland govern start to encourag their citizen for use bicycl in order to travel . by ride bike peopl , not onli will get fit , but also they will breath more clean air . second , and the most import reason for my expect in reduc car usag , is the oil resourc will vanish in the futur . more and more peopl are use car nowaday but our sourc for oil is limit . the oil reserv are becom less that is whi the oil price are get higher . in my countri some peopl can not afford buy the oil in these price . they have car but they are not abl to use them becaus their financi situat is not well enough to buy oil so often . third , the scientist will find more suitabl vechil in order to travel in the futur . in an articl i have read , i saw that some research in the us did find a vehicl which can fli as well as ride on the ground . so with the develop technolog some other devic can take the place of the car in the futur . tu sum up , i think less peopl will still be use the car in the next two decad . you will think that the car are safe , econem and fast but they are also leav a bunch of carbon monoxid for us to breath , the oil price will get higher day by day and the technolog improv will make faster vehicl . so in my opinion peopl will forget their love toward car in the futur .
