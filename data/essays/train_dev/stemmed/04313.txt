i think that at high school a student should studi as mani subject as possibl ; it is veri import for a student to have a broad knowledg of mani acedem subject becaus , follow thi way , a student can have a global wiev of a lot of real topic , he can studi differ subject and then decid what he like , what is the best or the most interest subject for him . at univers , a person who have studi a lot of subject sholud be more motiv in what is learn becaus he is learn what he realli love . i think that after high school it is better to special in one specif subject also becaus nowaday it is veri difficult to find a job and the `` world of work '' is bacom more competit and it need special employe . for exampl i am go to appli for a financ degre on my graduat program and then i would like to work as an analyst in a famou bank . i am sure that my bachelor degre in busi administr ( undergradu program ) is not enough for my futur job bacaus at the moment i am not special in anyth and i can not appli for an analyst posit in a bank becaus sure there are a lot of peopl more special in financ than me ; my bachelor degre in busi administr doe n't provid me a specifc knowledg about the financi world . thi exampl is about an undergradu univers program and a graduat program , becaus thi is my own experi , but we can use thi way also , like i have mention at the begininng , for a student that , after high school , want to appli for univers . if you studi on a phd program you have the possibl to becom more special , but you should follow thi way onli , for exampl , if you want to becom a scientist . final , i am sure that it is import for a student 's educ to studi a lot of subject and then , after there , four , five year , decid a special in one specif subject .
