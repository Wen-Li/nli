there are some peopl who think travel led by a tour guid is better , but other prefer to travel singl instead of tour guid lead . but i would have to say , if i wa face with thi issu , i would probabl follow the tour guid 's lead in a group . in the follow discuss , i would like to reason and provid exampl to support my viewpoint . no issu is more import now than the one that refer to safeti . histori wit and present mani exampl , that travel by oneself may meet some danger or troubl . for exampl , we go to a less level countri , such as china , and take money on hand , thi behavor may suffer some danger . or when we travel an eurpeon countri with unpolit dress . do n't you think the exampl quot abov are veri persuas ? conveni is anoth head and chief reason that i have chosen to put it here . it is no better illustr that can demostr the view . if the trip is not conveni , it will take the travel too mani energi to enjor their trip . even famili as a coupl . they will be unconveni on a busili trip . superior as lead by a tour guid , lead by tour guid or decid trip by self also ha own demerit , too . decid trip cours may spend mani time and may lose someth interest . lead by a tour guid may lose one 's freedom to find someth els besid the tour . nevertheless , the advantag of lead by a tour guid carri more weight than that of the disadvantag of lead by a tour guid . so the most strike conclus is obviou . to sum up , given the reason discuss abov , which sometim intertwin to form an organ whole and thu becom more persuas , we can safe to reach the conclus taht lead by a tour guid in a trip is more safe and conveni . in fact , not onli do i prefer to travel lead by a tour guid in a group , but also prefer to hire a person tour guid for one 's own tour guid to serv himself as well as possibl .
