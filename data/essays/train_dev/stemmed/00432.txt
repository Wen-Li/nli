i mainli agre with the statement that peopl enjoy life more when they are young than when they get older . but some detail need to be analys to proov thi idea . the first point is relat to brithday anniversari . it is common that children and teenag are often veri happi when they get one year older . thi is often relat to present , parti , and lot of friend wish a happi birthday . but old peopl , are veri often sad and asham of get older , and they anniversari remind them of those feel . the way peopl enjoy life depend on their age . it is differ if we consid children , or teenag , or adult . children seem to be happi veri often . they can enjoy ani littl trick dure hour and keep smile and laugh without ani relev reason . children do not have to worri about import thing , inde , they even do not know about them thank to their parent that tri to keep them apart of ani troubl . the way of enjoy life chang as the children becom teenag . the main reason of teenag enjoy life is freedom . even thi often goe along with littl fight with their parent , teenag have the will to creat their freedom by proov that they can be independ . as they feel free , teenag have new hobbi , sometim forbidden , but they enjoy the risk they take . in opposit with the happy of children and teenag , adult can not enjoy life as easili . be an adult mean have repons . adult have to work to earn money and have lot of bond which keep them out or entertain and enjoy life . moreov , when adult have children , they manag to offer their children the happiest life they can . so they do not hesit to sacrific their own happy to the benefit of their famili . but even if that is difficult , parent enjoy everi littl moment of happy they can share with their children .
