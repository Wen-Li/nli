from my point of view it is real that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . thi is a strategi that is usual use in market to encreas the market of a particular product . the goal of thi strategi is to give the idea that a product is realli use , and so it is introduc it in the daili realiti , make it a common product . an exampl of it can be seen in the use of cellphon . it is real that they are realli use : with them you can call everyon everywher . but in the present day they are loos their origin function of phone becom an object of fashion among the teenag . so you can find everyday a cellphon that is better than anoth one that wa sell yesterday onli becaus it ha some new unus function . anoth exampl is that of the ritch car . they have some accessori that are not realli necessari , whose purpos is sometim onli to transform a car in a sort of mobil hous . in thi case the situat is somehow differ from that of the cellphon , becaus the ritch car simbol a sort of statu simbol . so the point of the question is that the advertis on the car make you dream of a product that is not use like a normal car . in my opinion everyon would have a ferrari , but onli becaus it is a statu symbol , and not a car that can be use in the daili life ( it is not design to go on citi street , ot to go at the supermarket ! ) . in my way of think most advertis are usual made on product that are not realli use but that onli repres a fashion ( thi is to say someth that will be use onli for some time ) or that repres object unreachebl . but thank of these properti these type of product seem much better than they realli are , and have a great market .
