to me , the whole point of advertis is to sell , thu when advertis you should tri to seduc the costum . in fact there are mani thing or featur of the product that you can use to do so , as the qualiti or the price , but alway the main thing of show the good featur over the bad one . i agre with the idea that advertis make product look better than they realli are , but i do n't see anyth bad with it . inde , our freadom of speech ensur us mainli the right to say almost everyth to everybodi , with some exept of cours , but under thi perspect anyon could told us anyth , in particular how good is the product they are offer . most of the time , the advertis do not lie or say anyth strictli fals , instead they focu on their strenght . therefor is true that the product look better than they realli are , but is not ill will on that . inde , it is the same thing you do when you go to a job interview , or tri to approach some of the opposit sex for first time . think about it , in these ocat you tri to look good , seem confid , veri capabl , intellig or even sexi , realic that you are tri to look better than you are . although i consid that some exager should be avoid , becaous they are not show how good the product reali is , instead thay are a lie . for intanc , see the all magic recipi , belt and all kind of craft and offer to lose weight , everybodi know that is a lie . i think th kind of thing should be control by some costum 's agenc , which should request some kind of survey or stadist to support thing that are state on the advertis . anyway , is in the costum and the costum 's agenc who will at the end decid which product deserv an which doe not , our trust . thi is the onli way of reali punnish tose that make reallli exager adverti say lie or said unproven thing about their product . but alway whitout attak the fredom of speach or see thing in a particular prespect .
