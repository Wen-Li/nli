in gener i agre with the statement , that success peopl tri new thing and take more risk instead of onli do what they are use to do . there are sever reason whi i do agre . in the first place , if you alway do the same there is no develop at all and your environ remain stabl . it becom bore and you do not differ from all the other peopl worldwid . success occur when you do someth surpris and new . one good exampl is columbu , who found america by do someth all the other men in hi time hesit . anoth exampl is the discoveri of antibiotica , which wa made by accid and tri someth new . success mean to differ from what is normal and familiar to the peopl . they want to be impress and buy thing that are new and in facion , so as a design you also have to be creativ and tri new thing . on the stock market you even have to take enorm risk if you want to make the highest incom . here take risk is fundament . second , thi is also true in the human partnership . here you have to take high risk to talk to the person you like and say thi to him or her , but onli then you can be success by come togeth and get frien or even partner . you have to take the risk and see if you fail or succeed . without reveal your feel to the other person you never know , if you would have been success if you did . success also mean improv and thi need chang and develop . but these can onli take place if you take risk and tri new thing . final thi statement is also true for me myself . i have chosen to take the risk and go in a foreign countri to studi and do my llm instead of stay at home and complet the normal educ way that lawyer have in my home countri . thi includ be in a new surround and far away from home , but it is a challeng and it perhap lead me to a more success career than without take thi risk to studi in a foreign countri . in conclus , all these point support the idea of the statement and therefor i agre with it .
