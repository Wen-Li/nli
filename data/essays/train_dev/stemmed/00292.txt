some peopl are call success peopl becaus they tri for someth that other can not achiev so easili . becaus of these success person we are abl to see refriger , micro owen , televis , comput , aeroplan etc . success peopl are uniqu and risqu are alway part of thier life . they never mind take risk dure reach thier goal . for exampl take the case of wright brother of america who ha led to the discoveri of jet plane , aeroplan . wright brother saw a bird fli in the air and he thought that whi can not a similar structur be made and make it fli in the air use two wing and a tail . he went to ahil and ran from the hill to downward by let to fli with the model plane . he had tri sever time and ha eventu fail . even there wa risk to hi life he never mind and hi goal wa to run the plane . atlast he final succed oneday . from thi one can learn success peopl tri new thing and take risk . we can also take the case of newton who wa respons to find the graviti of motion of earth . he wa onc sit down an appl tree and he wa see up toward the sky . while he wa see toward the sky an appl ha eventu had fallen on hi head . he wa surpris by see the appl that had fallen on hi head and he thought that whi doe the appl doe not go up toward the sky and whi is it fall downward . thi typic think lead him to the find of gravit motion of earth . he wa also respons for find the three newton law of motion . from the abov exampl we can conclud that success peopl alway tri new thing and those thing make these peopl uniqu from other . without risk we can not do ani thing great and we all peopl should do someth new and find someth new and contribut someth to world .
