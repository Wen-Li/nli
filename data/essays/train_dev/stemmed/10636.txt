in our life we alway see that some peopl keep success and other not . i think that it doe n't depend onli on the fact that a person take risk or not . so i can say that sometim a person keep success becaus of their risk and sometim becaus of hi good luck . in the first case , the person is a veri known and exim person . for instanc , a person that ha peopl that work for him can be a man that take risk , that believ in hi abil and in hi potenti , that have a great sens of respons becaus perhap the futur of mani famili depend on hi decis . in the second case i can think to some peopl that now appear on televis , or in the cinema . they are success peopl but their success is not keep from hard work . they had simpli a good luck in order to be known and to receiv a lot of money and often the success is no so long . for instanc the famou peopl 's son are success peopl but they have n't take ani risk : they are onli famou peopl son . to conclud , success peopl can take risk or can have a good luck rathen the other .
