in my opinion i think that the statement will probabl not reflect the real vision of the futur . in twenti year there will be hope more car than today . car repres a materi good which everyon in the modern societi must have in order to keep up with the world outsid . whatev you do , you need a car . wherev you go , you need a car . it 's definet a must . that 's whi i believ the amount of car will increas in the futur . also , long distanc are now an everyday part of life . most of today 's job usual requir a car in order to move , to go anywher . in fact it is so common now to move from citi to citi for work , and mani peopl find it easier to move by car , sinc the bad servic of train or plane end to be often annoy and stress . in fact , when you have to catch a train , it often happen that the train is delay . the same happen with plane . so you find yourselv wait for hour at the train station or at the airport , tell yourself `` i should have use my car ! '' . that 's one of the reason i do believ peopl would rather use their car than take a public transport . therefor , if peopl need to use the car , whoever doe n't own one , will need to buy one , and that will increas the number of car . besid , i believ that we should also consid the young peopl in order to forse that the number of car will definet increas in the next year . in fact we have to take into account how import are kid within the societi . they repres the custom of the futur . they will also be the car ' buyer of the futur . young kid ca n't wait to turn eighteen year old onli to get their driver licenc . they look forward to have their own car , becaus they want to feel indipend , free , they want to turn into adult final . one of the feel to feel a grown up man or woman is drive , owinig your car . your own car repres a piec of world of your . onli your . i think is the previou step of go live in your own apart . have a car mean that a piec of your person world is in that car . that 's whi kid want a car so bad when they get their driver licens . and sinc kid now are the futur , the number of car will grow for sure .
