in my opinion the best way to travel is alon or in a veri small group and without a guid . i 'm therefor completelli in opposit with the idea of travel in a group and with a tour guid . one of the main reason whi i believ that travel in a group is not the best way to travel is the fact that the group itself will distract your attent from the envira , both natur and cultur , around you . with thi phrase i mean that be in a group in the major of the case mean that you will spend your time preval within the group itself . in thi way the relationship with the peopl of the commun that you are visit will be veri limit . thi , in my opinion , not onli will reduc your chanc of understrand the cultur that you are visit but even to fulli apprici your journey . furthermor be with a group mean that you relay completelli on it and for the major part of your time you will probabl not even feel the need of speak with the peopl live in the place which are you visit . also when a group of peopl move they are moir notici and they caus more effect that what a singl person will do . thi princip to the fact that a medium size group of peopl will never be abl to go in a small villag without affect the life in the villag itself ina consider way . for what concernc the guid furthermor i do n't realli like the idea of be with a person who 's rule is the one of explain to turist what the cultur of a specif place is . i know that is veri use tool for increas your person understand about a place . but i think that if you relay on a guid , you in same way exclud yourself from the peopl who live in the place . in fact be much more easier have inform about a place from a guid that form a habit of the place it will be normal the tendenc of relay all your inform on what the guid tell you . for these reason i , if i have the possibl to choos , would prefer to travel alon or in a veri small gruop than to be in a big gruop with a tour guid .
