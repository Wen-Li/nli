student have to do both : understand idea and concept , and learn fact . first of all , i do agre with the statement that understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact . for instanc , in an histori class , the professor will teach the date , when the event happen , but more importantli whi , which is the idea or the concept . even though it is worth mention date becaus it is part of the histori and it is also cultur , in my point of view , learn the idea and the concept is more import . learn how the second world war start , the concept , the behavior of the govern and the reaction of peopl is more interest than know that hitler die and the war end in 1945 . anoth exampl would be the contin . student know that a long time ago , there wa onli one contin , then two ( the northern contin and the southern contin ) and final seven contin . that is a fact . what would be interest is to understand whi and how it happen and that would be the concept of chang in temperatur and drift of the contin . nowaday , it would be the effect of the global warm on the ice and the level of the ocean . secondli , if student understand the idea and the concept , they will rememb it easili . moreov , they will be abl to use them afterward for anoth applic . understand the idea and the concept refer to use the intellig . to the contrari , student learn so mani fact that they won t be abl to rememb all of them . nevertheless , learn fact is also use . even if student can not rememb all of them , it is worth do it becaus it stimul the brain . the memori ha to be use . besid , it is nonsens to understand idea and concept without learn fact . i agre with the statement but also think that both are necessari .
