i disagre with thi statement . it is becaus , there are sme reason . one of the reason that if we travel in a group and led by a tour guid , we could not get a interrest to plan that where want to go and where want to stay . usual the tour had some schedul and there were no privat thing . all of the time we have to spend time with other peopl who did not know . you may say to make new friend is veri good thing but not alway we can spend wonder time with them . i think that the travel that go with the peopl who are understand eachoth veri well is better . the tour guid is veri usehul to travel , but we have to allow the rule of the tour that i do not want to . i want to travel more freelli and i want to make a lot of memori by my own style . and the next reason that by my experi . last mounth i went to hokkaido for the school trip with my class mate and we use a bu all three day ofcaus with a tour guid . befor the trip we had a lot of plan for the trip but the school trip had to allow the school style which had a lot of rule . we went to some plece with her and we were told mani thing by the tour guid , but i felt that it wa not to interest . i felt that if we could plan the schedul of the trip might be we could made more oridin memori of the trip . becaus of thi i disagre with thi statement .
