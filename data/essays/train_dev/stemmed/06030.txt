do you agre thi statement that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' ? as far as i am concern , i think that the individu travel is anoth better choic than travel in a group with a tour guid . in addit , i will provid the reason in the follow to support my opinion . first of all , i argu that if someon travel alon , he / she could have more surpris and interest experi that can not happen in group travel and poss the more unforgett memori dure the trip . for exampl , my friend , she travel in the us few year ago . she told me that she went to a small town then lost her all money . howev , a kind person borrow her money and let my friend to live . therefor , she also had a gread time . secondli , i consid that we can learn how to be independ and settl the troubl that encount accid when person travel without a tour guid . to summer , i believ that individu travel is not onli a good oppotun to experi the differ and interest way of travel , but also could train us to becom an independ person and learn more . in the end , i will conclud my argument by emphas on individu travel is good way to have experiencesand to learn someth . tri to travel alon .
