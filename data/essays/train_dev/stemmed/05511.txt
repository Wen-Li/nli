i fulli agre with the statement . for me , the main purpus of an advertis is to show a product to someon ( a person , a group of peopl , a compani , etc ) in order to sell it to the person . so what other way to sell a product than show it the best way possibl . and if the product is not so good or not that good look , the onli way to convinc the audienc that thi product is worth buy is by show it a tini bit better than it realli is in fact . a great exampl that i have in mind to illustr thi , is the follow one : when you are wait in a fast food , restaur and you are look at the pictur of the food you are about to order , you alway see all the french fri lined-up and '' face '' you . you alway see the food display in those poster in a way that you have never seen it on your tabl . the reason food is more attract on the poster is that the server , would not have time to re-arrang everi french fri in order befor you eat it . and of cours , there is no way that a fast food brand display it 's fri just like it is in real life , becaus nobodi would order it . some might say that if the product is realli good , there is no need to make it seem better than it actual is . and again , thi is usual wrong . let 's take for exampl a big brand . whatev product they manufactur , they will probabl be anoth compani out there that is sell the same product ( usual a littl bit differ ) . in order for the first compani to sell it product more that the competitor , the compani need to invest on a advertis . and the main goal of the advert is to show that the product is better than ani other one that look the same or have the same function . so basicli the advert ha to show that the product is better than the other , so probabl also better than it in fact realli is . and final , is a product is realli good , there is probabl nood need to make an advert in the first place as it will be a self sell product .
