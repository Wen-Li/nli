i am a young person and i am work for free in the cathol commun of my hometown . so i have a good idea of what young peopl do to help in their commun . becaus of thi , i am convinc that the statement is wrong . i know mani young peolp which are help in the cathol commun . there are mani holiday camp for children which are organ by young peopl in our commun . there is also a monthli meet of thi peopl . new game or special festiv are organ by thi group of young peolp . mani peolp do not recogn thi work . it is not so obvious like bee a trainer of a children soccer team . but not all young peopl are work in a commun like me . i believ thi is becaus work in commun is first of all not veri honor . mani peopl do not even care about the commun work . communtiy work will be notic the first time by them , if nobodi doe it anymor . second , commun work is not veri attract to young peopl . the most peopl , work for free in the commun , are veri old . but it is not much fun for ani teenag to work with senior . if their friend spend time help the commun , most of the young peopl will have a great plessur to help their commun - togeht with their friend . and it is also a problem that most of commun work is not for the youth . young peolp do not see the neccessar to help their commun , becaus the commun work doe not take effect in their allday life . overal , i am convinc that young peopl nowaday give enough time to help their commun . furthermor , i believ that they do more at thi time then in the past .
