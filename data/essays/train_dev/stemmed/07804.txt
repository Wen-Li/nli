in my opinion success peopl tri new thing and take risk also . in the whole world everi one want to tri new thing and some peopl onli take risk . so in that risk some one will succec and some one will not succec . some peopl will tri for new thing . in that case the peopl who had alreadi done research in that one some peopl take that one and also studi in that also . whi mean they want to tri for the new thing . some peopl have the idea to tri some thing and they will do also but they do n't know how to keep that in a well manner . in our world mani scientist discov mani thing . for exampl `` charl babbag '' invent comput . so thi comput is play an import role in everi human life . so the whole world is use thi comput . mani scient invent mani thing like light , print machin and etc . . , . so the scientist are the success peopl . whi becaus they had tri for new thing . so in my opinion everi one ha to tri for new thing . so that we can gain more knowledg . but everi one ca n't efford for the new thing . whi mean for new thing to discov lot of money must be need . so all will not have so much money . for thi reason the student or who ever want to tri for new thing can come forward and they should ask the govern to provid some thing . the govern should come forward and they must encourag the student . so if they tri for good thing the countri will get a good reput . final those who are talent they must come forward and they have to use the resourc what they had . so that he wil be in a good posit . i agre with thi statement . success peopl must tri for new thing and they must also take risk . in thse day with out risk noth can be done .
