i am agre with the idea that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in my opinion , if the advertis make product more better is in order to encourag peopl to buy them . in fact , if the televis or the radio make mani advertis about one product , the consum will be more attract and spend more money . it is a good way to sell a product becaus the most import thing consist to attray peopl . if the product is veri sad or ugli , it is clear that poepl do n't buy it . for exampl when we saw advertis on televis about fast food , in particular mac donald , the burger seem perfect , i mean that he is bigger than the restaur 's one and seem to have more ingredi but when we go to the restaur , we have anoth vision , we have the impress that what we saw at the televis is realli differ than what we have in our plate . thi exampl show us that if we did n't see the burger on televis , we ha n't gone at the mc'donald . the role of the advertiss is to bring us anoth way to imagin the product and to push us to buy and to spend money . all in today 's world is commerci , to spend money is the new way of life and we can see that nowaday that we buy everyth even if we do n't need it . buy give us satisfact and we could'nt live in thi world without sell . that 's the reason whi the media take the opprtun to show us product which seem much better than realiti . even if we realis that what we are buy is not the same with what the televis show us we will continu to do it becaus it is necessari . to conclud , everybodi do n't care if the product show by the advertis do n't seem like what they realli are becaus the need is to buy .
