in my opinion , nowaday it 's veri import to studi and to know a specif subject . becaus today we live in a compet world , to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject mean to spent a lot of time to studi , in meantim a student who sutdi onli a specif subject spent onli some year at univers and in futur , after degre , he ha the opportun to work and to continu hi studi in hi specif area . thi mean to have a hig prepar on a specif subject . for exampl in architectur area or in medicin area it 's necessari to studi a lot of time to becom a good doctor or a architect . so if we imagin to creat a sutd patway that touch medicin and architectur in the same time , i think that it 's imposs to have the same qualiti , about knowledg , of a specif stude adress . it 's iport to put in evid the financi aspect of thi model . to studi correctli need a lot of money , in particular with scientif mattr , and to suggest a multiacadem prepar it 's realli expans for the state , and in particular for the student . so today we live in realli competit world , everi year there are new technic innov , and it 's import to now a correct use of them . i think with a correct and specif academ prepar it 'll be .
