mani peopl think it is better to have borad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . in my opinion , i think it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . there ha tow reason that i choos thi one . one reanson that is broad knwoledg is veri import for us , if we want go abroad . we should have a lot of broad knowledg to gain our person knowledg . we alway stay in china , we have not know a lot of other countri histori , and thi knowledg are still veri import to us . if we have broad knowledg of mani academ subject we can solv mani problem , and we can aslo help other . in anoth hand , broad knowledg of mani academ subject is more interest than ani other knowledg . in china , mani student have no chanc to learn some other countri knowledg . than alway listen to the teacher and take note without ani person idea , thi problem ha becom harder and harder . the reanson whi i donot choos to have special in one specif subject is that i have one exper . when i wa 11 year older , i 'm interest in comput scienc , and i do a lot of time on it . althought i have known mani knowledg on it , i get bad score on other class . a student who have broad knowledg of mani academ subject can easili take part in a new student envrion , but a student who have special in one specif subject just can do one thing that he or she can do . accord to thi abov , i think a student had better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject .
