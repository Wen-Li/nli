i agre with thi statement . i also think , that understand idea and concept is more import for student than it is to learn just fact . i can say that especi in connect to my own major mathemat and econom . for the futur life it is veri import , that you understood idea and concept at school and univers . my first major mathemat is probabl the best exampl for thi statement . just by listen to the professor and read book you will learn noth about mathemat . my professor alway say that we have to work on exercis ourselv becaus the most import thing is to understand the concept behind the think we learn . without understand the concept , we wount be abl to understand the further lectur . so it is veri import , even for for littl kid and school . if they do n't understand the idea in the first class , they will never understand them . anoth good exampl is my second major , econom . in the univers we just look on easi topic . the goal is not to know how to work with these topic , but to understand the idea behind it to use these idea to solv more complex thing in the futur life at a big compani for exampl . that is where i come to my third veri import point , whi understand idea and concept is more import than to learn fact . in the futur life , especi at work , you will probabl never be ask again about special fact , that you learnd at the univers . if you are , it will be easi for you , to go on the internet and find out these fact . today the internet is so complex , that everyon will find almost everi inform he want to get . there is no need to know histor date or someth like thi as long as you have the abil to use a comput . so i think , these are veri clear point . in my opinion , school and univers should even more focu on teach the student the idea and concept behind a topic and not make them learn fact .
