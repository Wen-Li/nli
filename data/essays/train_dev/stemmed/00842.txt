i veri strongli disagre with the claim that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . such a posit reli on a few logic argument , but also on the result of a person experi , both of which i shall now tri to highlight : first of all , ani effect decis come from a group ha to be the result of a veri long , slow and fastidi process of argument . also the decis , onc made , are known to level the number of excit thing to do , museum to visit , to a strict minimum . even if the presenc of a guid would undoubtebl temper the problem of an effect decis as the result of a collect process , it would onli do so by rais anoth kind of problem , quit more preoccupi realli : tour guid are not alway reliabl , and actual often turn out to be quit decept if not fulli mendaci . true , to the extent that it allow the travel not to worri about ani plan or ani decis to make , to reli on a tour guid can be an agreabl way to enjoy a holiday . also to travel in a group can provid a sens of psycholog comfort , by know that one will never be on her or hi own . in the end , it seem that the person of the travel play a huge part in the answer to that claim . in my opinion , the best way to travel is unquestion on one 's own . no tour guid , no group , just a backpack and a citi map . as paradox as it may sound , i have alway experienc it to be the best way never to be alon .
