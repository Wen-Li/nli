for an estud , it 's import to learn fact and also to undestand idea and concept . but , i totali agre with the statement that is more import to student to understand the concept , than is for the to learn the fact . i think thi way , mainli becaus by underst the concept and idea , you are realli get the basi of knowleg ( you can go to the deep of it ) . it 's the onli way to go to the bottom on the issu . if you just learn a memor the fact ( and leav the undestand of concept behind ) , you wo n't be abl to innov . i think fact are the start point . by revis and question those fact and work base on them , know their caus and effect is the key . the onli way to do thi , is by the underst of the idea and concept that lead to those fact . in other word , if you just learn the fact and do n't know where the came from , you wo n't be a complet all-arround student , just memor machin . the great human mind over the cours of histori , have been well known for understand the idea they work on . albert einstein onc said : `` you reali do n't know someth , until you 're abl to explain it to your grandmoth ... '' , mean that the onli way teach someth in a way anyon can follow , is put it in simpl form . the way to achiv thi , is by domin the concept and idea well ( know where they come from , so you can put it in differ word ) . tri to pictur einstin explan to hi grandmoth one of hi teori , just give her the fact . .. in resum , undestand the idea and concept ( what they realli mean , where they come from , ect . ) is by far more import tha just learn the fact . fact are import , but no
