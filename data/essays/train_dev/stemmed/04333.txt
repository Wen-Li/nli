i agre that it is veri essenti for student to understand idea and concept . there is a say that if you give a man a fish to eat he will eat onli for one day , but if you teach him how to fish he will have food to eat for the rest of hi life . the same principl appli here : if a student mere memoris or learn the fact without understand the reason behind it he will have to keep go back and review over and over again to rememb the materi , but if he understand the reason behind it , he will never forget it . let me explain my reason use an exampl from physiolog . in physiolog we learn that the sodium potassium pump is veri essenti for the function of the bodi . the sodium is present outsid the cell and the potassium is insid the cell . exchang of these ion occur with the help of the sodium - potassium atpas pump . sodium can come in and out of the cell through the voltag gate channel but potassium doe not need these channel . it ha ungat channel . it leak out of the cell constantli . if thi pump is disrupt due to injuri , sodium get trap insid of the cell and thi caus the swell of the cell . thi is what we see when a person is injur , or when they have a heart attack or when they have a stroke . if the student doe n't understand the simpl mechan of thi pump , he will keep learn about swell in differ area of the bodi without be abl to link it to one small process and keep learn the same thing over and over again without make a connect and wast hi valuabl time . therefor , i believ that everi student should first be abl to understand the concept befor they proceed to studi someth new . most of the new stuff we learn is an old idea in a new packag with a differ fanci name .
