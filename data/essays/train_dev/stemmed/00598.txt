iam of the opinion that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i would like to cite my respons on the student who have to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn . i would like to explain sever exampl and reason to the issu . the student must understand the concept and idea . for exampl , if we have a mathemat subject in our graduat cours , it is veri difficult to solv the problem if we are unabl to understand the idea and concept . so we would like to work hard on understand the idea and concept even though we are unabl to understand . for better reason we can consid the more exampl in accord with the issu . in our daili life the idea and concept are more prefer when compar to learn fact . the more reason in support to the issu are , we will digest the concept which are happen in our regular life onc we ca n't digest those concept we have to face more difficulti . if we are do a busi then first of all we will learn the idea and also how to form idea in develop of that busi . these concept and idea will take a major role in sever applic . if we learn the concept more effect , we would done a great job in our applic such as in studi , busi and in our depart . in some case the learn of fact would be a achiev thing in our goal . here some exampl which support the learn fact , if we are abl to learn the fact effect then we can achiev some better result in the life .
