in my opinion , the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk is true . my believ is that success and new thing are close relat . i do think so becaus in my experi i alway consid someth as a person success if i wa abl to overcom old barrier and to reach target that seem unlik to be reach befor . i feel especi satisfi , if by reach new target i have to face risk . on the other hand if someth is well known to me , i do not feel great satisfact in achiev it . so for me it is part of person success to tri in new thing and overcom risk . also in a materi way i think that it is true that success goe along with tri new thing and take risk . there are mani exampl of great person who are regared success becaus they were the first to do certain thing . for exampl lanc armstrong who wa the first man on the moon is definetli consid to be a success man . anoth exampl would be a business-man who manag to built up a compani that provid uniqu and new product or servic . if hi compani offer useful stuff and is the first to do so , the chanc of be success are quit high . of cours , there is also anoth side of success . if someon ha certain target that are not necessarili new or ground-break , you can also be success by reach these target . you could for exampl tri to play soccer as good as some famou soccer player . if you manag to do so , you might be a success person without achiev a new thing . but in my opinion it is more like to becom sucess by do someth new rather than just to do like other did befor . in conclus , even though it is not a necessar to tri new thing in order to becom success , i do believ that by do so you will have a greater chanc to becom success in the way you feel about yourself and in the way other peopl see you .
