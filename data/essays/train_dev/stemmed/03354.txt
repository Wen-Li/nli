i agre that most adertis do make product seem much better than they realli are . in my opinion , the purpos of advertis have alreadi decid their natur - to attract more custom , no matter how to get it done . busi want their advertis to make a good impress to peopl , and to lead peopl to believ that their product are better than other . i have found numer way that busi use to achiev thi purpos . some advertis intent give you the `` good point '' of a product while hide the actual , sometim more import , limit or disadvantag of the product . for exampl , some credit card compani claim in it advertis that it credit card servic ha 0 % apr ( annual payment to the servic ) . howev , when custom subscrib to the servic excitedli , they find that there are actual other fee with differ name associ to the servic , which are not mention at all in the advertis . in thi way , the compani success lead peopl to believ that their servic is cheaper than other , while in fact it might be more expens . anoth way to trick the peopl watch advertis is to make invalid or incomplet comparison with other compani ' product . for exampl , some comput retail compar hi comput with the comput be sold by anoth retail . howev , it onli compar the featur that hi comput are better at , while ignor other import featur that might limit the perform of them compar to the other product . howev , peopl who watch thi advertis often have no expert knowledg of what featur are import to comput , thu get trick to believ what the advertis say . sometim , advertis even use decept mean to attract custom . for exampl , a clothes-sel store give an advertis that it will give a sale on saturday . it then list sever price of certain cloth compar to their price a few day ago . howev , the store actual increas the origin price to make a bigger differ in the price , which deceiv custom . there 're mani more way that advertis exploit to make their product better than they realli are . in fact , most advertis do .
