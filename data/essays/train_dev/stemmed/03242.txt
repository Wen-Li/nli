the question whether to have a broad knowledg of mani acedem subject or to specialis in one specif subject is a veri arguabl and can lead to mani a heat discuss . in my opinion , it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than to just have expertic in one . accord to me , the practic valu of a person increas when he know about variou other subject apart from hi major . thi make him a lot more versatil and flexibl . he can take care of a lot of thing without extern assist and thu can prove to be an asset . moreov , in today world , one ha to be awar of a lot of thing to make himself as well hi famili prosper . for exampl , a doctor by profess ha to have a basic knowledg of electr and safe measur of electr applianc to safe oper the applianc . if he doe not pay enough attent to thi , and onli be expert at hi profess then he may unintent caus an accid . also for exampl , a charter account need to know the basic of first aid in order to administ the same when the need aris . in the same way a contruct worker need to know the basic of taxat where he can save a dollar more . henc for a comfort live in today world , one need to have a practic knowledg of a varieti of subject . see in the practic aspect , thi opinion is reflect in the corpor world also . we dont have a lot of expert of scientif or civil field . the reason for thi is the amount of extra effort that they have to put in to becom an expert . to further explain thi , the time when a student start learn the content of a subject , i believ , he is not matur enough to decid whether thi is what he actual want to expertis in . he is unawar of the other subject and possibl that lay ahead in them . for make a sound decis , one ha to spend some time in know the subject and then decid . in we take thi approach practic then , by the time a student get aquaint to all the subject hi learn time ha laps biolog and he thu becom jack of all but master of none . but there are a few exept one who do pursu specialis educ and becom specialist in their field . henc i feel that , the choic should afteral be of the student to decid between master or jack . but given a choic , i would prefer to be a jack rather than a master .
