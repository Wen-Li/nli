some peopl say `` broad knowledg of academ subject are essenti . '' howev , i do n't think it 's true . the purpos of attend school is basic for becom a profession in one field . broad knowledg about other field is not necessari to becom an expert . normal , we learn subject of variou kind in elementari school , junior high school , and high school . howev , most of subject which we learn there are not practic knowledg to live . for exampl , i studi biolog and geolog for more than 4 year in my junior high school and high school but i have never use thi kind of knowledg to solv problem i encounterd . i am sure that it wa wast of time becaus they are useless . i major in music composit in my colleg for 6 year . i receiv ba and ma from the colleg . howev , i am still studi music composit in an anoth institut becaus i thought what i studi in my colleg wa onli a small part of entir subject . i am sure that it take a lot of time to becom a real profession in one field so i think all student must concentr on just one field to becom a real expert sinc we do not have so much time . if you learn sever subject , especi in colleg or univers , it normal cost more . if you major in two subject , for exampl , fine art and mathemat , you have to pay normal more tuition than student who major onli one subject . in addit , you have to buy more book and materi for sever subject . howev , you have less chanc to becom a real profession on both field becaus you spent less time compar to student who major in onli one subject . it doe not make ani senc . it 's just wast of money . broad knowledg is not essenti to becom an expert . knowledg in other field is normal useless . besid , it take time to real expert in one field so you do n't have time to learn other subject . moreov , it 's espens to studi more than one subject .
