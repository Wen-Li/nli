i agre with the statement in which it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . there is sever reason whi i think so . first , if you have broad knowleadg of mani kind of academ subject , you can commun with mani kind of peopl . in other word , you can talk with a person who are studi intern polit and econom and law if you have ani knowledg . in opposit side , if you have onli knowledg of law , you ca n't talk with a person learn about econom . second , by gain widespread knowledg , you can be interest in variou subject . i think that 's so nice . if you have interest in variou subject , then you will have more way you can choos in your life than a person who ha interest in onli one thing . final , we should get as much knowleadg as possibl while we are live . i think know is grow , so we can grow until die .
