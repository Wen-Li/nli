there are mani way to travel around the world , by group , individu , in a famili , with a tour guid , friend or even by yourself . first , travel in a group might be good if you know the peopl you are travel with . a tour guid might be good if you are to lazi to learn and adventur yourself . if you travel you have to be open mind to face new experinc . travel to anoth countri or a new place is not go to be excit unless it becom challeng and fun . the onli way to step on those emot is guid yourself , otherwis if you are gonna take a tour guid better stay home and buy a book of the place you desir to go , as well travel in a group is more a wast of time . secondli , a tour guid will onli show you what he thing is import , or whatev he believ that is interest from hi point of view . therefor , if you want to realli learn of the place you must do it by yourself and probabl with a partner to have a safe trip . in fact , as a tourist you migth miss some import detail of the place , but as well from everysingl place is visit you will be more like to be abl to depict to other becaus you had to figur out everyth by yourself . unforgett experi are those experinc where our mind wa work in it maximum . in addit , travel in a group is not the best idea becaus usual they travel in lower pace nad becaus of the quantiti of peopl togeth is not comfort to go to small place , where it is alreadi overcrowd . travel individu give you more flexibl in your schedul . time is gold and what you with in dure your travel is veri import . for exampl if you go to louvr in a group you might have to wait 8 hr . to get in . instead if you figur out that late night you onli have to wait 20 min. you are more like to go around pari and enjoy your day and then go to the louvr , other than stick to the group and wast your time . in conclus , travel alon is more fun and use than in a group with a tour guid . life is about learn and take adventur . you want to live , so travel and have fun , but if you do n't better buy a book and stay home or wast your time travel in a group with a useless tour guid .
