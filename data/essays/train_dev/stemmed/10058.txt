i agre with the statement becaus to me undeerstand is the most import factor in lear for univeris . the first reason is that if you understand an idea it is easier to rememb it and the idea stay in mind longer than than a learn fact . secondli i find it import to be abl to appli the learn knowledg to other situat and studi area . one should be abl to adopt the learn featur and work with them . understand is veri import for idea you have to rememb not onli for a specif examin but for a long time . they stay in mind becaus you can imagin how the idea work . although you can be sucess in an exam just by lear the fact you will not be abl to rememb them later . the most import reason whi i prefer understand is that fact which are understood can be adopt to your work . for exampl an engin who know how to build an engin but doe not understand how it work will never be abl to invent new featur to the engin , but someon who undestand the pricipl of an engin will be abl to improv it . thi can be easili transfer to ani other subject . so a psycholigist ha to understand the theori of disord , e.g. a depress , in order to help hi patient . if he doe not understand it he can onli tell the patient more detail on hi disord but can not transfer the inform to the individu . so thi doctor is no real use to the patient becaus the patient can easili find these inform in book . if you understand a certain techniqu it is easi even to transfer it to complet differ studi field . it can help you to learn and understand even topic which are not relat . the given reason are onli a few reason whi understandind is the more effect learn method . besid there are mani other advantag of understand idea . so for exampl learn can be a lot more interest when you understand the idea . it can be motiv and learn can be more fun .
