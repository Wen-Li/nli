thi is gener accept that young peopl enjoy more life than older , but is it realli right ? when you are young , you are usual not consciou of all the danger of the life : for exampl a lot of young peopl go out , smoke and drink a lot becaus even if they know it is bad for them , they can not realli realis it . thi is in opposit with what do the older peopl think becaus they are more awar of the ill like cancer and they do not want to be ill becaus they have to work in order to bring money for their children 's educ for exampl . the second point is that adult can not oftenli go out becaus of their children : they have to take care of them while young peopl can go out everi night to the theatr or the restaur or disco etc . on the other hand , the fact that adult earn more money than young peopl is a big point : the more you have money to spend , the more you can buy everyth you need to enjoy . the entertain industri is quit expens , special when you enjoy do thing out of the common place . becaus peopl are leav longer and longer and in better shape than fifti year ago , retir peopl enjoy travel oversea in order to discov the more , and to make the most of the short time left to live . thi last part of my text show what i think : it is easier to enjoy your life if you have enough money in order to buy you all the thing you will enjoy and also becaus when you are older , you have built the life you want , while when you are young you do not alway have the choic of everyth and you need to obey to your parent .
