i complet agre with the statement . i realli think that someth ha to chang . i mean , there are a lot of car on the street everi day and peopl is alway buy new car . somethimg ha to chang otherwis there will not be enought space for peopl ! have car ha it problem . pollut fir of all . all the citi ha to fight against the smog and the gase that damag the enviro . they are tri to encourag citizen not to use their car . and what about the petrol ? the petrol nowaday is quit expens and the resous are not endless . talk about drive a car , we can understand easili that too mani vehicl make long queue and a lot of traffic on the street . thi mean a consider wast of time . car also need place to be park , thu a lot of space is reqiur . that is whi i think that someth ha to chang , and that in the futur peopl will prefer to use public transport in order to avoid all these proplem . but i also think that peopl are becom more and more awar of all the servic that the internet can offer . i mean that a lot a person now prefer to work at home use the comput and commun by e mail rather than drive to the offic . and thi way of work is becom alway more common . the possibl of buy good on internet ha the same effect . peopl can do shop stay at home . they do not have to go out , stay in line , drive to the shop or to the market . those are all the reason that make me beliv that in the next centuri we will have less car than today . i can not stand the traffic anymor . i hope i will get a job that allow me to stay at home . i will buy food on the internet and i will move from a place to anoth by buse , that in my town are veri numer . i do not need a car ! and i think that lot of peopl will follow my exampl , also becaus is a good way to safe money and time .
