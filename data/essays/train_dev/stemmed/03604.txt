today , mani older peopl tend to travel all around the world , live in abroad , enjoy their hobbi , go to older peopl 's school for talk and play with same age peopl after retir their job . thu , i disagre with thi statement `` youn peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . '' mani travel compani tend to make travel plan and long-stay in abroad plan for onli older peopl these day . for exampl , my parent are think of travel all around the world and live in abroad to relax and enjoy their rest of life after retir their job . my univers teacher ha been talk same kind of thing . in addit , i know some older peopl who live in abroad . i agre with their think becaus they have work veri hard and have not seen the whole world . older peopl can have a lot of free time to enjoy their hobbi . they do not need to care about time . think about young peopl , they also have free time when they are student . dure go to school , they can travel , studi about their interest , stick to their hobbi . howev , after graduat school , they need to work and they have much less free time . thu , i think older peopl enjoy life same as young peopl do . or might enjoy more than young peopl becuas they do not need to anyth . in my opinion , i would like to enjoy retir life , but i would like to enjoy more when i am young . thi is becaus to get a job which i want to do , and to get a happi life , i need to see the world by own my eye . travel around the world is veri fun to me , and thi would also benefit my futur . by the way , i realli hope that my parent would have veri enjoy life after retir .
