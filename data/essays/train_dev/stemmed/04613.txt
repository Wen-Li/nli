i think the best way to travel is go the place without a tour guid . travel with tour guid is look good , but i can not think so . there are three reason whi i think so . the first reason is about the travel time . if i travel with a group with a tour guid , i can not go anywher i want to go . becaus the travel cours is decid by the guid . it is not fun . the second reason is about a time . in a travel with a group with tour guid is need to go somewher on the time . if i get a free time at the tour , i had a lot of plan where i go but the time is limit , so i can not go to all place where i want . and if i go to myself , i do not have to think about the time becaus there is no person who ha to wait for me . so i think i can enjoy my travel . the final reason is about money . i am a univers student , so i do not have a lot of money . if i travel with a group led by a tour guid , i have to pay the money for the guid . it need more money than i travel by myself . and the guid exist to inform about the place or some good point of the place , so if i learn about them befor i travel , i do not need the guid . these three reason are veri import for me . and these avoid me to do someth what i want to do . so , i do not think that to travel with a group led by the tour guid is the best way to travel .
