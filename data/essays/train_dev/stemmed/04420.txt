though discuss for long , the question that wether to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or to special in one specif subject is better doe n't have a peac end . for my opinion , i prefer to have a knowledg structur with more broadth rather the more specif . there are three advantag of a broad knowledg make me feel like it : firstli , broad knowledg mean tend to support more comun between peopl which mean more understand . you 'll get more charact in common with other when you share some knowledg with other , so you 'll probabl get to know what the like and dislik for other peopl , for exampl , my father can understand me quit well for he know all that what i have known ; secondli , thi will make you more success in social activ . as you understand other more and give them what they want , get rid of what they do n't want , you 'll build a good relationship with ani other and gain their help when you need . as for exampl , mani polit leader and busi champion are thi kind , such as bush and bill gate . last but mayb the most import point , you 'll find the knowledg of each specfic domain are connect to each other . in fact , under some situat , the connect is even more import in each of the individu one . take comput lingust for exampl , befor 1980 , lingust is not consid to be a popular research area , but after the induct of comput , more and more organ and peopl devot themselv in it , even govment cast an interest on it , and it is a hot research domain now , both for domain of lingust and domain of comput scienc . sinc all of abov , i prefer to have a knowledg structur with more broadth rather the more specif .
