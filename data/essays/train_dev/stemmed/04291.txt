if the `` success '' mean econom or scientif success ( big money or new deverop ) , i agre with the statement . recent , the peopl 's life becom more convini becaus of the develop of industri , and more homogeniu in the mean of infom becaus of the progress of commun technolog like internet . so rel comfort life can be achiev by the routin task , or work . it mean new chalang are not necessori for common life , so mani peopl seem not to like tri new matter . the chalang is more impot now ! in the field of scienc , new result onli deriv from new chalang or idea . alreadi known work onli make alreadi known result . in the econom sens , also new chalang sometim make big success . but econom chalang alway bring some risk and easili becom gambl , so we should manag our total risk . but l think it is also import to keep the tradit matter , theori and caltur . they can be the basi of new one . and we can avoid some failur and accid from previou one . so in the mean of `` import '' , or `` import peopl '' , i can not choos one from these two .
