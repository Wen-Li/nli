as a colleg student studi in taiwan , base on what i do in the past year and my observ on my friend , i agre with that young peopl nowaday actual do not give enough time to help their commun . i know i am kind of reluct to admit the truth , yet i think the follow reason could explain whi we are not abl to do so . in the first place , we are actual too busi in our school life . as you know , peopl at thi age are expect by elder or even by themselv to be as competit as we could be . thi mean we have to spend most of our time on take lectur in differ field , learn preciou experi from deal with club affair , and some of us even alreadi have internship in compani . in the rest of our time , there are a lot of read materi and project wait to be treat . and as a human be , we need time to play as well as to take a rest . it is too hard for the young peopl to put their attent on the need of their commun if they are alreadi bear so mani requir . the other reason is that the concept of help each other in a commun ha not yet form in my cultur . i mean , it is not part of our life . we are told sinc young to take care of yourself first then consid to give the rest to other . so if a new idea is introduc to my countri -- like encourag youngster to do someth for the place they dwell in -- it must first serv as a requir in school . my colleg implement a new polici last year that everi student should earn at least 36 servic hour befor they can graduat . yet the servic on school campu is also count in the requir hour . the result is that , most of the student still do not learn the spirit of devot to their commun . i know the fact is quit daunt to those who wish the new gener to do more to where it live in ; howev , the reason abov which stop us from that also discourag me . i hope thing would get better
