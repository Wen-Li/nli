in the last coupl of decad , - uninvit - the field of advertis ha expand vastli into the everyday life human be . no matter where peopl are ; at their home , on the street or in a movi theater an advertis will be wait for them to promot a commod , no matter how good or bad it is in realiti . given that the power of advertis is obviou in our age there appear to be no reason whi it would not be abl to sell product which do not deserv to be bought , given their qualiti and price . thu the advertis often do make product sold by make them seem better than they are . the first way of make a product look good is the use of clean imag and role model , introduc the product as a saver of the individu . for instanc in wax commerci the product seem to remov all the hair from the bodi never to return . the viewer see the imag of a top model who probabl never had much bodi hair at all , look at her eye and tell her that she could be smooth like her if sheus the product . imit someon we like or trust is an old habit of human be , thu the custom buy the wax and in a few month she realiz that the wax actual feed the root of the hair and just a few week follow the epil she will have even stronger bodi hair , harder to remov . the second way that advertis make bad commod sold is repetit , so as to say the frequenc of commerci . whenev a new product is introduc to the public the advertis are shown dozen of time in such short time to brainwash the viewer and final make them think whi they rememb thi product so well . in time they begin to believ that they rememb it probabl becaus it is a good and they feel the urg to tri it at least onc . that is how they go to the mall and grab the advertis product . a veri good exampl of thi can be observ in turkey where the singer ajdar ha sold hundr of thousand of hi album just becaus hi rather funni song were repeat in almost everi 2 hour on tv , while the turkish popstar tarkan suffer from a conflict that exist between him and hi advertis agenc and bare sold fifti thousand with hi flash album . advertis are everywher wheter for the bad or for the wors . they have alreadi sneak into the mind of the consum with the support of a long histori of visual commun skill and trick . therefor it seem like anyth that is bought for ani price may not be the best choic .
