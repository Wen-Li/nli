car have been the mean of transport around the world for centuri . it is no doubt that the car is a major part of mani peopl live . so will there be fewer car in use twenti year from now ? well , i think that the car will veri much be present twenti year from now and probabl with more user then ever , with a few chang to the car 's function and design of cours . i think that the car will chang greatli over a twenti year period . result in a burst of popularl with mani individu around the world . i think that mani of the function of the car will be chang as well . i think that the car , twenti year from now will use electr fuel not gasolin . i think thi becaus there are mani problem aris around the world regard the price of gasolin . not onli is the price of gasolin expens but it is also destroy the atmospher , result in global warm . i feel that the car industri will thu , shift it vision on car from gasolin to highli product , well-mad electr car . these electr car will not onli run on small amount of electr , but it will also have no exhaust pollut , creat a better and cleaner environ . it is becaus that i think these chang will occur that i say that the number of car will not diminish in the futur . i feel that with the environment friendli benefit and with the attach that societi alreadi ha on car will make peopl keep ride car . i also think that there will not be fewer car in twenti year becaus i think that mani peopl in mani sociti are veri attach to the car . it is not a mere transport vehicl , but it is a part of tradit to drive a car in mani countri . for exampl , it is a tradit to get your driver licens when you turn the age of 16 in america . also it is a sign of wealth in mani countri to own a car in mani countri , such as china . therefor , i feel that there will not be a declin in the use of car becaus ; by lose the car you will lose mani tradit , and tradit are a part of cultur . so it is hard for me to think that the human race would diminish an entir part of cultur from there live within a short period of twenti year . the attach to car by the human societi and the possibl to alter car to better suit the need of the environ and the peopl , make me conclud that the usag of car will not declin in twenti year .
