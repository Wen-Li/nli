i do agre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . thi is becaus by think about myself and friend around me , i can not find mani young peopl , who are interact to the commun a lot . i believ thi cultur chang is happen worldwid and consid it is usual these day . when my grandpar are young , they said they rememb that their parent were interact with the commun deepli and felt normanl that they had to live in that way . at the time when my grandpar are littl , the wordl war ii wa happen therefor , strong bond in the commun wa need more than nowaday . young teenag were there to look after the littl children and help the old peopl . that wa someth they all had to do in order to surviv . howev , as the war end and my parent 's gener wa born , there wa not so much situat need for peopl to stick togeth becaus that wa the onli way to surviv . my parent 's said that they rememb that their parent 's tell them to care about commun and help them sinc that is how their parent 's grew up but my parent 's said that they never realli understood whi . i also do not rememb my parent teach me to interact with commun and spend time for it . thi can be becaus in my 17 year of life , i move more than 10 time becaus of my father 's job and everi time i move to new commun , it wa hard for our famili to join easili . so we were kind of give up on thi kind of cultur . even if the person never move around so much , i believ not mani peopl like to interact with commun becaus peopl becam colder about the connect with differ peopl . in western and some part of eastern countri , the cultur chang in religion wa also signific to thi chang . in old day , religion wa strict and if you are christian , you had to attend to mass everi sunday . howev , nowaday , attend to mass is quit free and not mani peopl critisis you if you do not attend to the mass . howev , it doe not mean that spend time for commun is wast becaus peopl are act in thi way . human be can not live without interact each other and it is veri impor to be a well be and help each other without benefit . it is veri sad that nowaday young peopl are not spend enough time for commun and for our futur , we should connect with peopl more and creat comfort commun .
