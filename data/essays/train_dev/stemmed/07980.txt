as a first comment , i woul say that there are two way of be success after have taken risk . the first one is when you are still aliv after action and more wealthi than befor , the second one when you kill yourself while take a huge risk endang a famili or a whole commun . but thi is more philosophi than real explan . .. what is success . .. generali speak , thi is true that peopl who take risk are more success than other . thi is right for mani reason . first , they challeng their own mind , or what they have learn just becaus they dont feel confort with regular rule . in fact they can not live with what ha been given to them , they have to re-inv the wheel or tri someth els like bill gate did in hi garag . becaus they feel free in their head , they find new solut and new idea that save money or facilit onc life with product or idea that everi one will buy or follow . veri often they invest they own money or borrow a big amout of money . but money doesn t make all the differ . thi is becaus they have taken thi risk with a huge faith in their project that they are success . they never stop even if they fail onc . in other case they put their own life in danger and one of the best exampl could be what the appolo 13 team ha achiev . the fact of onli do thing that are veri wee known and establish is alway lead to the end of an era or a civilis and everybodi know thi and thi is whi the popul recogn easili their hero that are take risk . we are use to say they take risk but in fact in mani case they have noth to loos or they dont even see the risk they are take just becaus thi is simpli their own way of live .
