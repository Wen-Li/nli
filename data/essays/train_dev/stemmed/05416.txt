i would like to believ thi statement will come true , but i think it will be veri difficult . first of all , the degre of car increas doe not seem to stop and mainli in that countri that are grow up econom in thi period like china , india and brasil . so i believ it will be imposs stop thi rais for the next year . anoth point is that the nowaday cultur is not readi for chang it habit . the most citi in the world are plenti of car becaus the govern do not support altern transport , like for exampl public transport . i think if the tram , subway , train , ect . would be more effici than now , peopl would choos to catch the underground instead pick up the car and stay stop in the traffic jam . for instanc , the problem in my citi is that the onli way to move are the car or the tram . besid , thi public transport is not modern at all , veri dirti and in add you can not reli on it . so it is obviou that peopl prefer drive their car . i know that some new citi for exampl in china are develop with a powerful net of public transport to encourag to not take the car , but we need to consid that in the most old citi is veri difficult improv new form of transport becaus it is not so easi to integr them with the environ . accord to thi opinion , rome doe not have the subway becaus dig they found out anchient piec that are consid veri valuabl so they can not go on . sometim in other citi subway or train are veri expens and so thi do not encourag anybodi to move by public transport . of cours , later on , thing have to chang . one of the most actual troubl in thi period is pollut becaus of the car smog . so it will be a must tri to decreas the number of car and find altern transport way .
