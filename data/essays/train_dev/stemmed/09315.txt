there are some fluctuat in usag of some item while the time pass and the technolgi improv . some peopl think in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , but i do not think so . there are some item which their usag is decras day by day becaus of the improv technolog . they replac by their improv one , like walkman . in the past , we listen music by walkman veri often but nowaday we prefer mp3 player that are more easi to use and have high music storag capac . like walkman , car are improv everi day but they are not replac by anoth trasport vechil . peopl still need car for trasport , but ofcours with newer modal are preferd . in turkey in 1970 , everi famili ha maximum onli one car . becaus there are veri small product of car in turkey and it is veri expens to buy a car . in gener peopl ha not enough power to purchuas a car . moreov have a car is not veri nesscesri for everi one becaus citi were not as big as today . throughout the pass year , our countri becom to have better financi power and product quantiti of car increas while their price are decreas . so now nearli all familli ha a car and some of them ha more than one . the reason for have h'gher amount of car is not onli the low prive , in today world everi individu need to own a car for fast and easi trasport . we are in the technolog age in which time is money . in conclus , ofcours there are some item which loos their import and thir usag decreas when the time pass . i think not onli car will keep their import , but also their uasg will increas in twenti year .
