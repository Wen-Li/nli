i agre with that `` it is better to have borad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject. '' becaus if i have a lot of broad knowledg i can use everywher in the test or exam . i agre with that becaus if they have broad knowledg of mani academ subject they can understand that what is go on here and what is go to happen here now . they will not lose becaus it is good to have broad knowledg it is like gener knowldg even i can use in the test or in exam if they ask to me that about world or anyth that about gener knowledg or broad knowledg of mani academ . i think if they do not have broad knowledg or gener knowledgeof mani academ , they will be stupid becaus if they do not know about anyth , tyey can not do anyth for exampl in japan , if they want to go to that unverc they have to write exam and if they pass that exam they can go that univerc but for that exam is realli hard becaus that univerc 's exam will ask to them about for exampl what is happen in usa 's gavern and ect so which mean is that if they do not have ani of gener knowledg or broad knowledg of mani academ they will not pass forev . if they want to have gener knowledg or broad knowledg of mani academ , they do not have to studi to know thi , they have to do is that just read the newspap or watch the news everyday than they will have gener knowledg or broad knowledg of mani mani academ but they must continu they must not stop it otherwis they will not get ani of them . so as you can see that if they have gener knowledg or broad knowledg if mani academ subject it is good to have tham and it is not wast time . so if they want to get tham just read the newspap and watch the news everi singl day not like onc a week than they will get a lot of thing in thier head and stick on their head so they never ever forget them .
