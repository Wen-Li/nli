thi question be ask to me just a coupl of year ago , i would have agre complet . but in the last year i 've had the chanc to experi sever situat that lead me to believ that thi tendenc is chang . to me , it look like that the world as a kind of natur secur alarm , and when , over the last decad , the selfishness-altru balanc wa start to be overload on the selfish part , an altruist essenc ha start to spread over western societi . of cours i 'm sure not all the societi ha been affect by thi phenomenon , but i could outlin a coupl of exampl to make my idea more clear . first of all , i 've got to get in contact with the wide realiti of voluntari work . i start with an internship with an italian non government organ of intern volunt , and i 've been posit surpries to see how mani young peopl want to get involv in the fight for a better world . a lot of student show their avail to work unpaid to make possibl a lot of event , like exibit , market , debat , etc. , to collect fund and to commun the messag of the valu of human develop . to look more closli , in itali it is possibl to work for a year as social servic volunt , and , i 'm alway surpries to see how mani young peopl are will to dedic one year of their live just to help disadvantag peopl and organ that work for the protect and the respet of everi human be . almost all of my friend collabor as volunt in at least one associ , and everyon of them affirm that hi voluntari work is one of the few thing that make sens and give satisfact in everyday life . to summar , i would said that just until few year ago it wa true that young peopl did n't mind that much about help their commun , but i do believ that thi tendenc is nowaday chang and young peopl are take a more respons direct .
