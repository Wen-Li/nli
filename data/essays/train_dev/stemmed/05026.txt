who enjoy life more , young peopl or older peopl ? in my opinion , i tend to say that older peopl enjoy life more . first of all , older peopl have much more leisur time than young peopl . as older peopl have alreadi work for a long time , they need not work so hard as young peopl . they need not struggl so hard for surviv as young peopl do . as a result , older peopl have more leisur than yound peopl . with more leisur time , older peopl can travel , can have holiday with their famili , and can do other activi . imagin what young peopl are do when older peopl are enjoy their life . student at universit may be busi with write their assig , cram for exam . those who have job may be do extra work in the offic . how miser they are ! secondli , older peopl have more money compar with young peopl , make them lead more comfort life . as older peopl have work longer time than young peopl , they earn more money and have more save , which can make them afford long distanc travel to pari , to rome , or even to space , depend their financi abil . howev , young peopl can onli enjoy the short trip and some hike . though no one can deni the interest that short trip and hike can bring , they can not be compar to those brought by the the romant travel abroad . thirdli , older peopl can manag their life better than those young peopl due to their longer live and social experi . older peopl know what is most import to them . they know that enjoy of life , instead of make money or work is more import to them . they know the valu of be togeth with their famili member , so they tri their best to accompani their wife or husband . on the contrari , accord to my knowledg , most young peopl do not realiz what is import to them . they make everi possibl effort to make money and grasp everi chanc to get promot in their work place , neglect the happi of be accompani and accompani their famili member . in conclus , i think that older peopl enjoy life more becaus they have more time , more money , and they can manag their life more efi .
