i do not agre with the statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl do '' . mani old peopl might enjoy life more than mani young peopl do , sinc they know more about life becaus of their age , or they know that they are close to end so they want to enjoy it as much as possibl befor it is gone . enjoy life is not relat to person 's age . it is more relat to individu 's person , or the life condit that individu ha , and the accid or luck that the life bring to an individu . i know mani young peopl who are deal with mani problem of life rather than enjoy it . financi problem , or career concern are the main topic that make young peopl too much stress about life . howev , when we look at the old peopl , it is not hard to see on their face the scarc of satisfact and awar . they were slow down , they end the competit with other peopl , and just tri to enjoy the life after accept it as what it is . therefor , it would be invalid when someon claim that young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl do . mainli , enjoy of life is mostli relat with person . in spite of mani difficulti and the rapid in their live , there are mani young peopl who enjoy life . mayb , those are the one who can balanc their enjoy and respons . while they are hold a lot of hard work , they also leav some time to have fun , deal with friend , famili and social activ . someon might have a posit motiv of life , which make him/her optimist about the fact , and lead him/her to enjoy the life . some other might have neg motiv that they onli see the neg aspect of the fact and can not be abl to enjoy life becaus of their motiv . some peopl might be too much concern with the onli `` responsibiliy '' or `` career '' part of the life that they do not allow themselv to relax , spend time with friend and experi the enjoy and easi part of the life . to sum up , enyoy life is not relat with the person 's age . it is more relat to person 's charact , the person 's percept of life . there are mani young peopl who do not enjoy the life becaus of their neg motiv of life or becaus of the other prioriti in their live . there are mani old peopl who enjoy life more than mani young peopl do becaus their old age give them the awar of life and the rapid of time . and those motiv them to enjoy as much as possibl when there is still time .
