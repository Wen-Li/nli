i think that succesful peopl alway tri new thing and take risk . as a matter of fact everybodi can do what he alreadi know . it is veri easi repeat someth mani time , it is like to copi ; but everi man is abl to copi . and how can someth that everybodi can do get you to be a succesful peopl ? i think the answer is that it ca n't . moreov noth can be done radic better whitout make a chang . without changement there could not be innov and improv . i think it is the same in the human condit : a person will alway remain in the same condit without tri new thing . that is not a characterist of sussesful peopl that , instead , alway tri to improv their condit . natur take risk is not a synonim of have succex . someon suc in improv hi condit , on the other hand anoth man fail . but to becom a succesful man it is necessari to tri . howev thi imprevedibili is anoth point in favour of my theori . if tri new thing would get automat to a succex condit , whi some man do not tri them ? the answer is simpl : there is the risk to fail . fail mean get you in a wors condit . and onli a few man can risk to becom in a wors condit . so onli few man becom succeful peopl . in conclus onli tri new thing can chang man condit . it could becom better or not . chang it in a better way mean improv your condit and improv your condit make you a succeful man .
