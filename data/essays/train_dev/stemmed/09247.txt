how the student can undestand the idea which are give to him ? a reserch ha aprov the phenomnen when they have done thi in some school they found that the student can understand the idea from the concept than learn idea . in my opinion i think learn from concept is better for mani reason such as , the student can explaint in hi way , it will be in hi momeri vey long time , and he can add more detail on it . the student when he undestand someth he can explain it by hi way . for exampl , if the student understood a theori or someth complec , he will simpli can tell hi classmat about it . also , he could answer ani qustion about it . in brief , when you undestand someth it 's better than learn fact . undestand an idea is agood method to memoris it in the futur . otherwis , he will get it when it necsseri for the sutat which he is in . furthermor , the student when he ha the idea of the issu , he can add more detail on it . he can inspir a new informatoin about the iossu and then he will have agood knowledg in hi life becaus of hi undertand of the idea . in conclus , i agre that the student is better for him to understand the idea than learn it becaus it happend for me alot and i recomandleu disagre to learn the fact .
