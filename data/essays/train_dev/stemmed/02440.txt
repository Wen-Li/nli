the speed and the pace by which technolog proce is veri fast :: if we look at the past , we can recogn how human progress and invent have chang and restrict their own time of prepar and creation . a set of materi in which man ha improv hi condit of life is transport . nowaday it 's veri common to own a car and to get a licenc to drve it as soon as possibl . thi mean of transport ha becom essenti to us . thi lead me to openli state thet i do n't realli think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the follow are my reason to hold my opinion . firstli , it 's commonli known that the number of car own by famili ha been strongli increas in the last year : more and more car are daili be purchas by peopl , and a clear proof of it is that center that are specif built to gather old and over use car are overcrowd . besid , it 's becom more and more difficult to find a bare park in the neighborhood of your hous , expeci if you live in a citi . secondli , although the fuel ' and ga ' resours are be strongli decreas and scientif research is tri to find altern way to satisfi the huge suppli for fuel , statis in the market can ensur us that car will constitut a well built buis for still mani year , no matter with what is concern with fuel 's lack . thirdli , techolog work veri fast , but not so fast to complet revolution our way of move and carri within twenti year : fli car that we often see in fantasy-scientif movi are enough far from us . it 's true that mani other way of transport have been invent ( such as airplan ) , but car , buse and van are too import to us , becaus they work on the ground ane we live on the ground , too .
