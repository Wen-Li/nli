ye , i agre that young peopl enjoy more than older peopl . young age mean the teenag where most of the peopl spoil their life rather mould it into a good futur . they studi till the secondari school but as soon as they enter into their colleg life they enjoy rather concentr on their studi . he is not awar of the futur experi and problem he would face . young peopl enjoy in their teenag keep studi asid . most of the peopl in their young age are not awar of the futur . they just wast time in enjoy and parti . so that they can not becam a success person in these societi . he can not reach hi goal . everi person ha their on goal but we have to fulfil . by enjoy we wast half of our life and suffer half of the life . their is no use of recognit after the teenag is pass . they think that they have grown up and can handl their decis on their own . they think that they know what is right and what is wrong . they go on for parti without the permiss of parent and return late night . they smoke , they drink and commit lot of mistak . they break the parent reput . but the same person when he come to old age he shall think of the past what he have done . he stop all the enjoy and concentr on the work and settlement . he think as a matur person . young peopl are not matur and can not take decis on their own . they live in a world of fantasi , passion and fashion . he wander on the street and creat havoc to the public . most of the young peopl who think in a better way get settl in life but those are still on road . so everyth is in our hand , we should have to chang our life accord to ur wish .
