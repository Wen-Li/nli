i disagre with the statement that is best to travel in a group led by a tour guid . when you travel with group and guid there are onli predetermin place you can go to , and also spend a precis amount of time in each activ . these are the main reason whi i prefer to travel on my own . i think that if you travel by yourself , you are not subject to a specif schedul , also you can organ yourself in a more conveni way . sometim you feel like stay in the hotel and rest or do someth total differ than the rest of the group . also it can happen that you do not get a great and cheer group of peopl and that can contribut to some tension among travel . sever year ago , i went to brazil in a tour with sever friend , and ofcours , we thought that have a tour guid would be the best thing to do . initi wa o.k. , but at the end becam a nightmar becaus we want to do other thing that were not part of the guid tour routin . for exampl , we want to go to buzio , a small town with amaz beach and a lot of natur site to visit . unfortun , and becaus the tour guid refus to take us there , we were not abl to visit buzio . some night we also felt like go to differ and more exit place or stay longer at other , but , we were remind of the polici in place . guid tour are veri restrict , and becaus of thi and other experi i have had in the past , i believ that travel on your own is the best move .
