there are a lot of theori on the number of car that are in use now and that would be in use in the next futur . expert have differ idea on thi question , and their theori are base princip on the cost of car ( includ the fuel , the insur , etc . ) and of govern ' polici . in my opinion , if thing do not chang quickli , in the next twenti year in itali there would be fewer car in use than today . my first argument is that car ' cost is increas year by year in the last time . even if car ' price are not increas , the cost of the fuel and of insurac is now at an incred high level . for exampl , the last govern 's law , in order to solv the financi problem of our countri , contain a special tax on suv . today , a tipic italian famili can difficulti afford the cost of a car . in addit , the local polici of the citi are other reason for not buy a car . now in all the big citi there are traffic limit , and , in order to tri to reduc pollut , in some day car are not allow to move in the citi . furthermor , old car can not circul at ani time dure the day . also , in the citi is veri difficult to find a park and , when one find it , it cost a lot of money . therefor peopl prefer to go to the citi with scooter , that take less space , or with public transport , which are cheaper . howev , the italian govern is not give a real altern to the car for peopl that need to move for work or for other reason . the public transport do not cover all peopl 's necess . for instanc , there are no buse dure the night so , if one want to go out at nightim , he or she ha to use a privat mean . in conclus , becaus most famili can not afford a car , and becaus car are not use if one can not use them ( like it happen with citi ' limit ) , i think that the number of car will decreas in the next twenti year . howev , govern polici is not help to resolv the situat in favour of public transport .
