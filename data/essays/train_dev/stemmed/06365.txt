i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i hold thi point of view becaus of the surg of the global popul , the expans of the urban citi , and the research of the invent of futur car . first of all , it is clear that the number of the global popul is dramat increas by look at the demograph chart . the number of peopl may soon reach it peak and it mean that there will be more and more peopl that their transport necessari should to be met . and it can also observ that in mani prosper area , one famili may have more than a car in their garag . so the accelar of the number of human will result in the intens need of car . secondli , sinc there are more and more fellow men who settl down and pursu their live in citi , the brink of citi have extend , form the so-cal metropoli and thi phenomanon show that mani peopl dwell in the outskirt or suburb of urban citi will need car to access the core area of citi due to the distanc from outer place to the busi or entertain center and the conveni that car bring about . thirdli , becaus of the exhaus of the fossil fule , mani scientist or copor are now eager to research in the field of renew energi and seek to invent environment friendli green car that util bioenergi , electr or solar energi . sinc the further research and the activ invet of green car , how can the number of car be decreas in twenti year . accordingli , there will be more and more car on the road , no matter what appear they may have . as a whole , in twenti year there wo n't be fewer and fewer car in use . convers , what with the explos of the global popul , the swell of the big citi and the enthusiasm for produc futur vehicl , car will still on demand .
