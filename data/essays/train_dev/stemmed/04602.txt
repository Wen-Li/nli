the given statement state that `` it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one subject . probabl i dont agre with the statement given becaus of mani reason . as it is said that it is better to have broad knowledg about mani subject rather than one it may applic onli at lower educ level . where it is easi to read mani subject with not so prolong issu but just a overlook about the subject and get a vagu idea about the topic which are requir and use in our daytoday life such physic , english , mathemat . but as we go for higher educ we probabl prefer a singl subject that we are intrest in and make special . so i specifi my view that it is essenti that at which point of time we are take the import decis of studi our graduat or post graduat at that time onli the prescrib subject is requir to do special . i can support my view by give some import point . the point are , if want to studi all the academ subject at greater level of educ then it is veri tough becaus for a given academ time we may not get the inform of all the subject in detail . and some time we may not be intrest in some of the academ subject and we may neglect those subject and get a lower grade which may not be correct for a proper educ . and the next reason is that do a special patrticularli mean when we are take in particular subject and do research about the topic then we say that we have done specil in that particular subject . we cant say that we have done special in all the subject which is practic not piossibl becaus man is not perfect and he cant gain such a great knowledg at a time . basic we select our subject accord to our carrer object so we rather prefer to gain knowledg about that particular subject and do special on onli that topic , so if we go for all the subject accord to the student tendenc we usal neglect some of the topic . final i would say that the given statement may be applic onli at lower educ level , but for the higher level it would be better if we do special onli in one subject rather than all the academ subject . get broader knowledg not onli mean that studi mani topic but to have perfect about them which may not be posibl for a greater extent . thi gain of broder knowledg may be onli for some time final we have to be perfect in one .
