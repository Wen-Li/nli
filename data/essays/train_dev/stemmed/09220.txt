the market have devolop veri fast , the compani everi day are discuss what they have to do to sale more and how they can attract more consum . the advertis is a good technic to obtain their goal . the statement `` most advertis make product seem much better than the realli are '' is a true . the advertis make the peopl believi that the product are as they show in the televis or in the magazin . i have live thi expiri with a shampoo . i have a veri curli hair so i need a shampoo that do n't let me see as a lion . when i watch in the televis the advertis of pantenn 's shampo that let your hair veri curli but not as a lion i thought it wa the best solut to my hair , so i went to buy it inmedi . the first time i use it wa a dissast , it did n't work as they show in the advertis and also my hair began to fall . in that moment i undestood that you can not believ in the advertis . other exampl to support my opinion is when i went to isla margarita in venezuela . i chose the hotel that i saw in the web page , it seem veri comfort and beauti , but when i arriv to the hotel , i wa veri dissapoint becaus it wa n't what i wa expect . the room wa veri small , the air condit wa damag and the food wasn ; t good . the same day arriv i chang to anoth hotel , which wa spectacular . the advertis make believ the consum what they not realli are . the compani are tri to attract consum by show them fals attribut of the product and by thi way the compani will have to replant their advertis , becaus it would caus damag in their imag and the peopl will not buy again their product .
