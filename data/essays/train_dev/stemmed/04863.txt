i agre with the statement , the best way is in a group . howev , i disagre the travel is led by a tour guid . i think travel in a group ha a lot of benefit . it will be fun than travel alon . i think travel alon is so bore . if we travel in a group , we can talk when we are go somewher . and we can enjoy the game dure the trip . but if we travel alon , we ca n't play . we wil spend time quit . when we travel , i think fun must be first . we can help each other . if someon do n't know someth how to do , hi or her friend can help him . if someon ca n't do someth becaus of other one , hi friend can do that instead of him . for exampl , there are firework at night . by the way , he is sick or ca n't go out becaus of hi work , then hi friend can bring hi camera and can take the photo and video for him . i told you that led by a tour guid is not good . dure the trip , the tour guid explain and teach everyth . therefor , get inform is so easi . then we will forget the inform easili . i think if i get someth easili , i also can lose that easili . we need to prepar inform about the place where we go befor we travel . it is my experi . i prepar inform befor i went haha tower . and when i went haha tower , i could know about that veri well . and it wa veri interest . and you can talk with your friend with that inform . and you can get more inform by your friend . by these reason , i think to travel in a group without a tour guid is the best way .
