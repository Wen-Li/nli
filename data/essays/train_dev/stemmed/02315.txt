that is what i have in mind . actual most of the success peopl must tri new thing and take a risk rather than onli do what the alreadi know how to do well . thi is becaus if they did not do like that , they could not succeed . there are a lot of peopl who can do veri well about someth , if someon want to succeed , he/sh ha to do someth special just like the follow statement . i will show a exampl about the statement ; about einstein . if my memori serv me right , he took lot of risk like earnig money to do someth for invent , or studi himself instead of go to school . at that time , mani peopl critic him , but now everyon can know him and hi invent , and admir him . as einstein did , if we tri to succeed we can do . unless we do not tri , we will fail . that is whi i agre with the follow statement . and the other is about me . i use to tend to do someth easi . someday my parent aks me `` do you want to studi abroad ? '' so i said to them `` sure . it will be fantast `` then they talk to me '' ye it will be . but will you be abl to do ? it will have a lot of problem . '' i think about go to america . and i decid to go america . sinc that time , i do not have thedenc that make me do someth easi . it make me like thi . as i told , if we want to succeed in our whole life , we must tri . that is the onli way to succeed . i mean we have a difficulti succeed in someth that we alreadi know how to do well , becaus the thing that i know how to do veeri well , anoth peopl knew it just like me . person , the way to succeed is to tri new thing and take risk . like einstein or the other who are success peopl , they might take a risk . i can be sure about thi . we can not succeed in our life without ani tri or take a risk
