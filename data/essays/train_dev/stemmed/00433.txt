in my opinion young peol do n't enjoy themselv then older peopl do becaus we speak of two distinguisc way to enjoy . for exmpl , if we keep an young and an old we can note that the older have mani responsabi than younger , for exampl they can have littl children to regard so if they decid to go out , they prefer , i think , go to the resaur an d came back home earli . an young if decid to go out , go out more late and back more late . but i do n't think that the hour do the differ in enjoy life . you cau stay well also remaind an appointa becaus you are tire , becaus you say that the morn have to work and so refer to remain whit your famili . in my opinion young peopl have chang the valu to enjoy whit to go out . in fact i think perhap that my mother or my grand mother enjoy more than me or my sister .
