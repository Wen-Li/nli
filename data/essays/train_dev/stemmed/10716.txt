i do not agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know to do well . to my mind , it is true that success peopl are will to take risk , but i think that they balanc out advantag and disadvantag of an occas better than peopl who are not as success . they appli their knowleg to the topic situat and know how to cope with it . most like success peopl have had mani experi and thu have learn when they can take risk and when it is too danger . stereotyp , success peopl are wealthi and thu have to consid their capit . as a contrast to these peopl , i think that peopl who are not as success are will to take more risk , in order to becom success becaus to their mind it might be their last chanc to reach what they have work for . in my opinion , they do not have to care as much about ani disadvantag or about the risk certain step bring along . they do not have as much to loos as veri success peopl . howev , there is anoth group of success peopl : the success peopl who onli see the money , the success and the fame and therefor take ani risk without consid neg effect . they are will to risk a good work climat and even friendship to becom more and more success . these carrierist are veri ambiti and most like veri egoist , too . they just see the benefit for themselv and do not care about anybodi els . to my mind one can not divid peopl in risk take success peopl and care non success peopl . it alway depend on the situat they face . if it is someon 's last chanc to rescu a compani , even the most care success person might consid take the risk . and on the other hand a non success person might not take a risk becaus of ani consequ , even if there is not as much to loos .
