i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do and there are three main reason whi i think so . first of all , there are more task given to young peopl than to old peopl . for exampl , young peopl have to studi in order to go to school and get a good mark at class . they also have to work to make money or to be experienc enough to get a better job . sometim they are too busi to do someth they realli want . but older peopl have done all the task given to them . all they have to do is to receiv a reward and appreci for their hard work and achiev . secondli , old peopl are wise enough to realiz what pleas them . in other word , they enjoy their live wherea young peopl often get stress out from live . old peopl have more experi and clue about what life and they know how to behav when they face a challeng . probabl the reason whi young peopl think they are struggl through their live is that they have less experi than older peopl and panic whenver they find their live difficult . old peopl know how to enjoy their live , hope young peopl will soon realiz what they figur out when they were young . thirdli , and more importantli mayb , old peopl are richier than young peopl . they have work hard and have earn money as a result . they can spend money on whatev they want . they can buy a fanci car , they can make a beauti garden , and they can even give their money to their children if they want to . everyon want to enjoy life and the onli differ is the way of enjoy life . peopl can not assum that old peopl can not enjoy life onli becaus they are old and bore . obvious , there are mani thing for young peopl to learn from older peopl . they need to learn how to work hard , how to achiev their goal , and how to enjoy life . howev , most of these question will be answer complet as they actual get age .
