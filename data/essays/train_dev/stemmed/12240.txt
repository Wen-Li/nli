i do not agre with the thi statement becaus younger and older peopl have differ way to enjoy life . life is not about age whether is a young person or an older person , but insta about symbol of joy is a way of enlight and reach happin . younger peopl might think or have the idea that they are onli one to enjoy life , but at what cost . older peopl insta , have the treasur of wisdom among knowleg , with a convin of lot of experinc , they have the matur and most import qualiti , patienc . i have see older peopl enjoy life more then yunger peopl , but also , come to a cost of good health . i have see mani older peopl that enjoy life as if they have the hearth of a twenti year old person . to me , life enjoiment is long term learn experi that bring individu to understand the mean of enjoy of life . when one is young , one can think that they have the energi to impos them selv to the world that they are indestruct and thi might bring to a short end of life . a few year ago , i wa talk to an old friend , he told me one import thing that mark my life for good : `` the diabl is not smart becaus is the diabl , is becaus the diabl is old '' ; is like the young or old wine , or like the age of the wieski , what it is better an 8 year old wieski or an 24 year of age in a barril , i would go for the 24 year old age in a barril . for mani thing , as children one learn patienc by tri to creat someth mayb a small plaster figur or a carb on wood , but as learn , it take time to develop and to evolb . thi is whi it doe take time to go trough school first in kindergarten , then into elementari follow to middl school , and high school and later colleg where educ teach us that for anyth to matur , it doe take time . and becaus of i beleiv that one need to matur some how and reach and state of age and would enjoy life as everyday should be , a joy develop . becaus of thi mani observ , i beleiv that younger peopl would need time to evolb and reach matur to be abl to enjoy life in a more passion way .
