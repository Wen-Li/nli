i definit agre with thi statement . i realli believ understand idea and concept for student be more import and valuabl than just learn fact . there are divers reason support thi opinion . first , idea and concept are abstract and gener , in fact they gener fact . thi mean that studi either a concept or an idea you learn the outstand which all that kind of fact are base on . in other word you studi a multipl set of fact . besid onc you becom familiar with the concept , you can appli it in sever way and field of real life . on the other hand learn a fact you just learn that fact which is differ to all the other fact . anoth import constat regard how long a student can keep in mind a fact or a concept . onc you 've understood a concept , it is difficult to total forget it or delet it complet from your knowledg . differ a fact is absolut easi to lose even in the short term , becaus it is an uniqu , isol situat . you can appli thi statement especi to subject like mathemat or finac in which you have to learn how to deriv formula or valu rather than rememb all the possibl one . so even you do't remmber that formula you can deriv it through passag that you understood
