i agre with thi statement that most advertis make product look much better than thier real qualiti . in these day , a lot of advertis of product come out through media . as peopl saw those advertis they never feel those product are not good , but they feel those look good and want to buy or use it . it is becaus ad do not show all of real , exist qualiti of product . when peopl watch ad , they just accept ad by media . all of the media are one-way commun , so peopl have to accept it and they do not have chanc to reveal or ask about the product to media . moreov , compani , which make product or good , onli want to show benefit of product rather than shortcom of product . therefor , peopl can not know side effect or demerit of the product , and it make peopl to beliv that product do not have disadvantag . for exampl , i bought an `` i-pod '' three year ago with a proud of buy good look mp3 . howev , after i had been use that for two year , it wa broken . then , i went to servic center to fix that . but servic worker said they could not fix that becaus of it had been over it warranti . it look veri good in ad , second , when product maker use advertis , they hire famou peopl and super star who are effect to major to make product seem better . it is due to the fact that peopl want to be and like to be them . for exampl , if women watch the jennif aniston use a certain hair product in ad , that product will be sold out fastli becaus mani of women want to have hair like jennif 's . even though that product do not have good qualiti , it look good thank to jeniif , so women feel that product ha good qualiti .
