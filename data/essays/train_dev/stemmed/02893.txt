mani academ believ that it is more import for student to analyz and understand concept and idea rather than to studi fact . in thi essay i will examin whether the benefit of just understand the idea outweigh the possibl advantag of learn fact . firstli , one argument that mani peopl state in favor of the abov mention opinion is that if you know the idea then you will be abl to adapt to a differ situat and to appli it to new circumst . in other word , onli if you analyz the concept then you will be abl to use it to new situat . the mere knowledg of fact doe not help in thi case sinc they are onli characterist of a certain point in time and can not be appli univers . secondli , it could be argu that onli the knowledg of idea enabl you to develop new idea . fact are static wherea idea are dynam . you can look at idea and concept from differ angl and play with them . out of thi deal with a concept a new , further develop idea or system of idea might be gener . mere fact are not open to such a proceed , they can onli be acknowledg . thu , becaus of these persuas argument the opinion of the academ seem to be correct . howev , the import of the knowledg of fact can not be underestim . in most of the time an idea can onli be understood if you know the fact on which it is base . most of the idea are born out of a specif situat which is essenti for the understand of the idea . furthermor , an idea can not be further develop if you do not know anyth about it origin . you would not be abl to appli it to a new situat and surround . in conclus , although there are sever strong argument in favor of the opinion mention abov i believ that the knowledg of the idea and of the fact are equal import . both idea and fact are intertwin with each other and can not be separ . thu , in my view student should studi concept as intens as fact .
