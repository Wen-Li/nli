numer peopl live togeth in our societi . some peopl are young , and other are old . sometim , we can hear that older peopl say to young propl `` i envi you becaus you are enjoy your life so much . '' howev , i doubt the idea which young peopl enjoy their live more than older peopl . as far as i am concern , they are too busi to enjoy their live becaus young peopl have a lot of respons to have to do . first , young peopl have to studi for their futur . for exampl , high school student in korea spend over 15 hour to studi everi day . in my case , i have been studi toefl over 10 hour a day after i decid to go a univers abroad . do you think that we seem to enjoy our live ? second , young peopl have to earn money hardli to support their children . one of my friend hate hi job . he is work as engin , but he actual dream is to be a writer for novel . howev , he can not quit the job becuas hi son wa just born last year . he doe n't think that he can afford hi famili do what he realli want . how sad it is ! final , young peopl a lot of concern about their futur . for exampl , accord a research , 80 % of korean junior high school student answer that they are not happi to the question '' are you happi ? '' becaus they get ton of stress from studi and feel nervou about their futur . it is not diffrent for peopl who work after graduat school . mani peopl are not satisfi with their live and are worri about their futur . they are young ; it mean they have a lot of difficulti for the futur for them . therefor , i ca n't agre with the idea which young peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl . actual , i beliv that they could more enjoy they live when they get older after they are done on their respons .
