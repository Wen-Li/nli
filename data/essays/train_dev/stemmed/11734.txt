i agre thi statement . young peopl are too lazi to help peopl nowday , although we sing : `` stand hand in hand '' everyday in school . young peopl nowday are get more and more selfish . we can hardli see a young person help a old granni to cross the road nowday , becaus we prefer chate with friend besid the road . i do not realli know south african young peopl 's behaviour , but i know young peopl in china veri well . of cousr , not all of us are selfish and unconsid , but the major of the youth are selfish . they are everywher , in the school , on the street and even just in our famili . unfortun , i think that i am one of them too . i rememb when i wa in the school of china . we need to do the daili clean everyday by ourselv , becaus that wa and still is the part of our school duti . class teacher divid us into sever group , and told us the date that we would be on duti . we want a nice and clear environ to studi , although we do not want to do the clean by ourselv . therefor we expect the other peopl could work harder to get the classroom clean . but , other peopl also thought that way . so , as you can imagin , we all work not hard eough . therefor , the next day we had a untidi , dirti classroom . peopl who had duti on that day might think that : they did not do the clean well , so whi should i ? therefor , the next day we had a untidi , dirti classroom again . then it just carri on like thi , so we never had a clear classroom ! that look ridicul , but that wa exactli what happen . that is all about selfish . young peopl are just like that , push the duti to the other . then the other will push them to someon els . we just can not understand that if we help the other , they will help us oneday , when we are exprienc difficulti . young peopl nowday do have enough time to help their commun , but they just do not want to give it .
