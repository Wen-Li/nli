nowaday car are use , becaus they help peopl to move from one place to anoth . there are also other mean of transport , such as train , bu , plane , bycicl , etc . i think that there are pro and contro for such a decis , as to use car instead of other mean . car are use mostli when you travel within your contri . for longer distanc , train or plane are prefer . bycicl , instead , is use for shorter shift . it help somebodi to keep fit and it 's good for their health . moreov , car are danger for the environ , destroy the atmospher . some peopl , in fact , prefer use buss , in order to avoid smog and nois . even if bu is more uncomfort than car , it is wider and wider use . plenti of peopl prefer car becaus they can stay there on by themselv , in order to get not in touch with sombodi els . some other , prefer public mean becaus they are will to speak with other peopl . advertis meke you buy carsar as car are concern , i think that the onli opportun to diminuish them is to invent a new moder technolog , in order to replac car . it 's up to the govern to invent someth to save the environ and , abov all , the life of hi citizenship . in fact more and more peopl have a diseas , owe to the pollut and it 's difficult to heal . therefor , i guess that if the peopl know the problem , they will do someth to avoid it . the societi we belong to chang hi habit in order to improv the world they live in . to sum it up , i sustain that in twenti year there will be fewer car .
