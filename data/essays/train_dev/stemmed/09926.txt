i think that both of these option are veri import for a student . of cours , it depend on what is your field of studi . for thi reson i would say that i desagre with thi statement . for exampl if you are stude histori , is much more import to learn the fact and the date of the histori passag , than you have to understand idea and concept , but of shure thi is also a veri import knowledg that is requir you , as histor , to have . is realli veri import , infact a student is stude for thi reason , to understand idea and concept of what are you stude but i ca n't say that thi is more import than learn fact , becaus without the knowledg of the fact you ca n't say that you have studi someth . i 'm think about when i wa stude mathematik : for me and also for the teacher wa veri import that we , as student , had understud the idea and concept behind an algebr formul , but of shure you need to know veri well also the formul itself . an other reson whi i disagre with the statement is that if you are a student you have to learn everyth that they are explain in the lectur or that you read in the text book , you ca n't say at ani time that you have studi thi or that fact but you do n't remeb the fact : i 'm think at some friend of me that they studi someth and after a few hour you can ask them somethink and they do not rememb anythink , exept the main idea . to the other side i think that is import in the futur , i mean after 10 or more yar after your studi , to remeb the main idea and concept ; and is quit imposs to rememb all the learn fact . at the and i wont to say that i desagre with thi statement but depend a lot on wich is your field of studi and in wich time proyect ar you look for .
