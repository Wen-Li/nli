i do not agre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . as far as i know , in my univers , there are hundr of club that provid extracurricul activ for student to join in and mani of the club are focu on sevic , includ remot primiari school sevic , fisher villag sevic and of cous , commun servic . all of them are part of student ' societi servic . usual , those severc club are veri popular around student in my univers . their common main concern is to help the whole societi to becom better , but becaus they focu on differ group of peopl , they devid to variou kind of club . these club will recruit new member at the bigin of the semest and then arrang all the member into differ group to design help project . sometim , it take whole semest to prepar for a big project which may conclud sever univers and carri out togeth du summer or winter vacat . these student realli do some miricl to the commun , even the societi , by donat their idea and effort to go on some activ such as pick up everi piec of paper on one specif commun , give a bath to the old who live alon or offer free after-school tutor for children in remot rigion . how could one said that there are no young peopl will to spend time particip in those work for simpli becaus there are mani student spend thier time right befor the comput or in ktv ? howev , there are still shortag for human resourc when it come to help the commun or societi . we need more young volunt to go outdoor and take part in the project that club or govern ha design . there is alway a need for one more hand in ani place .
