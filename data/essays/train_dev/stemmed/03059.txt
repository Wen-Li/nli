wherev you are , you will alway have an ad , point out at an amaiz product , even if it look weird or expens . it will alway show the good point of it , and if not , there is a chanc that someth did not go well ! we are total live in a consum societi , thi one reason you have that much ad on tv , magasin . .. i rememb when i wa about 7 year old , i saw on tv an ad for the baywatch barbi and all it goe with . i total felt for it . santa claus brought me the barbi and the jetski which match with for chrisma . i wa so excit that i start to play with it immediatli , but they were that tini detail nobodi took care about , the jetski wa not water resist and when i dive in my bath with it i wa pretti disapoint ! who could have guess that ajetski would not be water resist ? from my personn experi i know that thing alway look better on and ad . howev , two year ago i went with some mate to miami , and as we were lay down , watch tv , act like real teenag , thi commerci pop : three ballerina eat oreo 's cooki , they were so cute who would not fell for them ? i might not have fell for her but i total went for the cooki , they are so good ! love them . i think the percept you got from an ad is so differ from each other that it make it difficult to have a real statement toward it . thing could look good and are total not and thing can look so weird and funni that you would not go for a bite , and it turn out that it is okay . honnestli , green jelli , no way . i rememb in ireland , the ad with that kid who were eat like ton of it . .. more discust than anyth . green shin thing in my mouth , hell no ! well right no we are work thing out , i 'd rather go for the blue one as i said , you can never trust a thing befor you tri it , thing can turn a way you did not expect them to . .. last but not leasr , the onli person you should believ in is yourself not the perfect mum on the tv who is tell you that it 's the best thing she never had in all her life .
