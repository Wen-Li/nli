i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . herefor there are sever argument , which i would like to present as follow . at first we have to keep in mind , that technolog is a rapid process . everi day there are new invent and new possibl , which are offer to the consum . the consum see these new invent and come to the conclus , that he must have thi product . the automobil sector is a everi day grow sector which offer these new invent in form of faster car or intellig navig system for the driver . there is nowaday even the possibl to watch tv , while use the car . these new invent lead to the impress , that a car is not onli good for transport . in the contrari , it is use as a statu symbol . as a result more peopl want to poss such technolog advanc car for repres their statu to their environ . anoth reason might be , that peopl want to be independ while they are voyag or drive to work . when use buss , train or plane delay occur , which caus an insatisfact and lead to the impress , that public transport possibl are not as good as the own car . with the own car peopl can decid when they want to start the voyag , without be depend on bu schedul or rout . of cours , the decreas of use car , ha and will have a big disadvantag . the pollut of the environ . the more car are use , the more it is effect on the enviro . tree , anim and plant will not have their special environ ani longer , which they need for a perfect growth . the air is pollut and the life expect of the peopl declin as more car are on the street . nevertheless car will never disappear from our life .
