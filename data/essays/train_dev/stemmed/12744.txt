i total disagre with the statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more than the older peopl '' . as there is a famou say `` still young at heart '' . the abov statement suggest that there is no limit of age to enjoy life . it 's your life and one should enjoy it 's each and everi singl moment he live , becaus life is preciou and the time which ha gone by will never return . it is certainli old fashion to think that onc you get old , you have lost the author to enjoy . but in thi stage of life one should enjoy life to the fullest as you have spend your whole life tri to make both end meet both person and profession at sever circumst . now when your children are grown up and you no longer hold their respons , one can spend thi import part of his/her life by live upto each and everi moment that pass by . as when a person is young and full of energi , he get into the grind of life face thi harsh world . onc he come out of hi colleg and start earn money , he is ultim engag with the chore of the famili life and face day to day problem . and now in today senario , where the world follow the express lifestyl , one ha no time to spend with his/her famili memeb neither get time for himself so that he can enjoy the varieti of thing that thi life ha to offer . he work day and night to earn money just to buy that extra comfort for hi retir . so that he can spend those last day in peac and enjoy rest of the day . the veri which show us that we work hard all our live to improv our retir , then how can one say that young peopl enjoy more than older peopl do . each person doe thi for himsel , for a secur life later . he add up mone so that one can enjoy lidf with one partner without hassel and problem of daili life .
