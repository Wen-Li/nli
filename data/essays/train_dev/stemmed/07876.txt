ye i do agre that `` it is moer import for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' .i have mani reason and exampl to cite in support of thi statement . there are mani advantag if the student understand idea and concept . becaus the fact are alreadi done known by other and the student have to follow the consept and idea of that fact . for exampl there are mani thing like the math problem and theorm which are prove by mani other peopl so the student need to follow the rule like idea and consept of the theorm in order to solv that . but the student cant again take the fact and the experi on that . so it good for the student to follow idea . by follow the idea we can even solv mani more problem . even by use that idea we can prove some thing els . the concept and idea are use in order to find the reman thing like prove the problem further and even we can make new meathod of solv the problem . by use some of our own idea . but it not good that we wast our time in know the thing which are alreadi prove so it better to follow idea and consept to move forword . even there is a need to know that what the fact becaus some time we may think the idea is correct and which may even go wrong some time . so it even necessari that the student should also be awar of thi fact so that he dont get in mistak . similar way there are mani advantag and disadvantag about thi sentanc but there are few disadvantag so i would like to agre the sentanc becaus there are mani advantag of thi sentanc .
