ani other express would not be more import than thi topic . petroleum , what for mani of the countri fight with each other , is decreas in quantiti . in my opinion , in twenti year there will be fewer car than today , and i am sure that there will be an anoth way of transport differ from the car . there are sever reason whi i believ that , fewer car will be use in the futur . in my opinion , the main problem is the enegi problem ; world is grow everi day , the requir of the new energi sourc are in need more than ever . today main enegi sourc for transport is petroleum ; howev it is clear that the deposit of it are decreas in quantiti . the other enegi sourc , such as solar enegi , wind power , fuel cells-which are oper from hydrogen - , geotherm sourc are not suffic to overcom the energi problem of the transport sector . for instanc , the most ultim design solar car , which can reach up to a speed of 90km/h , can onli carri 2 peopl , and is 3 meter long , due to the need of larg solar panel . in addit , car , which opar with fuel cell are not suitabl to use in the highway ; mayb they can be use at low speed in the citi . anoth import aspect is traffic problem , i think . big citi are grow everyday , and more and more car are sold in these citi . howev , the road stay same . i believ , traffic is not just wast of time ; in addit , it is wast of energi . for instanc , from school to home normally-with traffic-it take 1 hour and 30 minut ; but , when the road are empti it take nearli 1 hour . it mean that everyday i spend 1 hour on road . i think , thi can be solv by build more underground or by set more bu rout : these all mean fewer car . as a conclus , i strongli believ that there will be fewer car in the futur . not onli the energi aspect , but also the traffic problem forc peol to make car fewer .
