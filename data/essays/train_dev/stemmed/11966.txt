for me , it is better to have a special in one specif subject than have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus it is easier for normal human studi one subject and spend hi time on it . peopl who prefar studi one languag sue do n't have time for that becaus there is mani thing in life take aolt of human 's time . one reason that a human could have amni social prblem make him confus and not consetr on hi studi so it is better for him to studi one subject . also studi one subject make human sucsess in what he is studi . for eaxampl , if a person studi busi administr and spend all hi time and energi for it he will becam amaz in hi career and job . if he had a littl time he could take some cours of ani thing he like . on the other hand , have broad knowledg it 's may be good to haver a well inform about mani thing in thi life but i disagre to have mani knowledg of mani academ subject becaus it is wast for time espcial if the person ha a familli and children , it would be difficult for him to take care of hi famili and hi studi at the same time . the famili need time to spend with becaus it 's the main ting in thi life and from the good famili grow good pepl . but when one of the perent do n't have time for thier famili that would reflect in a neg way at children . so studi one subject would allow person to have time for hi own life and take care of it . so have one thing to studi is better for the peaon him self also better for the countri he live in . i think have one subject to so studi or not , well . . that depend in person 's person in hi life and hi scadul . each person ha hi own idea .
