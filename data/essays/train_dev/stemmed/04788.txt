i total disagre with thi statement . i think youg peopl should make effort to help their commun becaus they must be one of the member of the commun . firstli i think all peopl should cooper with each other . within the commun there are mani kind of peopl , such as youg children , adult , or elderi peopl . mani of them are need help . especi elder peopl need help . now there are big number of elder peopl in japan and there are fewer of those who can assist them . gener mani young adult have their kid and they do not have much time to help pther and mani adult have their job and they also have no time to help . but how about youg peopel such as univers student ? they just have paranti of time . of cours , i think studi or work part time job must be import , but they should make some time to help elder peopl and help therir commun . second of all if young peopl help commun they can be learn by other in the same commun . if one help commun they have to talk with or have soem rerationship with other . though thi process they can learn a lot of thing which school would not provid , such as tradit or old experi . fow exampl , when i wa in my hometown i sometim went to a kind of meet of elder peopl with my grandmath . they talk me or other youg peopl about some great stori base on their experi . the oen i wa the most impress wa hi own experi in the war time . sinc no youg pepol have experienc the war at all , we should listen to the real stroy by the real person who actual had experienc it . though read articl is good , it would be lack of realiti , i think . for these reason , i think youg peopl help commun and learn form them .
