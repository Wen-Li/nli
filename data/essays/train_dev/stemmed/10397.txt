i total disagre with thi statement becaus is a gener rule that from the fact the idea or concept is get . in fact , for student are more import to know the fact then they can analyz them and prove it , so they can build their own idea or make their concept about . for me is like the practic and the theori . the fact in some measur is how the situat ha been develop , the fact help to student to understand more effici and quickli becaus the fact can explain them datail about the situat and they can obtain a better idea about what they are studi . there are mani idea and concept about topic depend on the way the person understand the fact . to explain thi opinion , i 'm go to give you an exampl : the fact that one children have to studi is a gener idea , but there are mani concept around thi fact , but the fact alway ha to know it , as a result of it mani idea and concept begin to be develop for exampl , some peopl can say that they doe n't agre with thi fact , but mani person agre with the fact that is so import for children to studi and they should do it , onli in thi fact we have two difer idea , and if we continu analyz the fact we are go to obtain mani reason to be agre or disagre with it , but the fact doe n't chang , it is like the root of the situat or topic . in conclut i think that it is more import for student to understand the fact and then they can understand the idea of the other person and make their own idea about the situat and prove
