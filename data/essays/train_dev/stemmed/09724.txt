nowaday it 's veri import to have a good academ format to get an interest job and realiz yourself , but thi should be reach in two way : a broad knowledg and a specif knowledg . i 'm italian , so i 'm influenc by the italian typic school system base on a big knowledg of mani subject . in fact when i wa at school i studi a lot of subject , includ latin and ancient greek , and when i wa at the univers i took twentyf exam on differ aspect of econom . i think that it 's import to have a broad knowledg of mani subject becaus today when you work you need to be more flessibl than befor ; a lot of thing are chang and it 's quit differ from the begin of the twentieth centuri when ford teoriz the `` work special '' . but , probabl in some case it should be differ ; for exampl an ingen need to know a lot of thing in a specif subject and he must special in a specif construct sector , and , i think , it 's similar for medician . on the other hand , my prepar is gener becaus i would becom a manag , and it 's konw that a manag must be resolv a lot of differ problem in differ way , you may use your abil to find new solut to the problem . for exampl , if you have a problem sell a product becaus the market doe n't like it , you have two chois : the first is to retir the product from the market and second one , which is more creativ , is to find a good market solut to make the product `` pull '' by the market . in conclus , i think that you must choo your format depend on your interest and your futur job .
