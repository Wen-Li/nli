the statement say that student should importantli understand idea and concept instead of learn them . thi is a question that i face myself as a student almost everi day . on the one hand it is necessari to understand the theori that lie beneth all fact and all new inform , in a way to get a solit knowledg how thing work . on the other hand it is also necessari to just learn new word or relationship . without that base knowledg it is not possibl to commun with other becaus they do not know what you are talk about . i guess there is no black and white view whether to say that a student should learn everyth new just by heart or to understand just the fact . it must be a middleway you have to find to combin thi both view . when repitit is the aim then i would say that learn the fact is enough but when it is necessari to find new conclus and relat between differ case then it is a must to understand basicali what the new inform want to tell . nowaday the knowledg is given to everybodi through variou databas like book or the ultim inform base with techonolgi of the internet . it is just a matter of how to find inform and how long you need to access the new inform . it is get more and more unimport to know everi fact by heart with help from data on page like wikipedia onlin . with that help it is just a matter of a few second to access the right topic and to get ani inform that is so enorm nobodi could keep in mind . to come to a conclus i wish that in mani more field then today alreadi exist student learn the `` whi '' stand behind instead of just pure fact and knowledg they will never need in that particulali case in the futur .
