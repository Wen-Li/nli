student understand idea and concept . student also understand form learn fact . in my opinion it is import student understand idea and concept befor go to learn from fact becaus there are somani reason in that some explan with exampl is given bellow . student learn idea and concept of some topic is veri import befor go to lear fact . for exampl take an experi from a chemistri lab , without know idea and concept of the experi what would do in the lab . if possibl someon do the experi without know the idea and concept definetli some explos go in lab becaus in the chemic lab we do the experi whith care . with out care , if we do the experi in the lab definetli will go wrong . for exampl h2so4 is highi acid , i rememb in my class room in my colleg stadi some student without know the experi detail and idea he want to do the lab . he put some water into the h2so4 a big explos took then my teacher scold that boy that is anoth matter . without know the knowldg and detail he do the exper will give some bad conclus . take anoth exampl some neclier experi are down there in some countri . if we do the some wrong with know or without know there will go a big explos . in that place definetli we know the idea and concept , without know the concept and idea we can not do anyth such place becaus nucclear wepon give big energi than ani other . even son also give the energi base on the neclear energi . forthermor give the safti and full detail inform about what student want to learn . if student learn about concept and idea , he know the entair point about what student want to learn from fact . thi give no loss of ani thing around the place where the applic do . moreov some fact know by without know the idea and concept that is anoth matter . in my opinion we must know the idea and concept befor attempt to learn the fact .
