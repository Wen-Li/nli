young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun , now ; i 'm not sure here at japan , but i know that im my countri australia ; we give up our time to help the poor in need . most school do n't have a rule that they have to a least sever hour of commun servic , and everyon except for the slacker strive to reciev the honour badg of commun sevic . especi year seven must tri to gain thi to show the littl kid younger than us that if they want to get a badg they should do commun servic . the reason for the year seven to tri to gain the badg is becaus the year pre-school - year 6 look up to the year seven as the head of the junoir schiool . so from the statement question , no young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun , except those school who have a rule of commun servic , becaus most young peopl care onli about them selv and not the other . the young peopl of today do n't understand that they could make a big differ just by help their commun , for exampl they could organis a fund raiser , but it doe n't have to be big , they could just donat some money to the countri that is in poverti , or help thier mum or dad in the kitchen . it 's that simpl to make a differnc . so my final answer is no , young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun , but they could tri .
