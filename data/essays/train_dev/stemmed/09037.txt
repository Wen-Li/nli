i agre with the given statement becaus in my opinion young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . nowaday young peopl spend their leisur time with play video game or watch televis . they are surf the internet and are put on weight . onli a few children go outsid to play with friend or do team sport . nowaday most of the children are overweight . they do not learn that there are other peopl with need , opinion and feel , too , which have to be respect just like they want their need , opinion and feel to be respect . unfortun mani children onli care for themselv and they are not interest in the opinion or feel of other person . they do thing onli for their own advantag and most of them think that it is absolut unnessesari to help or care for other peopl . mayb parent should give their children a pet so that the children can learn under the advic of their parent how to take respons for anoth live creatur . i guess that help their commun would show them that they are not alon on earth and that it can be veri satisfactori to know that you do someth becaus it help anoth person . in everi commun are sever peopl that could use some help and there are not enough peopl who can provid thi help . young peopl could visit old peopl in retir home for exampl . they could take the old peopl for a walk or talk to them or play card game for exampl . in a retir home is not enough staff to care for each of the old peopl like they would like to . for the young peopl it would not be much work . they would onli have to spend a littl time with them . it would make the old peopl happier and thi way the young peopl would do somth to help their commun .
