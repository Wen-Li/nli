i neither agre , nor disagre with that statement . i think actual both is import . let me give a person stori that help me get a conclus toward thi question . the problem is , if these day somebodi is onli sophist in fact and ha not a lot of knowledg about the ideolog fundament among the fact he know about , he will probabl alway have big problem to convinc anyon els for a project or an idea . the modern world leav a lot of small nich to hide for peopl who pretend to have a lot of fact-knowledg and who in fact `` did not red the newspap '' . both case are noth to follow after . but , to tell thi right at the begin of the sentenc , both case are more theoretical-typ of be that in fact dont exist that way and i onli use them to illumin my point of view . for exampl the former german bundeskanzl gerhard schroeder wa often call a big actor , a pretend . a lot of peopl where concinc , that he did not have much specif knowledg about polit programm from hi parti or import parlamentari decis . and in fact , i often thaught similari - until i met him one day . it wa a raini sunday and some freind of mine and me where walk through the bar of berlin . than mr schroeder suddenli stood at our tabl and ask if we knew where the toilet wa . it follow what alway follow , we drank , we laugh and we where talk about polit , as soon as he wa back from the restroom . but my person lesson from that meet wa - if somebodi is abl to make a successful carreer , where ever that happen , he need to understand fundamental idea and concept at first - and than he ha to know fact . mr schroeder impress us all absolut becaus of hi the huge flood of fact , that so call `` pretend '' could tell us about .
