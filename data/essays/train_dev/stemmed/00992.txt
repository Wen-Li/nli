well , i dont think success is a result of experienc risk . risk may help to prove oneself new way of do thing ; new possibl to aboard issu or face fear and convention . but i realli dont think that by take risk one can assur for it life success . the main problem that i detect on the statement is that the concept of success is limit to the risk one . fisrt of all we should defin what those term stand for in modern societi in order to realli understand what are the possibl involv in that particular process . for instanc , i could be veri succes without risk anyth in my life . i may have proven formula that have work for me all my life and that not necessarili make me a succes person in term of money and fame , but in my own refer term , that could be anyth regard a good qualiti of life , or even not simpli that . if we tri to make a gener analysi about what is beleiv in modern societi that succ may bring to a person , the argument would orbit around phrae like `` money eventu can make you succes '' , the same thing with fame . so , whi is money and fame the two main refer to explain succ from my point of view ? becaus those concept are the one that prevail in modern capitalist societi . ye , capit , far from all the so-cal econom benefit that it suppos for mankind , it ha also produc a terribl social need for materi whealt in order to expos social statu and succ . i may finish my tought on thi topic by referenc the one and onli clue to understand postmodern : `` the more you buy , the more you are ''
