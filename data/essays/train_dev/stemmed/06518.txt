at school , at univers ( ... ) , we can see lot of student who have either broad knowledg of mani academ subject or a specif subject . we can wonder what is the most import of these two issu for a student . i will answer to thi question in two part and explain the best issu for a student . on the one hand , it is a good idea to be special in a specif subject becaus it mean that the student is veri interest in a subject and can continu thi one in postgradu studi and mayb have a fantast job relat to thi subject . for exampl , a student who is onli special in econom can improv hi level thank to a phd and whi becom an econom teacher or a econom journalist . .. so , it can be veri interest to have a specif subject where we are veri good . moreov , be special in a subject mean that the student must have veri good grade , henc am accomplish for the student who is fond of thi subject . on the other hand , i think it is a veri bad idea to be special in a subject and it is much better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . actual , a student special in one subject must have veri bad grade in the other subject wherea have broad knowledg in lot of subject allow to the student to have mid or quit good grade in all the subject . as far as i am concern , i prefer have arround 12/20 in all the subject than have 18/20 in a specif subject and 8/20 in all the other . i think a good aplic form must show that the student is polyval and not good in one subject and bad in the other . final , i qgree with the statement . it is , of cours , much better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject .
