i believ with the statement that `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . primari reason for such attitud would be drastic chang in their lifestyl , constant peer pressur , too much focu on shape their own carrer and chang in social valu . i would take some of these issu to prove my stand . young peopl are now under the effect of corpor cultur everywher . whether thi be their schoo , home or offic . thi demand them to be at their best everytim . they are expect to be first in their class , decid startegi of busi manag , earn money . all these lead them to focu more on shape their own ident and rather contribut toward their commun . young peopl put in much more effort in term of physic work then be put up by peopl of same age gener ago . thi leav them absolut with no time for contribut toward their commun . with such mad rush behind money , young peopl have becom highli self-centr . they are not worri about suffer of their commun , let alon do someth to remedifi it . young peopl with their live habit , social set and behavior pattern like to remain detach from everyon els . leav commun , young peopl find it difficult to commun with their parent and famili member . thi is not just becaus of commun gap but as well they are not concern about their state . in most of the case they are non exist for them . with such apathet attitud toward their parent , spend time for their commun can be easili rule out . idea to help and connect is die . a perfect exampl of thi could be of how we like to make new friend through internet but young peopl are hardli awar of suffer of r next door neighbour . perhap an exampl of apathi of young peopl toward their commun can be best seen with recent katrina hurric in america . there were hardli ani initi be taken by ani young peopl . henc peopl do not give time to help their commun .
