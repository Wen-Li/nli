the question is be ask if the idea and concept are more import for the student than learn fact . thi is veri import issu about the educ becaus the student have to know everi thing about the life and the world from their school and teacher and their educ book , i think the educ is kind of curios that ha to give the student all what they need . in my opinion , that the school as well as the parent have to give the student the opportun to learn everi thing in thi world by it fact and the idea and the concept , becaus some time if you do n't have ani inform about the real fact you ca n't get to ani point of the concept that you look for . for instanc what wa think about the earth that is revolv around the sun . if thi issu is not abl to be learn at school , no one can imagin how thing can revolv around each other by graviti . addit , teach fact to the student let them ask more question about that issu may lead them to underst and may lead them to figur out more concept in the entir world , like if the student been taught that , not just becaus you see the entir scene in front of you flat that mean the earth is flat . the earth is round not flat . and what you just seen is accord the angl of your scene . so these fact will be in the mind of the student and will never forget it period , and the student will think with similar issu that make that idea or concept in the bottom of their mind and heart . in conclus , i mention point that seem to be import to the student to understand idea and concept as well as the learn the fact in order to know everi thing about the world that we live in
