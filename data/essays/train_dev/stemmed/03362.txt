thi is a veri difficult question which can not be answer in one strict way . in my opinion there is no gener right or no to answer thi question , it depend on the situat . to answer thi question it is import to see it from differ point . on one hand it is good to have a broad knowledg of differ academ subject . for undergradu it better to have a main idea about differ topic to see what they are interest in . without thi knowledg it is imposs to decid which subject you want to take in the further studi . but not onli for the academ career a wide rang of knowledg is import . to understand connect between differ subject or to understand social problem it is necessari to have an gener idea about sever academ point . there is one more point in favour of a broad knowleg i want to mention . if your academ subject you are an expert in , is no longer someth which is import to work at , mayb becaus comput can do all these thing instead of human bee , than you have to watch for a new job in a differ field of work . in thi situat experi in differ subject will be a great advantag . on the other hand , as an graduat student you need veri specif knowledg about one subject . if not , about what will you write your final exam ? for which job advertis will you appli ? both are imposs thing without a good knowledg about a specif topic . in nearli everi exam dure your studi , except you are studi someth realli gener , you need specif and deep knowledg about one topic . all in all i would say it is import to have both , gener knowledg in differ academ subject and special knowleg in one subject . there is one thing we should ever think about when we discuss thi question . you can not get deep knowleg in a subject befor have a gener idea about it .
