person i disagre that young peopl nowaday do not give enought time ti help their commun . i have mainli three reason . my reason are point of support , econom , and secur . one mainli reason is support of commun . in gener , all peopl belong to their commun . commun support the peopl with tangibl and intang . for exampl , tangibl support is fire resuqu . if happen to fire , the peopl of neiborhood in commun support you . second exampl is intang support . if disappear activ in the commun , it is not vivid . commun support you with spirit . second mainli reason is econom . commun depend on the econom of their commun . for exampl , if fulli to take money with commun out resouc , the econom of the comun is not surplu . where is necesari of money ? it is taxat . the econom of the comun without taxat is effect and efficent . the commit of young peopl is good effect of the econom of their commun . final my reason is secur . the netwok in the commun is good point of secur . secur is not free . in gener , common servic is free rider problem of macro econom . if young peopl commit their commun , the cost is lower . therefor , i do not support that young peopl recent do not give enough time to help their commun . i think that young peopl have to help their commun for own profit .
