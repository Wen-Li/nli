in my opinion the enjoymanet of young peopl are more than that for older peopl , becaus young peopl dont have a lot of resspons dure the youth period such as that upon older peopl which includ home loan , tax , bill . .. etc . also youth alway appear interest in parti and week end journi done by their friend , on other hand old peopl prefer stabil , comfort and money save . the youth alway like travel and chang it life routin which he assum a kill factor for hi social relat that spent a lot of time produc them . while the older peopl prefer routin and react against chang of their life style what ever it wa . accord to the long experinc of older peopl , their are more mani thing in life than enjoy , for exampl health , secur which appear meanless for the youth . those they have attend to keep in track for much more time to benefit from each second of the life . final , accord to the prement factor , older peopl have less enjoy than young peopl , and that clear from the say ( eat to live or live to eat ) which best illustr the differ between thi two kind of human be .
