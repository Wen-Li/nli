in today 's world , car are the main kind of transport use for transport on land . as the citi grow and distanc get longer , peopl need way of transport more and more in everyday life . therefor , nowaday almost everi person that can afford it over 18 and ha a lincenc own a car . if you consid the number of peopl live on thi planet , that would make quit a number . howev , on the other hand , way of public transport are develop , which reduc the necess for car . so what will happen in twenti year ? first of all , there is the fact that to get from one place to anoth , you need to have a way of transport . for most peopl , in the larg citi they live in today , it is imposs to get to work or to go shop or anywher within walk distanc . so , they need to have a car or a way of public transport . most peopl prefer have there own car and it 's easi to see whi : method of public transport are slow and unreli . you never know when the bu is go to come and it 's almost certain that you will be late to wherev you 're go . also , buse go slow and stop mani time for passeng to get on and off . metro are usual veri crowd and it is veri uncomfort to travel squeez against peopl that you do n't even know . taxi are usual veri expens . plu , if you go groceri shop , there is no way you can carri all your bag unless you have a trunk to put them into . pictur yourself in a crowd bu or metro with ten bag full of heavi fruit and veget , gallon of milk and juic , meat that is about to get spoil and ice cream that is melt all over the floor . not veri conveni , nor is it go to work . thi is an exampl of whi at least one car is needen for everi famili . howev , there is the grow problem of pollut and traffic . there are so mani car that it take you an hour to get home dure rush hour when it usual take fifteen minut . plu , when you get to work , or the mall , there is alway the problem of park . would n't it just be great to go and catch a movi or get a bite to eat in the time you use look for park space ? that is whi shop mall and work place have start to schedul servic buse which will take you directli from home to work or wherev you are go . also , there is the problem of the oil resourc run out , and put that asid , car heavili pollut the air . so , instead of twenti peopl go to a place in separ car , imagin how much it would reduc pollut and traffic if all twenti peopl use a bu to go there . my opinion is that the number of car will reduc in the next twenti year . govern that are awar of the pollut and traffic problem are develop method of public transport to encourag their peopl to use those method instead of car . for exampl , in the unit state , carpool lane have been arrang in big citi like lo angel which you can use onli if you have more than one passang in your car . so , in my opinion , the rise public awar of pollut , the rais in the cost for fuel for car and the develop in public transport will reduc the number of car in the futur .
