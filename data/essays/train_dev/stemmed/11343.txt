a commun need the help of everi member to be a nice and pleasant place to live in . young peopl have to particip like ani other member , have to give the same time like anyon els . i think that they do that but mayb they do not do the same thing as an adult and mayb adult do not see what they do . young peopl do thing they like to do . that can be a problem becaus , as young peopl , they accept less easili thing to do than an adult who now that he doe it for the well be of the commun . youg peopl like to do thing they like . the problem is that adult often think that what young peopl are do is less import than what they are do . so for exampl , when there is a parti to oragnis in the commun , young peopl will be happi to organis it , but as it it less seriou than someth than adult can do , it is not consid like it ha to be consid . young peopl have not the same vision of a commun like adult . time are chang and adult- idea of a commun is not the same as a young people- idea of a commun . young peopl can show their love for their commun by write a song about it , or bye paint grafitiy on wall about it , so that is is pratic help like adult do , but in the mind of zoung peopl it is a kind of engag for thi commun . so i think that youg peopl do thing and give enough time for their commun but in a differ way than adult , but i do not think that what the adult do are more import than what young peopl do .
