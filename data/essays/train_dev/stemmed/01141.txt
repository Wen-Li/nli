i disagre with stateman that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun becous the young spend mani of hi or her time to help the person that have some disabl and also help the older peopl , for thi reason the statement is wrong . an exampl is if a young have a grandpar such as grandfath or grandmoth when he help them he make an help for the commun becous they spend a time to help an older person to buy food , water , medicin and other and ha also spend time to speack with them that in some case is more import than when a person go to them onli for take a list of what they necess . thi is the same aspect that there is when a young help a person with disabl becous the true problem is n't hi inabl to do someth but is the necess to speack and play with other person same to him or her and thi person is the young . i know a lot of young peopl that over the time that he spend for him also spend a littl or a larg of the time that remain to him to help thi person and thi is veri import for the commun and the peopl that do thi .
