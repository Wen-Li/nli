in the era of high technolog that enabl us to tranport longer distanc easili use car and ther mean of transport , we have receiv the consider benefit in our daili life as well as the busi activ . howev , the advers effect of use car have brought more seriou problem than the human be ever face , that is , the environment problem . in my opinion , there will be fewer car in use in twenti year due to our effort to reduc car and invent the altern transport system that is less harm to the environ that we live in . the reason whi i think thi are as follow . first , we are awar of urgent invent altern transport system other than car . in fact , the big automobil compani are now make effort to make car which do not depend on use petroleum to get energi to move . for exampl , they are now reseach of the effect of use electr , water , and other possibl mean that are not harm to the environ . these effort will contribut to our way of life in which we do not depend on use car . secondli , due to the social movement to protect the environ , the govern of a lot of nation are now tri to reduc the emmis of the co2 in the air . becaus car are the main produc od co2 and other harm chemic compon , the govern from all over the world have made treati which bind their use of co2 . although we need to pay attentino to the desir of the develop countri to enhanc their economi , we have to propos differ way of boost ecomnomi other than depend on use automobil as their primari mean of transport . if all these effort gain the result success , we can realiz the societi in which we can live in hramoni with the environ as well as maintain the sustain develop of the economi . and i think thi futur outlin is feasibl . therefor , in twnti year or so , we will be live in a world where fewer car are use as a result of reduc the use of car which were harm to the environ .
