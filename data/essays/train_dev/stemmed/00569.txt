basic , i disagre the idea that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today . for starter , there ha been a countin increas in demand for car sinc car wa invent . becaus it is a veri simpl and effect mean to transport someth or to move from place to place . and second , car have been evolv so fast . manufactur of the car ha been consid as a veri lucr busi that mani copor are spend enorm amount of money on develop , manufatur and launch the state-of-the-ar car equip with new featur . by do that , they are make more consum want their car and keep peopl to spend thier money on car . and thi busi is go to stay lucr for a long time . becaus like countri in korea , goven is also invest a lot of money on car manufatur like hyundai sinc it wa one of the busi that ha great effect on korean economi . plu , as popul increas and as they get more affluent , they want nicer car . for some peopl , it is a mean of show off thier wealth . they like to drive expens car and enjoy the attent on them . and it will probabl countinu to be like that for a long time . but there 's still a question ; `` how about fuel ? '' gasolin may disappear in the near futur and we 're run out of fossil fuel . but altern energi sourc will be invent also in the near futur like hydrogen or solar energi , which is free from pollut . it is not the kind of thing will be chang in twenti year .
