some peopl think that have board knowledg of mani subject is better than have knowledg in one specifi subject . but i disagre with it . as i think specil in one subject is better than have board knowledg about mani academig subject . firstli , have specil in one subject , the person can have good hold on the subject . the person will have the detail of the minor topic of the subject . it will prove to be help from hi job perspect . he can be abl to perform hi job veri well without anyon 's help . he will be abl to solv ani kind of problem . thu prove to be more success in hi career . thi may not be possibl if the person had not done special in one subject . for exampl , the person may put hi creativ and develop more intrest thing as he ha more knowledg on the subject . secondli , the person can have full confid on what he is speak . he can also help other in that subject . he can attempt to carri out some research in that perticular subject , provid more inform about the subject and also gain more inform about the subject . thi way he can not onli improv hi knowledg int subject but also help other improv their knowledg by carri out the research . for exampl , by put in hi knowledg on the subject he can develop new and revic theoriea that would prove to be help to other who use it later on . by have board knowledg of mani subject , the person may not be abl to achiev the height of the success that he could by have special in one subject . that would be so , becaus he would have minimum inform about everi subject , and that he can not go deep into ani subject . thu limit hi creativ . thu i disagre with the statement which say 's `` it is better to have board knowledg of mani acadim subject than to specialis in one specif subject .
