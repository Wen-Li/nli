some peopl say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . howev i do not agre with thi idea . thi is becaus there is mani peopl who is in differ situatuion in thi univers . which are the nation , gender , and wheher they are rich or poor . so i think how peopl enjoy their life is depend on their situat . in japan , most of the peopl who are teanag oe to school . they enjoy their school life and have fun with their friend . by look at thi stuation , it seem to be that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . the young peopl have more enegi than the old peopl . howev in some countri , there are peopl who fight in the war even though they are still teenag . they have to fight even though they do not want to . they have to fight to surviv . in africa , there are mani peopl who die of hunger , which includ the teanag . even in japan , there is lot of teenag who can not go to school becaus of the sick or their parent do not have enough money to send their children to shcool . so how peopl enjoy life is realli depend on their situat . for old peopl , they do not have much energi than the young peopl . howev they can enjoy their life by find fun thing . my grandmoth and grandfath realli like to go travel . they go to lot of place in japan , kyoto , kobe , hokkaido and so on . they do not have much energi so they alway go travel by tour by bu . so they do not have to walk as much as they go by train or airplain . they said that they enjoy life , even though they got old . so enjoy life is depend on the situat and who they are . the characterist of peopl also affect how they enjoy their life . if a person is have a problem , howev if that person think posit , then they would not think that they are unhappi that much . i do not agre with the idea that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , becaus i think how they enjoy life is depend on them , so the age doe not matter .
