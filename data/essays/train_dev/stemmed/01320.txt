it is interest to travel and to know about cultur of other countri . when i travel , i usual travel with a tour guid . i becom more pleas after i go travel in a group than travel freeli . i strongli believ that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid becaus , i can get knowledg and i can spend travel money more effect . to begin , i can get knowledg . one of tour guid ' work is to help peopl to understand the cultur of the other countri . also they need to make sure that they show the cultur and some tourist give opportun to travel to experi the cultur . to illustr , i went to hongkong last week and it wa veri nice . the tourist show us the cultur of hongkong and not onli that , we could also eat food of hongkong and went to place where hongkong peopl usual go in daili life . he also talk about the histori of hongkong that we could understand the cultur easili and i becam to have interest . therefor , with tour guid , travel can know about the countri more deepli . moreov , i can use the money that is spent on travel more effect . some peopl travel to get out of daili work and to get rid of their stress . they think they need to relax dure travel but they need money to travel so i think it is not cost effect . for instanc , when i went to cambodia , i did n't go there with a tour guid so i did n't know where to go . so i just spent my time have rest in my hotel room which wa wast my time and money . even though i could have a rest at home , i chose to spend money and had a rest in other counti which wa not a good choic to make . thu , i can save money . to wrap up , i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . first of all , i can get knowledg and learn deepli about other countri . also , i can use money that is spent more effect .
