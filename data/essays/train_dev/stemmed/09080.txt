i think peopl usual buy product becaus of attract advertis . but most product are wors than sampl on the advertis . therefor , i agre with the topic -- most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . first of all , saler alway tell custom how great the product are . they can make a magic stori to show how product work . for exampl , one time i went to a cusmet store , and the clerk told me their product wa good , it could make my skin better . after i use it for a week , i did n't think so . it wa not use , and it wa veri expens . i wa realli angri about that . second , advertis compani know how to design the product and advertis to attract peopl . in addit , they know how to persud the custom and make mani program , such as buy one get one , or coupon . for instanc , those program usual attract women and teenag . but they alway regret after they bought those product . third , advertis compani usual make a survey to understand what kind of product will be popular . and they tri to make a perfect product in a reason price on the advertis . when custom see the advertis , or hear from their friend or co-work , they will rush to buy without think . in my opinion , i usual think twice befor i buy someth . it is necessari to consid about that . as i have mani experi , i do n't want to wast money on those unus thing anymor . now , if i realli want to buy someth , i alway ask my friend or look up inform on the internet . saler just want to earn money , they can tell you all advantag of their product , and after you bought it , you will find out how terribl it is . therefor , i support the idea -- most product seem better on the advertis than they realli are .
