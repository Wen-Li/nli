in my opinion both type , the understand of idea and concept and the learn of fact , are import . one reason is , that student who just learn the fact of cours have a great data bank but it 's just learn by heart , they do n't see ani connect . to see those connect the student have to take a look at the idea and concept of what they learn . anoth reason is that student , which just learn by heart everyth , are not as abl to make a decis as student who see more than just the fact . for exampl , a histori class talk about an import happen in their countri 's histori . on the one hand they have to know the date and whi someth ha happen , without thi it is imposs to talk about the reason and the consequ , but on the other hand it is need that the student understand the idea which lead to thi happen . onli with thi both kind of studi combin it is possibl to have a product discuss and a succes educ . final i disagre with the statement , becaus i think that it 's not possibl to choos between one of the kind of studi . the student need both to get the best out of their educ and so it 's import to use both type for studi .
