i agre with thi statement becaus the most advertis even do n't show the product alon and discuss onli thi . advertis are just made to attract peopl and to turn them into a possibl custom . they are made powerful , colourful and sexi . they show the product but often they do n't even discuss the predict of it . in the past i had such an experi . i wa blind by the advertis and bought the shoe . but after around two week they were broken . these shoe were not so stabl and even not such comfort like it wa said . i just use them for walk and run . but they alreadi were walk shoe and well i did n't run through a nightmar . so these shoe were obivisiu not that what they had to be . i wa trueli blind by advertis . but now i know how to handl it . you have to be careful with everyth you want to buy . you have to compar the price and even you must have a look on the product . you do n't need a eye of an eagl . i just mean that you should look at the product befor you buy it . you shall look if it is ok . well i have to addmit that i like advertis becaus without it , it would be realli bore . but it is not fair if the product ca n't reflect what the advertis is say . i think if you are the produc of an adveris and you know that thi product will be shown much better than it is in thi advertis then thi product is made for a judg . you ca n't sell someth and know it is not that what you will present . thi act is similar to cheat and you have pay for it .
