from my point of view , human life is so complex that the onli way to learn valuabl aspect is by tri event that we had never tri befor . for instanc , an engin may be a geniu in develop complic mobil phone servic , but these servic may not appeal to most of the peopl . so what he or she should do is concentr on complet differ subject such as peopl 's need and habit . probabl , he or she ha never studi anyth relat to thi , but the onli way to obtain success is by tri . let 's see anoth exampl . if we work for microsoft and we would simpli expect to earn money for the current version of window , other compani may creat a powerful oper system that would gradual substitut window . that 's whi we would have to invest an enorm amount of money on a new oper system . if we do n't do it well the compani will eventu disappear but if we do n't do anyth it 's much more like to disappear . nowaday there is much more competit than what it use to be . obvious , these measur are alway taken after mani hour of debat and requier the support of mani worker . but the point is that if we do not convinc ourselv that we have to innov , then other peopl will innov for us and they will be success but not us .
