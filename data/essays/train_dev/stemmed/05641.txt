i strongli opin with the statement that it is best to travel in a group led by a tour guid . if you visit a new place , it is alway better to consult a guid sinc we will be ignor about the histor inform . there are lot of benefit when you have a travel guid around . the guid will have vast amount of inform regard the place . for exampl , they could give you histor signific of the place or ani other import reason for the fame of a particular place . it would be of no point in visit place when you are complet unawar of it signific . and also , the guid will have vast knowledg about the place around so that we will not miss ani of them and repent later . it is also convini to interact with peopl when guid are around . there could be huge linguist differ and also cultur differ . also , there are all possibl of get cheat by peopl when you are a foreign . usuaulli , the guid are multilingu and henc there are no chanc of get cheat . in india , a south asian countri , there are mani histor place famou for it magnifici architectur . there are stori depict their significan . it would be of no point if we look at the work without ani knowledg about it . it would mere be a piec of work . but instead if we know the stori behind it signific , we will be in a posit to appreci the work . i could give a good exampl to support thi point . one of my friend had been to a histor place in india . when she return , she told me her experi and the work she saw . she did not feel anyth special about it . i then , explain the signific of the place . it wa then she realli appreci it and felt that she should have known it then . she then appreci the cultur and did further research on the topic and the cultur . henc , i feel that it is alway better to have suffici knowledg while visit ani place .
