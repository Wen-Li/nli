even though there can be good argument found against the statement that success peopl tri new thing rather than stay at the point where they are i 'm of the opinion that thi statement is true . to underlin my thought follow reason are given : first , if somebodi is veri succes it is usual also veri self-confid . so if there is someth new a success person will not say : `` i am unabl to manag thi new task '' . it will be rather the other way round : `` i have manag everyth to my satisfact , of cours i will also manag thi new task '' . the risk will not be seen at first glanc . so a success person trust in it abliti to suc . in the past everyth turn out to be right ; so it will also do in the futur . a failur is not to be seen as a neg experi . a failur is a possibl to do it better the next time . there is no fear to lose bo do the new riski thing . the second reason in my opinion is that a succes person would get bore continu do the same all the time . thi person need new challeng to deal with . let 's take an exampl from the field of sport . a good tennisplay doe n't want to compet with person play the same level . the player ha to improv and learn new techniqu to be abl to compet also with person of a higher stage . it 's the same in the busi field . whi stay be assign alreadi done for mani time ? a new challeng is need . new thing have to be discuss , tri even invent . otherwis there can be no step forward seen . the success person need to feel the success again . after have been success in one field somebodi doe n't recognis the success anymor . sucess is someth usual . so the feel of have success ha to be found in a new way . thi is especi the new risk which ha to be taken . in conclus , in my point of view success peopl do n't have ani fear by tri new thing . they even need to risk someth new otherwis they would get bore after some time do the same .
