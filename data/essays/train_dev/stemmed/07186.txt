i do not agre nor disagre with the statement . i strongli believ there are advantag as well as disadvantag in all phase of life , in youth as in old age . it is gener agre that young peopl have strong physic qualiti , more energi , and a wide rang of opportun potenti avail to them : their life is n't written yet . at the same time , older peopl are weaker , need medic attent with higher probabl , and do not have mani of the choic young peopl have : becaus , as you grow older , it becom too late to seiz an increas number of opportun , and more door are close , so to speak ( in particular career-wis ) . for exampl , if a young woman pursu a career in act and attend theatr class , is struck all of a sudden by a revel and decid her true vocat is in marin biolog , she simpli quit theater studi and enrol into scienc school . chang your mind like that would not be possibl when you 're like , say , 40 year old : no matter how hard you work , the competit will probabl have been into your field for 10 or more year than you have , and that kind of gap is practic imposs to fill . so , if you 're 40 year old and you 've been , say , a theatr actress , you 're probabl bound to stay that ; or at least , you do n't have all the opportun you 'd have had , had you chang your mind at a younger age : in short , i guess we can safe say that get old reduc the opportun of success chang your career field . howev , there are clear advantag that go with older age , such as secur , reduc uncertainti about the futur , the comfort of reli on a famili of your own , and that feel of safeti that have a steadi job give you : all thi is more like to happen as age increas . it is wise though not to gener too much : in those countri where the job market doe not present high level of protect , job-secur might be low for the old as well as for the young ; and when divorc is a popular behavior , your dream of a happi famili can be easili shatter and turn into a nightmar .
