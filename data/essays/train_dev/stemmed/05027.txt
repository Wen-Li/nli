the point at issu is to discuss wheather or not it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specef subject . so the question is , if it is prefer to have a broad common knowledg in order to be prepar for a wide varieti of issu or to have special knowledg in a certain field . i disagre with that statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than of one specif subject . i disagre , becaus i think it is essenti to figur out where someon is especi talent and then to support thi qualiti . i think it is import to focu on a specef subject and the knowledg which is connect to it . most peopl have some common knowledg about sever topic but onli a few have a deeper understand of a broad spectrum . as i mention in the begin i think it is better to focu on a specif subject and tri to improv in thi area . peopl are talent and advanc in differ field of life and so it is import to improv where one is good at , rather than tri to develop skill that someon els might have by natur . for exampl , when someon is veri skill in mathmat i might be good for him to special thi object , rather to tri to improv in a field that differ complet . in conclus i would say , that it is good to have broad knowledeg in gener , but for academ reason i think it is import to be awar of specif deep understand in one subject .
