i 'm agre with the statement abov , becaus usual the compani want to have more costum and they start the public for thi . they just show in commerci the best thing of their product , but they do n't give the costum all the true . for exampl if you go to a fast food restaur , they have meal cheaper than meal that you can find in other kind of restaur . it 's true it 's cheap meal , but also is small , and it can affect the health of the costum , becaus it nutrit fact will can damag the regular system of the bodi in the futur . in other hand , if you go to the cloth store , obvious you want to see the best and the cheapest dress that they have , but the problem is , in some case , that they do n't have your size , the cloth there is just for thin women and you ca n't wear it . they just show the price and how beauti is the dress but they do n't say that the clote in thi store is just for `` unreal women '' . i think that the owner of thi type of compani are also costum , and for thi , they have to think like that . if they want more costum , more sale , so more money , they have to know exactli what the `` real peopl '' need to wear , to eat , or just to live healthi . i come from anoth countri and the first time when i realiz the way of i 'll have to live my life here , i thought `` i 'm go to have mani problem '' , becaus in my countri the life is slower than here , and we have time to think about ourselv . we have some more time to cook , to have a good time with our friend , but we also are more lazi than american peopl and just think about the parti time . i think becaus american peopl do n't have enough time for cook or do differ thing , they make everyth easiest for everyon , and is whi they just show the best of their product with do n't care about the thing that can caus a damag ( the fri meal ) to the costum .
