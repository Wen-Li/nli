noweday , competit between compani is feirc , everi one need do hi best in order to sell hi product and surviv in the market . and advertis is a veri effici techniqu to sell and be success . i total agre that most advertis make the product look much better than they realli are , everyth look so wonder on tv or on a magazin . new technolog are appli to make peopl and celeb so perfect , bottl of product look bigger and to easi to use and to open . .. as a result , advertiss are have a big and neg influenc on peopl 's life , it is just and endless process of a `` must have '' . we alway find thing that we do n't realli need , but we buy it anyway just becaus we saw it on tv last night ! and we end up bu spend hundr of dollar becaus we thought it wa somth that we ca n't live without . aaother neg thing that influenc adult as well as teenag is use celebr to promot a certain product . everyon becom obsest and ha to have thi product . for instanc , product for wrinkl or acn . just becaus it work for a calabr doe n't mean that it would work for you , everyon 's skin and hair is differ . anoth exampl is the cloth . most of celebr and model are thin and tall , and everyon ha a differ bodi shape , so , if those cloth look good on the model it doe n't mean that they would fit you . and the worst thing of all in teenag watch those commeci , they can starv themselv or be anorexiqu in order to look like someth irealistic , those photo shown in magazin are fake most of the time , they can make you look taller or thiner . in conclus , i beleiv that advertis are not real most of the time , and the produc exager and make thing look so much better than what they realli are , but compani that never keep their promess will cost them a lot becaus they will lose the costum 's trust and will have a bad reput . advertis can be effici and work for the compagni and make it popular and effici if the thing shown are real and not just lie and exager .
