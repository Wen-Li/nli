ye , i do agre with the quot statement . i think success is connect to new thing and risk . as an exampl you can regard the open a new busi . if you want to found a compani or a new busi , you have to take sever risk . first of all you do not know whether your potenti custom will like or accept your offer product or serivc . but you have to invest captial in order to be abl to offer your good . of cours there is the risk of lose thi invest money , if your articl are not request on the market . on the other hand , it may lead to success and it will pay off serval time . anoth aspect is the innov of your busi . you must be better than your compeditor to be succes . new product by invent or imporv are a must to surviv on the market . a favour price and qualiti is also a strategi to reach your target of success . a succes compani lay it focu on innov . as a matter of fact you must offer someth , that your compeditor are not abl to . thi can be a new product . but not onli from the perspect of a compani but also as a succes employe you must provid your target group , who ever that is , with someth new that other can not offer . as i have mention befor , thi take work and invest befor , which may not be paid off directli . but that is the risk of success . a too high degre of secur doe not permitt competit . i think competit will lead to the highest degre of perform in total . i can understand whi peopl fear take thi risk becaus they depend on a direct incom , but you should alway tri to experi new thing and tri new method . the first one with somth fresh and new ha a small number of compeditor and low competit . if it is request what you are offer , it will lead you to success .
