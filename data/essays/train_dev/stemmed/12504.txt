i agre to the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i will explain the reason whi . first , the purpos of advertis is to make peopl buy or consum those product . to accomplish thi purpos , the weak of the product should be hide and the strength of them must be emphas . for exampl , in an tv advertis for a medicin use for impot , the peopl make that advertis tri to persuad peopl with impot by use differ stimul such as visual signal and sound . when i watch it , i think i should tri some day even i do n't have that problem . they comment some side effect at the end of the advertis in veri fast speed and use ambigu word such as `` may '' , `` some '' , `` rare '' or `` most '' . second , through advertis , the qualti of the product will be exagger becaus the produc of the product tri to beat their competitor . let 's think about the competit between coca cola and pepsi cola . they use differ advertis strategi to beat their competitor . they add nice-smel cherri flavor to attract the peopl like sweet tast . they develop a low calori cola name `` diet coke '' or `` diet pepsi '' even these product do not contribut reduc weight . in conclus , i agre to the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
