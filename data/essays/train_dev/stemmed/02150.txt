it is arguabl that which is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ field or to have specif knowledg of one subject deepli . i agre that it is better to have broad area of mani academ subject . in my case , i am studi intern studi . intern studi contain mani area such as intern polit , intern law , diplomaci , intern polit economi , peacekeep , secur , intern organ like the unit nation and foreign polici of mani countri . i should know these all of area , even i can not know deepli . meanwhil some peopl believ that it is better to have specif knowledg in one subject insist know deepli in one subject is more import than know broadli , becaus if someon need to master one area of studi , he/sh should have background and histori of thi subject first , then start to absorb all chapter of thi specif subject . in that someon can be said he/sh is master of thi subject . howev , even peopl who believ that it is better to special in one specif suject , they should studi outsid area of their subject to need to understand their own subject easili . moreov , the knowledg becom clear after touch broad area . sometim one or more theori can not be understood at onc with these own theori . those must be dealt with other theori from differ field . basic , the most of studi are connect in similar area , so it can not be consid and understood seper . for instanc , interior design , it is connect with art and architectur . if interior design doe not awar the base of them subject , he/sh can do his/her work . it mean that design should know about the color and structur of build to achiev his/her work . to sum up , it is better to have wide knowledg of mani academ subject than specif knowledg , even it need more deepen understand sometim .
