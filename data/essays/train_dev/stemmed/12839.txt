there are sever reason for peopl to take a trip . depend on each person 's person , some peopl prefer to take a trip alon while the other prefer to travel in a group that is led by a tour guid . thi is controversi subject to dicuss about , howev ; in my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . the first reason is that , peopl do not need to worri about thier safeti as they do when they travel alon . tour guid know well about the area that they are travel . as a result , they offer tourist who are in the group , a safe hotel to stay in and clean restaur to eat . in addit , guid give sever practic advic to help peopl stay out of problem . for exmapl , in some area , it is extrem danger to travel alon without ani knowledg , such as new york where all kind of crime are happen . therefor , within a group led by a guid , tourist aviod some potenti danger . the second , peopl get explan of histor place that they visit . if peopl are travel alon , they need to purchas a guid book and struggl through it to find exact inform that they want . or sometim , if they can not find , they may ask to other peopl who live in that area . howev , thi is not like go to happen becaus the tourist would feel embarras from lack of knowledeg . as a result , travel with guid is conveni . the last , peopl save moeni and time . as travel with in a group , there is limit time to visit some place . thi mean that they are go to visit import plaec . plu , place that are worth to visit . thi help them to save time and prevent them from wonder which place to visit first . moreov , when peopl travel alon , they lose direct often , becaus they are new to that place . they need to spend addit money for stay in hotel if they get lost and it is dark outsid . consequ , travel in group led by a tour guid is more effici choic for peopl , sinc they are less expos to ani sort of crime . addit , peopl get abud explan from guid and save thier money and time .
