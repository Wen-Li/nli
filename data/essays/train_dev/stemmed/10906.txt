young peopl often believ that they have the possibl to enjoy their life more than other can and that the qualiti of their current life is much higher than it would be when they will be much older . my opinion is total differ . the degre of enjoy your life belong to your mental of manag your life . that mean to manag the good and the bad thing that can happen to you in life . when peopl are young they know that they have know more opportun than a child have . they are discov mani new and excit event . and when they attempt to imagin how they can manag all these wonder thing in the age of fifti or sixti , their assumpt is that everyth would be more bore , becaus there is noth new to discov for you . to illustr that argument imagin your first time in the cinema . it will never be the same again , even if there will be produc thousend of new film everi year . but when i take a look at me . i see that go to the cinema is as interest as is wa the first time . the point is that now my emphasi is put on the new film and no longer on the cinema itself . anoth strong argument for have a better life as young peopl is that your bodi is stronger than it will be in a higher age . thu younger peopl can make variou activ such as sport or adventur trip . my persuas is that when you becom older your bodi loos some skill not from one to anoth day . thi is a process of mani year and you have time to learn to handl thi . as your bodi is becom older your interest will chang . while younger peopl often like sport older peopl enjoy sport like fish or go into the opera etc . to conclud the previou argument i would like to express my disagr with the present phrase . it is up to yourself to feel good in higher age and to enjoy life . if you would ask older peopl how they think about the life of today younger gener they would probabl not feel well of imagin theirself in thi situat .
