i think there will not be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year . there is two reason like below . at first , the present popul in the world is six billion , and it never stop to increas , and it is said the world popul is grow with much more high speed . so it is certain that the demand of car also increas with the increas of the popul . second , i think it is difficult that we invent a brand new vehicl that is more convini than car in twenti year . we have alreadi had anoth transport system like plane , ship , bicycl , but they are use with differ need , and they are not use as a altern of car .
