i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , becaus idea and concept are the root of the fact , it is the idea that make the fact to exist and undestand idea will help the student to be product . first of all , in order to reli on some fact there must be gener some idea and concept . that is , all fact depend on some idea and understand of these idea caus the occur of fact . moreov , to learn the fact we have to understand the thought behind the fact . just learn fact will caus the student not to gener new issu and thi will caus the number of research in the school to drop and soon there exist a gener that is not produc anyth but alway live with the one in the hand . in addit , it is onli possibl to develop fact in the light of idea and concept . there are fact that is suppos not to chang forev like the fact of physic . there are law of physic and they are suppos not to chang . howev , there is one point that these fact and law replac the old one . therefor learn a fact is not big deal but understand the idea will develop the sociti . as a final point , learn fact will just caus student to memor the fact . howev , if they understand the idea behind the fact , they will undestand the topic better . moreov , there mayb some student that handl these topic think about them and make some suggest about them that can be fact in the futur . in conclus , encourag student to understand the idea will improv the research and will caus the student to be open mind . besid , the student that are tri to see and understand further will contribut to the develop of the societi .
