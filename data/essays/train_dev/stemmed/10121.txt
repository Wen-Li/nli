in my opinion in order to have a better understand of idea , concept must be support by fact . first of all it is imposs to understand an idea without a complet evalu of the fact that are the base structur of the concept . if you understand an idea without know the fact behind it , then you are onli learn a `` dogma '' . an exampl of dogmat understand is the religi one that ignor fact , becaus is not look for a deep understand of thing but onli to a solut that will bring to it answer . thi is whi in religi learn , fact are gener avoid : they do prefer interpret . second of all , to understand someth you need to start learn the fact in order to start a critic analisi . the onli way to start thi process of understand is start from the knowledg of fact . in order to understand an idea you must know what wa the historyc situat in which thi idea wa creat . i 'll make an exampl in order to make my opinion clearer : you ca n't understand the basic idea of comun or nazism without know the historyc situat and dynam that brought to these differ polit , social and econom totalitar . at last , i would say that you do n't realli understand anyth if you ca n't prove it and explain it with fact . is with an empir analisi of fact that you can prove what you have understood and whi you believ so . everi scientist need an experi to clear hi point , otherwis he will seem not credibl and hi idea not effect . these are the three reason whi i believ that there is a strong link and connect between understand an idea and learn the fact relat to the concept .
