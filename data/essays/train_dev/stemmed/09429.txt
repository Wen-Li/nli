while there is a common accept idea that travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best way of make a travel , i am not satisfi by thi form of my tour base on my own experi and knowledg . first of all , travel in a group mean you should adapt yourself to the other in the same group . unfortu , it is not a rare phenomenom that peopl can not adjust himself or herself to anoth person 's habit . a apt evid to illustr thi is my person exiperi when i had my trip to yangzi river with a group . i wa total scare and disrupt by a man in the same group for he alway made horabl sound while sleep . and the habit is not the whole stori , anoth thing is you have to adjust your own schedul accord to the time tabl share among the team , which mean you have littl control of your time . moreov , travel with the guid may suffer the risk of the incomp of the guid . mani guid are just graduat from school and lack of adequ experi in order to be a compat guid in a group . these greenhand might make peccadilo , flaw or even sever error dure their administr of the whole group . a recent studi conduct by cnate ( chines nation associ of travel enterpris ) show that about 27 percent of guid are recruit . although the pecentag seem not high , the possibl still exist , and onc it happen , it will surli serv as a joy-kil . at last , travel with a group mean the loss of privaci . it is hard to imagin how the privaci can be kept if i have to travel with a group for the whole tour . admittedli , travel in a group togeth with a tour guid still ha it own merit . for exampl , you can enjoy the trip without mani consider such a schedual , fare , to name a few . that is whi there are mani peopl have there prefer on thi kind of travel . howev , i am still inclin to individu travel . and i am still treasur a unshak belief that true satisfact of travel can be onli found in travel alon .
