it is often said that advertis deceiv pepol and creat need . on one hand , i am go to see in what extent the advertis is abl to influenc us in our daili life ; then i will studi how is it possibl not to be deceiv by thi artifici world . on one hand , it is true that the main role of the advertis is to creat an ideal world where everyth seem to be perferct . the purops of advertis is to improv sell of a certain firm . that is to say , when you see a beauti woman on a billboard who seem to be so happi , you want to buy thi make up to be beauti and happi too . but when you buy it , you realiz that your life ha not chang at all . in fact in our societi of consumpt , advertis ha becom a great way to influenc peopl by show them an ideal univers . in fact , most advertis do not realli sell product but they sell dream . the real purpos of most advertis is to sell and not to reflect the realityof the product . on the other hand , i think that the advertis is not onli a good way to increas sell but it is a kind of creativ . if the advertis is abl to have such a great influenc on peopl , it is becaus there is a real reflexion behind it . you alway have poster with skin women , beauti landscap , and veri effici phrase . they are creat to make you dream . and veri often it work becaus in our modern societi , consumpt is veri import . moreov , i think that is to easi to say that advertis deceiv you becaus you have to be abl to see where is the fronteer between the fiction and the real . that is to say , peopl should develop their critic spirit by read , listen and watch the tv to creat their own opinion . in that case , my point is that parent play a great role in their children educ and they have to teach us what is true and what is not . to conclud , i have to admitt that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are but it is import to emphas that it is also their first purops .
