there might be a group of peopl who do not work for their commun as well as there are peopl who work hard and show great effort to improv their commun . i agre with the fact that there are more peopl work hard for their commun than who do not care for them . firstli , peopl who have the right moral attitud and behaviour should be awar of the envoir they live in . and they should alway tri to develop it for the better . i assum that our world have enough consciou peopl to do so . therefor peopl may be abl to leav a liveabl world to their children and the other who come after them . howev , they might be veri busi with their career and their live , improv our envoir and develop it must includ one of their goal . have a good life should not be the onli thing they care for or reli on . likewis they wo n't have better enough live in an uncar commun . they ca n't live without care for one anoth . there are peopl that suffer from hungar and the war that damag their home . i see on tv that a great number of peopl are work to make the condit better . they tri to find them place to live , adopt the children who have anybodi left and fund for their loss . even for the peopl who do not take action at all , there are campaign avaibl everywher . it is the easiest way for them who do not stand up from their chair they sit and at the same time they would still be help . to sum up , if peopl consid the fact that thi world is not onli ourselv but everyon 's who live in it , they will probabl be more help for their commun and tri to chang it for the better .
