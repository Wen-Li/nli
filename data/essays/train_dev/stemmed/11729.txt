transport and crowd there is a huge number of car and truk nowday . big number of thim are for transport . is that huge number go to be reduc or increas in futur ? that is veri import quistion to ask ourselv and think deepli on thi import issu . my own opinion is the number of car are go to increas repidli . there are alot of way to go and back in or out citi becaus there are more and more way of transport are discoverd . car are the first modern kind of way we use for long time . now , we have anoth use transport as train , buse and taxi . for exampl , we dont have these other kind of transport in saudi arabia , and we are suffur from the crowd evri singl day . other factor help in decreas number of car use evri day is car price . it is increas day than the other . it could cost you an arm and leg to buy a car these day . car maker are chaling each other not onli in the qualiti , but also in the price . also oil price are increas and not steadi . it is cheaper to go by train evri day to your work than take your own car . anoth aspict on oil is that it may vanish some day sudinli with out wrning . that would caus a disast . w
