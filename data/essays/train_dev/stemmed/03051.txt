i consid that as a human be , we are constantli make chang in our life , but gener we look for the thing we know , becaus we like to be sure and confort . i agre with the statement , becaus if you find out the stori of the peopl who ha suce in their life , they have done someth differ , and they took the risk of do it . usual the path they have walk is realli hard , they do not give up , they learn how to deal with the difficulti . i consid that their best caracterist is that they are selfconfid , but after all that at the end they saw the result . all the thing we do not know , allway give us scare , becaus the consequ are unkown , but in thi world what we need is more enterpreun , peopl who can start a busi , who can improv the social respons , who do not need other to make decis . on the other hand , peopl who ha onli do what they know how to do well , do not let themselv tri other opportun and of cours when you do thing that you have never done befor you learn , you know more peopl and thi peopl can teach you to be a better person . i think that it is import to take risk , becaus it improv your knowledg about differ area like the proffesion area , the sentiment area , the health area . and it also improv your relashionship with the enviro . life is a group of differ area , concentr in one person , who ha the freedom to take risk or no .
