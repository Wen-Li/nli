that is evid , life is not live in the same way when we are children or young adult and adult or age person . in my opinion , young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , and particularli veri young peopl like children . i do not mean that be old is bore , but i think it is more excit to be young . it recal me a french proverb that said `` we are not everi day twenti year '' . first of all , it is a fact , children and teenag are more insouci than adult and elder peopl . they do not matter about ani problem adult have oftent . their onli prioriti is to go to school . that leav plenti of time to enjoy life . by the way , young peopl have a lot of thing to discov . special children who do not have ani experi of life . go to the cinema , to the zoo , to the circu , unabl children to apprehend the world he is live in . a few year later , young adult will discov new aspect of life such as sexual and human relationship . futhermor , young adult meet less problem than their parent . they are not still confront by rent a hous , pay insurr , manag to get a job , et cetera .
