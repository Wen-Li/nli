most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , i stongli support thi view . the media ha play veri import role is mislead peopl , and made peopl to believ in what is not true howev there are alway except . the media industri ha been play with peopl trust in order to sell the product of diffrent compani becaus they pay alot to make attract advertis . to verifi my point i am go to give few exampl . for instanc i bought a wash liquid after see it on the tv the product give you garantte that it will take away all the mark no matter how deep they are but after use the product i wa not satisfi . infact it wa just wast of my money and time . i have a rough estim that 8 out of 10 prodduct are not reliabl , after my past experi . alot of thing play a role in make the product so appeal , a high budget advertis even take well know celeberti to emphasi the qualiti of the product and to some extent we all believ the well known figur and we might again mislead ourselv . you may see alot of commerci on the weekend which compel you to buy the product which you realli do n't need , you just get impress by the comerci and later on after use it you realiz it doesnot benefit you as the comerci show . anoth exampl i bought a shirt from mall after see the model wear it , when i wore the shirt it noth felt or look like the model ha promis . the light , the makeup and the setup made it appear far better than the qualiti and even the look of the shirt . i do believ that there are few product from well known compani which have develop trust over time but mostli the other are all not at all satisfi and are just wast of money and time , they play with one feel . the better the advertis the better money the compani ha paid to make the advertis to the realiti itself .
