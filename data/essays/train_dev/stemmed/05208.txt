when peopl travel our own countri or the other part of the world , peopl often travel in a group and also take a tour guid with them . i agre with the idea about the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . although there could be some disadvantag about go in group . in my point of view , first of all , we need some inform about the place that we are travel . of cours we can get inform about almost averyth on the internet , but it is so hard to get a veri specif inform and it will take up so much time and can be veri stress befor travel . but if we go in a group led by a tour guid , we can share some inform with other member of the group and we can ask all the question we want to know about the place that we are travel to the tour guid at the same time when we are travel . secondli , we can spend our time veri effici through the whole travel time . becaus when we travel in a group , we can not travel without a schedul , and if we do not , it will be veri disorgan with a lot of peopl . so we have to have a specif schedul . which make us feel veri satisfi , after the whole travel . thirdli , we can get to know each other more that we did not know about befor , while travel in a group and there are econom advantag also . there could be some diadavantag about travel in a group with a tour guid . for exampl , peopl might think that they can not have their free time and feel uncomfrt about alway move in a group with a fix schedul . howev , it is better than be so stress about get inform about the place ourselv and get lost in a new place we are travel . consequ , becaus of all those reason i think the best way to travel is in a group that led by a tour guid .
