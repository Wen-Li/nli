there are differ opinion about what is best method in order to prepar student . accord to me they could be associ to the school system of two countri , itali and the unit state . some peopl sustain that it is more import for student to have a theoric prepar base on idea and concept , than a pratic prepar base on fact . a reason in favour of that opinion could be that a student ha to learn the techniqu of a job befor practis the job itself . anoth reason could be that with a theoric prepar a student will alway be abl to learn and develop by himself new concept and idea . on the contrari other peopl affirm that it 's more valuabl for a student 's career to practis activ ( such as stage , train etc ) instead of read them just theoric . in fact in mani situat student studi at school a lot of thing that seem to not be use at all when they go to work . in my opinion learn fact is the best way to prepar a student for hi futur job , especi when he is at univers . for exampl i disagre with the italian univers system that oblig student to studi book of thousand of page instead of provid them with some real work experi . i think in thi way student would forget almost half of the inform they studi just the day after they took the exam . in addit , when they will have to look for a job , farm often say they lack of experi . consequ i prefer the american univers system , where student have less to studi but they do activ that make them becom familiar with their futur job . howev i have to say that in some case theoric prepar is import , for exampl in order to provid the student with a good gener cultur ; and in thi way i think italian univers system is better than the american one . in conclus i believ that a student should have a veri good prepar base on fact ; but it would be import for him to understand idea and concept in order to improv the techniqu of hi specif job and also hi person cultur .
