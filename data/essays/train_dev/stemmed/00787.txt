i prefor to travel with a tour guid exspeci we go to some countri and also that is a first time to go there . when we go to some countri , we have to speak their languag . if we go by ourselv , we have to make a resav for hotel , and also it 's hard to read and understand the menu in a restaur . when i went to korea with my friend , we did n't join a tour . we had some guid book that show famou restaur and place in korea . when we went to a restaur , the menu wa written in hongl , not even in english . we could n't read them , so we just point out the menu when they took order . the food wa n't that we expect . we can learn more thing from a tour guid when you go to some histor place . the tour guid know so mani thing . there are some guid book to lean those histori but sometim there are not enough to us , and also the book could n't answer the question when we have some question about which we visit . we get more explain from the guid . sometim , the guid take us a local restaur or store where local peopl usual go . when i went to franc with a small group of peopl with a tour guid , the guid took us the restaur where he usual goe . the food wa cheap and realli good . and the other day , he took us to a littl town in the countly-sid of franc . it did n't show in ani guid book . there are some winari and store . we had a realli nice time in franc .
