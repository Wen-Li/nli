i dare say that i agre the statement that it is more import for student understand idea and concept than lern fact . becaus idea and concept are fundament valu . they must know these valu so that they can appli variou set . the valu help student to extend their knowledg and skill too . i am a nurs major . when i wa a practition , i focus to learn fact . in thi situat , the word `` fact '' mean some daili routin activ , such as way to clean wound or skill of check blood sampl , etc . but sinc medic technolog is improv and most of the thing are done easili with some equip , i do n't use the techniqu in these day . but we still use our knowledg to analyz the data . idea and concept last long . then , if i have unerstand the concept , i can appli the idea to the diffrent situat . if i understand the theori that cultur background affect on peopl 's behavi , i can understand how to care a forein patient . if student have enough knowledg about fundament of the area , they can appli it to other situat . it will help them to solv problem they would face . moreov , fundament knowledg help student to extend their studi . if a student wish to studi in postgradu cours , the basic knowledg of the relat theori are requir . if i lean onli daili routin in one ward of one hospit and neglect to studi the concept or idea , i could n't continu my studi for the mastral digre . therefor , i support the opinion that student should make higher prioriti to undestand idea and concept than to learn fact . they are basic valu which last long , can be appli to differ scene and can be use for brush up the level of studi for student .
