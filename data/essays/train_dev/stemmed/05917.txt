i think there are some peopl who wish to travel in a group led by a tour guid , especi abroad . but i do n't think it 's the best way to do . i disagre with the statement ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid ' . there are two import point about thi statement --- ` travel in a group ' and ` led by a tour guid ' . first , if we travel in a group , we ca n't see thing and think in our mind quietli . that also mean we have to adjust the pace to walk or see thing to other 's . second , if we are led by a tour guid , we have to listen to hi or her guid all the time . even if some of their say is alreadi known by us , we have to put up with hear it . moreov , if we take part in a group tour , place to go are chosen beforehand and unchang in most of the case . certainli , we may feel much more secur if we travel in a group led by a tour guid . we do n't have to worri if we feel bad or get deseas compar to the situat of travel alon . and we can meet unknown peopl of tour member . also we do n't have to find a place to eat becaus it is decied from the first mostli . but despit these point , i prefer travel alon becaus we can go anywher we want if we travel by ourselv . and we can enjoy mani place --- includ some local area which is not popular --- that the tour seem not to go to . moreov , if we do n't have a tour guid around us , we have to check the inform of the destin beforehand and plan the whole process of the travel . that make us know much closer about that place , and enabl us to have a strength to deal with thing happen in unknown place . feel secur and be comfort are total differ . these are the reason that i perfer travel alon . so i disagre with the previou statement .
