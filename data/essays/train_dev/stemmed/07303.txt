definitli advertis make product seem much better , they have to , otherwis who will be will to buy product . the purpos of advertis is intend to do so . i strogli agre with the statement , espeaci for sell their product , earn profit & so on . first of all , if the compani ha to sell a new product , they have to work on how to attract consum . though the product may be not so good . for exampl , when i see an advetis on ani medic , espeati for cold i look for how it is differ from other medic & buy the medicin to tri out , then it total depend on me if i want to take it or not . secondli , buy make the advetis look better from the product will help the compani earn profit . if peopl are attract by the ad then onli they may buy the product . it will bring peopl to atleast give a tri . that will benifit the compani , but latter it all depend on how the product actual is . for instanc , i saw an ad on weight loss program , use pill make you slim & trim . i wa so attract to it that i just want to go & tri it out . i did , but when i took the medic with no diet control i lost so much weight , that wa incred . but onc i stope it i stare to gain weight . it wa profit for the compani but not work for me . not even that i gave suggest to all my other friend too . but later reales that it doe n't work . by my suggess all my friend bought the product . to conclud , all ad are made attract inord to attract consum & sell their product to earn money , but it boil down to one point that we have to decid to buy or not . your judgement is the best . everi one see thier own profit but we are at loss so be care
