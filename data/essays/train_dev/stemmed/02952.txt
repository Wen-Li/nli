i agre with the statement `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' . if you pick advertis in health care product like over the counter medic doesnt work up to the extent they advertis or print on the item itself . for exampl there are certain medic use for hair growth like minoxidil which doesnt help in hair growth as they advertis . there is onli one priscript medic for hair growth that is propecia even that will help onli up seventi five percent . there are certain homeopath medic like aerborn there is no exact theori how they work for all kind of symptom they list like cold , cough , and more . they alway advertis for certain over the counter medic they are as good as priscript drug for exampl advil , it not exactli same strenth as priscrit it lesser strenth then how can be better than a priscript medic . in the advertis they mention the advatag in big letter and disadvantag in veri small letter , which are equal import and right to know for a consum . by do such kind of thing and increas their sale compani are make lot of profit . there is anoth disadvatag of advertis it also increas the manufactur cost of the product , which eventu charg to the consum . they advertis five use of the product out of which one or two is correct . in the past two decad advertis is play a mazor role in sell new product . some advertis are realli good and the best way to know a consum about the new product in the market and their use , provid they give us right inform through advertis . my person opinion on advertis is i could onli reali upto certain extent and you have to be veri care
