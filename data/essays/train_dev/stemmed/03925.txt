i agre with the statement that most advertis make the product seem much better than they realli are . the advertis includ not onli those on tv show but also on the newspap . the perpos of these advertis is let the custom think the product are good and want to buy them . the perpos made the advertis do these . in order to let the custom think the product are worth to buy , what they need to do is to show the product is good enough and worth them to buy . the advertis ha to make the product look better than other similar product , then they have to made up thing to show the product is better than other . thi is the reason whi the product seem much better than they realli are . in china , the advertis make the product look like they were perfect are normal . there are mani similar product in china at the same time . make the product that thay sell look best is the most import thing to make their product sell well . for instanc , i bought an expens pen which it said will nerver broken under ani condit in the advertis on tv . but onli after three month that i found the pen wa broken alreadi . i found the seller to ask for return . the seller said someth that made me understand the true propos of the advertis . '' do you think there will be a pen that never break in the world ? i do n't think so . '' she said to me in a smile . '' all the advertis do these , not onli us . '' from that on , i do n't believ ani advertis anymor . there are more than one exampl can show that the advertis made product seem better than they realli are . base on my own experi that i can tell the statement is true all the time .
