refer to the statement i believ thet it 's veri complex to find the real differ between the two of them . i have some import reason to think like that . i 'm also student on the unives actual and my experi is that there are two kind of student . one that not use to go to class and tri to studi all the book dure the week befor . and second there is the student that alway goe to class and take note so that 's whi when he ha the exam he do n't need to spent so much time inm front of the book . howev , both of them use to pass the exam but use diferr way . the method of studi is as import as the way that you practic to memoric the idea or fact . from my point of view it 's more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in order to explain thi i will give an exampl . - imagin a situat with a student learn a complex theme of antropolog at univers four year ago . it 's not equal if he had studi the theme by understand the main idea instead of learn fact . be sure that he will rememb perfectli if he had undestand the idea dure that class . i believ that fact are confus accord to my experi . in concluss , the differ between learn and understand realli doe n't matter in my opinion , the import point is that with both of them the student is learn even fact or idea that he will use on the futur mayb work or teach other student . so depend on the studi it would be better oin way or the other one the thing is to choos the right one .
