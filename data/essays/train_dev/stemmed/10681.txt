i gisagre with thi statement . it is true that some young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun , but there are also some young peopl who do it . for exampl , my friend went to elderli peopl dorm to do volunt work . she talk a lot with the elderi peopl . she said to me '' elderli peopl look happi when i talk with them . oher student just went there as intership , but i think we did volunt work . we could make them happi . '' when i heard that , i felt that young peopl nowaday not all bad person . the are mani young peopl who are kind and do volunt work . anoth exampl , i had clean my citi to do volunt work to take up raddish on the road when i wa a elememtali school student and a junior high school student . other student in our citi also did such a volunt work . moreov , it doe n't mean '' give enough time to help their commun '' but i want to say thi . nowaday , i often see that young peopl give thier seat to the elderli peopl . i also often give my seat to elderli peopl . doe n't it mean we help our commun ? i also think that work veri hard , take great degre at school , keep the best score by school activ sport and write great art also mean that we help our commun . for instanc , great school which made grate student will be known other citi and thev citi will be famou . there are mani student who studi hard or plactic sport to win the play . abov all , i disagre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time help their commun .
