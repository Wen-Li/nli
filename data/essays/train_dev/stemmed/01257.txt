nowaday , there are so mani way to transport from one place to anoth . there 's the airplan , the train , the subway , the bu , the car and etc . and still , peopl are think up new idea for transport . as more and more method for get around are creat , mayb the old method , like car , will sooner or later decreas . well , it could happen . an exampl of my famili might as well give you a view of what i 'm tri to explain . one day , my famili and i were go to go downtown . after think about all situat , my parent decid to take the car and my sister and i decid to tri the subway that wa made recent . later on , my sister and i had to wait 30 minut until our parent arriv ! the subway wa way faster than the car and they had use 60,000 won to feed fuel to the car . they inde regret their decis . as you can see , scienc and technolog ha made a big effort in invent differ way of transport . in my region , dae-jeon , for exampl , recent subway have been made in order to tranport throughout the rather larg citi . mani peopl are use thi transport method and are pleas with the conveni and speed compar to the buse or car . also peopl use the subway becaus it 's more cheaper . nowaday , in my countri korea , the gasolin cost ha risen so high that have a car mean pay almost 15 , 0000 won per month . not to mention the other cost that you need to pay while maintain a car . therefor about twenti year later there will be fewer car in use than there are these day . as the era develop rapidli , peopl prefer the faster and more conveni method . and car do n't fit with these factor that well .
