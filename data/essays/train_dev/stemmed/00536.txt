i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . although travel in a group with a guid doe have advantag for peopl who are not use to travel , i think travel by individu is far more interest and challeng . here below are the reason . first of all , if you travel with a group , it is like that the travel agenc offer you onli sever choic of hotel . wherea if you book on your own , you can chose from a vast list of hotel that most suit your tast . you would probabl have to dine in larg restaur mosti for tourist becaus local food establish where they have delici food tend to lack space to host a group . anoth inconveni factor of travel with a guid is that you can not chose the site you would like to visit . usual , the guid would take you to the most popular tourist site , and not to the less famou but fascin place . you would also have limit time to spend at each site . i believ the most wonder thing about travel is that you get to meet peopl from all over the world , but if you travel in a group , you are less like to interact with other travel . i visit spain thi septemb on my own , and becam acquaint with travel from us , franc , morocco , and china on the train and at footbal stadium , and we exchang inform on the best place to visit . i still correspond with one of them .
