nowaday , in europ and north america , almost each famili own at least one car . howev , a few current issu rais the question of the number of car there will be in the next twenti year . in my opinion , there will be more car in use in twenti year than today . first of all , it is obviou that the world 's popul keep increas , which mean that more peopl are go to need a car within the next two sdecad . moreov , in import demograph region such as china or india , more and more inhabit buy a car . what 's more , one reason for which there could be fewer car in use in twenti year would be the lack of oil . nonetheless , accord to scientist thi should not happen befor the year 2050 . besid , in order to fight against the air pollut issu mainli due to the car 's traffic , scientist tri to find out solut , and work on other energi ressourc such as solar energi , or even hydrogen energi . then , if they eventu manag to creat a new type of car which would not pollut the air , drive a car would not be a problem anymor for the atmospher . henc , the number of car would be like to increas . anoth reason is that peopl tend to commun more and more , and the road network is get wider and wider . then , peopl realli enjoy travel with their own car in order to be abl to meet whoever you want wherev you want . inde , have a car provid me with a lot of autonomi . for instanc , if i intend to go from one side of the countri to anoth it is much more easier to drive my own car than to take the plane or the train , if the place i want to go is far from the airport or the train station .
