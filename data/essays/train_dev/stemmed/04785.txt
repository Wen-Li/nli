exel statement : whi ? becaus i think that thi phrase is the question that lot of us ask to oneself . for me is difficult analyz it , but i will tri to explain my idea . immagin in your mind thi : on the right hand you have young peopl , i have suppos that young could be until fouti year old , on the opposit hand you have old peopl . my idea is that for the fist part of peopl is simpler find someth to do ( in gener ) to enjoy their life than for the second part . the reason are that when you are young ( i alway suppos ) you have much energi to dicov someth new , for exampl new sport , new interest , new passion or new work to do . all these reason were use by old peopl when they were young and thi for me can be anoth reason becaus the old peopl enjoy their life less then young . if i could get in old peopl mind i think that i would start to look me around and i would think : `` i have work all life , i have studi all life and now i am pretti tire '' . with my mind is difficult think that in the futur i will spend all my time to do noth , mayb becaus i will not be abl to what i would like to do , but thi becaus i am young , becaus i want to discov new part of wolrd that i have not seen again , becaus i love sport and i think that i could not live without it , becaus i want to increas my knoledg and becaus i have to start to work . for all these reason i understand the old peopl that they cannnot what they do , i think that it wolud be difficult to organ the life when you are old . howev , i think that it is possibl , becaus i have a person exampl : my grandfath ; for him everi morn is a new day to discov .
