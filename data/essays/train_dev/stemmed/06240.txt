i agre with thi statement , becaus mainli fact that are learn without understand disappear from memori much faster than understood idea do . also if a student understand an idea he or she can alway relat other thing to that same idea that wa previous understood , wherea learn a fact without understand limit think skill . learn fact in my opinion may have a lot of neg effect on student , becaus on an exam a student will not be abl to recal what wa memor unless the inform wa understood . when student memor fact they are not stimul the logic part of their brain . not stimul half of the brain will have a neg effect on the student . if a student is take a biolog cours . in biolog , student must memor a larg amount of word , and from experi it is just easier if the student is abl to split the word into it 's combin form , with an understand of the mean of each combin form . thi way the student know what each part of the word mean , and is then abl to rememb the word , becaus the mean of the word now make sens . i strongli believ that althought it is much more import to underst idea , rather than just learn fact , it is still veri import that the idea a student understand are also memor , or encod into the memori , for him or her to be abl to recal the idea when need . in some case thing can not be understood , say for exampl if a student want to rememb the room where hi or her test will be take place ; in thi case the student must learn the room number with out understand it .
