i agre thi statment , becaus if they do noy have a risk. , they wo n't grow theriself . if they do n't grow theriself , they wo n't success . if you do just what you know now , your skill for everyth wo n't chang forev . and to challeg to other thing is to make success . i think that the success peopl took a risk . if they do n't take a risk , they do n't succse about everyth . in my case , i took a risk of luaguag . i 'm studi abroad in canada now and go to the high school same as canadian . that wa hard for me . i could not speak english veri much and wa afraid of speak to canadian and use english in front fo canadian . but i diecid myself to come here and studi english . i realiz again and i becam to tri to speak to everyon though they are canadian . final , i could make friend and got good relationship between my host famili . and to tri everyth wa chang my mind like kindli and more posit . second , in my opinion , if somenodi do n't want to take a resk and challeang anyth , they wo n't grow theriself . to grow yourself , you must do someth for you . i guess that someth includ some risk . but if you do't grow , you can not be success . bucaus , your mind is same as befor you do n't calleng anyth . in japan , i did not take a risk and challeng to anyth so i did not grow at all . but i came here i did grow a lot . bucaus i did challeng a lot and to grow myself . so i got a friend , good relationship and confid to everyth . final , i think to challeng is to make success . if you do n't challeng , you don'i have anyth even gad mark or result . you do n't get anyth and you do n't success . for these three reason , i agre thi statement ; success peopl had a risk for challeng .
