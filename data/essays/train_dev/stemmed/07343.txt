although the argument ha been made that travel with tour guid is best way to go to somewher , in my point of view , i would like to travel without tour guid and some peopl . when i go to a travel as a group , i alway have some problem about where will we go to next and whi they to begin with , without some peopl and tour guid , i may not go to some place where i would like to go and take some pictur . if i travel with some peopl and tour guid , i can go to that place and i have to follow the rout that the tour guid lead . in addtion , the tour may not provid the place where i want to go so that the tour may be wast of money . if i have a chanc to travel famou place , i want to chose place myself . second reason i should mention is that i have to take care of a lot of peopl . thi is great stress to take care of all opinion and use a lot of energi , so that i can not enjoy my travel . and also , there must be some troubl among peopl . for instanc , peopl dislik the tour that we will travel tomorrow , that peopl critic the tour guid . and also , when peopl do not arriv on the time , we may miss some event which is veri famou at place where we visit . therefor , when we travel and visit a lot of peopl , we have to have some risk as travel the tour . consid all of abov factor , i disagre thi statement that travel with group of peopl and guid tour is best way to visit somewher becaus of some risk for peopl and follow guid 's direct .
