well i strongli agre with the discuss that twenti year from now there will be fewer car in use then there are today , the veri obviou reason to support my opinon on thi subject is scarciti of fuel , which ha alreadi been recogn as the impend crisi human kind is go to face in thi centuri , now car need fuel to run , which unfortun is a non renew form of energi , howev over the year scientist have come up variou altern which are supposedli more effici and non pollut than the conventionol car which use petroleum as it fuel , howev the fact remain that petroleum is still the mostli easili avail fuel for run a car , atleast as of now . . and for ani person who is use to drive hi petroleum driven car wouldnt readili accept the chang . anoth reason for me agre with thi argument is that in the way human popul is increas , most of the major citi around the worl are overtli crowd and so are the road of these citi and time be such a import commod in today life , veri few peopl reli upon there car to reach there destin of work , colleg etc . . anoth trend which is catch up these day is car pool where in a coupl or more peopl who have a common destin point use the same car to travel which save them on fuel and also in a way contribut in reduc the traffic on the road , most of the major citi around the world have also spent a lot of money on set up a rail line between two major junction in the same citi or the adjac citi , mani peopl have start to use thi option as thi save them on time and it also veri cost effect measur although by opt for thi medium of transport they have to in a way sacrific the luxuri of start from there home as and when they want too . . but in life you loos some you win some as in here you sacrific your luxuri to have a peaceful an safe ride to your destin in a cost effect way . .
