car transport are veri import in peopl 's life . they provid easi way for peopl to travel from one place to anoth . there are mani automobil and in my opinion , i guess car are the most import automobil . car are veri import in one 's life for mani reason . first , they are easi to use , everyon can use them . second , they are not expens , mayb some of them but if one want to buy a car for a certain purpos , for exampl to go from one place to anoth , he/sh can buy a small car accord to hi budget . third , car are design , nowaday , in mani shape and for mani occas , so anyon can find a car that is suitabl for a certain purpos . for exampl , if one want to go to a place that is a littl bit far from hi home and he/sh need to spend the night drive , he/sh can buy the car that is suitabl for thi occas , like car that are big and have a chair at the back that open when he/sh want to have rest . so , the main point i want to explain is that car are design in mani shape and mani size that are suitabl for mani differ occass . well , inspit of their disadvantag , such as air pollut , traffic and accid , i guess car are more use than other automobil , like buss or train or even plane . let me put thi in anoth way , if one want to go to work and he/sh want to take the bu , first he/sh must wait for the bu to arriv , and when the bu arriv he/sh must check if the bu is full or not and after take the bu and arriv to work , he/sh will pay for the ride which annoy most of the peopl . so , i think , instead of pay everytim he/sh can buy a car ! so , i guess , car are smaller , more use , more help and cheaper than ani other automobil the core of thi is that i total disagre with the statement `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . i think in twenti year peopl will be fewer than car .
