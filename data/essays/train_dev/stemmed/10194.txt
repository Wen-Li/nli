consid the fact that drive a car is get the most stress and exagger way to get from one place to the other becaus of the huge number of car on our street that produc traffic jam of intolar length , i think it is without question that we should have fewer car not onli in twenti year but soon . the other possipl solut to build more and broader road is improp due to environment reason . the debat take place about climat chang and the convinc argument scholar are give us for the fact that , if we go on emiss such larg ammount of co2 , we are go to face a seriou climat catastroph , show that we are forc to think of altern to the nowaday use car . but i do not think person transpot system in some other way will still be in use in twenti year . i hope that by then we will be abl to use a type of energi that on the one hand doe not pollut the air and on the other hand is regrow . i am of the convict that fossil energi is not a techniqu of the futur . an other point i would like to discuss is the question if peopl could live without car , mayb even should . take into consider the million of peopl kill in car accid i come to the conclus that we should use a safer transport system like train . of cours we face the disadvantag that a given person is way more flexibl when take the car than when take the train or other public transport system . i would recom an improv in these system , for exampl a better network and more train , in order to make the use of safer techniqu more attract . come to an end i would like to again express my hope , that at some point in time we will be independend from car as we now know them with their nois , smell and neg consequens on the environ and our health .
