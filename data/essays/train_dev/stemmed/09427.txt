it is said that `` youth is the best period in life '' . but few may argu say that the older peopl also enjoy their life spend with their children and grandchildren and experienc the freedom a teenag get . howev i agre that young peopl enjoy life more than the older do and i will explain my view in the follow paragraph . firstli , young age is the time when they have time to go out with friend and parti around without ani sens or fear of respos . they can go for treck and can visit beach and swim in the beach which usual a older person will not be abl to do . the youngster need not worri about their health and will not have to carri medicin wherev they go . here come the older peopl who will alway have to think about their health and necessari medic . also for heavi journey which need lot of strain they need a youngster to take care . but a youngster would love to go for long journey with more fun and enjoy without much pressur . i saw my grandfath who is veri healthi and more funlov when he is home but he get veri much strain when he come out with me . he is as activ as i am but he doesnot have as much energi as i have though he want to enjoy . he can watch and enjoy but he cant jump and have fun the way i do . be a young girl i think young peopl have more way to have fun and enjoy life than older peopl . they can go for concert , play to have fun . but older peopl will get conjust and will not be happi with the loud sound in the theater . we can get adjust to ani environ and get along with all friend without ani place or accomod problem . i mean we can do nightout with friend and go for night show which is rather difficult for the older peopl . young age is the preciou time and have to be enjoy to the fullest . becaus as we grow older we will have respos which will not let us enjoy to our extrem . older peopl 's health will not let them enjoy . so accord to me young peopl will wnjoy life more than anybodi els .
