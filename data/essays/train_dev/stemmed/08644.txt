learn fact is an event that will be discov as a result of appli idea and concept . in order for a student to learn fact , he should first have to understand the main idea and concept than to know the result of thi idea and concept . gener speak , both understand idea and concept and learn fact have sever advantag . firstli , understand idea and concept have sever advantag . the first advantag of understand idea and concept is the improv in the abil of student to think and develop . thi mean that when student learn the fact onli without think of the main idea and the concept of thi fact , they will never tri to develop and improv these idea or concept . as a result , there will not go to be ani innov from ani kind . anoth advantag of understand idea and concept is the discoveri of new fact . thi mean that mayb some fact that result as a consequens of idea an concept are not the onli fact that exist mayb other fact result from the same idea and concept . these are few advantag from understand idea and concept . secondli , learn fact directli also have sever advantag . the main advantag of learn fact is that sometim fact are not base on ani idea or concept . learn fact directli in thi case will be more convini for student . anoth advantag of learn fact instead of understand idea and concept is that the student do n't have to worri about where did thi come from . and thi is the most annoy question in my opinion . i think that these are the few advantag of learn fact directli . to summar , i think that it is better for student to understand idea and concept in order to improv these fact but in sometim it is enough for them to learn the fact directli .
