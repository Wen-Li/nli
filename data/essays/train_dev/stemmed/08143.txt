when student studi , they need to understand what they studi , rather than learn the fact of it . becaus , understand of idea and concept will be help to understand problem much deepli , much easier to memoris , and much appicat for other problem that they have face . first , understand idea and concept will be help to student to understand what they studi better then fact . when student start understand idea and concept of certain question , they will find what wa the caus , and how it work . it 's like guier . all the teeth of guier are match perfactli the machin work . therefor , to understand what they stude deepli , then they need to understand what is the idea of it . second , understand of idea and concept will be in student ' mind longer time than learn fact . becaus , there are lost of fact in all singl question . if student start to studi fact , then they have to memoris all of the fact which is bigger number than idea and concept . lot of fact can be found in lot of similar type of question , howev those are similar question , so if the student rememb onli one idea or concept , then they will abl to solv all of question , instead of rememb all of factor for each question . therefor , understand idea is much easier than learn fact , so that will be remain in student brain for much longer time . third , idea are much appicat than fact when they have some other problem . when they understand the idea , they will follow on that idea and stick branch of lot of think and reach much further idea and studi more wide . howev , the fact are too certain , narrow . also it can not be chang , like a stone . none of branch can stick on a stone , so student will know how to get a bird with the stone , but will not know how to play ` catch ball ' with the stone . therefor , figur out and understang idea will be much goof for applic for other thing and will be much use when they face some other new problem . therefor , student have to understand the idea of what thay studi , so that will be much help in lot of way of their stude . so that is much practic way of stude then learn fact .
