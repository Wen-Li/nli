with the young and the old peopl , we have two differ way to see thing . in some point you enjoy more your life as a young personn than an old one , but thi statement work in the other sens too . for a young personn , life is a train that you do n't have to miss , in other word , you must enjoy your life as much as possibl as a young personn , becaus when you get old you are not abl to do all the thing you were abl to do befor . when you are young you have a perman energi that give you thi happi of live that allow you to do everyth , like go out on the even and go to work the morm after without be tire , or just pratic a lot of activ like climb , scuba dive . . for sure , scuba dive is not adviz for old peopl becaus of heart problem . thi exampl justifi whi be old can appear as the end of the freedom . you are more fragil , your bodi is not the same , you are not the same . but be old is not essenti the end of life . as the wine is get better when it 's get older , peopl becom better when they get older . in fact , you becom more confid becaus of all your past experi . you becom a brain who know everyth and who did everth ! that 's one of the biggest advantag of be old , you have a knowledg of a lot of thing . it 's not the onli thing , when you are old you can make a comparison with the past , societi chang , new product appear , you enjoy to see all the improv of the world you use to live in befor . by the same time you becom grand parent , and you enjoy a lot to be with your grand children . in my opinion , you enjoy more your life when you are young , becaus you are more abl to have fun . when you are old you are often seek , your bodi doe n't work as good as it wa use to , and futhermor you just rememb the past , when you were young .
