accord to thi topic i can neither agre nor disagre . on the one hand young peopl have a lot of energi for instanc they can danc through the whole night or go in for everi kind of sport they like . regularli they do not have physic problem and they know that they have lot of life-tim . but on the other hand they are often struggel with themselv . first love , futur and a lack of experi etc. are difficulti in their live . person i am often so worri about my futur , my job perspect and so on that i can not sleep in the even . older peopl are more experienc . although they have got problem , too , they mostli take them easier . they know life goe on . that is whi they see the thing differ and can enjoy other thing than younger peopl . after year of good and bad time they can analyz situat in anoth way . if your are young you want to chang the world , you are think about the big thing . when you are get older your valu chang . my mother is a good evid for thi . she told me that went on parti as she wa younger and that thi wa her way of enjoy life . but today she enjoy stay at home with the famili , she enjoy cook and play with my littl cousin . mayb older peopl think more posit about life and to my mind that is a sign for life qualiti . mayb older and younger peopl have just anoth way of enjoy life , but neither younger nor older peopl enjoy life more like the other group . so person i feel that it is imposs to decid wheather young or old peopl enyoy life more . especi the fact that i am young make it imposs . so i have to becom older and mayb then i will be abl to answer thi question in a better way .
