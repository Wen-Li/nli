i agre with thi statement . i do n't mean that fact and learn about them is not import . but the complet understand of someth come with the acknowledg of it basi . idea and concept are the base in wich knowledg and progress are built on . so it 's essenti for a student to manag the idea and concept of a topic of studi , to be capabl of complet understand everyth about it and to work correctli with it fact . when a student approach hi learn process , he must go through two moment . first , the understand of the basic concept of the topic that he 's studi . he must be abl to manag and handl all the basic idea and knowledg of what hi studi . and then analizyng the fact . in thi second moment the student , use hi previou result , the student compar and associ the concept and idea he learn earlier with the fact that are given to him . thi way the student can fulli learn about the topic and gener conclus , that are correct and use in hi and in other whole educ process . teacher should point out process like these , so they could get much better result out of their teach and could more accour reach their goal . and student could realli be prepar and could realli trust that they have a solid educ format . so in conclus , it 's not that know about idea and concept is more import than know about fact . is that the proper learn of basic concept can lead to a better use and to a better understand of fact . if student reallli want to reach a correct use of their knowledg , they must know everyth about the concept and idea that they are work with . and teacher must make their structur of teach easier to point out the basic idea .
