iam di agre with the statement that it is more import for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the student more eager to learn through the experi the fact than the learn by understand the fact . becaus understand fact is just theorit . learn fact is the practic . so , i prefer experi than theorit explan . when the student told by theorit he may not understand . where as if he show practic sure he will understand . for eg ; fact is water flow from height to the lower place . if the teacher told him oral he may understand or not understand . but if he show the water flow onc he wo n't forget . so that fact should be prove practic then onli everi one understand . idea and concept are told by some one . the learn fact are by the student hi own by in the learn process . idea and concept are help in the academ wise . the learn concept are use in lead life comfort . fact and concept of all are not practic . so that along with the fact and concept the learn fact are got equal import . initi student will understand the idea and concept . as age grow he learn through the learn fact . for eg ; in younger age what teacher tell in the class that student will grasp . as he grow up he will like to impliment the fact by hi own . he start think by hi own . so learn fact got the import in applic of own idea .
