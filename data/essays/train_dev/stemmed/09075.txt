i agre with the statement provid that the word in the statement `` car '' is qualifi to mean onli `` road-car '' . thi is to distinguish road-car from other automot , like space-car , which may be a thing of the futur . i will hence-forth call such automobil as personal-flight , to distinguish them from `` road-car '' . as a scienc student , i am total convinc that twenti year is suffici for technolog advanc to progress to such an extent , so as to enabl the the usag of person flight by mani peopl . in those year , peopl will be abl to purchas personal-flight , and henc the usag of road car will becom outmod . twenti year may be short to produc such personal-flight at low rate . howev although all peopl may not have luxuri to such high end automobil , a signific portion of the popul , especi in develop countri may start use them regularli . besid , the govern of those day might introduc other sophist public transport system , like space buse or space train . consid the heavi pollut that is caus by the today 's car and the great commot caus in today 's road becaus of these car , peopl then may start explor other option , such as space - buse . that would not onli be conveni to most peopl , but also be environ friendli . in fact , some environ friendli countri , might total abandon the usag of power vehicl on road of that day . peopl who wish to go on road on those day might go on cycl , and it is entir possibl that cycl might be in vogu then . the usag of road-car may be restrict to luxuri sport like formula 1 , nascar etc . the other import factor that may influenc peopl to consid other attract altern mean of transport is petrol and other ga reserv . the acut shortag of petrol , diesel etc in come year may increas their price so much that peopl wil start abandon road-car . even as of today , train in japan and in few other countri can move almost on the air , enabl them to travel as fast as sound . current research indic that space car may be manufactur without the usag of petrol . they also do not caus enviro problem , and traffic jam will be a thing of past . in twenti year , the advent of space car and space buse is look highli possibl .
