to me both aspect are import becaus a student should have the knowleg and the understand of the idea and the concept of an specif topic befor they learn a fact on it . that is becaus i actual think that , when you have a fact on ani matter , that fact happen as a respons to sever or variou event that happend befor therefor an student should know all the concept and idea , or all the inform he can have on a certain matter to becom awar or to have a logic explan of whi that fact or event turn that way . in my specif field of medicin , that is obstetr and ginecolog , an student need to know all the inform about labor and deliveri , for exampl , refer to all the chang the uteru , the deliveri channel and the vagina go thru , and all of the bio-mechan aspect of the uteru contract , the biochem aspect of the contract , all the activ and passiv chang that the mother an the fetu have in the labor and deliveri event , as well as all the chang that occur in the pregnanc , befor get to learn how to take care or handl a deliveri event . that way if someth goe wrong he will have all the inform on wath is go wrong an if there is a way to make it go the way it is suppos to go , and have the knowledg to handl ani undesir event . tha same reason aplli to a student that can learn how to do a c-section , or learn the tehcnic aspect of how to perfomr it , but if he doe not have all the anatom inform about the human bodi , anyth can go wrong in that procedur and it will turn to the death of the mother and the babi . so i think that everi fact ha an explan and the more you learn about the concep or idea lead to a certain fact the more you will know about the fact itself .
