i realli agre with thi opionion . what i studi now is the technolog of electr . but what i should learn not onli thi thing . i should learn math , physic , comput and a lot of other thing . at first , i do n't know whi i should learn it , then i know it . if i wa ask to figur out someth about the power of electr , i should use math , and how the electr move , i also need the knowledg about the power and other ting . sometim i need some special comput programm to figur it , then i should write these programm by myself . the more borad knowledg of other academ subject will help me the better in my specif subject . not onli in my experi , i also think almost all learner would agre it . beacus noth is exist in one theroti alon . here is a veri simpl exampl : when an appl fall dow from the tree . thi phenomon support on a lot of thing . such as whi it leav the tree , whi it fall down , how fast it fall down . .. all these differ question need differ subject to answet it . and also , board knowledg of mani academ subject will help us see a question in differ way . also there is a simpl exampl : also there is an appl . it becom smaller and lighter everyday . you cant find ani reason of that in botant or physic subject . but you will know whi if you have learn chemcial . beacus the water cell in the appl get outsid , so you can kown well whi it becom smaller and lighter everyday . everyth in the world need broad knowledg . the more we learn , the better we can kown the world . thi is my opinion of board knowledg of mani academ subject . you will find interest in a lot of knowledg .
