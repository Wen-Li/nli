young peopl and their commun young peopl have the abil and the time to do mani thing for their commun but nowaday they are busi in other thing like play game , watch tv , spend too much time with friend . i agre with that statement becaus of the follow reason : they think that the oth thing ( play , watch tv , ... et ) more import than help their commun ; and they think that the young peopl themselv need help from their commun . mani young peopl are interest in the comput and video game , internet , wath tv and movi , and visit friend and spend much time with them . so they are veri busi with these thing and they ca n't find time to help their commun . also the young peopl think that they themselv need their commun help by give them advis by the older peopl about studi in universi and how they can choos a good univerd and a good major . also they want to learn from the expert . those expert are usual from the old peopl . moreov , we have to give the young peopl a feel that they are men we can depend on them . and if they feel that , they may provid help to their commun . for ecxampl , if you deal with ayoung person as a chile he will hate you and the commun and wo n't help you . for these reason i think that young peopl do n't give enough time to help their commun . but if we provid advis for those young peopl they will help their commun but when they get older .
