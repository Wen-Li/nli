have you ever tri to figur out the hard and complic math question ? some peopl suggest that it is import for student to learn the fact . on the other hand , i think that understand the concept is much more import than just learn the fact . i suggest my opinion with two reason , peopl will rememb longer when they understand the idea and they will also figur out all the question even though it 's hard and complic . first of all , peopl tend to rememb longer when they understand the concept or the idea . howev , when they just learn and memor the fact . they will forget about it quickli . for instanc , in biolog , i learn about the ` feedback system ' in human 's bodi and i wa abl to understand how thi system work becaus my mother knew about the biolog veri well . howev , my friend , who did n't get halep from anyon , just memor and learn the whole process of the ` feedback system ' and a week ago , we had a pop quiz in the biolog class . i wa manag to figur out all the question about the ` feedback system ' but my friend could n't solv non of the question . in thi case , i wa abl to answer all these question becaus i understood how the ` feedback system ' work then my friend could n't answer them becaus he forgot what he memor and learn befor . secondli , student can figur out ani hard question if they fulli understand the fact or the idea . thi happen a lot in math class . math teacher do n't just ask student easi and simpl question , they make the question complic and hard for student to solv it . student who understand the idea would be abl to solv these question . howev , student who just memor or learn the fact will be confus or hesit to figur out the question becaus they have the basic knownledg about the concept and idea . sinc , student do n't forget or mis-us the knownledg when they understand the consept and student , who understand the idea and the concept , will manag to figur out all the hard and high-level question . abov all , i state understand the fact and the idea are much import than just learn the fact .
