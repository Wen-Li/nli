i disagre with the statement and believ that special in one specif subject and be a master of that area is much better than have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . in today 's complex world , each field or subject ha becom so complex that it requir more than a lifetim of dedic effort to master that subject . unless one give that effort , hi knowledg about that field remain onli superfici . specil lead on to new frontier . unless we have specialist in variou field , it will be veri difficult to come up with new discoveri and invent . each academ field ha becom so complex , it hi highli improb for a generalist today to come out with someth new unless aid by chanc or luck . special also lead to confid in one 's person . if somebodi is a specialist in hi field , that person can be trust to do that thing better than most peopl . he can be expect to take respons relat to that field , so that other peopl can focu on their own specialist field . sinc a specialist is a master of hi domain , he can pass on that inform gain by invest time in one particular thing to the next gener . a generalist wont have the depth and would not be appreci by hi audienc when he talk about ani of hi variou known topic . there is no cours in the world which give degre to student for have studi about 20 differ field . all the degre offer by colleg all over the world focu on one or two area of special . thi itself prove the worth of special viz a viz gener knowledg about variou academ field . if one look around , almost all the success peopl are master in their domain . they know about one subject in detail and henc gain respect from their peer . even a generalist post like the presid of india is occupi today by a scientist who help the countri further it satellit program . there is a say which goe like : `` jack of all trade , and master of none '' . unless we chang it to `` master on one '' or `` master of some '' , it will continu to remain derogatori in it usag .
