a question on have knowledg of whether mani academ subject or special in one specif subject is heavili debat among academ . it is an appar fact that interdisciplinari cours are veri popular and a lot of academ institut are offer cours in that context . although , i believ have knowlegd of mani academ subject are veri help to reach a good comprehes in the studi , i disaggr with the idea in gener sinc i believ that a good academ research can be carri out with the good background in a specif field . the strongest aspect of special in one subject is the power of the deepen in that field . it is quit use to have a broad knowledg of mani subject and it might serv to reach a meaning synthesi when they are put togeth . howev , if one doe not have a comprehens knowledg in one field , it is sure veri difficult to put the inform in a framework that attempt to explain , for instanc a case , in an academ way . let us think about a master thesi that we studi on . if we choos to conduct a case studi , it is mostli comfort to appli more than one theori . if our master thesi is in social scienc , it is obviou that the case can be defin and studi in that manner . howev , i can put forward that it also creat mani misunderstand and it can end into a huge paper without noth . becaus if we achiev to special on one aspect , we can draw the line about the case which will help the reader to understand what is tri to be told . a person who concentr on one theori can depict the case veri well under the guidanc of main point of the field he or she deepen . to sum up , although have knowledg in mani field can sound better than my idea , it is usual better to concentr on one disciplin to reach a better explain .
