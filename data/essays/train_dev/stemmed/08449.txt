i am agre with the statement that advertis gener give wrong inform about their product . if a particular product is launch then genar compani advertis their product to peopl so that peopl buy their product more . an advertis expalain about a particular product . it should tell about the pro and cone of it . but it can be put into neg use also . below i will explain for what kind of product genral compani give fals advertis . in compet market gener the compani say better thing about a product in it 's advertis . there might be some compet product , which are alreadi there in the market and a compani come up with the same kind of product . the compani tri to sell it 's poduct more . so in it 's inform they genral put fals inform about their product so that their product look nicer than the rival product . i 'm give one exampl below . you can see thi kind of trend more in cosmet industri . everi hair shampoo is more or less same . they all contain the same amount of chemic in it . but still everi compani come up with differ advantag of their shampoo . they say that thier shampoo is more effect that the other . sometim it also happen that compani make cheaper product and tri to sell them at higher price . to do thi they make fals advertisemnt about their product . you can see thi kind of advertis for duplic product . you can see thi when a roam salesperson come into your home for sell hi product . genner they give wrong inform about the product and tri to sell them at a high price . it also happen that sometim an advertis say onli good thing about a product . they hide away the bad thing . for an exampl , say someon want to sell slip pill . the advertis say that the sleep pill is good , it will give you a good night sleep . but that sleep pill might caus other symptom also . the advertis is not go to tell you about that . but you ca n't say all of the advertis give fals inform . some of the advertis realli give help inform about a product . we should analyz an advertis onli on it 's true valu .
