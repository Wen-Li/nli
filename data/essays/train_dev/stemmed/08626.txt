in my opinon , most advertis are deceiv peopl by make product seem better . there are two specif case of exampl of trick to present product much better : chang the look of the product by chang it color of it cover and chang it name to make it look like high qualiti . first of all , advertis chang the color of the product cover to attract the custom . gener fade color will make the custom think that product is made with an old technolog , wherea bright color deceiv the consum that it is made by high technolog . for exampl , brighter pencil are gener prefer to faded-colored-pencil in turkey . that 's whi mani advertis forc manufactur to produc bright look pencil to increas sell . secondli , advertis forc the manufactur to chang product name of a specif product to increas the amount of product sold . in turkey , that is usual done by give a foreign name to that product instead of a turkish name to trick the consum . in thi way , consum may think that the product is a high qualiti product becaus some of the good manufactur by turkish industri lack qualiti . there is a real case for thi in turkey . a-spagetti-producing-compani chang it product name a coupl of year ago and gave an italian name to it product to deceiv the consum that it is an italian product . henc , they have increas sell their product . thi is the way to present their product much better although it is same qualiti as befor . to sum up , most advertis make product seem much better accord to some techniqu list abov . unfortun , thi techniqu are becom so widespread that consum will unlik encount a product reveal it real qualiti .
