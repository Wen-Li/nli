althogh some peopl would agre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject , i definit dissagre with the statement . there are two reason whi i dissagre with the statement . first , it will make you feel special if you have special in one specif subject . for exampl , one of my friend play have lot of hobbi , such as play piano , read , and play tenni . and i ask her what doe she like the best . she said `` i do n't know . i mean i actual do n't know yet what i realli like . '' on the other hand , my anoth friend onli play judo , he ha been practic judo for 8 year . and he know that he love judo , and onc he start talk about judo , he never stop talk . it is not about the academ subject , but for these peopl , it work same way . the girl i mention first , she ha no subject she doe n't like , but she also ha no subject she realli like . so in the exam , she usual get all b+ or b - which is not bad , howev . while she never get a , the boy who is play judo alway get a a+ and c in hi exam . i think it is better to have one a+ rather than all b sinc it will make you feel more special and happi . second , it must be fun to have someth special . for exampl , if you have special in one specif subject , it will be so much fun to studi . onc you learn how much fun to studi will help you in the futur when you start work . for these two reason , i dissagre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject .
