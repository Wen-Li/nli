when peopl travel , some peopl visit a place with a group of peopl led by tour guid while other travel by themselv . peopl who travel in a group might have their reason for do so . howev , i think travel in a group is bad . fist of all , travel in a group led by a tour guid doe not usual fit your favor . dure the journey to china with my school friend , we were led by a tour guid . from the beggin , there were mani discont between student . all of us want to visit super famou market in shanghai but the tour guid did n't let us . he just said that he ca n't let us becaus it wa not the part of the plan . follow the schedul , we just had to see mani similar bore templ for three day . also , you can not get to know the place realli well if you travel in a group . you wo n't have mani chanc to enjoy the place . you 'll just have to stay awak follow the line . again , when i went to china , i realli want to have an experi of use chines . but onc when i wa tri to have a talk with chines , i got reprov from the tour guid for not follow him . it made me feel bad not to have spoken chines even onc , though i stay there for 5 day . some peopl might argu that tri by yourself can increas the danger of yourself becasu you 're not use to thet place . but thi is the thing that i want to point out for the last . as you do n't know the place a lot , you might do more research for the place you are go to visit . eventu , you will get more amus when you actual arriv at the place . furthermor , you will prepar some solut in case of danger . nobodi can be so sure that travel in a group is safer . rather i think there will be more danger becaus there is almost no solut in case you get lost from the line . for these three reason , i strongli suggest that travel in a group led by a tour is bad . i realli do want to recommend travel by yourself or just with your famili .
