educ is a veri import and vital throughout the world . but unfortun there mani obstacl for student to go on the right way when they begin to learn . educ system in countri have differ kind of aspect and differ kind of qualif around the world . for exampl in some countri finish the class and exam are so import for student than ani other object so the first aim is to pass the exam and the possibl way for thi is to memor the concept and formula . in addit student are gener look for the previou exampl amd question which help them to pass . gener the mean of educ is that when you can pass the exam than you are prosper onli a few are curiou about the fact that are the reason for these formula . in contrast in some countri there are realli good indic for prosper . in other say student are divert into search the fact they are told that search the resano are more import than the result by these inform inform are realli the pioneer for develop . devolop is realli possibl with the fact or with reason that lie behind the concept . for instanc think about the scienc the reason and fact are realli veri import especi when you are a doctor and your main aim is to help peopl in their oper so to know the fact is necessari for the right and fair act . to sum up in my opinion it is gener more import for student to underst the idea than to understand the fact which lay behind the inform . award are gener base on the end so peopl are gener concentr with the outcom so at thi point concept must be learn firstli .
