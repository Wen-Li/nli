i partli agre with that statement , but there is no point in lower the neccic of learn fact . they built the basi for further understand . for exampl in biolog , first you have to learn the fact , the term and their definit . it 's like learn a languag you 'll need for comun with other in your field . so you have to learn the basic fact and term and know them by heart to actual express yourself , your thought and question . well , the fact are the tool but understand the mean of idea and model is the actual work . one can use the tool for understand the fact . and understand is sometim even harder than learn fact , becaus you have come to thi point , i would call it `` aha '' moment , and thi can take veri long . you probabl have to repeat thing you did n't understand at home on your own , and read secondari literatur for better understand . i would say , that understand can be much more time consum than just memor the fact . but onc you realli understood a theori or a problem you probabl wo n't forget it , and you can built up on thi . real understand of idea and theori can built the foundat for further question or even own thaught and theori . for exampl a student wo n't be abl to present own thaught in a topic he doe n't even understand . addit , understand concept is a cruicial requir for a carrer in scienc . in scienc you have to understand the work that wa done on your fild to built up on it , to add new idea and creat own thaught . to sum thi up , learn fact and know them by heart is neccecari to comuic in your field and understand it , but understand is the part that is cruical for own creativ of thaught .
