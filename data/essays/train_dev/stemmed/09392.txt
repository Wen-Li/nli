have you notic how crowd of young peopl shop are at anytim in the citi ? young peopl nowaday love to have more and more thing and spend much of their time on thi without consid the need that our commun have . in my opinion young peopl behavior seem to me selfish and not help with the commun . first of all , capitalist societi we are live contribut young peopl to consum . for exampl , the ad on televison help to creat expect of have thing and consum more . furthermor , shop everywher make citizien feel confort becaus we know we can have what we need just go shope . what i mean is that is not possibl to think in enjoy thing all the time , youth need to consid other aspect . regard to thi , we can be help at the same time we enjoy as we do shope . we can reach thi aim for exampl help beggar recolect money in group along the street . for instanc we can have a chat with old peopl who are on their own sit in a bench on the park , just to make them have a good time . in short , consid young peopl do n't help too much the commun what i suggest is that we can help the commun we are live and at the same time have a great time do simpl thing .
