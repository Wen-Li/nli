i partial agre with the statement that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guid becaus it depend on the situat such as how you are go , what palc u are go and how mani peopl did u accompani and also whether u know ani thing perfectli about the place . firstli , while we are go alon and if we are new to that place and we do not know ani thing about the place than it is better if we go for a tour guid . tour guid help us to cover import thing and also it is safe and also no confus occur . i say thi with all the experi i had in my trip . last time me and my husband went to hawaii we attend a polynesian cultur center with a guid . the guy who guid is realli good and he said alot of thing about the cultur and the peopl who are there in hawaii and so we know all the cultur that ha emerg in hawaii and it sister island and also about the same time we have known all the cultur and tradit that are there in hawaii and we cover almost everyth went well . secondli while we are go to place which are well known which doe not have an histor import there is no need of guid and also at the same time if we went with the guid we ca n't spend a lot of time where we like it and also there is no privaci if we went along with the tour guid . consid the exampl , if iam vist la vega with the guid what should i do ? realli i can spend my time where i like ? no i ca n't . visit la vega what is the need of guid . at last i would like to conclud that if u are vist an histor import place u realli need a guid the guid help u to explor more thing and if u are vist for onli entertain there is no need of guid . so lastli i can say that sometim i prefer guid while in sometim i may not it may depend on the place , situat and time .
