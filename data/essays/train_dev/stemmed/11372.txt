i agre that student should understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . i think understand one specif thing such as : whi the war wa occur , how thi problem result , whi thi music sound thi way , requir to understand backgraund of the thing , idea , concept . idea and concept lead you to understand whi the fact were occur . i think that understand idea , concept , and fact are one thing to achiv your learn skill . understand fact are the easiest thing to do the out of all three . for exampl , when you learn the histori , teacher talk about `` what is happen '' wa the first thing which is the fact . and after you know the fact , you would be interest whi , how , when it happen . when i learn japanes edo era in japanes histori class , the teacher taught us about tokugawa shougunn , what he did in the big govern plan and chang and i wa so interest how he becam a head of samurai , whi him , how he relat with thi big govern plan etc . i had a lot of question . it wa hard to understand the idea and concept of whi and how he govern the countri . i spend way more time to learn the idea and concept more than the fact . understand fact in the first make you interest to know more about it . i think that learn idea and concept lead you to understand deeper of the thing , and relat you with the thing more than understand idea and concept to lead you to the fact . it is veri import to relat all three , howev , know and understand idea and concept are more import to achiv your learn .
