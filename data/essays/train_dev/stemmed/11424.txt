in the last 20 year the number of car in use ha increas a lot , thank mainli to econom develop and technolog improv . the car industri ha , as consequ , improv a lot in term of secur and modern car need less fuel than in the past . given the bigger uncertainti and instabl that are today present in the world , both from the polit side and the econom one , is not obviou what will be the futur develop . there are mani reason to believ that the number of car will decreas , especi in western europ and usa . for exampl , i think that the traffic and the pollut level that have been reach in mani modern citi will not sustain in the longer term sinc they effect neg the overal qualiti of life in most richer countri . in addit , the current trend of the cost of petrol make the use of privat car everyday more expens . in thi context , a well organis public transport servic would solv these issu by reduc the usag of privat car . on the other hand , it is like that economi of countri such as india , china and russia , will continu to grow at a sustain growth rate . thi mean that , expeci in india and china , where the popul grow impress fast , the number of car will increas as well . the futur of the car industri is anoth reason for which the number of car may not decreas in the next year . in fact , both in europ and in the usa the car indutri is a veri big and import contributor to the countri wealth , becaus it employ a larg number of peopl . it is fair to believ that govern will help these industri to maintain their import to avoid ani social crise . in conclus , i think it is veri difficult to predict what the futur will be . too mani uncertainti are present in our world today . i also think that a reduct of the number of car , even if unlik to happen soon , will strongli improv our qualiti of life .
