learin is a veri disput word . few person gener misjudg it with introduct , understand or crame etc . but it is veri necessari that what we learn should be same as that of what we understand . it 's veri common among the student to learn the fact rather than to understand the idea behind it . they alway look for short term goal usual their examin . but it creat a great problem when they get a appli question in the examin . few question are base on uderstan of concept . these type of question are usual not mention in the text book . if you donot uderstand the motto or theme of subject , it 's veri difficult to appli it in the current field , other field or after a short time span . one will foreget the thing just after few day or month . but if we evaluv the subject fulli , it a life long achiv . we can use the same concept in differ stream or at ani time . for instanc , if an agriculturist beleiv in learn fact ; may be he will abl to acheiv a good grade , but practic he will not abl to appli hi knowledg in hi field as agricultur is an appli scienc . the understand lead to develop of creativ and if an agriculturist is not creativ , he will not abl to investig the new techniqu . similarli , if an engin student learn the fact of the principl of work of a mach rather than to understand it , he can onli handl that particular type of machin and never think about a new discoveri . on the other hand if got basic idea , he can renov the mach accord to the requir of time . everi field of studi requir applic of your skill rather than to copi it , which can be onli possibl when the student will understand the idea rather than learn the fact . today 's time is for idea hold person which is entir base on creativ ; ultim understand .
