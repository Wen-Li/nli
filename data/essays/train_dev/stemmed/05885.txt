what advertis want to tell us ? we can see a lot of advertis everywher nowaday . some is veri seriou , other is veri interest . howev , in my opinion , i agre thi opinion that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are for the follow reason : it give posit imag , they are emphas and they are not clear sometim . first of all , advertis are usual give us posit imag storongli . for exampl , cosmet compani alway use beautifl actoress or model for their product ' advertis . thu , if peopl had posit imag for her , they would also thed to have great imag for the product even if they do not know quariti of the product . secondli , advertis are usual greatli emphas . for instans , food compani show how excel their product are , use blilliant color or show atract pictur . i bought a chocolet cake becaus a advertis wa so atract and it look great , howev it wa not as delici as i expect from it advertis . final , advertis are not clear at time , becaus the most import inform is not state in advertis or even state , it is hard to notic . for exampl , cloth compani ' advertis highlight price of their product . howev , it usual do not show materi of it product . in conclus , it is true that advertis are import for both compani and custom . howev . i strongli think there are mani advertis which show much better than actual product . the proper judgement for advertis is essenti for us .
