advertis are drive the market . in nowaday world , the best compani are esili recongnis from their advertis . all the great compani have a fantast advertis campaign in order to promot their product/ . on thi direct , all the new emerg busi are work on creat fantast advertis to break into the market and obtain a huge amount of counsum readi to consum teir product/servic . the onli problem is that these new compani are focus so much on the advertis that they stop to take care of the qualiti of the product . for these reason we have on the market there well made advertis promot a product that is not so good . it is true that the most import point of an advertis is to give to the custom a sensat of a dream . compani want to convinc custom that their product/servic is the best on the market , but consum , if are not satisfi in the product that they bought , they will never buy that product again . from a sourvey that i road in the economist , i discov that the dissatisfact in custom ha incres of 40 % these last twenti year . the respons is probabl thi new trend of exagir the product/servic qualiti to much by advertis . for exampl , i rememb when i bought a pair of tenni shoe from a new sport cloath compani call ttk . i have been attract to thi pair of shoe from the desin enphas on a billboard with a slogan on the buttom that wa say `` ttk . .. the shoe of the warrior . .. '' . there wa also written under the slogan that they were one of the most resisten shoe on the market . after that i bought these shoe , i suc to play tenni just ten time : they were alreadi complet destroy ! i believ that if compani will not chang the way of advertis , consum will not trust them anymor , and also the big corprat will have a decreas in the sale .
