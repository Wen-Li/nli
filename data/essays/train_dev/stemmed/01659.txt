scienc , for that matter ani other field of studi , have been broadli classifi in to mani subject . it import for everon to have a basic knowledg of all these subject but i think it better to special in one specif subject . concentr on a wide rang of subject creat a lot of problem . firstli , the individu may not be abl to find ampl time to devot to each subject . secondli , the reader may retain far less than what is requir becaus the detail of the mix of all subject might be realli confus . we alway find that peopl who make their decis earli and act promptli and concentr in a particular area of interest turn out to be high perform or high end achiev contribut a lot toward the develop of societi . dr. a.p.j abdul kalam , the presid of india can be quot as a veri relev exampl in thi context . dr. kalam identifi veri earli that hi interest lie in the area of space scienc and technolog and start work on it from hi senior seondari school itself . we all know that he had alway been a tower figur in the evolut of indian space programm ever sinc he join the indian space research organ . he can be a real role model to the young student . i do feel that an exposur to all the subject is essenti for a student to make the right choic . it also give him the confid to tackl new situat and to effect put forward a new idea befor the gener public . but ultim one should tri to becom a specialist in ani field of hi interest . in thi societi i feel one should be a specialist in the field he or she is work to make the other peopl listen their voic . it also gener a sens of belief among them over the thing he or she is tell them . i feel it alway better to be a master in one field rather than a jack of all .
