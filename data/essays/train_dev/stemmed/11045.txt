the question be ask wheather success peopl should tri new thing and take risk or they should keep on do what they alreadi know and what they alreadi do . thi is an interest topic sinc it is relat with risk-tak by the peopl . in my opinion , i believ that peopl should tri new thing and tri to take risk if they can . i think , if we do some thing for a long time than we would alreadi improv that skill and we would get bore of do one thing again and again . and be a success person there would be less chanc of loss . or if there might ani loss occur than it will not affect that person busi much more . and , if we would do some differ thing it can be good as far as chang is concern . if we have capabl to take risk and to improv ourself than there is noth wrong in take risk . i am a pharmacist , so be a pharmacist i believ in research and develop . and in research and develop i tri to innov more and more use drug which have low side effect and have high margin of safeti . and for that purpos i believ in take risk in chang alreadi exist formula of ani perticular formul or drug . which can help me to invent new drug which is more advantag than the exist drug . so , accord to me , we should keep on tri to do new thing apart from what we do in our day to day curriculum . furthermor , i thing , dure present time where each and everi person tri to gain more and more knowledg as compar to other . and for thi everyon ha to take more chanc to improv hi skill and to becom better than other . for exampl , if some one would not have taken risk of develop atom bomb than we would not have been awar of that . in conclus , i have shown that success person should tri new thing and take risk . sinc without risk , there will not be ani develop .
