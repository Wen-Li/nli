i complet agre with thi statment . in my opinion , educ and learn ha a great more impact on the student if the subject touch them emotionali and person . learn fact and recit thing memor form textbook can achiev noth for the student except from give them a shallow concept of educ . as an exampl , i will present a person experi of mine that ha actual happen to me . in one lesson of person studi , we , as a class , touch upon the subject of anim right . i never had ani thought on thi subject befor and read a essay written on the subject in a text book , i still had no idea and opinion on the subject . read from the textbook establish by the school gave me no understand of the subject . but later on in the week the teacher took us on a trip to a anim shelter call the bspca . there , i saw anim that were actual under a lot of stress and anim that have been abus in the past . from that experi i learn a real lesson and actual understood the idea and concept behind the subject and from that i realiz that what realli is import in a lesson , is the amount you understand rather than learn fact and get an a * on a test . thi is parli whi i think that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . actual understand a subject can help build charact , histori , person and valu in a charact . on the other hand , learn fact from a textbook can onli make a copi of an unorigin be that believ in some one els view ( the person who wrote the fact , or a fact that ha no person appeal ) . the major reason that make me believ that thi statement is true is that the peopl around me and myself have mani stori to tell , and the reason that peopl have stori to tell is becaus they have learnt , understood and experienc idea and concept that merili , definetli , did n't come from a textbook full of fact . in conclus , i absolut agre with with the follow statement : `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' becaus of the sever reason list abov .
