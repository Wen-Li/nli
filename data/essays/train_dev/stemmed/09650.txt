first of all knowledg is veri imprtant to everi bodi adult or even children , so we should know about genar thing in our life , but my answer if i do i agre or not , i disagre . when you ask me whi i chois thi one , i will tell you that it 's true to know as much as you can and take knowledg but when you take just one thing and fouc on it bilev me yoy will do good work . so taken one thing and fouc on it will make you not like everi bodi you will be jenous becous you will appear your self and will shine . for exampl : if some on ha gradut from collig in one subject like medicen , thi person took almost like 8 year stadi which he want to work and make the help hi \ her countri after find good job . moreov the person when get thi sutit that 's clue for thi person and start hi life and make the other thing like famili children , and how he \ she will think about how to have up deagr or leavel to prove hi \ hi self . espeacilli in thi time knowleg it veri iport thing in our life as i said . final thi wa my opinoion .
