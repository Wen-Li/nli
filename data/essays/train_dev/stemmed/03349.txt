although i can understand whi some peolp have the impress that young peopl today are not engag themselv enough to help their commun , i disagre with thi statement . i have three reason for my opinion . first , in my view , young peopl have to dedic most of their time to their educ and career . as the unemploy rate in most countri increas year after year thi is the onli way for young peopl to asur themselv a job in the futur . for exampl , young peopl have to attend colleg or univers , they have class dure the day and usual homework to do in the even . some student also have to work part-tim to be abl to afford the univers fee . second , a lot of young peopl are plane their own famili when they are still young . when you have children on your own you need time to rais them . children need a lot of attent as they alway have so mani question about the world and a lot of reasearch paper state that the intellectu capabl of children are influenc most at a veri young age . so parent should take all the time they need to rais their children and explain everyth to them . final , i am convinc that even though young peopl do not have a lot of free time , still mani of them do engag themselv to help their commun . i would like to give two exampl of the commun i live in . in our commun especi young peopl are part of the first aid team of the local red cross . they spend their time do differ volunt servic , like medic help or entertain for older peopl . furthermor , the fire depart of our town ha a special youth organ for peopl age below 17 year . for the last five year the volunt member of thi youth organ have increas steadili . conclud , i think that young peopl today have a lot of import activ and oblig like their own educ or the found of their own famili which prevent them from give more time to help their commun . but i also have the impress that young peopl still engag in their free time as much as they can to improv their commun ' condit .
