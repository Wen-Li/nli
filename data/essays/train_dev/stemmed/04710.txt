it is said that the understand idea and concept is more import than learn the fact . there are mani student who onli tri to check the fact becaus they are use to the test ask the choic of solut . howev i think learn without understand idea and concept is not effect and meaningless . to begin with , mani student who do n't understand the profound idea and concept of the fact will not be abl to solv the problem successfuli when they face the a littl bit differ problem . even though the problem request student to find the other aspect of the gener fact , student alway appli the same fact to solv problem , moreov , they can not realiz what the mistak of their solut is . my brother graduat from a famou high school in korea with a good grade . howev , when he studi in the univers , he suffer from the lack of the understand an import idea and concept of the fact . becaus the univers educ need him to think over the problem consid the concept and idea . he final gave up get a degre in the univers . at second , when student focu on the fact , they can not develop the skill that is necessari in the real life . we have to do mani activ such as find a problem and suggest the sitabl solut in the compani . at that time , we sometim need to get the differ point of gener view for the more innov solut . howev , the student have no understand of basic concept and idea could get the uniqu point of view . in conclus , i can not agre the learn the onli fact is enough to overcom and solv the everi situat . without understand idea and concept , there is no way to find the real method to solv the complex situat . so we need to motiv the student get the understand of the profound concetp and idea of the fact .
