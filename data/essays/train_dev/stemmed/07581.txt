for me is import to say that most of the person start from the same level . i mean same money and cultur . so when somebodi is joung he have to decid what to do in hi life , so he ha to decid . the problem is that almost anybodi know what he will do in hi futur . that 's the reason becous a lot of peopl do a lot of differ job at the begin hopi to find the right one . the purpos of the man is to find the best way to live , at least for himself . when he final find the job that he think is good enough for hi aim , he will not do anithyng els , he will not find anoth job to replac it , mayb he will tri to improv hi job or find a secondari job . that 's whi thi situat give him stabil and he will feel safeti . that 's could be the reason becous even success peopl tri new thing rather than ordinari peopl . in fact is veri difficult that some busi man risk to improv hi , alreadi good , situat . but even the ordinari peopl think the same : they wo n't risk to lose what they have , even if could be just a bit for a big busi man . i thing that somebodi will not risk anymor when he find the harmoni between hi request and hi possibl . besid veri often even if somedodi do n't know how to do well one thing , the import is that it 's link with hi aim .
