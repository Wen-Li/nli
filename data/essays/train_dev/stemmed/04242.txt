the first thing that come into the mind is that peopl are simpli unconsci about the topic of pollut and environment problem . what they realli care is their comfort . everybodi want to live in comfort , isnt it ? but they dont think about how much time their comfort will last . the answer should not say a long period of time becaus it is thi comfort that will end the life on earth . everyday , the popul of earth increas with acceler , so , proport to the number of peaopl we can say that the number of car will certainli increas . if we are to think of ay decreas in thi number , we should consid about peopl conscious as individula and govern regul . first of all , the car releas outsid , to the air , veri hazard gase which caus to ozon deplet . the peopl outsid dont realli know what the ozon deplat is . moreov , the old car that are not use anymor are themselv are the caus of the pollut becous , the huge metal wast is also thrown into the earth . so , at thi point , scintist have the real job . they should make both the individu and the govern bewar of thi danger issu . secondli , there is also a conflict here that increas in the number of car make themselv useless ! there is a lot of traffic in big citi alreadi and thi will increas day by day . at the end all the car will be total useless . it will be that time that peopl will begin to think about use buse and railway . but , i dont think thi will happen in a coupl of decad . final , with the advanc in technolog , there may be fli object that can suppli the transport in the citi so that peopl will no longer need the car . but for thi technolog to be reach , mayb it will take a whole centuri . to sum up , i think in the next two decad there will bw even more increas in the number of car simpli becaus of the incresas in human popul . it will take much more time for peopl becom consciou about environment problem . but in the end natur will adjust itself
