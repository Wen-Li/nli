in my person opinion i am disagre with the question , becuas if you travel in a group you need too go to the same place that the other peopl of the group want . mayb if the group is integr by peopl that i know , is fine , becaus i could have the thrust to said if someth or some place dont like me , but if the group is integr for peopl that i do not know i preffer to travel just with one friend or one sister becuas we could go to ani place where we want and when we can . the idea of have a tour guid is good becaus we can know a lot of place and thing without the neces of are ask all the time to the peopl around about the place to visit in the citi . in other hand if you have a tour guid the trip will be more enjoy becuas the tour guid give you all the inform necesari that you need to enjoy your estanc in the place or citi , mayb the cost that you need to pay to the tour guid will be expens but will be more expens go from one place to anoth without know in realiti that you want . i think that in some case you need a person who lead you and help you in your trip . for exampl in a museum is good that you have a person who explain you about the exposit get the best benefit and know the hole place . in my person experi last year i travel to guanajuato in a group integr for friend , and it wa a great experi . we did not have a tour guid but befor the trip we made sure of know exactli what place were avail to visit , we look for the cost of hotel and the tipic thing to do in that citi search by internet and the result wa a realli good trip and we dont need to pay a tour guid and we salv money to spend in other thing .
