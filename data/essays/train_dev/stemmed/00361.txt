i disagre to the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . becaus you can not be free if you are in a group , also there is less chanc to interact with the peopl of the place you visit and you can not explor thing by yourself . first , peopl want to travel to be free from their ordinari live such as time limit and rule . howev , if you are in a travel group , there will be more rule to follow and time limit than travel by yourself . for exampl , you probabl not be abl to spend much time where you want to stay long and alway have to be on time to get togeth with other peopl . i would be stress if i have not much freedom dure the travel . second , you will get to meet more nativ peopl where you visit if you travel on your own than travel with a group . one of the most import reason to travel is meet other peopl from other world . howev , if you are with a travel group , you onli get to hang out with that group until you come back home not know how the peopl you visit are like . therefor , i would travel on my own to get to know the peopl from the place i visit . third , you will not be abl to explor thing by yourself . you can make much memori if you deal with new thing from the new place by yourself . if you onli follow the leader of the group you would not feel pleasur of achiev dure the trip . in sum , i prefer travel on my own to travel in a group due to the less freedom when you are in a group , lack of chanc to meet nativ peopl from other world and lose chanc to explor thing in the new place . you will be fill with lot of stori if you travel on your own .
