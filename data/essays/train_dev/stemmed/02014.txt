whi do young peopl not give enough time to help their commun nowaday ? i presum there are sever reason for that . first of all , young peopl have increas possibl and money to spend their leisur time , so they might rather spend their time enjoy themselv with friend than to be help the commun . anoth reason might be the chang live condit . peopl nowaday have to be and are more flexibl . the number of young peopl leav their hometown to studi in a citi far away ha increas . young peopl are chang job more frequent than befor and thu have to move hous . the time a young person spend in one site ha shorten and accordingli the feel of be a part of a commun . help a commun mean to be motiv as you feel respons for it . without have spent a certain time in a commun your are less motiv to help , as you do not know a lot of peopl person . the person knowledg of peopl though increas your motiv to help strongli . the strongest reason for the fact that young peopl nowaday help less in commun is the chang behaviour toward commun . peopl have becom more individu , more focuss on themselv and their need . famili as much as commun do not mean as much to peopl as they use to in the past . peopl are econom more independ so that they do not need support and help of the commun as much na in the past . take all those factor into account i would agre that more and more young peopl tend not to give enough time to help their commun .
