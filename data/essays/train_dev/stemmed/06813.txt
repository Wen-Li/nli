the answer is . i agre about it . the world is develop now and follow it peopl develop with that , which mean the fact that we have to learn is get now use . i live in korea , and in korea , the student need to learn everi subject that we do , so we have usual almost 12 subjest to learn , the reason whi i mention is korea academ learn is old , the subject we learn is the fact that ha been finish by long time ago , we know it , but sometim we are learn someth that it 's not use . the world ha develop and we have to follow that the technolog is realli high now , which answer that fact are not use to know , we can use it fact , but we do not realli need to konw it , becaus we can find the knowleg from the internet which mean we do not need learn about the fact that we do n't know , which mean we do n't need to know all the fact that we had to know befor , on the other hand , some fact are need to be known as common sens . the world is develop and person is develop , peopl is develop , so the societi doe n't want the peopl that good for everyth , which mean the major knowledg is more import , which mean we need to be good for one major thing . we can understand someth better with fact , which mean understand idea are better than known fact , like now develop countri , we have a lot of competit with the other , and we have to have major skill to make a job , so we ca n't realli think about the learn facter , becaus as i mention that internet doe that job , so now we problem is how much we underst about it , not how much we know . that also mean we understand the societi .
