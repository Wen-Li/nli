nowaday there are so mani car throughout the world . and peopl can see so mani car when they walk on the street and it may find limit place for car park . in my opinion , i agre with that in twenti year it will be fewer car is use than today . first of all , gener speak , peopl who drive car are make mani pollut such as air pollut , soulnd pollut and so on . these pollut may affect peopl 's health and even get some seriou diseas . in addit , everyday on the highway there are so mani car in the morn and those driver who are rush and want to keep time so they alway overspe and then may make accid . if there can make less car thu it is not onli prvent the traffic jam , but also few accid in a day . howev , sometim it 's much easier than we act . if peopl want to make less car-us and make sure it realli work ; here i provid some recommend that may handl these problem . one of the solut is that peopl can peopl should use less by drive car and they can use some other public vehicl to replac to drive car . for exampl , mrt , bu etc . thi will reduc lot of air pollut and it can be provid more car-park space for other driver and it can prevent peopl are pollut by the car . anoth solut is that the governemnt can also help peopl to perform thi activ use differ way such as make a new polici that limit peopl onli can buy one car for everi household and increas the tax of the care and licienc per year . therefor , it will make less number of car and peopl and peopl who do not purchas too much car to spend the extra land for car-park . overal , there is lot of car around the world and peopl should make use less of car . therefor over twenti year it can prvent air and sound pollut , traffic jam and even accid .
