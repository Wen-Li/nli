i fulli agre to that statement becaus of the follow reason . first , an alreadi success person will accept a higher risk becaus he ha a larger secur if he fail . when the new thing produc loss he still ha the gain of the success work action he did befor . so he ha a lower risk than a person who could lose everyth by experi with new thing . secondli , the hunger for success grow with the success one ha . a success person know there ha to be more than the alreadi achiev . the known old pattern will onli provid the known old amount of success . but to increas it there have to be found new unknown and mayb also unfamiliar kind of way which mostli have a higher risk but also a higher possibl gain than the convent one . if someon ha a riski charact he will not stop at the first success but look for more the whole life . the third and i think most import argument deal with experi with fear of the futur . if a person were success at least onc in hi or her life by take a risk he or she ha made an import step . by cross the border in one 's own mind onc the next time it will be easier becaus you get a kind of imagin what ist wait for you on the other side . of cours there is no possibl calcul with all risk , there will alway be some one did not think about . despit of that the person know how to deal with develop that can not be foreseen , so he or she ha no or at least less fear of them . the argument show , whi success on a high level is not possibl without risk at a high level and therefor i agre with the given statement .
