travel for me is as import as eat and sleep . in fact , i would like to travel three time per year if i have the chanc but that never happend . in my opinion , travel in a group led by a tour guid is more realibul and more enjouabul esspich for visit a new place . therefor , travel with a group led by a tour guid will be alway my choic becaus that will save my time and money , give me the background inform about thi new place , and give me the chanc to meet and know new peopl in the group . first of all , sinc my budget is alway law and fix , travel with a group is menim my spend cost . also , i will save time rather than weast it in see bad place or get lost when i want to go to a good place . on the other hand , i will find a time for haung out by my self on the street becaus the tour time is limit dure the day . anoth main reason , the tour guid will be the most knwn person about the histori , musemu , cultur , and food of the peopl of thi countri . as a result , i will benefit of listin to these inform and add it to my knolwdg . final , most of the time i like to travel by me self , so , it will be a great chanc to meet and know a new peopl from all over the world and have a new friend and talk about their cultur , in brief , travel in a groub will be alway my choic and i will recomend thi way of travel to my friend and my children in the futur .
