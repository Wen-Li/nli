life is a veri long journey with mani differ kind of period in it . we are born , than becom an infant , a teenag , an adult , an elder and final come to the end . each period ha good or bad part and enjoy to live . the most import point in thi journey is undoubt that you have just one chanc to live each part and can not chang the order . in my opinion , the most enjoy period in thi journey is youth . firstli , when you are young , you do not have to face ani import diseas that the elder bodi bring . human bodi is in it healtiest period and also the most good-look one . young bodi are attract , thu , you can do ani sport , eat anyth you want and these do not damag your health . it becom a disast when you can not eat someth you want like chocol or sweet , or els salti refresh . secondli , older peopl have problem due to their appear . they miss the bodi they own when they are young and each time they look in the mirror , they make anoth pace to depress . moreov , they lose their fertil accord to their age and enter the menapos or andropos section ; these are reaali hard time to face for peopl . in addit to that , when you are young , your manner can be accept by public even they are not ethic , but when you are older you carri the burden of respons on your shoulder and you are not easili accept as youngster by public . consequ , even be young is thought to be more enjoy than be old , it depend on person live it . thi is not an all black or all white situat and a person may have had an unhappi youth may have found happi later when he is older . whatev the case is , life is beauti everytim .
