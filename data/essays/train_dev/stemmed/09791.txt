i disagre with thi statement . i am onli a high school student so i 'm not realli sure about how elderli feel . but i 'll state three reason which i 'm sure about it . they are ; we are all same human be , gener realli doe n't matter , all peopl feel joy at differnt time . first reason whi i disagre is becaus , we are all same human be . it 's true that elderli as our grandpar had live in a difficult time such as the world war . eventhough i believ that they also had an enjoy young age . for me , everyth wa fun when i wa a littl girl . watch at a line of ant were even enjoy . therefor i 'm not sure how our thought will chang through when we get older but , i 'm still sure that we wo n't forget presiou memori . second reason is becaus , look at my grandmoth make me feel the age doe n't matter to enjoy the event . she like to go watch movi with friend and after come back she alway talk to me how the movi were and what she did with her friend , with twinkl eye . from these experi i 'm sure that she is enjoy her life as an elderli . last reason is becaus , i think that all peopl ha differ thought and feel of the word enjoy . i feel most of the thing which i felt happi enjoy . even on the train watch other peopl sometim mke me enjoy . talk with friend , famili and eldarli who i just met in the street is also enjoy time for me . as a result i think feel their life enjoy or not doe n't depend on the gener . it will be differ by how peopl think the event on their usual life .
