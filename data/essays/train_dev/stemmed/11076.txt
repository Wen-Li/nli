whi do we have the appolog of youth in our modern societi ? to me it is clearli becaus life sound better when you are yuong ! of cours some of you could say what we are eager of in our societi is apper . peopl would like to look young for ever ! inde get old is difficult to assum not onli morali but also becaus your bodi is chang . that is one reason whi peopl like to be young . but be good look is not the onli explan whi be young make you more enjoy life . actual it is secondari in my opinion . what is so joy with be young is that you have everi thing to built . you are in a moment of your life where you can still chose to becom anyon . no regret for the moment , no error in your background . when i think of my mother 's sister i feel sad for her . she is a person veri sour . she tri all her life to becom an actric and never succeed . whem you are young you can still be optimistc about your life becaus anyth can hapend to you . when you have noth you have noth to lose ! an other advantag with be young is that usual yo have n't got mani repons . you have a selfish exist , the onli person you have to take care of is your self . your not in charg of the educ of a child , you do not have to feed a famili . life is less stress . you do n't have to compromis everi day life to make everyon happi in your hous . special when you hing up on your parent financi , you have even less worri . i mention thi situat becaus i am luki , that is my sitat . but some young peopl have to endow their life alon of cours . an import point a realli appreci with be young is that social there are not as much convent than for adult . young peopl are more relax when they get in contact in profession as well as in social life . the proof is more older you get less friend you have . it is the case for my parent . it mu n't be true for everyon but it is a gener tendenc i have notic . to sum up be young give you a feel of freedom
