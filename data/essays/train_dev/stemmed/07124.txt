i agre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . in first place i consider that thi is a safer way to travel , special when you do not know veri well the place that you are visit . in second place , i think thi the better way to know all the histor place and the most import detail about an specif citi or countri . when you travel to a place for the first time it is almost necessari that a tour guid could aid you with the organis of a tour that result in the best knowledg of the place you choos to travel . moreov when your visit is led by a tour guid you will not wast time vist place that are no highli import , or that will not give you ani idea about essenti aspect of the histori of the citi or the countri that you are go to visit . within second place , travel in group is safer than travel alon . when you do not know the secur condit of an specif place , you will be abl to feel more comfort if you voyag with person that are close to you , special if your famili goe with you . in thi aspect a tour guid also could help by tell the best and safest plece to visit . as a conclus it is import to consider that the most import aspect to travel in a group led by a tour guid are : the facil to know the place , the secur that a group can offer and the good memori you will abl to keep
