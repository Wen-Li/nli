i think that there is onli a littl chanc that in twenti year there will be fewer car than today for a lot of reason . first of all today car or similar ( truck , bu etc . ) are the most common way to transport everyth , peopl or materi and there are a lot of road ( like highway ) destin onli for car and it will be a veri big problem to chang all the system that we use in few year and i am sure that twenti year are fewer time than the time we need to make thi chang . onoth evid of thi is that the sell of car is not in a decreas . i think it 's possibl that , beacaus of the problem relat with the decreas of petroleum reserv and the rise of ga cost , car will chang and they will use some altern resourc to function ; biolog and refresh resourc like wind , sun or hydrogen are the futur of the transport problem but today i think they are onli a futur far from us . the thing that is also possibl is that the way to use car chang . today we see al lot of car in everi road that contain onli one person . for exampl there are often a lot of car that are oblig to go veri slow beacaus there are more car then a street could contain ; i take the bu everi day to go to the univers and i know veri well thi bad situat . a way to chang thi think is to use more public servic , like bu or train , but i know that they do not work veri well so peopl prefer to take the car . one other way to chang thi is to organ peopl to have car full of them and not with onli the driver . i definitli think that in twenti year there will be more car or the same as today beacaus to reduc the number of car you have to chang the mind of the peopl , and thi is veri hard to do in a few year .
