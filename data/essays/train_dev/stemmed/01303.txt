i disagre with the statement , `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . the first reason whi i disagre with the statement is that i know young peopl who spend time in help their commun . in my univers , there are activ that involv help the commun . for exampl , there is a marathon come up thi month , and some of my classmat will help organ thi event . it involv interact with the commun , and it should be a great help for the commun . the second reason whi i disagre with the statment is that young peopl do not have enough time to spend on their commun . if they go to school or colleg , they have to spend time on their studi , so even if they have the will to spend time help their commun , they can not do so becaus they just do not have the time . i think that it is enough for young peopl to help when they can , and that it should not be someth that they are forc to do . i am busi most of the time studi , and it is hard for me to particip in event just becaus i do not have enough time . a third reason whi i disagre with thi statement is becaus i do n't think there is enough inform sent to young peopl about event that are happenen in their commun . if they do not have the inform , they can not help , even if they have the will to do so . i know that if i look hard for inform , i should be abl to find way in help my commun , but it is not easi to find thi kind of inform . in conclus , i think that young peopl nowaday give enough time to help their commun . there are peopl who are activ involv in activ in their commun , and if they have the time and inform , i think mani peopl will be will to help . i think the most import thing to do is to inform young peopl about event happen in their commun . i think that accus young peopl for not help is wrong , and that there is a need for an environ that make young peopl want to particip in help their commun .
