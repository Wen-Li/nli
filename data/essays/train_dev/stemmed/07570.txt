consid the develop regard energi sourc in the past decad , i can say that thi statemnt would prove to be true . the increas scarciti of petroleum , the lack of progress in introduc altern fuel , and a grow conscious of peopl to use public transport for their daili activ would all lead to thi outcom . although scientist and mani politician have talk about the incom shortag of oil sinc the earli 1990 , we have actual felt the first sign of a bigger crisi in the year to come as the barrel price of oil reach over $ 70 last year . it is now known that the disput area and countri with weaker tie and interest with the globalis world could shake the whole world with limit the product or distribut of oil as iran did it last year and russia did when it refus to pump oil to ukrain and as a result to the rest of europ . these high fluctuatin in oil price will be even higher in the come futur and mani middl and lower incom houshold would afford at most one automobil or mayb none . recent , the introduct of altern fule for car ha been a hot topic and even some hedg fund have move in to invest in these project . howev , asid from some substanc that can improv the perform of gasolin and lead-fre oil , there is no real progress to replac petroleum base motor . electr motor can onli be use in conjunct with the tradit motor and help increas the mileag of the car . so , with no replac , oil seem to be remain the main sourc of power for auto , in accord with the argument i made abov , rise oil price will still make these technolog unattract . as a result of the abov mention reason , more and more peopl as well as consciou govern adapt public transport . especi subway system are becom more and more popular with citizen and local administr as they provid a fast and comfort way of transport without be an extra burden on the citi traffic . for longer distanc , high speed train provid speed even greater than most auto and a comfort out of the chaotic highway . the chang from automobil to other mean of transport will be hard and mani peopl will tri to resist at first . howev , when there will be no other way out peopl will definit give the right decis and leav their belov car .
