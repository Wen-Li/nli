i disagre with the statement . i believ that older peopl enjoy life much more than younger peopl do . there are sever reason whi , first of all is that older peopl have more experi and can have a better idea of what they realli want out of life . on the other hand , young pepl tend to be undicid on what they want . second , older peopl know what they want , tend to be more appreci of life sinc they probabl have encount hardship to get to the point where they can enjoy life . with young peopl is the opposit . they do not have the experi nor have face as mani hardship ( if ani ) in life to realiz how difficult life can be . moreov , older peopl have work veri hard and have been patient enough to wait and enjoy life . it is true that young peopl have more energi and probabl are eager to enjoy life but older peopl have been wait a long time and they can cherish and enjoy the the moment inmens when it arriv . i recogn that older peopl are more skeptic and less like to take risk compar with a younger person so the way of life an older person might live is less intens and thrill with emot but and older peopl can enjoy their way of life as much as ani young person . thirdli , let us not forget that older peopl were onc young peopl . they can look back and judg wether they are enjoy life more at an older age than at a younger age . they probabl would come to the conclus that life is better at a older age just for the fact that they surviv and reach an older age . final , older adult certainli are , phisic , older than younger adult , but they can be young adult in spirit . they can enjoy life inmens know that they had a great life and that the best part is yet to come .
