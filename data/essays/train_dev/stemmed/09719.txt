i do not agre that statemet , young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . to enjoy life , their age is not matter . most import thing to enjoy their live is have strong perpos to live . if peopl do not have certain perpos and reson in their live , they might to spoil their time . even they are still young , they will spend their preciou time to just have some fun . i think enjoy life and have some fun time is not same . recent some american rich girl appear on magazin , and they show their daili life-ltyl , go shop , traver , atend parti . they are rich and cool . but they seem not to have some special mean to live . they just spend their time and money . peopl who have no money , no good-look , but have strict aim to live and the pattion about his/her life , they can enjoy his/her life . in addit , age peopl have much experi and more patint than younger peopl . and i think it is impot poin to enjoy life .
