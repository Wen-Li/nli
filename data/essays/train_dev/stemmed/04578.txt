base on my own experi i total agre the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . now i will give you my conspici reason . first idea come in to my mind is the definit of success , that is outstand which ha the same mean of stand out . it is to say those success peopl should be differ from ordinari peopl . how to be differ ? the answer definitli not onli do what other alreadi know how to do well . it is reason that the award usual go to those who tri new think and take risk becaus they are outstand . second tri new thing and take risk can make peopl more open mind and gain more knowledg and final make them success . when tri new thing you can get anoth point of view of the problem . i can rememb that my senior design project wa to design a control system for hot blast stove . perviou peopl solv thi kind of problem by classic control method , howev my teammemb and i decid to tri intelleng method although our advisor warn us that we might fail . guess the result , we not onli acheiv our project success , but also got undergradu research prize . read the histori book you may find that each huge develop of the world ha some relationship with the new invent . and more and more school teach student the invent abil is the most import qualiti to becom success nowaday . look at anoth side of the statement and suppos that if peopl onli repeat do what they alreadi know how to do well . no new theori , no new technoledg , no new applic , how could the world get increas develop . from all the point i mention abov we can drive a conclus that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
