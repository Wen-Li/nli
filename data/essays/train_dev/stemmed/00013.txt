today , most young peopl are veri busi about their work , such as studi , clab in the school , and thier some hobbi . becaus of thi , i think young peopl nowaday have less time to help commun and they are not enough . my primari reason is that school work have made young peopl veri busi . we have not onli studi in our school but also club activ . i am a high school student now and i am in the drama club . when i go back home form school i have to do my homework , and prepar for the check test which we have alomot everyday at english and languag art class , and also ihav to practic act from the club . i am the main person of the next show so i can not quit pract . these thing made my veri busi and not to even allow me to wartch my favorit tv show ! also , i think mani yong peopl are not interest in their commun veri much . some of them doe not care about thier communitiy at all . i love where i live now so i do not understand whi they think like that but mayb they do not have friend in their commun or they think thier parent are enough to help commun , so they do not need to . as you can see , mani yong peopl are veri busi about their school , and some of them are not interest in their commun . therefor agre young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun .
