in the modern societi , with the gener growth of popul and knowledg , more and more job and field of studi are avail . therefor , it ha becom a difficult task to choos a way of studi . is that better to special on a particular academ subject or to keep a good overal knowledg in mani subject ? as far as i am concern , i would first disagre with the idea that have a broad knowledg is the best thing to do . inde , specialist are nowaday more than necessari becaus we are alway discov new thing and expend our knowledg . nobodi can keep in touch with the latest discoveri in everi domain . for instanc , one of my teacher is a searcher in a veri specif field : model driven develop in comput scienc . thank to him and hi colleagu , new featur of program have discov and are now use by a lot of peopl . becaus thi teacher ha been fond of hi special sinc hi childhood , he ha made and still make some import work on thi particular field of comput scienc . moreov , when he is teach us , we can fell he hi give us the latest and most accur knowledg avail . thi help us understand and appreci the subject . thu , it can be a good thing to special in a specif domain mainli when you like it . on the other hand , it is import to say that it would n't be good if there were onli specialist in our societi . actual , as i just said , it is more and more difficult to know a lot of thing in mani domain . so specialist concentr on a special branch of a domain . sometim , they can even work on veri specif topic like `` how do the electron pass through the silicium in a transistor '' . thi kind of work ha to be handl by peopl who are not realli specialist but who know how the result of the research can be use . these person with a broad knowledg are also essenti . they are the onli one who can coordin the work and give them some util . they act as a manag in a compani . in conclus , i would say that both academ curricula ( broad or specif ) can be good . at least , they are both use in societi . in fact , the choic depend on the person of the student and the possibl in the univers .
