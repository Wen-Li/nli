teacher are constantli ask themselv whether it is more import that their student should understand abstract concept rather than learn fact . these two thesis were in fact respect defend by montaign and rabelai : the first believ in a well made mind wherea the latter a fill mind , for sure it is better that a student goe out in societi and in the world know by heart fact in their head rather than have an empti mind . yet , i believ that it is prefer to have a well made mind that are open enough to understand concept and that montaign prais so much about . most parent , howev , believ that their children should go to school to learn mathemat , know the date of histor battl , know that name of famou writer so that the children would sound highli accomplish as they would be abl to show off their knowledg , which as erasmu state is `` power '' . thi would gener impli that the object of go to school would be to gather fact . yet what would be the use of accumul them if the student do not grasp the mean ? thu , instead of be supercili , they would make fool out of themselv and would be dismiss as fals machin , in other term useless to the world . inde , what is then the use of have such portabl dictionnairi when one would usual be in possess of such book in their reach ? furthermor , with the frequent use of the internet , variou inform that we did not learn and that are need could be found in a matter of a minut . thu , it is not requir for a person to recit fact especi that hi or her memori could not be entir depend upon . what the world need which neither a dictionnari nor ani machin could provid is the use of one 's intellig to ensur that he or she take the most righteou or practic action or decis . such a capac could be provid with a well made mind and also with an experienc one . of cours , it is import to have some knowledg and learn idea and concept to forg one 's way of reflect and to gradual allow them to take their own person mind up but thi could not be done unless they have a well made mind . thi educ for a well made mind would allow them to understand new idea and concept and fulli grasp them . therefor , it can be said that is it more import for the student to gener have the capac to understand idea rather than learn fact .
