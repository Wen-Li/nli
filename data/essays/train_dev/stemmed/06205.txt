i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . from my point of view it is veri import to have peopl within a societi who tri to do new thing . thi is especi import when it come to innov . up to now there would not be ani automobil or plain if peopl did not tri to do new thing allthough these thing were connect to high risk . on the one hand societi need invent but on the other hand you need to have a look at the risk aswel . regard albert einstein and hi invent everybodi would agre that he creat huge valu for our societi . on the other hand the question must be rais if nuclear weapon exist today if he would not have been that innov . as most peopl are part or member of a commun or a compani , i would like to focu my answer to the strateg manag of a compani within a highli competit market . from my point of view the onli possibl to be success and to creat sustain is to be innov and to have innov employe . of cours there are a few compani stay in the market by focuss on their key compet and by `` do what they alreadi know how to do well '' but to becom `` success '' as mention in the question you have to be innov . of cours one could say that a compani focuss on onli one well known activ doe not have ani risk but from my point of view the risk is to get kick out of the market by anoth veri innov compani . there is a famou statement refer to the strateg manag of a compani and it employe which can be use for all other peopl as well : `` often it is more import to do the right thing than to do thing right '' . i draw the conclus that peopl tri new thing are success allthough they must be awar of the risk .
