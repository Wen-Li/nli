usual student do n't realli understand whi idea and concept are tought in school or univers rather than fact . which of these two notion is more import ? let 's weigh the pro and con in order to have a clear opinion on thi subject . i usual ask myself `` what am i do here ? '' while attend a math cours . inde like me most of the student i do n't realli understand the point of learn math which is total absract . it is alway about number ad to each other , multipli , equat , solut ! i 'm not veri keen on thi subject but in thi case i see no solut . for instanc , we all know that becom a brilliant architect or a great physician is imposs without acquir math notion and knowledg , but how can thi knowledg be use when we do n't realli understand how it can be appli on our everyday 's life ? in biolog for exampl we learn how the human bodi is construct , it anatomi , it strength and weak . these scientif fact are use at ani time ! by learn biolog we are abl to understand the reason of the consequ : how our brain command each and everi move of our bodi . .. thi exampl also appli to physic as thi subject is tought by show experiment work and display to the student the reason of all the phenomenon that happen on our planet for instanc . newton 's fall appl lead him to discov graviti that lead to the explan of other event . but in the end it is alway about math ! these eplan can onli be prove by thi import scienc and that 's the main reason whi thi subject must be tought , although it useless apper which veil one of the most import aspect of scienc . to put thi in a nutshel , it appear that fact would n't exist whitout idea and concept as the proof of a gener fact is imposs whitout demonstr hypothesi by experi and calculu . even if fact are closer to realiti than concept , these two topic ca n't be taken apart , they depend on each other .
