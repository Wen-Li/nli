i agre with the fact , that if you want to be success , you have to take risk sometim . i want to stress that it doe depend on the individu 's situat . for exampl , if a creativ director of an advertis agenc ha had lot of success with use one certain method in creat an ad , it is smart to stick with that method . at some point , as time chang , peopl 's interest chang and the creativ director need to consid a differnt method in creat an ad . if the director wo n't consid do so , he might lose hi client . thi is when i would say that it is import to take a risk and do someth differ with your ad . base on my own experi i have to say that i had more success with take risk at time . for exampl , i have great passion for the art and therefor , i have taken quit a few draw and paint class in the past . at some point , one of my teacher grade me down on one of my project , becaus appar i alway use the same method in draw , and i never tri someth new . thi is when i decid to tri pastel paint , instead of the good old charcoal . my teacher wa impress by the color composit , which wa a chang from just black and white draw . my teacher gave me a better grade , not necessarili becaus the pictur wa better than my other pictur , but rather becaus of the fact that i wa abl to deal with someth new , such as pastel . tri new thing give you exposur to differ perspect , which make you a more open person to new thing . if you constantli stick with the same old thing , you show a lack of flexibl . it also show that you can onli be success in the same area . if you tri and practic differ thing , it give you the opportun to show more expertis in differ area . if you do n't take the risk of tri someth new , you never know whether you could be more success or not .
