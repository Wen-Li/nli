the 21st centuri is the centuri of more technolog develop than ani centuri befor could achiev and the centuri of unsuffici sourc . due to the popul growth , on of the concern of the scientist and research is the transport problem . one side of transport problem is the number of car in the traffic . the traffic rush , the pollut and the ga are the problem of car use . the technolog develop may be use to protect the planet and find new sourc of energi or use exist sourc more effici . therefor , we can argu that in twenti year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today : firstli , becaus there wo n't be enough ga for all the car in use and secondli , there will be new way of public transport , like the millenium 's invent , the `` ginger '' , or cost-effici fli object . on the other hand , technolog predict on the futur were alway been a sourc of inspir for the scientist , but never been accur . for exempl , accord to 2001 : a space oddesey by arthur c.clark , we should have been live on other planet by now . or if predict were true , jule vern 's novel would n't mostli be unreal . therefor , we can state that , accord to the grow number of car in use , in twenti year there will be even a lot more number of car on the road . in conclus , we can say that the futur depend on us . if in twenti year , we learn to be more proactiv and begin to take initi , peopl 's awar of the damag and pollut of car could prevent the grow number of car in use . nevertheless , if we keep on persist on individu gain and forget about the planet 's sake , there will be much more car ride on the road everi day .
