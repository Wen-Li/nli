last week i read an articl in our daili newspap about who enjoy life more , femal or male . i consid about these piec of paper a veri long time and came to the conclus that it is more worth to distinguish between young and old peopl , than between femal and male . but nevertheless i am of mix opionion concern thi question . one the one hand , you might get the express that young peopl enjoy life more than older one if you observ from outsid . but the onliest reason for that is , that young peopl live their life more activ than older one . they tri new thing , have fun whenev there is the chanc to have and make their own experi in order to develop a person . student for instanc like to go to parti or hang around at the beach play soccer becaus they know , that in later profession life they will not have the chanc to act like that . on the other hand older peopl have gather a vast amount of experi dure their life . consequ they do no longer feel ani pressur to act like younger one . i believ that they also did have an activ , excit life in their youth . but with a certain decreas in age , other thing like famili , health or financi sercur becom more and more import for them . so in my state of view , they simpl have a distict way of enjoy their life . they get their satisfact by go for a healthi walk in the park or have a cup of tea with their husband or wife in the nice restaur next to the beach . unfortunatelli these fact are invisbl to peopl you observ from outsid , so the wrong impress might come up that older peopl do not enjoy their life . all thing recommend , i would state that neither the young nor the older peopl enjoy their life more . both group ha it own way to enjoy their life . the youth often express more activ while older peopl are satisfi by a calm and especi healthi life .
