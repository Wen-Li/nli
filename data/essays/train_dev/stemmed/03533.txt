i believ that someon should be prepar on mani aspect and subject . but not everyon could have the possibl to follow thi result and be veri skill on mani subject . sincer i like to be prepar on mani argument , i daili read mani newspap and mani book about economi , histori , scienc , philosophi , but also thriller and novel . i have seen mani film and visit mani place and knew mani cultur . overal for thi reason and for my deep prepar on mani subject i can recogn that it 's quit imposs to be skill on each subject . i believ that the special on a specif subject is the key to be success on your own field . improv everyday the subject of your special is absolut the way to reach mani posit result and the way to be the best in your field . for exampl i have took my degre in busi administr three year ago and after one year i decid to take a master degre in financ to be more special . and after some month i obtain a certif as financi analyst , so i think to be more special . i believ that is the way to be veri veri skill . stude , learn and improv is the right way to special ourselv . for me all that you can learn more than your special is call person cultur . all that i read and learn from the life of everyday is cultur that can help me in mani situat , dure my job or also dure my free time . know the differ cultur of the world and our histori is a way to look at the futur with a differ view , to be global and open to receipt other cultur can help me also in my special , becaus in thi way you can chang your way of think . so , to conclud and to answer the question , if you think to your life as a result or a mix of your deep knowledg and special and of a broad knowledg of mani subject , you can live veri well . it 's import to be alway in the middl , the excess in everyth is never consid well .
