i agre with thi statement . young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becous they have no problem , or at least veri small one to compar with older , that make them tire . in fact , if we stop now think about their simpl day , we can observ that they have no other thing to do enjoy themselv . on the contrari , older peopl have too mani problem and thing to do dure their simpl day as work , children , park , traffic and a hundr els . in my particular case , i live alon in milano and i have to do a thousand thing all the day so i can-t leav time to relax myself with the consequ that i-m often tire and i never smile . i clearli rememb when i wa young and how the day run speedli with no problem , but it is live . i think that we have to re-discov the young there is in all of us becaus it is the onli way to becom a smili person < and i believ that it is possibl stay close with young - life . i think that they possess the correct kind to live the life , the onli one we lost when we are young .
