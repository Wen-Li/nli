i think that in twenti year there wo n't be fewer car than there are today , i think they will be differ . peopl wo n't happili leav the opportun of have such a confort , they prefer go to the seasid with the whole famili without depend from a public servic like nation railway by have theyr privat car that could take them with all the packag directli from the hous to the beach with no delay and not trasport luggag by hand . the car in a centuri becam a everythay thing in the life of the peopl and onli few think they can do everyth eeven without that . but the lack of oil will rise in the next decad and the pollut is get too high to use thi resourc ani longer so it will be necessay to find new energi resourc to permit the use of these privat transport . petrol compani like chevron and govern ' scientit are search new way to give power to car engin , for exampl use hydrogen or convert sunlight in power , now thi kind of energi cost a lot , but in some year they will be the most use way to give power not onli to car . so the car will have probabl differ engin in 2030 or ( whi not ? ) they will go on rail , but theyr number wo n't chang a lot , mayb it will grow if the new resourc will be access to everybodi without make too much pollut .
