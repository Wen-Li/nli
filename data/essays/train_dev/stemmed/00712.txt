i disagre with thi opinion . i think , in twenti year there will be more car in use than there are today . i have some reason to think about that . first , some compani of car are now invent new car , like hibrid car , electr car someth like that . actual we can see that kind of car on the road sometim . we also interest in car that are good for enviroment . car industri will chang the their way to sell the car to custom . of cours thought of custom for environ of earth will chang in thi few year . second , i think that puclic translat is not convini at countri side . for me , i am live in countri side , i can not ride on the bu or train when i want . it is differ between the big citi like tokyo and small citi . so peopl who live in countri side , they are use their own car now . i also use my own car . number of car in countri side more increas than befor . but the other hand , now gasolin is so expens . if thi situat will continu , number of car may will dicreas . i imagin that reason . but , i think if cost of gasolin is expeins , bu compani will chang the time schedul not to move out . that is whi , peopl will have to use their own car . japanes compani like honda , toyota is famou in mani other countri . if they invent the new car that not to use the gasolin so much or someth , it will spread up all over the world , and then mani peopl will be abl to think about enviro of earth even if use the car . it is veri good for us . we should accept that kind of project . that is whi i disagre with thi opinion .
