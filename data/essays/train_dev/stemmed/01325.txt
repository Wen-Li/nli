peopl it accustum to travel with a big group and noth is better than go with a tour guid for achiv that . in my person opinion it depend to the place you go the desicion you may choos . personali i like the most travel alon becaus it give me a feel of freedom that isnt in anywher . id also like that becaus it the onli way to stay alon with natur and with my oun feel and thought . eventhough , it is import to recogn that go to a tourist place alon is not some much funni : you will may not danc with anybodi , or you may not get out of the hotel . on those trip im so agre with that statement . go whith peopl make you meet peopl , known other person , and the most import . share with those who share that life experi with you . in the other hand , a tour guid give you the oportun of a payment facil . you also have the secur that those organ give to you , even when you have to pay a littl bit more . when you are alon you chaleng with more problem , you have to respond for anyth , so , as good it is it , is the respons you assum . final i can said that in my opinion both option are valid depend on your point of view . mine is clear : i prefer even all the respons travel by own way and my own prefer .
