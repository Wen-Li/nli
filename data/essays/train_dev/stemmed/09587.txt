nowada , advertisemnt becom a veri hot topic that everyon want to discuss it . some peopl think that advertis are quit good ; howev , other think that most advertis make product seem much beetter than they realli are . from my point of view , i agre with the second opinion . first of all , the purpos of the advertis lead the businessman to lie to audienc . there are a lot of same product in the maket . everi businessman want to sale their own product and make money . whi peopl buy their product ? they can persud consum to buy their product by make the advertis . howev , if they do not describ the product much better than they realli are , consum will not buy thi product , so thay the businessman will not sale the product and make the money . secondli , the famou peopl like to make money by tell the lie to audienc . peopl are alway veri curiostiy . they want to know more about the live of sport star , sing star , moiv star . one way to know the famou peopl better is to buy the product which they introduc by the advertis . the produc know that peopl alway believ what the famou peopl say . for exampl , a famou movi star in hong kong tell the audienc that use thi mask wil let you look like 10 year younger in a mask advertis . after watch thi advertis in the tv , a lot of women go to the shop to buy thi mask . alll wise audienc notic what the movi star say will not come true . there are still mani peopl believ thi advertis . three month later , a news report that thi mask is veri harm to woman and it will be ban to sale . in conclus , it is true that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in order to be a wise consum , you need to know what is real and you can not believ everyth the famou peopl say .
