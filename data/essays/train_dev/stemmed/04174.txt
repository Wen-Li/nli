in my opinion , as a student , it is veri import to go deepli to parsu the knowledg in my major . howev , it is also import to learn and have broad knowledg in differ acadim subject . from my own experi , it is veri crucial for me , as comput scienc student , to learn more and more in my major . thi knowledg make me proffession and expert in my special and thi in turn will benifi me . for exampl , my grade will be high and when i graduat , i 'll have the apportun to continu my studi . even more , if i want to work in a univers or ani other compani , i think it will be easi . on the other hand , the scocieti , that i am live in , is not onli comput scienc . there are mani other scienc and topic i have to be a ware about . for instanc , i can not imagin that i 'll sit with my friend and other peopl talk about some topic and i know noth about it ! so , it is import also to have broad knolwedg about mani acadim subject . unfortun , in my univers it is not allow to take subject out of my field . if they allow that , i 'll be realli happi to take subject in account , art , and histori . in conclus , it is import to go deep in your major and parsu everi new in it . but also it is necessari to have broad knowledg that abl you to commun with other peopl .
