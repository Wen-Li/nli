i disagre with the follow statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today as follow reason . first , instead of car , noth will be improv and develop in twenti year . i can not find ani special reason which there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in addit to car , we use train , plane and ship everywher , howev , car are the most use and conveni for peopl . for exampl , it is veri easi to go from the hous to the destinaion for children and disabl peopl especi . they do not need to walk to the station and airport . second , there will be fewer popul in twenti year . peopl have their own car . if the popul decreas drastic , the amount of the car will decreas . howev , it is said that chines and indian popul will increas drastic . it mean they will have the chanc to get their own car in twenti year . for exampl , in japan it will have the chanc to increas mani car due to traffic circumst . it is said that there will be 25 % of old peopl live . i think they can not continu to use japanes railway and subway . there are a lot of problem for them . first , there are not elevet at the station . it is impossilb to use the station forev even if they are healthi . second , there is a ruch hour , commut time everi day . it start at 9 o'clock and finish at 5 o'clock at japanes compani . even if you are young student and offic worker , it is difficult to adjust to the curcumst . in conclus , i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
