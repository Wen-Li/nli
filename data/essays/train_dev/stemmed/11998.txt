some peopl might say that it better to a ` master of one than be a jack of all ' . but in my person opinion , it better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in just one . life is made up of not just thing , but a varieti of thing and subject . it is import for ani individu to know atleast the basic of almost all , if not all , subject . life is integr with variou issu . the main reason for me to support that experi and knowledg is need in variou aspect of life is to surviv in thi constant-chang world . world can take up ani turn in ani time of life . it is hard to predict the twist in the market . market in one field can drop down suddenli one day , and all busi in that field will close . so it better to have knowledg of other field , atleast the preliminari knowledg and skill so that the person can think of start up of new busi if one doe n't work . second point is recreat . if a person know few more thing to do life other than hi regular routin work , it will be like a chang for him , which he can enjoy and have fun . you get to know more peopl around you when to interact , and will help to build relationship between them . it a part of our duti to maintain a balanc of everyth in life . let us consid one exampl , current it the trend of comput and technolog , and mani peopl will onli take up subject in comput scienc and neglect other aspect like ecolog , sociolog and econom . who should care for the better and preserv of natur and nation , if no person is knowleg about the least the basic of ecolog . everyon should be awar of thing take place in and around hi place , hi societi and nation as a whole . gener knowledg is requir to be successful in life . everi busi tycoon in thi countri ha a vari field of experi and knowledg . if we consid the owner of mcdonald 's , who is not just a hoteli but a realtor too . onli becaus of thi , he is abl to start up million of mcdonald 's center in everi busi commerci corner of the world . he integr hi knowledg of market and real-est into the knowledg of food-industri . thu to conclud , in my view i feel that to lead an independ and success life , it necessari to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject and strongli agre with the statement .
