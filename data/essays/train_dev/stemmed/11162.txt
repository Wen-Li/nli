i think that thi statement is true , but not complet . i think it 's true that ` success peopl tri new thing onli do what they alreadi know how to do well ' . in fact i think that a lot of peopl who had success are n't so differ from other peopl , for exempl they have the same intellig or possibl that a normal person , but they had successf becous they put all their energi in their work or , gener , in all thing that they do . i can think about a lot of exempl who can be industri men , writer , teacher and opinionist . but without tink about great man , i can also think about myself experi in my life . all the time that i have done a work in summer , i have seen peopl who work veri hard have success and improv their situatio at work . i disagre with the statement becous i think that 's not complet . in fact i think that in the histori there are a few peopl who began successful becous they were special and quit differ from ather peopl . i can rememb for exemplesmarx , who probabl wa the best thinker in the stori , and he creat a complet new teori about economi and social problem . i can think about leonardo da vinci , newton and mani nobel 's prize and i think that it is not possibl that they are similar than me and that there is a littl number of man who can do great thing that noon can do . i think they are special . conclud i think that there are situat where it is n't import how do you work hard and where is more import if you know someon who can help you or who can permit to you have a job or success . and it 's for that that i have a littl fear for my featur in work and in all that i will do .
