accord to me the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guid . first of all , the best way to enjoy to travel is to go with an other person , it n't good to go with a group , becaus it 's difficult to share your feel and make a plan quickli and effici with mani peopl togeth . for exampl if you need to shop you have to be worri about of the feel of your group , but it 's more easi when you travel with a friend or a menber of your famili to chang the schedul of your journey . secondli , all of your mouvement dure the travel are restrict becaus you are in a group . for instanc , if you have plan to enjoy to eat in differ restaur , if you will meet mani new peopl , it 's not possibl to do thi in a group becaus dure the travel you are alway with your group , so you do n't have the time to meet someon and the travel can be borri . final , if you travel with a guid you are not abl to quit the group and to do what you want to do . you have to follow the instruct of the tour guid it 's like a travel inform that 's not good . for exampl if you go to some countri in africa like ivori coast , all the tourist like to go to yamoussokro to see the biggest cathol church in the world , the tourist do n't take the time to visit the capit which containt some interest stuff too . in conclus the best way to travel is with a partner like a friend or a menber of your famili it 's more fun . on the other hand , that depend of what are you plan to do and what 's your purpos . for instanc if you want to travel for a histori class or whatev . i agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . in fact you can take all the inform who want about the topic of your class .
