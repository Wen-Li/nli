most of peopl like travel all over the word and everi one have hi personatli which differ from othr . they have to think how they will sped time and make plan for that . i disagre to travel in a group led by a tour guid becaus mayb he ha differ interst and ther is no time for rest . first , travel in a group led by a tour guid is not alway good becaus i have my oppinon about which place i prefer to visit our to spend long time in one place . for exampl , five yea ago i went with group tour from germani to franc but i did not find ani time to visit my feavoert place becaus i have to follow the leader in addit we have big differ in age . so i will not did travel with a group leader . second , there is a spicfic time for us to visit mani place and i have to follow the guider and lisson to him so you can not rest if you like thi or that place becaus he ha plane for the trip . while travel in a group led by a tour guid good to see mani thing in short time and with a person who ha knowldg but it nice to do what you want with out ani bother . in conclus , evey preson ha a differ inters thing to spend and have a good time when he travel . i disagre with travel in a group led one guid becaus , i have my interst and i travel to spend a lot of my time in rest and relax not for follow a guid mayb he is deffrent form me .
