in the follow text i discuss the question if in twenti year are fewer car in use than today . first of all you have to take into consider the countri you are talk about , becaus i am sure it is too difficult to discuss the develop of car sale for all over the world . in my case , i am go to talk about the amount of car in germani . as far as i know , germani is alreadi one of the countri that ha a veri high rate of car user . that is whi it becom harder to sell more and more car . moreov it is import to know that car are not cheap at all . thu , the wealth of a countri influenc the car sale as well . in germani there is one more factor . the green are an import power in the german govern . that can be explain by the wish of minim the pollut . peopl do not want to see their children grow up in a world full of car which pollut the air . on the other hand scientist alway tri to improv the qualiti of car and it is possibl , that they will invent a car which will not pollut our environ anymor . so i am sure , such a car would lead to more car in twenti year . one huge disadvantag of car is the troubl on the street . in my opinion it is horribl to cross a bigger citi like berlin or london by car . it usuallz take sever hour and even if you have been in a good mood , you will be in a veri bad mood after the third traffic jam . compar to car it is so much more comfort to take the underground in a big citi . more and more young peopl want to live in the citi and they grew up with idea of how to avoid pollut and that is whi i think in twenti year will be fewer car in use than there are today .
