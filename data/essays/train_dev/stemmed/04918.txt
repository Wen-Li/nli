i partial agre with thi statement for mani reason . young peopl have less respons , they just have to studi or work , or both , but after thi they usual have spare time to spend with friend , have fun . thi is a nice aspect of be young . young peopl have their thing to think to , but rare they 're respons for someon els 's life . older peopl have more to think to . they usual have a famili which bring a lot of joy , but also a lot of stress ; financi stress for exampl , parent 's have to think how to earn mani to go on , to make their children studi and have fun . young peopl do n't have thi type of problem and thi make their life more enjoy , in a certain way . young peopl want to feel strong emot and live new experi . everyth ha to be intens : loud music , disco , stay out late at night . older peopl alreadi live these emot , they know how it feel to be young , but they do n't need these feel anymor . they belong to the past . i think that when one get older , he find joy and happy in smaller thing . for exampl just by spend an afternoon with hi famili or old friend . there 's no need to stay up until the break of dawn , but just to live life and appreci it simpl thing . thi doe n't mean that older peopl can not have fun , it 's just a differ way of have fun . a young man 's challeng are ( in my case ) : univers exam , human relat , famili life and a job to pay cd 's and amus . grow up one need more , or ( i think ) should need more than just have fun danc at the disco . after the studi one need to find a job , someon to love and to start a new life on it own . a marriag is a great accomplish . the partner and the son becom the most preciou thing one could have . thi is happy . i do n't believ young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . the way of have fun chang with time , but life is alway enjoy .
