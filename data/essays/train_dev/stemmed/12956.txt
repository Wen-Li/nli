i agre on thi statement . i think peopl loos stenght and other physic abil as they get older and also they loos free time to have fun . young peopl can enjoy there time without ani matter of money or time . i think that older peopl doe not have time to enjoy life . what they have in mind is the repons of there famili and the worri of of children , so they need to work work and work for their famili . if they stope work no one will help your famili nor your self . thi belief is a common senc to teenag . we all believ that peopl work doe not have the extra stenght to entertain their self . on the contrari , teenag have both the srenght and time . we use our time luxuri as it seem etern . we do not have to think of respons . therefor what we do in our dili life is to have fun everiday ani minut , and do not think about the futur . we use our time onli to entertain our selv . teenag are free to do ani thing . most of the teenag in japan think to enjoy life . young peopl still have not seen the hard of life becaus they still do not have the respons . but i think that is not bad . young peopl can use that time freeli to get matur . the young age is fill with experi and their experi make their life so enjoyabl
