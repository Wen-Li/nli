some peopl say the success peopl are the one who tri new thing and take risk . on the one hand , that is true . on the other hand , success peopl are also peopl who onli do what they do the best . my point of view on that point is success peopl are peopl who do both of these thing . first , a lot of success peopl are peopl who tri new thing and concept and also took risk . the best illustr i can take on that point is steve job , ceo of appl . hi compani wa special in comput scienc . howev , he decid to take the risk of a new market : the mp3 player market . now , he succeede in impos hi ipod as the refer in the market . almost everybodi know what is an ipod and want to have one . the new market strategi he use is also an aspect of hi success . with a good concept , new idea , and a great part of risk , peopl arriv to succeed but unfortun thi is not alway the case . second , peopl also succeed by do onli what they know to do well . some person are veri good in their special . they are even so good that they could not be replac in a compani and then access to leader role . for instanc , my father wa a busi engin . he wa so good in what he did that he wa promot everi year until reach the role of director of the sale . he did not have new concept and he did not take risk too but he succeed veri well in do what he knew to the best and i consid him as a sucess peopl . third , my point of view on the subject is the follow : success peopl are often peopl who tri new thing and take risk in what they do well . i am convinc that if one is special in a domain and tri new concept in that domain he ha more chanc to success . for exampl , the person who creat ebay is a veri relev illustr . he wa a comput scienc engin and want to make a websit for the exchang of stamp . that websit becam a true success and nowaday everi kind of thing are exchang on ebay . if he had open a shop , i am not sure he would have obtain so much success in hi compani . to conclud , i do not total agre with the statement . some peopl obtain success in tri new thing and take risk but other also reach success by do onli what they do the best .
