the pace of the develop in scienc and technolog is hard to compar with ani of the previou period . we wit a post-industri revolut , or in other word we are transform into a knowledge-societi . with thi great transform , academ world is also reshap it way of do research . the number of the research area are increas and interact among disciplin becom more frequent . in thi context , a broad knowledg of mani academ subject will contribut much more to our scientif knowledg than to special in one specif subject . special in one specif area is sometim good for instanc , in discov a new medicin . but , there may be wait a number of opportun with a broad knowledg of academ subject . therefor , in scientif research there is an incres tendenc to make inter-disciplineri studi . for exampl , econom and physic are rather differ two subject . but , scientist from these field are arrang joint-congress in order to find solut to the problem of thei field . biologist and sociologist are collabor to understand the natur of the behavior of anim live togeth like ant . thi kind of inter-disciplineri approach can open new door for some critic invent . use nano-technolog for some vital heart problem save a lot of peopl life or at least increas the qualiti of their life . final , in a veri rapidli develop enviro of scienc , inter-disciplineri studui will bring a lot of supris to our live . so , it is better to have a broad knowledg of academ subject and educ system much revis with thi approach .
