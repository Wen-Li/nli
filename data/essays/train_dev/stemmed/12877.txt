mani peopl can think that the more you go to school the more you will be abl to understand the world . they think that go to univers make you becom an open-mind person . at the univers you learn theori - idea and concept - but what will theori be use for you if you have n't ani practic - fact ? for exampl , i am a civil engin student and at school i 'm learn scienc of structur or how calcul the rate of steel you have to put in concret to make a good prestress concret ? the theori look pretti good . howev in fact when you are on a site work all that theori is not help . it 's onli the experi that will give you the good rate of steel . even if i think that understand the concept of prestress concret is veri import , onli the fact will show you how to be a good civil engin . to illustr , i will give my exampl . last summer i made a train cours in a hous build compani . even if i had studi civil engin for one year , i wa unabl to give order to plumber or electrician or other handwork becaus i did n't know in fact , in realiti , on the site , how they can execut the plan . i think that concept and fact must be taught togeth . you have to understand the concept and to know to what they are relat to in the real world . it 's import to alway be connect to the realiti . an idea without it applic can be misunderstand . speak of aid without speak of the real danger in all countri , without speak of africa 's problem could make a student think that it ca n't happen to him , that it is a rare diseas , that he 's not conern . that is not accept .
