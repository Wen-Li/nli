in everi time and everi part of the world , young peopl are critic that they had chang for bad , especi by the adult . and alway it is partli true . but thi time i disagre with the statement , which say young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . i think , nowaday young peopl rather do give enough time to help their commun . today , let me explain my opinion and support reason . first of all , young peopl are said to be so much indulg that they do not contribut for the commun by the adult . but i think , they becom much more activ for their commun than adult say . i saw a documentari film about the cleen-up project in shibuya . in that film , even girl call gal or guy like teamer , who are most like to be explain dull and infavor of anyth , take part in the project . actual , when gal express their opinion to other , they seem to be more enthusiast than ani other adult same particip in the project . so it mean that they sincer think of their commun , and give their time and passion . and secondli , someon say that young peopl are not interest in their commun so they do not give their time in to help their commun . but i oppos that opinion either . my friend take part in sanja festiv in asakusa for 10 year , and she found interest in it . and amazingli , not onli her is the person who think that . year by year the young peopl who take part in the festiv increas . it mean that , if commun open up to youth and commun with them more , young peopl interest in their activ . i think , everyon should do someth befor be analog to young peopl for how less help young peopl are , and how less time young peopl use for commun . youth alway have interest , and time for their commun to use . i can say that , onli if have veri littl opportun , young peopl are more activ for help their commun .
