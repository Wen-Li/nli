first of all i would like to write that i am in complet agreement with the statement . let me say some of the reason that support my decis : sinc there are more innov and new thing come in , the young peolp spend their time do thing that in the near futur do not contribut with the develop of their commun . as an exampl i would like to say some exampl about what the young peolpl of my countri do at the moment and what the young peolpl did befor . i rememb when i wa at the school , the teacher took us to differ place of the citi in order to do social activ with the poor peopl , we braught them food , toy , cloth , and it wa realli satisfactori for all of us . in addit to all thi activ , at the end of the school , i mean in the last year , we had to do a social project whit the commun and it wa a part of the grade at the end of the year , but anyway we did that for other reason ... `` help the peopl '' . howev , after to have finish the school , i still carri on with thi kind of activ and some of friend also do that yet . on the other hand , when i look at the young peopl now , i get surpries how the life chang and how the activ that we use to do it befor do not exist right now . what the zoug peopl are interest in ? ... go to the disco , play x/box , playstat , internet , watch t.v , etc. and some other activ that do not contribut with the integr format of the person . i think that much of the behaviour the young peopl have , are come from the rapidli chang of the world . howev we can not forget that we do not live alon , we live with other peopl that probabl need our help and we have not realis yet . .
