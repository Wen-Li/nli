in fact , i do not agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . what is the reason to support my point ? in the point of the compani , the purpos of advertis is to promot their product . of cours they will advertis their product perfect to attract more custom to purchas them . onli in that way , they could gain more benifit to their compani . so here come the trick . instead of tell the weak of thier product to the custom , the compani just repeat the good of them . after all , the expenc of the advertis and market is extrem high . for instanc , the cost of advertis in tv is charg per second . in order to reach the best profit , absolut they must make the product the best . therefor , it would not hard to understand that whi product seem so wonder in the advertis . in other way , custom chose what they are go to buy by the introduct of advertis . as what we mention about the compani 's concern , it is a huge differ between what custom need and what compani want ! so what is the best way for both custom and compani ? it would be better if custom could check the detail more deepli befor buy the product and the compani should tell us more dure theadvitis
