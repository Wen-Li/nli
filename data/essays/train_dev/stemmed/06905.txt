it is state by some that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in time we have seen that the use of car ha increas and in my opinion , the possibl of it decreas are veri low . the automobil industri is just start to develop and improv it self . they are find new way to satisfi a custom 's need and to attrackt a varieti of peopl . nowaday there are car for all type of activ , which come in mani shape , color and size . they appeal to the young gener also , make car that are equip with the latest technolog . famili car are much more comfort and the imag of the tradit sport car ha chang . sinc peopl are becom more and more concern with polut , car manufactur have been tri to come up with a car that work on natur energi . of cours , a car like thi is realli expens , but it may soon becom a most want car . i believ that the car industri is evolv along with the need of our time and is make out of car a need to have object . and as more peopl can afford a car , due to the econom improv , sale will grow all around the world . car industri may one day reach place that are in state of poverti right now , but that in twenti year or more will step into a better econom situat . so thi can onli increas sale . we are also find new way to connect part of the world that have been isol from the rest of the world . so as new road to travel are made , need to travel in will be extrem necessari . final , i believ that in the futur , although it might chang it form , car will alway be use and even by a larger amount of peopl .
