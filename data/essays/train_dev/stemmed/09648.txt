the issu at hand is about the type of studi . it is veri import becaus thi choic ha a lot of consequ for the futur . i think that it is better to know mani academ subject than to special in onli one specif subject . although there are good reason for both , i realli think that the reason support the statement are more than the other and more import . first of all , i think that the real life is never about onli one specif topic . i think that peopl need to know a lot of differ thing in differ subject not onli in order to be appreci from the other , but , for exampl , to commun with other peopl . addit , i think that there are not fix boundari between the differ subject . those boundari are made by the human in order to classifi and to organ the knowledg . but , as i have seen in my studi , all the `` differ '' subject are in realiti connect . for exampl , artifici intellig is not onli about comput scienc , but it is connect with a lot of other subject . it is connect to biolog ( biolog inspir algorithm and artifici vision ) . to electron ( for the robot ) , to philosophi ( differ type of logic and problem in the differ logic ) ... so , it is import , in order to understand well a subject , to know also other subject . anoth import consider is about the capabl of reason . i think that if student studi differ subject , they are more like to reason and to connect all the inform . on the other hand , if student studi onli one subject , they will not be abl to reason . their mind are close onli to specif inform . final , i think that it is more interest for a student to learn someth about differ subject rather than to learn onli about one subject . i discuss thi opinion with some friend and all of them agre with me . in conclus , as my essay explain , i think that it is better to know mani differ subject ( even not in depth ) than special in one specif subject .
