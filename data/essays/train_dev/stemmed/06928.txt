some peopl think that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guid and other peopl prefer to travel alon . i prefer to travel alon with my own organis for differ reason . i disagre with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i want to explain you my opinion and give you person experi . first , when you travel in a group led by a tour guid , thi person propos you to visit onli the most import place and not obligatori the most interest place . for exampl , i travel in india for two month alon , without guid and i visit and i discov a lot of small place veri interest . i visit villag and i can undersand the real cultur of thi countri in thi small place . second , the tour guid is often an intern person and not a local guid . i think thi point is veri import . nobodi can explain you a countri like a local peopl . one time i travel in pari and i take a tour guid to explain me the stori of `` versail '' . thi guid wa japanes and she speak not veri well french ! i like to spend time to speak with the other peopl of a countri . third , i like to be free when i travel . i like to stay one night more in a place if i like thi place . when you travel in a group , you need to follow the guid . i understand that a lot of peopl prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guid . for instanc , old peopl can enjoy , becaus they have a good organis with thi way to travel . howev , i prefer to travel alon an to be free . i respect an other opinion but i am sure that the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guid .
