ye , i agre with thi statement . i think when student understand the idea , of cours they will learn the fact . firstli , student should n't concentr on the fact , when they just start to learn it . i am a student , i know it is more import for me to understand how doe the teacher think about the question and the way she think , what are the import point , and how can i catch it . therefor , i can translat it into my own way , and then i can find the fact . secondli , student suppos to know that we studi not onli for the test or the deploma , we want to make us more knowledg , so they should consentr on the idea but not the fact . athought the fact is also import , it is more import to understand the idea . thirdli , as my opinion , i realli prove that understand idea is more import . when i in the primari school in china , i learn all the basic algebra . but at that time , i am too young to understand the idea , so i just remeb the fact . after i graduat , i went to amiddl school , i found that i complet confus about all i learn in primairi school . so after that , i know to understand idea and concept than it is for me to learn fact . i remeb that a famou author said : first , you should learn the fact , but after that it is more import for you to uderstand the idea , the way that peopl use to think . on the other hand , if you just learn the fact , you just copi the answer into your mind . it is same like you eat the food which other peopl have alreadi eaten . nobodi want to be a memori machin , student should be the peopl who invent the idea . in a word , understand idea and concept are more import than just learn the fact . in that way , you are a wise person .
