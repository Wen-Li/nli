in my opinion it is more import for a student to understand idea and concept than it is for him to learn fact . first of all , when a student learn a lesson , it 's more import for him to undertand the mean of hi lesson than just read and repeat what he ha just red . for exampl in law class , after read fact the teacher alway tri to make the student understand the reason whi the juge take a decis . first , the juge analys the fact through the law text , and after that he use the custom , the moral , and the social attitud to understand reason of those fact and to take a decis . secondli , in a passag analys , a student ha to know `` what '' appen to be abbl to understand `` whi '' thi think appen . for exempl a writer who describ a stori wo n't just give you the fact , becaus it doe n't make sen whitout the context , so he will give to the reader all the reason whi those fact happen to help the reader understand idea that he defend and the concept of hi stori . thi logic process is veri import for student becaus the fact do n't make ghim understand the reason whi he learn hi lesson . to finish , i think that learn fact and understand idea and concept are both import but they must be togeth for a better comprehens of the student .
