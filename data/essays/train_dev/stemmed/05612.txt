i disagre with the opinion that number of car in use after 20 year will be less than what it is today . instead i believ that the number of car in use will rise and will be much more than what it is today . i have number of reason to support my opinion . the world popul is grow at a high rate . sinc popul and number of vehicl bear a direct correcl , i expect that with more peopl , more car will be bought and use . it may be argu that more popul doe not automat mean more buy power . but it should be note the countri with high popul such as india and china are experienc high econom growth rate . thi mean that progress , more and more proport of popul will have better buy power . thi in turn mean that there would be a bigger and bigger segment that will be abl to afford car and therefor buy car . the cost of produc car is also declin . again with cheaper car , there will be more peopl who will be abl to afford car and therefor buy them . besid with research in identifi cheaper energi altern to petrol , the cost of run car is also expect to come down which will further encourag peopl to buy car . the govern spend on develop road infrastructur will also promot the car sale . govern tend to spend lesser on public transport as compar to construct highway . thi indirectli promot car sale as limit and congest public transport drive peopl to buy their own vehicl . henc more car will be use to avoid the inconvini caus by public transport . also there are social reason lead to disintegr of joint famili into unitari famili . besid the women that were previous more confin to home are join the work forc and move out . thi mean that while previous one famili of say 10 peopl could do with one or two car , now a famili of 5 need two car . the continu disintegr and women move out of home will therefor fuel car sale even further . besid , as human get wealthier , they look for more conveni option . it can not be deni that car provid the flexibl to take you right through to the destin as oppos to public transport such as train and tram where a person need to walk to a stop or station , board the train or tram , then get down at destin station and again walk to hi final destin . with more wealth , peopl will definit demand more conveni and henc shift to car . for all the reason abov , i strongli feel that there would be more and more car with everi pass day . car are today most flexibl and conveni way to travel . for number of car to go down , there ha be a even more conveni altern . sinc i do not see ani such altern in next 20 or even 50 year , i see more and more car hit the road .
