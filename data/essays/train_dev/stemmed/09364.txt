i do agre with the statement that it 's better to understand concept than to learn fact . infact i think that it is n't import to learn event , tri to rememb them without comprehend them , what you learn ha not to be a mixtur of inform but you need to know caus and explan of them . for exampl i can report my person experi : when i studi at the high school i did n't go on veri well with my histori teacher becaus we had differen opinion about thi same topic . she believ that student must know everith happen in the past , battl , import peopl 's live , date etc . on the countrari i thought , and i still think , that it is not so import to learn so mani inform , i 'm interest in caus , in import event , not in detail : i believ that if you focu too much on detail you will lost the main idea . it is also import to say that it 's hard to rememb fact while it 's easier to rememb idea and concept which are relat with themselv and wich have particular caus and effect . some yea ago i took a cours about techniqu of memori and i learn that to rememb someth you need to relat it with some other thing . in my experi at school i had the opportun to verifi that it wa a true statement ! i also think that idea and concep can be more util in life than the kowledg of a particular fact , it is rare that you will need to know a particular fact in the futur . what is import to say is that when you understand concept you understand also a way of think , of provid argument to support a thesi . to understand idea and a way of think is much more import than know three million inform or event : you wo n't need to know inform or event if you ca n't relat them .
