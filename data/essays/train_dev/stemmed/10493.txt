at first thought , thi seem a good suggest , but care weigh on the mind , we found that thi statment ha oversimplifi the way we deal with travel in a group led by a tour guid . it is true that there are benefit to travel in a group lead by a tour buid , but backpack or travel without tour guid is much with merit . even these day , when peopl say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , my belief remain that backpack is a better way of travel . therefor , i disgre with the statement . i would substanti it in three reason . first reaon for my statement is that to travel alon we could schedul our time more flexibl . travel without a tour guid , we could visit the place that we most want to go . we will not encumb by other and can arrang our time dure the travel . second , to travel alon without a tour guid , we could enjoy the process of do our survey . we could gain more knowledg broadli and deepli though the internet or from our friend . the joy not onli come from pay a visit , but also from the process of studi the place that we intend to go . the final reason for my disagr is that the tour guid might view or explain the place from hi or her point of view , which might mislead us from the genuin concept or idea of one place . peopl often have experi that a tour guid guid us to the most famou spot of one place but miss the most histor , meaning spot . it is onli becaus that the guid consid where to visit in hi own think , or hi own benefit . that is not to say , of cours , that travel in a group led by a tour guid is complet without merit . nevertheless , with the reason i present abov , i disagre with the titl statement . i believ that backpack or travel without tour guid could bring the most elat experi though the travel .
