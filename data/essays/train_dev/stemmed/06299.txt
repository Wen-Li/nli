peopl who take risk are more like to receiv benefit from their action rather than peopl that simpli do n't act . thi is not onli a logic assumpt but it is also support by evid which are true at global scale . some of the richest peopl in the world were ordinari peopl with veri good idea . an exampl for that is bill gate . instead of improv exist tool , he decid to project and invent a new instrument , the person comput , which will caus a revolut in work and entertain activ . he risk to wast mani year of work on someth uncertain that could just be a failur . it is now clear that he had employ hi time in a veri fruit manner and that he will be rememb as a geniu . on the other hand , some peopl succeed in export good idea to other countri with differ cultur background . a good exampl is starbuck coffe which is now sold all over the world and even in china . it must have been a veri controversi decis to take for the manag . but , although the chines societi is tradit use to tea instead of coffe , now mani chines young peopl drink starbuck coffe to identifiy with american model . on smaller scale we all can experi that if we take some risk we will have more chanc to fulfil our desir and be more happi . for exampl , you can decid to go and studi in the unit state . at the begin it will be difficult becaus of the languag constraint and the distanc from famili and friend . but if you hold on and overcom difficulti you will get a valuabl degre from an excel univers that will allow you to access to better job and incom opportun . in conclus , i think it is alway worthi to tri new thing and take risk . we need to rememb that we are given onli one opportun in thi world and we should do our best to be happi and make other peopl happi .
