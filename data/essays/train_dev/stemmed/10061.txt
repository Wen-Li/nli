the concept of success due to risk take or not is hard to explain , and it is also a controversi one . on the one hand , take risk is someth veri excit but danger at the same time . on the other hand , keep his/her knowledg and never take other is more comfort , but all the same danger too . but in my opinion , i think that the key of ani succ is to take some risk . first of all , take risk in all field of life make the person more stronger in his/her mind , even if they can be danger . but you have to be enough intellig to check your abil to know if one risk is veri danger or not . for exampl , when you know that when you will do thi or that it can be a threat for you , as you can lost your money , you do not take it . but in anoth way , the risk doe an attract thing to you that you want to tri . that is the viciou featur of the risk that can lost you . secondli , i think that if anybodi would have taken risk , our societi would not be so effect ! for instanc , the hardest part of the compani creat here were creat by peopl who have taken risk . .. and if someon never take just one time a risk in his/her life , probabl he/sh ha gone next to marvel thing . final , my devic is to tri someth even if you are not sure of the result . and if you are realli motiv , you will gain what you want and acced to success . there is no failur when take good risk , that is to say risk that can not destruct your life . but he most import thing is to be abl to know the limit . in a nutshel , someom who never take risk is someon too angri and who will never win a real success . to sum up all the thing , take risk is someth veri import in anybodi 's life and overal , it can make the peopl to dream about thing that they could realiz one day , and to look for the futur .
