i agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . in my view there are a varieti of argument to support thi statement : first of all young peopl do not have as much duti as older peopl have . the do not realli have to think about how to feed their famili or how to rais and educ their child . consequ in my opinion young peopl have a lot more flexibl . for exampl when i want to go on holiday to visit some of my friend in spain and can do it . as a unmarri student i do not have to ask a wife or a boss for the permiss . furthermor young peopl have more leisur time . you can not compar the time peopl spend at work with the time young peopl have to be present in school or univers . even when prepar time is ad a regular job take far more time . accord to my person experi my leisur time and especi my holiday are twice as long as those from my father . moreov young peopl are often in a better condit than older peopl . for me it is import to do as much sport as possibl . i realli enjoy to keep myself in shape and to train a lot . with regard to my father or my grandfath i notic that older peopl are often injur or can not accomplish their own expect . i recogn that thi fact is everi disappoint especi for my grandfath who had been an excel sportsman . take everyth into account i think that my year at school and univers would propabl be the best of my entir life . therefor i am a littl bit scare of grow older and be confront with the present disadvantag .
