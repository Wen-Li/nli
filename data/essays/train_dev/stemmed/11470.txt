i think that fewer car will be in use in twenti year becaus of sever reason . first of all , there is a grow environment awar that is go to drive the decreas in car usag . peopl are increasingli awar that current pollut level and even oil resourc are not sustain in the long term . even nowaday there are exampl of citi major ban the entranc of car to certain area in order to protect them , and thi could well be a grow trend look forward . an effici technolog altern to oil ha to be found but until thi outbreak occur , govern would have to find a solut to make the best possibl use of the limit oil resourc . therefor , a possibl solut would be to encourag the use of public transport while disencourag the use of car ( tax , fee to enter certain citi area , increas park fee , etc . ) in addit to environment awar , i think that peopl would actual end up find public transport a better way to move around than car . thi would obvious need a gener improv of public transport , but it seem quit reason that thi improv will occur with the govern align in a drive to restrict car usag . onc public transport is improv , peopl will without ani doubt choos it becaus of two reson . firstli , peopl like to travel in the fastest and safest way . public transport will be a safer way of move around than car , and it woul even be faster , as it could avoid traffic jam . in the second place , public transportatio will prove to be more cost and time effect . peopl will be abl to save a signific amount of money while travel in a more time-effect way , as not onli will they get to their destin in less time but they will also be abl to read or even work while they are travel .
