student are too often requir , by unskil teacher , to learn pure and simpl data instead of develop the abil to understand wider concept and idea . befor go on , i 'd like here to make a distinct between `` data '' and `` concept '' . a data is someth we could learn by heart , that could be simpli memor , for exampl by read and often easi to forget . a concept , instead , is someth complex and someth that usual , onc acquir , is almost imposs to abandon . with concept it work more or less in the same way than with experi : usual , old peopl state that `` life is the best teacher '' and sometim they 're right . life , with all it amount of experi , teach us how to react , how to behav and sometim the direct experi we make will be record in our mind forev , certainili in a more unforgett way that the inform we receiv at school . in my opinion , so , concept and experi have the same valu , or better , experi can help in understand wider concept and viceversa . the studi of concept , if done in a certain way , could help student in build a system of idea of their own : it 's reali import , infact , to be abl to start independ from one subject and to arriv to anoth , show a flexibl mind and the capabl to develop an autonom way of think ; simpl data alon , instead , are not suffici in order to learn how to link the inform student get and how to build an integr inform system . to conclud , it would be veri use for school to develop an integr educ system , expeci in itali that normal lack of practic aspect , which could coniug practic experi with the studi of concept . the idea of a common core curricula and of differ subject ( for istanc literatur in a scenc faculti ) which could enrich one 's gener knwledg , would be a good method to be implement . .
