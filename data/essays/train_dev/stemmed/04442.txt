peopl travel to differ place , to enjoy their vacat or to acquir the knowledg and histor improt of the place they are go ot visit or to spend time with friend and rel or to take some time off from their daili routin work . what ever the purpos of travel , i think , i agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . travel with a group and a tour guid make the trip more enthusiast than travel alon or with a partner . there are sever advantag if we travel in a group . for exampl , we will be more secur , get more knowledg about the place , interact with differ peopl , share food , play game etc . for exampl , if we travel to a differ countri , absolut i like to travel in a group , sinc it is a long trip and the other reason is that if we doe n't know the languag of that countri , some person or the other in the group will be familiar with the languag . if we travel without a group then it is difficult to surviv in the new place and enjoy the trip . more over , a tour guid know about that place and he will guid us . i travel to ooti a place in india with my friend and rel last summer . ooti is a hill station , with beauti senic spot and veget . the temperatur is veri cool . our tour guid suggest us what to bring withu in order to adjust with the cilmat . it wa a three day trip . as soon as we reach the place , the guid gave a list of hotel which are reason in prize and are good to stay . he took us to improt place that are worth visit and explain about them , he also clear the doubt of some co-travel . dure night we put the fire and enjoy eat food in group . childern in one group and elder in anoth group . we divid the group accord to age and had lot of fun . those are the most memor moment for me . i interact with lot of friend , even today we discuss about the tour . base on my own experi , i think , one can enjoy a lot , if he/sh travel 's in a group with a tour guid rather than travel without a group .
