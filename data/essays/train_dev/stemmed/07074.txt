nowaday peopl use in everi circumst the car : in my countri everi famili own at least a car and sometim they even have a car each . the car is actual a symbol of the contemporari societi as much as comput or mobil phone . we all know how useful and comfort it is to go by car , and how faster we can get to veri far distanc , but we usual forget how devast it is fot the earth . in my opinion sooner or later there will be fewer car : first of all , the price of petrol will rise so much that it will be imposs for a normal famili to afford a car trip . in fact , on one hand it will be soon veri difficult to find new petrol sourc becaus they are disappear and they are abl to regener themself olni in thousand of year . on the other hand , those big compani that held the petrol distribut have no interest in develop new energi sourc that could be cheaper for the costum . secondli , i hope that soon there will be more law against pollut : inde , the govern of all the world have to admit the fact that if the planet is too pollut there is no possibl of life for the human race . thi strategi should start as soon as possibl , give money for the reserch of natur energi and give more opportun to the peopl to consum less energi and to pollut less . there are mani way to do thi : inde , citi should have effic public transport , or mayb the peopl that use solar pannel or other natur energi devic in their hous should be help by the govern . in conclus , there is the possibl that the peopl will start to leav their car at home and go by foot : i am quit sceptic about it , but i realli hope that the peopl will understand how import the enviro is for our live .
