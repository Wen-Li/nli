i agre to the opinion of have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than restric yourself of have knowledg of a specif field of interest and area . i believ that one should be well inform and awar of what happen outsid hi domain and specialis . it primarili becaus of three reason : - a ) competit : - the societi we live in is a veri competit societi . . so when you are not well inform about what happen outsid your field of interest ; then you are serious in troubl and inde are lack behind peopl who have a competit edg over you . ex : - be a softwar engin ; if you dont have the knowledg of what happen in the hardwar industri or for that matter in the electron industri in gener ; then you might not be abl to keep up with the inform on latest gizmo and technolog . moreov other would have a competit edg over you . b ) uncertain : - the second reason is uncertain of the current field you are special to sustain itself ; say 15 year down the line . if you are talk about a technolgi which is be use now ; there is no guarante that it would be there after few more year . ex : - everyon is behind java and some other program languag . . now no one is sure that java is go to be there in the futur ; say five year down the line . so it better to have a backup plan readi for now wherein you are constantli updat yourself with other subject . c ) organis need or industri requir : - now-a-day larg organis do offer interdepartment transfer by cross-train on differ product thu give a chanc for the employess to move on to a differ vertic altogeth . . if you are just inform about a specif field and are resist against the inter-department transfer . it can realli hamper your chanc of move up the ladder in the corpor field . thu i believ that you need to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than just a mere specialis . .
