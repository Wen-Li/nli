i agre that it is import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . idea and concept are qualiti which are inbuilt in one mind but everyon do n't know the better use of it . onc the student understand how to frame idea and how to understand a particular concept he is deal with than it will help him easi to get hi other work done . on the other hand learn fact is someth which the student is go to learn becaus fact are fact and it wo n't get chang with time . but here it is more import for student to understand idea and concept rather to learn fact . thi can be best illustr with an exampl . let us take it for grant that oper a comput or i can say comput knowledg ha becom a compuls in today competit world . but to oper comput is not an easi job . to oper it one should undergo proper coach regard the structur & system in comput . thi is onli possibl if one ha access to understand the concept regard variou comput programm . onc the student learn the concept to creat hi own idea and thu use the comput programm in a better way . to run a programm is not a fact but it is to be understood with variou concept to be clear and than to introduc the idea . knowledg is god gift to all but onli few know the better use of it . for student it is veri easi to creat new idea in their mind but until and unless they understand the proper concept behind the idea it is useless . thi can not be learnt by learn fact . it becom import for an individu to plan , understand ant than onlt to implement an idea if and onli if the concept are clear . but the fact will onli lead to what wa go on in tha past . fact are import but at time they hinder the growth and develop by block new idea . onc the idea and concept are clear in one 's mind than it becom veri easi for a person to learn fact . on the contrari it prove to be a bless for the individu becaus he may creat a new marvel product or design use the fact ant than modifi with new idea and concept . fact come from histori and will remain till futur but new idea in present will improv one 's futur if implement through studi concept and visionari idea . thu onc again i will say to support the point that it is more importa for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact .
