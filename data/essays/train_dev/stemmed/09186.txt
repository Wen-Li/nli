ye i agre with the topic , young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . as far as my view is concern i would like to put some reason behind my accent to the topic . first young peopl are more enthusiast , hasti , inexperienc , while elder peopl are well endow with wisdom , prudent , jurisprud and compass etc so they are more devot to their work rather then to enjoy life , although they enjoy littlebit at their stage of burden of respons but as compar to young peopl they enjoy less . secondli , they have less opportun to enjoy as their thight schedul doesnt allow them to have spare time for enjoy . howev , they did enjoy at the time of their sophmor becaus they did not have such a burden of responsibl to maintain and dosent have the respons to maintain famili . i would like to give exampl of my father who is a manag in a compani , when i wa toddler he taught me to take fisrt firm few step in the path of my life and gave me good qualiti educ by enrol me in a good public school where i can set fort my acaedm journey , so he ha the responsibl to give me a good carrer in path of hi life by give much attent toward me he rather by enjoy himself he gave me platform to secur me futur to path of success . also , if we look at the cut throat compet between the world there is not much enough time for elder to enjoy life although thi same hold for the younger peopl but they could abl to manag time for their enjoy . it is also import for younger peopl to enjoy becaus of the studi burden becaus i believ that a healthi bodi can dwell into healthi mind so for the futur succ they must be stress free . enjoy for younger i believ that it is a dose for their tire nerv and if taken thi dose will sooth hi tierd nerv and rejuven him for the upcom responsibl . thi will allow him for greater success throughout the life as the elder have cross such limit they have no more spare time to do such enjoy . they have attend the proper opportun of enjoy at their time of develop . well i feel that as ani human be ha not such a skill sinc from hi brith he ha to develop those skill gradual and through the amus of life . so for human be at everi walk of life there is some state that ha to face him through hi knownledg and skill must
