comparison of understand and learn is probabl one of the most import discuss i have seen about the turkish educ system in the last ten year . thi paper will mainli discuss the posit and neg side of understand the idea and concept and learn the fact . understand the idea and concept for student is veri import for not onli for their educ life but also the real life . as an illustr , a phylosophi teacher may explain plato as onli a man who said that there ha to be three group to form the ideal societi : worker , soldier and the leader . it would not mean anyth to the student . becaus of thi statement , the student may think that my father is work as a doctor , my uncl is a soldier and i am see the presid of my countri onc a week so my countri is just like plato explain centri ago . contrarili , the same philosophi teacher may explain that the three group form the societi are the mirror imag of the three qualiti which form the good person . these qualiti are desir symbol by worker , emot symbol by soldier and virtu symbol by the leader . understand the concept behind plato 's idea are more import than the plato 's idea themselv . on the other hand , learn the fact are also veri import for scinc and engin student . with the help of the fact , peopl can understand the univers . by know the law of graviti , we can understand whi an object can fall from the sky or by know kepler 's law , we can understand how earth revolv around the sun . a student doe not have to know the the number zero is discov , solv the question is more import for him/her . to sum up , i want to say that understand idea and concept and learn the fact are veri both veri import for the student . on the other hand , i believ that understand the idea and fact make you a better person in addit to be a good student while learn the fact can make you onli a good student . so , i agre with the statement that understand is more import than learn .
