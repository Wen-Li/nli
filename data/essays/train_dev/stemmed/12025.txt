thi is an interest question . i do not reali think , that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than today . one of the reason is , that earth popul is grow everi minut . more peopl need more car . today a famili with four person ha typic at least three car and that will not chang in the next twenti year . mayb we will not have enough place and street for all the car , but than we will have to find new way were we can drive our car . that could be street abov our citi or in the underground . an argument against my oppinion could be , that we will not have enough energi for all the car in twenti year . thi ha to be consid . oil is get fewer and fewer and therefor more expens . in the near futur nobodi can affort drive a car with ga . but i think the human bee ha a lot of idea to keep the comfort of drive car . mayb we will use bio car , or oxzgen car but i am sure , we will use car . anoth argument is , that car product is a hugh industri worldwid . million of peopl are work in thi industri . what would happen to them , if we would produc fewer car . i do not reali see an altern to car . use the underground train , or a bu is not as comfortab as drive with my car from door to door . if i go with the train for exampl i have to take the bu to come to the train station . at my destin i again have to take a bu or a taxi . such a short journey to an other town could take a lot of time and also could be veri expens . with my car i can use my navig system an go from door to door in half of the time .
