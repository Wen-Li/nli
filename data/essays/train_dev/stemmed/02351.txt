technolog ha been constantli improv over time . thi process seem not to be slow down , especi becaus peopl 's need increas rapidli , and advanc in technolog are an import factor in the product of highli demand good . obvious , car are one of those . each famili own at least one car , and peopl use it to go everywher , even when it is not strictli necessari . in some countri , place are reachabl on walk distanc , but in other peopl would not be abl to go anywher without an automobil . thi is one of the main reason we depend so much on car , and i find it hard to believ that some day we will be abl to give up on them . on the other hand , the number of car around increas incred everi day , and we should consid the possibl that - as time pass - it could get quit difficult to drive around becaus of traffic . road would be overcrowd , and it could be imposs to move freeli and quickli from one place to anoth . besid that , a shortag of ga avail could occur , and thi would definit have a bad impact on our economi . in my view , it is veri like to happen that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are nowaday . i am posit that technolog will give us mani more product whose main purpos will be make our live even more comfort than they alreadi are . moreov , a more moder use of car would benefit the environ , and peopl will learn to use public transport more often in order to live better . we onli need to get use to live without a car , and then we may even forget about it complet !!!
