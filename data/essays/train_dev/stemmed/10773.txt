i think is good if you can have knowledg of mani subject , but today , if you want to be effect and competit , you should special in one specif subject . the problem is the follow : nowaday the knowledg ha been increas a lot and thi proccess go on . in exampl , the natur scienc is increas the knowledg day to day and there are a lot of inform about complic proccess as dna replic that year ago did not seem possibl to discov easili . on the other hand , the specif knowledg ha a great problem . when a person is more especif can lose capac to anal minor problem . it is probabl that the peopl with specif knoledg would tri explain all the problem under their vision . in exampl , a doctor who work with pshycolog , probabl he would tri to explain a lot of case trougth the pshycolog . therefor , i think that the best posit is support the two type of knowledg . the govern should care that peopl in their countri have the opportun to choos both thing and the govern could manag how mani peopl take place in one or anoth possibl trougth polici and fellowship for student . the final object is that the countri will have proffession peopl in both area and each area will have their function . in that case , the specif area provid knowledg to gener area when thi need it . in exampl , a group of research discov a new medicin and they should give the medicin to doctor who work with the patient . in conclus , both type of knowledg ( gener and specif ) are neccessari to support the scienc advanc ( the increas of the knowledg ) and the normal life ( the solut to the common problem ) .
