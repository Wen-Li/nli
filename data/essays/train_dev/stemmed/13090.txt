i strongli disagre with the statement . it is not possibl to establish a gener rule as to whether the age of a person determin the intens in which thi person enjoy hi life or not . to evalu the statement against real life , we would need to understand how do we establish who is young or old , where the frontier is , or , if what the statement is say is that the abil to enjoy life is directli relat to age , for instanc : doe a person of 37 year old enjoy life more than a person of 36 ? in what proport ? ( - 100 ) * (( 36/37 ) - 1 ) ? the extent to which life is enjoy ca n't be accur measur and should be determin individu , independ of age . as a person of 28 year old , i have met friend and colleagu that enjoy far less their live than , let 's say , my mother , and she is 60 . while they are work 14 hour a day and spend most of their weekend sleep and rest for a demand week , my mother travel around the world , visit differ place and enjoy a lot of activ that are commonli thought to be exclus for young peopl . activ like surf , play tenni or soccer are enjoy around the world by a lot of peopl abov 60 year old . on the other hand , i have also met peopl around the 70 's , like my uncl , that are onli sit in their chair wait for death as well as friend around 25 that live their live to the maximum possibl and are alway look for opportun for fun and joy . give the abov , how can we defin if age ha anyth to do with the way life is enjoy ? i believ that age ha noth to do with the level of joy and true happi , and that none asid for oneself can determin they way one enjoy life . i could say that my brother , who spend most of hi life surf , doe n't enjoy life becaus with no money on hi wallet he ca n't buy new thing , eat in fine restaur and go to differ place becaus he ca n't pay for gasolin , the truth is that if we would get to ask him , he 'd respond that he ha enjoy life more than anyon in the world . in conclus , i do n't think one can establish a gener rule to determin who enjoy life the most . i would leav that question to be answer by each person .
