i do not agre in total with the statement mention becaus there are two side of the coin associt with issu . let us discuss those issu in agreement with the topic . the world ha been transform in to a global villag . life seem to get busier and busier everyday with the youth play a pivot role in ani organis thay work . . peopl especi , the younger one are occupi with their job and other trivial commit associ with the job . it is clear that they donat a chunk of their time to their job work for the success in their career fantas a real comfort life . . with the develop of scienc and technolog ( which inde reflect in media ) , the social responsibilti toward the commun is lack . peopl no longer feel it is their duti to have a clean commun . let us begin at the elementari level . keep a street in a good condit is seen as a duti of the govern organist and all the blame goe to them for not keep the street neat . while a deeper probe in to the issu may seem to lead to a funni situat as the citizen especi the younger one are veri irrespons to it . the young peopl no longer feel that the duti toward the commun are to be fulfil rather than the right which they demand for . so , duti should alway outweigh right . the establish of social-servic commun especi to enhanc a feeil of duti toward the commun clearli assert the fact . now let us deal with the statement that young peopl have enough time to help their commun . it can be describ a the insensit of the author to look at the issu from a differ facet . what doe commun help mean ? it simpli mean have and donat time to a better , effici and prosper commun . i believ that even though the direct approach is lack to help and particip in the commun help programm , what the youth are do is inde go to improv their own commun by and larg . illustr thi ,, just think of as situat where the divis of labour doe not seem to exist . the butcher , milkman , vendor sell awid rang of thing , blacksmith , gold smith do not start do their duti . the commun would be liter in chao and thi would led to ineffici functuion of the societi . not to forget the central fact that the order in societi is basic bulit on the type of job the youth who compris a substanti amount to the soceiti .
