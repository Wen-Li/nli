the question of whether it is better to have littl knowledg in lot of subject , or to have lot of knowledg in a specif subject , ha been a theme of discuss for mani year , special for student . i person agre with the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' , but onli up to a certain point . if a person ha broad knowledg of mani subject , he will be abl to talk to other peopl about thi subject and develop a convers about the topic . if the person ha knowledg in onli one subject , he will onli be abl to develop convers about that specif subject , therefor there will be less peopl he will be abl to talk to . also , a person with a broad knowledg in mani subject can be seen as a better overal prepar and inform person . he could be abl to understand news , for instanc , better than a person who doe n't know what 's be talk about becaus it 's not hi subject . on the other hand , special knowledg ha it advantag . in a job interview for a specif carreer , for exampl , the person with more knowledg in the area will definet be chosen over the person with less knowledg in the area and more overal knowledg . thu the special knowledg guy can make a better live . also with more knowlegd on a specif subject you can discuss the subject with anoth person in , just about , all possibl detail . as we can see , both statement have their pro and contra . my person opinion and recomend to anyon is to have both : a broad knowledg in mani subject and lot of knowledg in a specif one . if so , you can defend yourself in ani subject and be the best you can be in a particular one . that 's also whi i agre with the school system that teach broad knowledg in mani subject up to a certain point of matur , or level reach , and then let one decid in what subject one want to special . i think it is the best way to prepar peopl to live in such a complex societi , like the one we live in today .
