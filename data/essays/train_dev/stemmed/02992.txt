the issu at hand is that is it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to specialis on one subject . thi is import becauseit make us know what student are actual interest in . ipef it is better to specialis in one subject rather than have broad knowledg of mani academ . first reason to support my statement is that when we concentr on mani academ subject we could not concentr well on all of the subject . and we can not do well in all the subject . when you take one specif subject and specialis on it you could concentr well on the subject and can do justif to the subject . for thi reason i think my choic is superior . secondli , by specialis on a specif subject make you learn mani new thing without ani difficulti . and you can focu more on a singl point in a better way . by research on the subject you can discov mani new thing in that subject . for exampl mani great propl such as einstein devot hi entir life to a specif subject in which he is interest and mani discoveri in that field such as mass energi equival theorem e.t.c therefor from thi reason i support my choic is best . final , all the peopl would not be interest or capabl of learn all the academ subject . for exampl if somen is forc by someth to learn a subject in which he donot have interest he can not learn it in a proper way . so it is better to specialis in one subject in which he ha interest instead of learn all the subject . so accord to the abov reason mention it is better for a student to specialis in one subject in which he is interest rather than learn all academ subject .
