success peopl tri news thnhg . it is not the bad idea . i think peopl should learn new thing everi day . it is fun to learn new thnig . and when you learn new thing you can know what is thing you good at and do better than anoth peopl . but if you alreadi know how to well on one thing . anoth peopl are know well to do anothert thing . that you do n't need to wori about when you tri to do anoth thing you will make mistak . becaus you can just tole the peopl is good at do for you and you can do the thing you good at for him . for exampl today there is a complian . there are three peopl are go to make chair . there is a who can cut the tree faster than everyon . b is who can use one tree two make two chair . and c is who sell cahir faster than everyon . so if today you are a boo what are you go to do ? to make each one to leant how to cut the tre like a , make chair like b or sell chair like c. but that will be west to much time and money . and it problem will not make the good chair . so i think if there is one person he is good at someth alreadi and you shoul keep him to do the same thing . and anoth peopl do what is they good at . if you do n't know waht is you good at you can tri new thing untial you find out waht is you good at . so success peopl tri new thingd and rather than onli do waht they alreadi know how to do well . thi will be work . thi waht happen in the world now and to becan more propuc .
