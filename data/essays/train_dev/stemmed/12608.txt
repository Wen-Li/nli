i do agre with statement i.e success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . iam of the opinion that becaus of there are sever reason and exampl , to support my opinion . man is a gregari person and greedi person man ha no sati faction with hi alreadi achiev . he is raedi to take risk and pain to invent new thing . for exampl in earli stage scientist are invent bycycl , and then invent automobil , plane etc . there is no end for invent , becaus technolog ha develop day by day . great peopl are alway think and think they are alway look for some progress . compar to olden day now technologyhad develop more . great peopl are think there is no end for success , it is go on go on there is no end . if there is end no mean , becaus great peopl are search for better to best now day popul are increas like temperatur increas , if there is no place for humanb on land peopl can live on moon also . so i strongli support the statement , peopl want chang in life it will be help ful to better live . if great peopl are also think like thi . they have no rest , if they are taken rest there is no further improv in our live .
