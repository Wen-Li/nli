i believ that thi statement hold a great deal of truth . to be success , we must get rid of our tunnel-vis outlook on life , and open ourselv up to new challeng . i see success as a rel concept . upon achiev a goal , i may beliv that i have succeed , yet someon els may see my success as quit ordinari and dull . thi is due to the fact that each and everi individu set their goal differ from one anoth . i can recal mani moment in my life when i had the opportun to tri new thing . unforun , i can also recal moment when these opportun were not taken . one of these distinct memori is of the track and field competit that wa held annuali at my school . everi year , my friend alexand and i particip in the same race becaus we were use to them . i would alway come first in the long jump , and alexand would be first on the short-distancd sprint , sinc he suffer from asthma and could not take the longer-distanc race . year after year , the race were the same for me and alexand , and our triumphant victori over the other particp seem to becom trite as the year pass . after the fourth year , it did not seem like a success to us . it lost it element of surpris and astonish . when the fifth year came , i wa sure we would particip in the same race , which by that time , seem more bore to us that a four hour toefl exam . howev , i wa surpris to see alexand sign up for the one kilomet race . i ask him what would happen if hi asthma kick in . i will never forget hi repli . `` the onli way to succeed over my asthma , '' he said , `` is to challeng it with someth new . '' that year , alexand did not come first on the race . yet he succeed . how , you may ask . he manag to come out victori from hi battl against hi asthma , by tri someth new and challeng . i end up get my fifth gold medal for the long run competit . now i urg you to ask yourself . did i succeed , or did alexand succeed ?
