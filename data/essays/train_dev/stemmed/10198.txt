there 's a truth that some advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , but there are still some of them are the same as they realli are . it 's difficult to directli say that whether most of the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in my opinion , there are onli a few peopl make advertis seem much better than the advertis realli are nowaday , and also in the futur . advertis are use for introduct the stuff what are expect to sell , so if the advertis maker show peopl some real advertis . there will be mani peopl who are glad to buy . there wo n't be a problem that if peopl have known the thing well , becaus after they have spent their money onc , thet will believ these advertis , and mayb some of peopl will regard them as their favour , whatev which kind of advertis they are . for exampl , food , tool or electr equip . they 'll be sold well , and the seller will get a lot of money in the futur becaus their honest in the advertis . so it 's good to make advertis as real as they are . we have to believ that nowaday there are also some seller who make advertis much better than they realli are . at first , a lot of peopl do n't know the advertis a lot , so mayb the seller can incres the prise and earn a lot of money in the begin . later , after everyon ha known the truth of the advertis , how can the seller get money continu ? they can not ! all in all , i think that not most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
