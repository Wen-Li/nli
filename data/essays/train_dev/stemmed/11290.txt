i think that the statement is wrong , not becaus of what it tell could be fals , that could be , but becaus it lead to a like huge misunderstand . it is not difficult from the statement to infer that young peopl nowaday have becom more selfish and less worrisom about their neighbour or commun . that is , that they ignor the mean of the word ` solidar ' . and the figur can not depart from thi idea . a survey conduct last year gaug the enrol of young peopl in project whose aim wa to improv the qualiti of life of the underdog , show that the ratio had dramat plummet down dure the last decad . we are unabl to deni the fact , but be that said , i think that fair should be put on stage . it may be true that young peopl devot less time to help peopl that realli need assist , but the measur is in absolut term , not in rel one . in order to shed some light on thi topic , let us have a look around the duti a young person must face today in comparison to those face by young peopl ten o twenti year ago . if we do so , we will find that it is rather difficult for a young person nowaday to find time to devot to solidar project . wa anybodi oblig twenti year ago to speak fluentli three languag to get a good job ? wa the burden of the academ studi so heavi as it is now ? an extrem competit societi ha made peopl concentr on themselv , rather than think to get their close environ better , not becaus of disengag but becaus of oblig . thi fact will fix the point . if we take a look at the number of young donor to non goverment organis ( ngo ) we will find that the fund have soar dure the last few year . if we asess the enrol ratio in some of them , like the red cross , focus on period of vacat like the summer , we will see a similar pattern . to sum up , young peopl nowaday devot more time and resourc to carri on project to help their commun rel to the time they can afford . the problem is that thi spare time is scarc . there is a lack of hour , not of eager .
