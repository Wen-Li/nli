i agre with that statement . i realli think that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . understand idea and concept is the key to learn everyth . i do not think it is possibl to learn in a concret manner data thing if we do not have previous clearli understand the real concept or idea of what you are talk about . even if certain fact have to be known , i consid fact as secondari in the process of learn . i will demonstr my thought in sever point ; first it is veri import to clearli distinguish the concept from the fact , for exempl the economi is a concept , although the precis amount of the american economi is consid as a fact . as that exempl indic , we can not clearli underst data thing if we do not learnt previous what is the concept . the concept give the gener idea of what we are talk about . the idea or concept give to the student the element to understand and analys by themselv data thing . moreov , the understand of a concept ha to be consid as an entir intellectu activ sinc it requir all our attent , our curios , and our capac to absorb and understand inform . for these reason , i think that data thing must be use to repres and illustr the concept and not the opposit . the fact must be use to make the understand of an idea easi , and it is too bad that the scholar system doe not often give enough import to the understand of concept . final , i believ en concept sinc i think that student alway keep in memori when they have understood it .
