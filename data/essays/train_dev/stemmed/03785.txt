i disagre with the statement that travel in a group and with a tour guid is necessarli the best way to travel . i acons that there are benefit of travel with a group , but i view these benefit as be veri depend on the type of person you are , the destin of your travel , as well as the actual purpos of your travel . if - for exampl - your travel object is to experi the peac and tranquil of the german black forest , it is veri unlik that you would appreci the constant compani of your travel group member . if on the other hand , you are seek to parti at a ski resort , have a group with which to particip in the numer resort activ may make your trip especi memor . likewis the benefit of a tour guid need to be view in context of the trip you are take . tour guid might help you to learn more about the histor and cultur fact of your destin , but they might make you complac in explor for yourself and interact with local . person i prefer travel with fewer peopl rather than with a larg group . also i prefer that these peopl compris a small group of select friend , whom i know well and with whom i will gener share the same travel object . i also prefer travel without a tour guid and explor the place i am visit without the confin of a pre-plan tour , as i tend to valu the opportun for spontanaeti , that vacat present . ( after all , is n't part of the joy of vacat be free to do as one feel ? ) . obvious thi prefer of mine doe not exclud the option of hire a tour guid for select part of a trip . for exampl on a recent trip to india i did apreci the littl gem of inform provid by the tour-guid as he led me around the taj mahal . nonetheless , i wa veri glad not to have a tour guid constantli talk to me while i wa explor the beauti back-wat of india 's kerela . henc i think the express statement can be true for certain type of peopl , at certain time and in certain situat . as an absolut statement , howev , i would have to disagre .
