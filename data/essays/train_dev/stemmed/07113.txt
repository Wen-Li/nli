i agre with the say that peopl should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to focu onli on his/her specif subject . becaus do so have a lot of advantag , not onli in academ research . but it 's also import for one to make real academ achiev . firstli , our scienc system have been and is develop rapidli nowaday , make the relationship and interact between differ subject more and more . so you realli can not just focu on one simpl subject , becaus the broader you view , the more it help to understand what you are specif for . as for me , though my major is comput network , i also read a lot about other academ subject such as biolog and physic , even social art . becaus i found when commun , the behavior of peopl in societi and the comput in a network is much the same , so we can use the same method to look deep into it and see how it organ and cooper , and we can learn much about both of it . secondli , a broader knowledg make one person more sensit . thi kind of scientif sensit is extreamli import when make scientif invent . it 's becaus person can find the similar between two thing and make some realli brillant solut or idea , which is imposs if peopl just know the littl thing of hi major field . in scienc histori , a lot of invet and discoveri came from a cross think of two distinct subject of scienc . of cours , peopl should first know well about what he/sh is specif . but too much special just limit the person 's eyesight and make he/sh blind . so the idea that peopl should broad their knowledg is right . at least it work for me .
