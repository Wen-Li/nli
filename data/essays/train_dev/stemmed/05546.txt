in twenti year time i dont think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the way i see it is that in order to leesen the number of car in use we have to come up with way to make us less depend on there use mean that we have to come up with mani new trasport way and system that are suffiti and at the same time effic enough to surv the public . there are a lot of exampl for make good trasport method that can be introduc although some had alreadi been inde intruduc but need to be made more effeint , satisfi and acces for peopl . one of those exampl are train and the subway system that have been intoduc in a lot of countri but not in other beacaus there too small or the countri cant affiord bulid and appli them . anoth exampl is the use of the bu system and again buse are use in a lot of countri but not everi bodi would be intrest in use bu case they may seem uncomfrt and unsatisfactori . anoth good exampl is the use of beycicl for trasport like what been done in some of the highli popul poor countri . if the the gover came up with way to improv the trasport system given in the exampl and tri to come up with even newer and more advanc one i beleiv we could see fewer car in use in the futur my argumet is just that it will probali take more than twenti year to see that happen the end
