i agre with the statement , partli . broad knowledg of mani academ subject is great , but focu on a specif subject is also veri good . i think it depend on your age and your posit in the compani . when we are in the middl school , it is better to have broad knowledg . a teenag do n't know exactli what they want . they may be eager to becom a famou singer in the more , and carzi about the idea of be a scientist in the midnight becaus of a sweet dream . and everyon 's interest may chang in the long run . when i love the comput game in my 14 year old , i want to be a game design . in everi dream of mine , i studi comput scienc in a famou high school . i attain the blizzard entertainmet compani ( the most famou compani which present pc-game ) . i wa the onli focu in the e3 ( the greatest pc-game confer ) . but now , i lost my interest in pc-game . be a doctor is more attr to me . if i put all my passion on comput and gave up my schoolwork , no doubt i wa regrat for that . but when we are in univerc , we should choos a subject to studi . today , no one can handl all knowledg . everybodi should know someth deepli and corpor with other . as old chines say goe : `` you know everyth , you know noth . '' if you do n't have your specif subject , you will find no job . becaus everyth you can do , there are mani peopl who can do it better than you . not onli your age , your posit in the compani also determin whether you should have broad knowledg or specif subject . if you are the manag , you should know someth about econom , administr , and the product you provid . but if you are a staff , you should care about what exactli the compani want you to do . so we can get a conclus : both board knowledg and specif subject is need , just think about which is better for you .
