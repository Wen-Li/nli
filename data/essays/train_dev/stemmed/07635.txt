if we look at the past evolut of the number of car in use on the planet , we easili realis that developmemt of car is strictli link to the econom global developmemt . that is whi , it would be logic and easili understand that the number of car in use will keep on rais these next twenti year , sinc it seem obviou that the world econom developmemt will continu . indead , more and more countri will be develop and , insid these countri and the one whose economi is allreadi well develop , more and more peopl will be abl to afford car . basic , the econom developmemt , which is the natur trend of everi countri , lead to an increas of live standard and purchas power among popul . basic , in twenti year , more peopl will be abl to buy car . moreov , the econom developmemt increas the need in transport , becaus it bring local economi on a larger and more global scale , as the global movement show . the more a countri is develop , the more it popul and it economi need tranport mean , such as car . but , mani concern about car are today express . can we keep on ignor them , let number of car increas with econom developmemt ? car are indead in the middl of sever present debat . pollut is today a signific concern , as well as declin of oil reserv . it seem that peopl becom more and more awar that they can not continu buy and use car as they do . there is alreadi a trend in reduc number of car in use , illustr by the common use of car , for instanc , for peopl who want to go in the same place . furthermor , some govern tri to encourag peopl to use other transport mean as airplan or train , which pollut less , by reduc the price of these ticket . but there is also an other reason for assert that the number of car in use will decreas these next 20 year : the econmi is more and more immateri , as the developmemt of the internet prove . we wo n't use car as much as today sinc we wont't need anymor to move for some action or activ . so if the popul will less need car , their number per famili for exampl will probabl declin . to sum up , i am convinc that the number of car in use will decreas , becaus we will have to adapt to new comstraint and also to a new life style .
