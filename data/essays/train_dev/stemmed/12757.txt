everi thing in life have chang and thi the fact that we can not dini and than we will give the exaccus to the youg that they are not do like the parent use to do to their commun and i agre that they do not . first the sociati ha chage as their is no plenti of time as the old ginar had for exampl the trafic and the commun now aday have more time and efford to go from place to place more than the time in the paset with the parent so the youg man doe not have the time to finsh hi won need and doe not have the time to care with other , and also if we are take in the same point of the communicatin it becam more expans to go from a place to anoth and the youg doe not have thi enough money to go to help in other place . second the youg peopl have alot kind of interten in the life more than the last gener ha for exampl the youg peopl have a lot of movi they can go to wath and there is alot of place he can go with he friend so in hi fre time he will prefer to go for dinner or movi inst of go to help the commun in th cummun field like the paret did . third i thik that the sestem of the aduc is also respons of thi case as they did not teach the youth in the school the meanin and love to help other in the commun and how to be mumeb so when they grow and graduid they do not tri to help as they did not learn how to do and to sum up and with all the sttment suggest abov i think that we are all responsebl of thi case of the youth the parent in the hous did not teacth them how to love their commun aaaand how to help it and also the school the media we are all respons and if did not care for thi problim we will not gain in the futur the good result we all aim from those young peopl .
