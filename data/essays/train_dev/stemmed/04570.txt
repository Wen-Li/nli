the statment is realli gener and i disagre with that . i think the categori of young peopl should be divid in differ group . sure the first divis should be of two big group : teen and young peopl from 20 to 26 . teen should go on studi becous , as we now , their help to their communiti will be bigger if they can do some useful work . but at the same time i think , in that period , a teen must hold a part of the day for hi courios . peopl from 20 to 26 , that is the categori in which i am , could yet be a worker on could still be a student . and i think in both of the situat they are help their communiti . obvious there could be some except of peopl that , for differ reason , do n't found their own way . but they are exept . than , in itali , we can decid to give social servic to societi , also stop to studi for a year , and work in hospit or old peopl 's hous or someth similar . but i alway think the better way to help your commun it is to find your own posit as worker insid the system . and to do that young peopl must do what they do . what sould they be suppos to do more ? i realli would like to understand becous i read statement like thi from when i wa child . i think that the past world war did privat young peopl of their youth . and i think that 's not right . so when i realiz that i 'm live in a realli beati time and in a realli comfort place i think that is a must of mine go on to studi , improv my work and enjoy my self . and when i do all of thi thing i think i 'm help my communiti .
