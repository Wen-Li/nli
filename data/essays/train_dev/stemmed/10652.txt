the topic at hand is whether in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . thi topic is import from mani point of view . i disagre with the statement . i think the number of car will not decreas in twenti year down the line . world is grow at a rapid pace . time is the utmost import factor . even though there is an increas in the pollut from the increas in number of car , peopl will not avoid car . they are veri much busi with their daili schedul . they have thing to be complet within the deadlin . they can not imagin themselv with out atleast an automobil . they have to run with time . peopl find other way to reduc the pollut , but they can not sacrific their car . they would say that increas in the number of plant would decreas the pollut . even they would invent new method to reduc the pollut but there would n't be ani comprimis in the car usag . car number would decreas if car owner come forward to disown their car as the car are creat the environment pollut , which is impract to consider itself . mainta a car is also import from esteem point of view . there is a craze for the car in the market . some peopl want to buy car as soon as a compani releas the product . even there is a scarciti in the ga or petrol , new car will be invent which do not requir petrol or ga , instead use the natur resourc like the solar energi or bioga . besid `` as necess is the mother of invent '' peopl would certainli do research to creat new car which solv the problem creat from the exist car the technolog is also support the increas in the number of car . with the ever grow technolog , new car with differ power , style and with high effici are be invent daili . there is a competit between the compani for produc the best car . thi competit and thrist to win the market will lead to increas in the number of car in futur . in conclus , i think the number of car will increas with time , even though there are some neg effect from the increas in number of car . thi effect are nullifi from the advantag and necess of the car
