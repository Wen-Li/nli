consid the statement that `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' you definitli have to consid the aspect of money . to own a car and to drive it frequent is alreadi quit expens and peopl are alway complain about high petrol price , in addit to that it seem that they continu to increas constantli . therefor it could be possibl that some peopl think about use differ way of transport instead of drive a car . howev , in my opinion there will not be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today . most of the peopl that will be allow to drive car in 20 year are alreadi live nowaday and they grow up with the comfort of have a car in nearli everi familiy . i think if you get onc use to car and all the comfort they provid you will not like to miss them . there is , for exampl , the independ that a car provid . if you decid to go somewher , you do not have to look up the schedul of a bu or a train , you do not have to wait until the tain leav or search for a possibl how to get to the trainstat . if you have got a car you can just go outdoor take your key and get away . moreov the car is veri practic if you want to get to a place without wast lot of time . by car you can go more directli , becaus there are more street and road avail than way for a train , and therefor it is possibl to save time . to save time is one aspect that seem to be quit import in modern time . you can easili observ thi if you count how often peopl mention the sentenc `` time is money '' . in conclus i would say that peopl will not give up their car the onli aspect when car will probabl be use less than nowadi is for long journey . i think therefor peopl will use flight more frequent .
