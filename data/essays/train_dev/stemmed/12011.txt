i disagre with the given statement becuas i strongli believ that societi ha manag to reach the hieght that it ha today through special and divis of labour . special is a theori that emphas the import of concentr in one particular field . when thi theori wa employ by factori and manufactur plant , it result in a dramat increas in product . ofcours special ha it drawback and fault which are caus due to lack of knowledg in other field , but the benefit of know one thing realli well , greatli outweigh the fault of special . a reason whi special is so success is becaus eventu ( usual after 12 year or so of school ) , peopl realiz that they are better at someth than other thing , or they realiz that they have a passion for a certain field and that that 's what they want to do for the rest of their live . at thi point in time it becom appar to them that other knowledg , that doe n't further their understand of their subject choic , is a wast of time . after all , if some one wish to be a mechan engin , whi doe he need to know the literari featur that shakespear had use to captur hi audienc attent . i 've alreadi decid what i want to do in life , and to tell the truth studi thing like spanish and busi seem to divert time away from my goal of becom a research scientist . i love read about the latest medic breakthrough and discoveri , but all i get by learn spanish is frustrat and low mark . i sincer doubt the import of spanish in the long run , i mean sure it might help me commun with peopl who onli know spanish , but how mani peopl will i meet like that . through my person experi i 've learn the import of knowledg in all area , but i 've also seen the import of special , and in my opinion , to know one thing veri well is a lot better than know rel noth in everyth ,
