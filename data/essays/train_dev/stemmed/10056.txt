some peopl believ that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . howev , in my opinion , travel alon is a better idea . becaus i can manag my time by myself and save money . first , i do not want to be control my travel schdule by other peopl . by travel alon , i can make my own time schedul for my plan . for exampl , last year , i went to pari in a group led by a tour guid . first time , i thought it wa the best choic for me becaus i did n't need to book ticket , check the time and look for locat by a map . but after a few day . i realiz that i wa not the person who just like to follow other peopl and schedul led by a tour guid . i realli want to see paint more in ruver museum , sinc there were my favorit master piec such as monarisa . but a tour guid did n't want to spent much time at there . she guid the master peic and gave me onli 10 minut . i wa so upset and embrass , as i alway eager to see the work . after the travel , i decid not to go travel in a group led by a tour guid . in addit , travel in a group led by a tour guid is more expens that traveil alon . i compar two case by a calcul and found that travel alon is a cheaper choic . i travel around spain two month ago by myself , then made a chart of spend money . i figur out that by travel alon i could save more than three hundr dollar compar to travel in a group led by a tour guid with the same situat such as travel same day and visit same place . if i travel with them , i have to pay for a tour guid and the travel agenc . in conclus , i firmli believ that travel in a group led by a tour guid is not the best idea . if i have a chanc to choos travel in a group or not , i will choos the last one . as i can control my plan and my habit and save money .
