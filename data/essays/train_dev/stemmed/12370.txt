i think it depend on peopl but i disagre that understand idea and concept more importand for student than lear fact . i beliv that there are some import point whi to learn fact . peopl encourag to learn fact becaus of interest in realli and to learn easili factin inform . for instanc i would like to learn which tempertur doe water boil or how electr come our home and how dishwash doe work ? moreov , i would like to learn basic math to help my daili work . nowaday , young jener are veri knowledg for evryth even children . they watch tv , read newspap and resarch what happen in the world in spite of idea or cancept . in sort of inform is teach peopl differ way . some student mayb can learn easli ida and concept rather than learn fact . in my opinion which kind of necessari inform we need , we can learn guickli . so learn fact are import for me and i prefer to learn it .
