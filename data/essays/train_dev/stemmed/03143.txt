while man is grow he learn a lot of inform about how to behav , how to live , how to surviv in the societi , which is good and which is bad , becaus all are essenti while grow . in thi way the educ is also veri import to a person . begin from childhood he learnt sever thing . by studi differ field of subject he can get a varieti of knowledg about differ topic . like if he studi histori he know about past histor stori , and while learn scienc he have a knowledg about health and reason for scientif thing , like that if we studi differ area then we can get more knowledg relat to all field . that is the reason children are studi in the school day in differ subject . upto high school educ it give all the basic principl present in relat subject , while come to higher educ it is differ and confin to less subject becaus we want to special in some particular area which we like most . then if a student is interest in math he take that subject and studi it , and anoth student interest in the other subject and take that subject as a major subject and acquir profici in that area . in my opinion it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject upto graduat level . whi becaus upto that level we get some idea about all basic principl behind in it . as the studi go on as like master 's degre than it is better to take a singl subject rather than take sever subject . that is the time to be special in specif subject . whi becaus by studi all the subject at that time also there is no use , if we becom famili with one subject we can find new thing which is veri use to us . final i agre with the opinion that it is better have broad knowledg on mani academ subject upto graduat level which result in good result .
