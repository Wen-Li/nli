i think it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in fact if a person know concept that are on the basi of everi fact or situat , he can solv all these problem that are connect with those idea , on the other hand , if he know onli the fact without havig the concept and the idea on the basi , he can solv onli that problem and situat which are similar to that . all thi is veri import in mani aspect or situat in our live becaus everyday we have in front of us some differ problem that we can solv onli if we know the concept and the idea . especi we find these problem in our work , in our offic , in our classroom , in our homework , so in the our environment work . for exampl one person can solv a problem easier and faster than other peopl becaus he ha the concept and the idea on the basi of that work while other peopl know onli the fact and , if a situat introduc a new solut or a new detail , they do n't arriv to solv the problem , they do n't understand the new situat and so they ca n't arriv to the solut and to the implement of the situat . a person who know concept and idea can solv all the problem that a situat or a detail can introduc and he can develop new solut and new implement about the problem . final i think that a person who know onli fact he know onli a littl part of hi work becaus he can solv onli a schemat problemsv while a person that ha mani idea and concept he know more thing of hi work and so he can solv all situat of a problem with new detail and aspect and he can also find new and better solut .
