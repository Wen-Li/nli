learn fact ha no mean if it is not support by the capabl of understand idea and concept . therefor i would say that i agre with the statement . whenev you are learn a `` fact '' , you are learn someth which ha alreadi been state . what is most import about fact are the idea and the concept that brought to that fact . for exampl , talk about histori , it is easi to learn so mani fact about the french revolut that whenev someon will question you , you will be abl to answer with date , bottl , name etc but if you do not understand the histor background you wo n't be abl to understand how much the idea and concept develop at that time influenc the begin of the french revolut . anoth exampl could be better set by phylosophi , phylosophi is such a complex matter that just know the fact mean noth . what make philosophi so interest is the flow of idea and concept that we are still use everyday . we are not use fact . even when talk about polit problem , for exampl , we can not onli report the fact we have to support the fact with the idea and concept that creat those fact . it doe not matter the cours someon is attend , the key point is to understand the idea and concept and then it will be easier to rememb and talk about fact .
