in 2006 we are live in the world of mass media . i think it is not possibl to escap from thi situat . advertis are direct product of thi phenomenon , sure one of the most import and profit part . today advertis are not onli use to sell product or promot busi but even to advertis politician dure the elect . it give us an idea of how big their effect could be . advertis to sell product is essenti . mani time we buy complet unus thing onli becaus they appear in the televis . the major of peopl consid , probabl not conscionsli , a good product what they have seen advertis , indipend from qualiti . it ha happen also to me sever time . advertis tend to make product better than they are . some day ago , for exampl , i bought a veri expens profum onli becaus it wa advertis by my favorit actor , without tast it befor . at the end i have discov it wa smell veri bed . i can add severel other exampl . a special case can be food . food in televis appear veri colour and look veri tasti , of cours much nicer that the one cultiv by my grandpar in my hous , but often the qualiti is realli low . usual big compani have the power to advertis their product massiv . it is vital for their imag and , abov all , for their profit . let the product know can be better than produc well . it make money . to summar , i think that advertis ha a big impact on the imag of product , despit their qualiti . consequentelli it depend on final custom be awar of thi potenti problem . it is imposs nowaday not to be influenc by the advertis , but i whi peopl will be more qualiti orient in the futur .
