i disagre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are a few reason whi . one reason i disagre with the statement is that young peopl are requir to help their commun for certain hour . for me , as a middl school student , have to help my commun for more than ten hour a year which is a lot for a middl school student . also , to get accept into colleg , you need certain hour of commun servic . anoth reason is that the young gener ha a cultur of donat . donat could be a big help in the commun and mani young peopl are donat money to the commun . for exampl , a colleg student who work at a part-tim job , donat more than half of hi hard earn money . also , at school , donat are made by student . my class collect money and donat it to an orphanag nearbi , which is help the commun . the last reason is that the mean of give enough time to help the commun ha chang . in the old day , there were lot of poor peopl who need support from the govern and the societi . so peopl back then had to work veri hard to help the poor and improv the commun . but now , thing have chang . there are not that mani poor peopl in the commun and thing to improv . also , back in the old day , skill and technolog did n't matter much becaus there were n't that mani high-tech thing to improv in the commun . but now , it is differ . non-skil peopl can not help in the commun becaus everyth ha becom high-tech , so onli peopl with skill can help the commun directli . nowaday , we help our commun by donat and dure commun servic hour . these are the reason whi i disagre that young peopl nowaday are no give enough time to help their commun .
