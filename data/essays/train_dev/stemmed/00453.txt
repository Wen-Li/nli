'' , she repli : `` well , honey , i wa never as happi , i feel that i do not let a moment of my life go without live it '' . thi wa surpris becaus i have alway thought that we , the young , enjoy life most . then , i thought of take a glimps of my life , and after a long look , i found out that i do not realli spend my time in hat i love to do , and i had the explan for that , which is ll the other hing ihav to do , becaus i am still a depend person in everythingm and i can not do whatev i like to do becaus there is a duti that i have to do in life , while my grandmoth is independ , know what she want , andha the time to do it all , so she 's the one who 's given the chanc to enjoy her life . well thi doe not onli appli otm , but it alsoappli to all of my friend , becaus we , the young , feel that time is go realli fast , and we have mani mani thing to do , so we do not enjoy our life , but we rather use it in accomplish the goal we have to reach .
