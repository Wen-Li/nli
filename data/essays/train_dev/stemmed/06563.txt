i do not agre with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . travel is veri person and inter-person experi . first , when we are travel , we are depart from all that surround us in ordinari life . we meet differ kind of peopl , natur and cultur from what we 've accostom . and the experi reflecet who i am , and who i have been . thi kind of experi is so person innat that a guid tour in a group can not give the essenti . when we travel in a group by a tour guid , we can not determin even to leav or stay more at the place by ourselv . we can not imagin other altern to guid by our heart 's go . second , if we expect someth more in travel than just sightse , we should meet the cultur and peopl with landscap . you can say that a group tour is better to know more peopl each other . i can get friend who travel with me by group , but the peopl who travel with me by group are like have the same kind of cultur and environ of me . we usual live by one 's own view and sight and the view of valu and world doe not chang just as time go by . differ and extern stimulu can inful our mind and behavior more significantli . guided-tour have tradit too tight schedul to respond with the extern environ or to commun with peopl who live the tour place . in my opinion , the best way to travel is to travel alon or with someon who can share the person and independ experi .
