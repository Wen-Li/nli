on the one hand i think young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . young peopl are more activ , they can make journey and sport . they go to parti , spend much time with friend and have not much responsibl . older peopl often have problem with their health . some older peopl need perman medic and are not abl to leav their home . furthermor they know the most of their life is over . i think thi is not an amus thought . so one can say mani older peopl have not the possibl to enjoy life , but there are also older peopl who do not want to enjoy life . i know some older peopl who are healthi and well-off but nevertheless they do not go out , but sit in their hou and are sad . on the other hand young peopl are just at the begin of their live and therefor they have to fight for their place in societi . thi struggl is not onli fun , too . in school they have to work hard , becaus they want to rise their job opportun and in univers thi situat is continu . when young peopl have leisur time , mani of them wast their time in order to play vido game at the comput . other young peopl are unsatisfi by societi and lead life as outcast . in contrast to that there are mani healthi older peopl who earn a comfort incom or are even retir . they often afford luxuri trip and they have not so much pressur to be succes . instead of stress in school , in univers or at the begin of a career , older peopl can play with their grandchildren or can go for a walk with other older person . i think thi is a great perspect . older peopl can look back and see what they have achiev over the year . that can also be great pleasur . resum all that reason , i think both young and older peopl can enjoy life , but i am convinc that older peopl more often do so .
