in my opinion , it is better to special in one specif subject . first , i think that a gener knowledg of mani academ subject is import , but then you have to decid a specif subject to studi . i think that is more interest , becaus you can know thi subject weri well . for exampl , in italian litteratur is veri interest to studi the first edit of canzonier of francesco petrarca . of cours ou have to know also the other litteratur of the same period , but then you can pay your attent onli on thi work of petrarca , and you can understand , for exampl , whi petrarca decid a particular order for all hi poem . second , when you special in one specif subject , you can concentr all your attent on thi subject . instead , if you know mani academ subject , the risk is that you can know a littl bit of everi subject , but noth veri well . it mean that your studi can be shallow . in addit , i think that if you special in one specif subject , you love thi sibject and you want to know thi subject veri well . so , you can spent mani time on thi subject , but you will be not bore , becaus it is what do you want to do . final , i want to repeat that also a gener knowledg of mani academ topic is import , but onli as a support on a specif subject . for exampl , if you studi the histori of the cinema , and you want to special in the french director francoi truffaut , you have to know also the artist of the nouvel vagu , or the movi of alfr hitchcock ( rememb the book written by truffaut ) , or the classic french cinema . but then you can pay your attent in the specif characterist of movi of truffaut , and it is veri interest if you like thi subject .
