actual i strongli agre with that most advertis make produt seem much better that they realli are . which is realli unfair for the consum to be mislead to believ that thi product they are advertis is great and can perform it action perfectli . simpli they make you feel that you can never live without it ( even if you do n't realli need it ) and they usual pray on children , teenag and peopl that tend to believ everth . advertis usual use to techniqu , first one , convinc you that thi product ideal for you and that it perform it job with effic , precic and with minim effort from your side . like for exampl swiffer duster , they mention in the advertis that it wipe all the dust complet in one strok special on tight place , ofcours much better than your usual old duster , and that it is stong enough to get the whole job done with minim effort from your side that you would like to dust all day long . while in realiti , and i speak from my person experi , it do n't realli remov all the dust you have to pass it sever time on the same area to ensur that it 's free from dust . also id you use it in tight space the duster might attach it end to each other make it hard to clean the area in question and the last proplem with ti duster that you need to use sever dust part ( sinc the dust part are dispos ) to clean the whole hous and not onli one attach as they inferd . the second techniqu is that they tri to show you that you ca n't live without it and that your life wa realli hard and need help befor you know about thi product , they do thi by state all all the benifit from use thi product and complet egnor to state the defect of their product and even mislead you to believ that it doe n't have ani defect . an exampl of thi techniqu is advertis for durg special antidepress drug and sleep aid drug . peopl might not even need thi drug but by hear about them and their benefit all the time they start to think that they might realli need them when thet do n't . i wish their wa more supervis on the advertis so that they would send more accur complet inform about their product and to decreas the amount of drug product advertis by incres the spectatu awar .
