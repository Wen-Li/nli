i complet agre with the statement tell us about how young peopl today do not give enough time to aid their commun . i am go to use variou exampl to justifi my opinion on thi statement . in olden time , peopl in some way or the other had to help their commun in some way or the other as there wa no other occup other than agricultur occup but as time have progres , both chronolog and technolog , young peopl do not find it import to aid their commun . peopl today have to be compel to do someth that will help their commun , for exampl , school today have commun servic as an essenti part of their curriculum which is good as they are tri to instil valu in their student but the question pose is whether the school are success in do so or are student just do it as a compuls . peopl today feel that help their commun is a wast of time and money in some case but it is import for them to put themselv in the posit and see the variou kind of suffer peopl are go through . for exampl , the youth of today ha enough time to fit in time for comput game and movi in their schedul but they do not have the time and chivalri to go and help the lesser privilleg peopl in their commun . some young peopl , who feel it is their duti to help their commun , fear aid their commun as they think they might be consid a social outcast and peopl might make fun or make a mockeri of them becaus they are do someth ` uncool ' . through proper time manag and a chang in their outlook , the youth can make time in their schedul to help their commun and be of some posit use to societi today .
