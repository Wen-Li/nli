it is difficult to think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all the car industri is strongli relat to the petroleum industri , and they play such a strong role in the world 's economi ; i mean that there are too much interest of too much power peopl , so car must be use to sell fuel that mean petroleum . it is true that the worldwid transport commun have improv in the last year , a huge `` air traffic '' ha taken place especi from the ` nineti , furthermor high speed train have been creat , even here in itali the govern is about to creat a high speed line . and there are also other way of transport , for exampl ship , metro and buss . howev in my opinion everi man , everi woman , prefer to move whenev they want and wherev they like without pay attent to reserv a ticket or arriv in time for the departur and whatev . and i am an exampl : i even can not immagin to stay without my car , i need it for my job , i need it for my holiday and i can take it whenev i want without make a reserv and i am never in late , i mean that my car is `` alway wait for me '' . as we well know petroleum is go to the end , the reserv of these resourc , call black gold , are almost to the end , i do n't know who will be play the econom rule the next 20 year , but let 's thimk about hydrogen . car work with hydrogen alreadi exsist , but it is too much earli to replac petroleum with hydrogen , for the reason that i mention abov . one thing is true : petrolemu will finish and so hydrogen work car may will take place , and if not hydrogen , anoth altern type of carbur , but it is in my opnion that car will be much more than now
