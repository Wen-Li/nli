i have alway been told that you can never get what you want if you do not tri , or in other word , if you do not take risk . i total agre with that statement . as i told it previous , i admit that peopl who take risk by tri new thing can get what they realli want and thereaft be veri success . i mean that if you never tri to do someth differ from what you are use to do at least onc in your whole life , it is too bad . let 's talk about the actor for instanc . some of them alway act the same kind of charact and that is nice person or on the contrari a bad person . thi is a good thing for them becaus they alway know how to act sinc it is alway the same thing . howev , some other actor sometim tri to act an opposit charact that the one they are use to perform . morgan freeman for instanc ha often perform nice charact in hi movi and one day , he accept to play the '' nasti '' in the movi call '' dreamcatch '' . it wa a veri surpris to see him as a nasti but in spite of all that , the movi wa great and had success and so the actor is .
