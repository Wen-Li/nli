the choic and the prefer between a broad knoledg of mani acedem subject and a deep knoledg of a specif subject repres a classic topic to which it is difficult to give an answer and that involv , particularli , peopl who have to imag , think and/or implement an ideal educ model . accord to the human natur and consid how spread and variou it is , i think that a knoledg of mani topic could be more coher and offer a better level of satisfact and benefit to everyon . focus on mani subject , peopl have the opportun to discov aspect of the world that otherwis they will never know . moreov , i think that a prefer for a spread academ knoledg is also use to develop complet and reason judgement about thing that , coher with the technic and scientif progress , are becom more and more complex . on the contrari , a special knowledg of one specif subject ha certainli some advantag : for exampl , it allow to becom an expert for some question and probabl to know some detail about a disciplin that no one know . but the risk is also that thi knowledg is too much isol , without suffici contact with other type of knoledg , sometim and potenti help also in academ field of interest . on the basi of my consider , but also consid the global movement toward an academ activ with a network frame , i support the opinion that a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is probabl more interest and power .
