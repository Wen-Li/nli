the issu at our hand is wheather it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i think it is better to be special in one specif subject . if one choos a singl subject in which the student want to be special , he will be more focus toward that specif subject and it impliment and he will becom a profession in that subject . where as if he ha broad knowledg of mani academ subject he will be half focus toward all the subject and he would not be abl to handl ani subject perfectli . becaus of thi reason i think it is better to be special in one specif subject . and also he can spend much more time on that perticular subject and he can concentr more on that subject with which he can improv hi knowledg in that subject by present sever paper on it and do sever project for the impliment of the subject . where as have the broad knowledg of mani subject may make the student purplex . lastli consid an exampl of a person who can play chess , basket ball and cricket . if he tri to play all the game and if he practic all the game for equal durat he will not be abl to better utliz the skill he is have . where as if he concentr more on a specif game he will be a champion of that game as he is more focus toward that game . final as the be special in specif subject he will be more focus toward that special and he can better util hi knowledg and skill for the implement of the subject , he learn . becaus of these reason i think it is better to be special in specif subject .
