in my opinion , the appropriat of travel in a group led by a tour guid depend on the natur of the person and the place to be travel . for an enthusiast like me , the schedul of a group travel will be veri bind and i wo n't be abl to enjoy as much . but for elderli peopl and peopl with kid , it will be more enjoybl if everyth is taken care of by a tour guid . but in some circumst , tour group becom veri essenti . for exampl , if i am travel in a foreign countri and i do n't know their languag , i will prefer travel in a tour group . by do that , i will save the pain of order wrong thing on the menu , and more importantli , i wo n't keep loos my way becaus of sign board written in a foreign languag . also , if i am travel to a place of histor import , i would like to be led by a tour guid who can give me more inform about that place . in situat , when i have veri littl time on hand and there are lot of place to see , i think i will be better off as a part of a tour group . or els , i 'll wast most of my time , find and reach all the tourist spot on my own . on the other hand , if i am go on an adventur trip for camp and trek , tour group will be the last thing on my mind . also , if i am on a spiritu or relax trip , to a calm place with not mani thing to explor , the tour group will not be veri use . i feel tour group led by tour guid are import , but it depend on travel discreat to decid if it is the best way to travel . as a conclus , i would like to state that i do not agre with the given statement .
