although there might be some reason for agre with that statement i prefer to disagre with it . in the follow i will write about three reason whi i do not agre with the statement . first of all , i have to say that dure my time at univers i have met a lot of peopl who realli felt the need of offer their help to their commun . i know that student often are not call young peopl anymor but i think that they are becaus they are still on their way of find their own way of life . one exampl of their way of help wa take part in a project where a hous for children whose parent were not abl to offer them an approprit way of life wa built . everybodi who help build the hous did it for free . anoth exampl wa offer help by speak to peopl on the telephon where again peopl did not get paid . secondli , when you want to appli at a special organis for financi help it is alway a big advantag to be abl to show them that you have help your commun . these organis like to chose young peopl who show the abil to offer their help without want ani money and the abil to interact with peopl in a social way . if young peopl onli help their commun in order to get that financi help they probabl will get to know how much fun it might be to help other and how good it feel . final there are mani young peopl who make use of the possibl to spend the year after their final examin at school with organis that have the aim to help commun . in england that is call a gap year and is a veri good thing to do becaus young peopl make experi that are veri import for their life . sinc young peopl know that or get told about it they take that special year . as a conclus i have to say that i know more young peopl who help their commun than young peopl who do not . that experi might depend on the surround i live in but even though i am sure that thi statem is not true .
