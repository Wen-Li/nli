i am person not sure whether it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject or in one specif one becaus there are advantag and disadvantag for both opinion . on the one hand it is of cours good to have a broad knowledg in gener . in our societi it will alway be use to know as mani aspect of differ field of scienc as possibl and to have the abil to talk about mani differ area of knowledg . it would be fatal if i am just a specialist of my own field of studi but do n't care about other aspect that mayb could influenc me in some way . there are alway connect between differ area of academ studi and it is possibl to import some aspect taken from anoth file of studi to my own specif one to widen my point of view . on the other hand it is import to have specif knowledg in one field . firstli becaus the use of studi is gener to deepen one 's knowledg in a specif field of studi . secondli i think it is veri import to specialis on one topic in which i am realli interest and have a great knowledg in than to know onli main fact in area i am not that interest in . thirdli a specif knowledg in one subject will be vital to my futur life becaus if i ever want to get a job somewher i must have a great and not just a gener knowledg about the field i want to work in . in addit to thi the subject i am special in is probabl an area which i am veri involv in so that i can express myself and my skill in thi field veri well . so i come to the conclus that even if it can be use to have knowledg in mani differ aspect of life it is more essenti to have knowledg in one specif subject most of all becaus it will help me to get job in futur . but that shall not mean that i am not convinc that it is also vital to increas my knowledg in other area of studi .
