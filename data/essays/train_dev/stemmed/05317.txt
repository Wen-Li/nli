i agre with thi statement . i feel the student understad idea and concept then fact . it is clear the student lern more hi idea and concept rather then the fact in classroom . soi agre with thi statement . in gener anysubject are clasifi ind two way either scinc or social . speciaali in social subject we lern so mani thing like histri geographi econom and civic i tdiffer what we see to what we lern in histri . suppos few contri histri less then the 500 year but those contri are now word bigest lephacanami and those rool entair world . in start of twentiath centuri ther is no develop of electron scinc . now we arr not think with of elecon and comput and power but is it is truth . so mani thing the idea and concept veri iport . like a meteri . their chemic bond conductvitytyp of meteri these are lern from idea and concept onli not throuth fact . in meteri we have differ type of classif fron thier characterist supos now we are disscuss scinc class . in thi case i would like to discou solour system . insolor system sun is not revolv but we feel sun is move from east to west in natur the earth is move fron west to east . and i will give anoth exampl if we travel ani vehicl we feel soround are move we feel we are stationari like that . an other exampl we feel earth is like plat it 's not like a sphere shape but actual our earth is sphere shape not flat shape . but generaali we feel it is a flat shape ,, if it is plat shape sun rise time and sun set time must be same but it is not true . i feel abov threee exampl we understand idea and concept s then theit is for then to lern fact . i give one technic exampl in thi case . in gener we are not acept energi transfer in real life but energi transfer one form to an other form of energi . but from fact we are disagre we can produc from heat to cold . in our fact life we feel it 's veri diffuclt . but it produc the heat is ( in boiler ) some kinet energi thi kinet energi convert into elect energi with help of terbin , and final electr energi into cold from with help of refregar process . so i stangli agre my entair part of discut . `` that is more import to student to understand idea and concpt then the it is for them to lern fact '' .
