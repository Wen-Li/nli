i realli like to travel around the world . i can see a beauti place taht i have ever seen and have a lot of valuabl experi . there are mani kind of style when we go travel . i can not agre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid for the follow reason . to begin with , the way of travel in a group led by a tour guid ha less time that we can spend free . most of these trip have veri tight schedul . we have to see the famou place more quickli and we can not choos the gift for our friend or parent slowli . in my opinion , travel should be more flexibl and relux . in addit , the way of travel in a group led by a tour guid ha littl chanc to happen . i think that happn is veri import factor to enjoy trip . when i went to itali with my friend , i meet one italian chef in a bu by chanc . we enjoy talk and then we can eat italian food in hi hous . it wa veri delici . in conclus , i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
