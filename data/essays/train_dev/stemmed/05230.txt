learn is an import phase in everyon life . some student concentr more on understand idea and concept while some concentr to learn fact . in my opinion both must go parallel in order to have an effect learn process . they ha to be content about the fact and then they ha to understand them by learn concept . mere read of fact can not give a detail explan about the overal concept . some practic knowledg is requir to exploit the situat . most of the student learn concept by read the textbook . some concept may not be understand when we read them . we have to do some experi regard them , these creat some new and innov idea in the mind of children . for exampl , let us take lighten as an exampl . when chindren learn about the process of lighten thay are not fulli satisfi about the process . but when they see the process through eye they can realis that light travel faster than sound . that is the reason whi we first see the light and then hear the sound . so by thi exampl it is clear that student should understand idea and concept than mere learn fact from the textbook . in my school day my teacher would alway insist to know about the concept behind a fact . teacher play an impot role in thi process . they ha to creat some prototyp which explain the concept about the fact . moreov the student absorb the fact when it is state practic becaus student learn more from do than from read . but it is equal import to read about the fact becaus they must have the minimum capabl to understand the idea of what teacher is go to explain . onc they are readi with the fact and concept they can face ani problem easili . moreov thi type of learn instig zeal to exploit new thing and thi will definit help them in the futur educ also . so in conclus i would like to state that the process of learn must be balanc enough to have a better understand of the fact support by learn the concept behind the fact .
