if you were to ask me whether young peopl nowaday give enough time to help their commun , my answer would be definit be a solid `` no '' . at least it is the case for the young peopl of my countri taiwan . there are two reason whi i feel that young peopl in taiwan are not spend enough time in help commun . first , time have chang , the environ and the behavior of peopl have chang . in comparison with the time when there are mani children in a famili , most famili now have onli one child . hi or her parent spend a lot of money and a lot of time provid hi or her need . most of the young peopl in taiwan are be spoil by their parent . the young peopl , therefor , are selfish and inconsider . they do n't feel it 's necessari to help the needi in their commun becaus they do n't think there are peopl that need to be help . it 's quit pathet and sad , but it 's true . how would they spend time help in the commun when they do n't think there 's a need to it ? the second reason whi i do n't think young peopl give enough time to help their commun is becaus there simpli is n't time for them to do it ! even if they want to help out , they do n't have time to do it ! nowaday , young student have to learn a varieti of thing in school . asid from basic subject like math , histori and english , they have to perform well in other subject like music and art . student often go cram school to learn their art and music skill after school . when they get home , it 's usual around nine or ten o'clock . some teen even have to go to cram school on the weekend in order to get into better high school or univers . their schedul are alreadi fill with subject they need to handl in school , how can they have time to help out in the commun ? the two reason i mention whi young peopl do n't spend enough time help their commun are fair and true . it is realli a sad thing to point out , and i truli hope thi situat will chang in the near futur . young peopl help in commun is someth that 's import and meaning ; it would be a piti if no one help out in the commun .
