as we can see everyday , car are the most import imlpement peopl use to travel from a palc to anoth nowaday . but if thi siuation will last to the twenti year later . i do not think so . firstli , as we all know , the car run by oil . but with the develop of world , there are more and more car on the stress while the crude oil resours are run out everi minut . with the use of oil , the price of it will go much more higher after twenti year later , as we can see from the year 2003 to thi year . if so , most person can not afford the cost of driven car . secondli , with the develop of technolog , there are mani new kind of commun appear , compar with twenti year ago , for exampl . so , i can say that the commun between peopl will be much more conveni twenti year later than today . at that time peolp can exchang all kind of inform on the internet instead of driven here and there . thirdli , as the atmospher becom wors and wors as the result of oil burn by car , the govern of all countri will make new law to restrict the use of car . last but not least , also with the technolog develop rapidli , there will be mani kind of new method of traffic . for instanc , the network of the subway in most big citi will becom much more develop and complex so that peopl can move themselv by underground railway to ani corner of the citi more quickli and safe than by use the car . besid , there will be more traffic moth run by electr or even sunlight . in conclus , the world develop day and night . the car do much harm to the enviro and it is not so safe ( you could notic that they kill hundr of peopl in the traffic accid everyday ) . more conveni and safe traffic thing will replac the car in the near futur . so i think there will be less car after twenti year later .
