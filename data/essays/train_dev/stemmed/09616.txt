i agre with the statement . to me the question shown in the phrase is an ethic problem becaus societi which creat a new product trick peopl who believ in their lie , so the entir popul depend on advertis which show `` incred product '' which can resolv mani differ problem , such as how to clean up hous or car at best with a new soap which eras ani stain , or how to repair a part of the furnitur ; in realiti mani of the effect of the product are creat use a modern comput program . in thi way peopl believ in someth which partial doe not exist and wast much money . for exampl , one year ago i bought a new soap which could eras everi stain on my shoe and cloth : i use it onli 2 time and then it did n't work anymor : now i still regret buy it ( but the product present in the tv advertis seem veri differ and much better than the real one ) . the philosoph karl marx , in the 19th centuri , said thi : '' ... the religion is the oppium of all popul . .. '' : to me thi express may be chang in thi new form : '' ... advertis are the oppium of peopl ... '' , and it 's realli relat to the today 's situat .
