peopl respond to thi issu differ . in my opinion , i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help thier commun . as a young girl , i do n't think that i can give enough time to help my commun . here come some reason . first of all , young peopl nowaday have more vivid person than decad ago . in thi situat , young peopl tri their best to be themselv and do everyth they want to do . so they may have fewer time and may be unwil to help their commun just becaus they think it is stupid or redicul if they help thier communuti . in other word , they think that help their commun is not the thing that a young man should do . for exampl , young peopl in my countri indic that young peopl should go outsid and tri someth new and excit , not just stay at home or in commun . particip activ of commun is the thing that old peopl do . although thi may not be a correct idea , it realli influenc you in addit , as advanc technolog is invent and appli , there are more and more activ that young peopl can do . but we onli have 24 hour a day and it led to a fewer time to hepl our commun in contrast . for exampl , we can go see a movi or go ride , go kloof , or even attand to a big comput game competit . there are too mani thing for we young peopl to tri and to experi . that is , we can hardli get eough time help our commun becaus there are more and more interest and excit activ that appeal to us . to summar , young nowaday realli do n't give enough time to help their commun . but thi doe n't mean that we do n't love our own commun , afteral , there are too mani thing enchant us . we have the right to particip an activ that is realli interest to us and thi may help us to learn more and experi mor from it .
