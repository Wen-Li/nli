unfortun , it is true that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . nowaday life ha becom veri complic and exhaust , not onli for adult but also for young peopl . there is a lot of competit in everi field . the young gener is so occupi by their own live that they hardli have ani time for commun servic . student have to work much harder compar to our parent in order to be success in their life . a lot of the time ha to be devot for studi . a good educ is given much more import than earlier . secondli there are mani more recreat activ nowaday . with the invent of high-tech video game , comput game like the soni playstat and x-box the level of entertain ha reach a whole new level . then there is televis and internet on which you can view an unlimit amount of thing twenti four hour a day . for sport fan there are variou sort channel like espn and star sport on which a larg number of sport are cover rang form cricket to basebal . the young peopl spend a lot of time on the internet chate , e-mail etc . peopl would rather spend time enjoy and entertain themselv instead of help other . the young gener is selfish and ignor the need of the commun . they are more concern about there futur and do not care about the commun 's futur . they do not understand the import of a good commun . therefor i agre with the statement .
