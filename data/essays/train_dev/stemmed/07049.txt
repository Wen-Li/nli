someon think that a concentr knowleg is better than a broad knowleg of variou field . howev , it is so arguabl issu becaus both case have advantag and disadvantag . howev , i strongli believ that peopl should have a special subject for the follow reason . fist of all , we should have a special skill or knowledg for get a job . when i wa an high school student , my uncl live in my home . he wa a gentlmen for my life . howev , he could not get a job becaus he had no specif skill and knowledg . when he wa an univers student , hi overral grade wa almost b - . he told me that peopl should have a specif knowledg in interet field . he regret hi univers life . howev , he had broad knowleg of mani academ subject such as physic , chemistri , art , music , and so on . at that time , i feel that i want to get a special skill or knowleg for my success . secondli , all subject are becom more deepli . one hundr year ago , we do not know the special rel . at the time , few physicist understood the speical rel . howev , i am a high school student in korea . i learn the special rel in physic class . i heard that one or two thousand paper are publish in a day in physic . espeic , all scienc are rapidli and deepli develop day by day . therefor , we should concentr one or two subject for research . anoth exampl is that we can not learn everyth . although peopl should have a broad knowleg of mani academ field , it is less than one percent of whole knowledg in the univers . in the view point , it is better to special in one subject than to learn variou knowledg of mani academ field . in conclus . i strongli assert that peopl should concentr on a special subject . first , we need a special skill or knowldeg for a gob . second mani field of academ subject are becom deepli . to overcom thi situat , we should studi a special subject becasu recent knowledg should be a old one .
