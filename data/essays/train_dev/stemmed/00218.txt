fact are those that often peopl believ . if the fact are not deriv from the idea and concept of the relev subject then they does'nt have strong root to be consid as fact . peopl are almost all fool if they believ in the fact in which they doe n't have enough understand idea and concept . so i prefer in idea and concept in which most of the fact are emerg . in favour to my decis i can suggest the exampl of physic area in which newton ha made a theori that everi bodi in the univers is attract toward the earth due to gravit forc . thi fact ha not just emerg from the idea that an appl thrown up ha fell down . he went deep into the idea whi the came down and made him do a research that proov their is a forc of attract toward the earth . as a result we learn today the law of newton . so as far as the exampl is concern i strongli believ in idea that led to fact and the student commun should focu on that the exampl i give is the invent of electr that benjamin franklin ha given . the mere idea that she felt the shock dure fli her kite didnt led to the electr . she made effort to learn whi thi happen and she felt that their are some charg particl which are responsipons for that shock . thi led mani theori in physic and later scientist creat wonder with thi concept . the argument can prove in all other area not onli in scienc . student doe understand the fact unless they are project with concept and idea . so unless the fact are support with enough idea and concept the fact are never fact and there will be a black spot alway if it is believ blindli
