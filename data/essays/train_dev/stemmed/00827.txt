in twenti year there will be much more car in use than there are today , if noth unusu like a world war happen . and the main reason to support thi idea is just becaus the world 's popul is grow veri fast . in particular , the popul of develop countri is increas at a rapid rate , and mani of these countri are attain veri high rate of develop . let us think about china : it ha a popul of more than one billion peopl . china 's econom growth rate is 9 % . nowaday still mani peopl in china is poor , but as long as the countri continu to recov , more and more car will be demand . the same phenomum is occur in countri like brasil or india . the fact that the amount of oil to produc petrol is limit and will no longer exist as the main power sourc use by car and other mean of transport , doe not impli that the amount of exist car will be reduc in twenti year . first , after that period , there still will be petrol enough to be use by car , and second , there will be other altern sourc of energi like hydrogen . like or not , car are nowaday our princip mean of transport , even peopl do not use them in an effici way . mani peopl go to their job by car , and prefer it to the public transport . but , for exampl , most of the time an averag person use a big car of four place for thi purpous . thi caus mani traffic problem and pollut . to solv thi new public polici are necessari to reinforc and to enhanc the use of public transport by make it cheaper . in conclus in twenti year will be definet more car than today but they should be re-inv . they probabl will be differ : smaller ( just for one person or two ) , they will consum less energi and use alternative-clean energi sourc . .. thi issu is relat with our great goal as human , which is to care about sustain develop
