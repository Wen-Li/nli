i disagre with the statement which is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i will disscu and give the reason as follow . first of all , travel in a group led by a tour guid make you not to think . i person think the travel would be more fun and interest if i make my own plan . if i travel in a group led by a tour guid , i end up just chat with peopl and follow a tour guid . after that kind of travel , i would not rememb anyth . for exampl , when i wa in middl school and high school , i went to school trip led by a tour guid . even though the place i went wa kyoto which is most beauti citi in japan and they have most valuabl and interest templ , noth realli remein in my mind after the trip becaus i wa just part of the group and follow a tour guid without think . i think i wast great opportun by do that . second , hire tour guid cost more money . i rather spend same amount of money on eat well dure my travel instead of hire a tour guid . if i could get most of the inform tour guid provid by read travel guid or search on internet , i do not think it worth to pay that much money for a tour guid . especi , now a day , becaus of the develop of the internet , we could easili find inform in free . third , travel in a group with tour guid make trip too tourist . most of the tour guid onli take peopl to the major spot and suvenior shop they have commit . but there are more thing we could see besid those sightse spot . for exampl , when i travel to new york first time , i wa not led by a tour guid , but eventu , i get to visit not onli most of the major spot but also happen to discov a lot of interest spot none of the tour guid would take peopl to . in conclus , i disagre with the statement the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . my favorit way to travel is either with famili of close friend , and make our own plan . it give me more fun and opportun for learn and experi .
