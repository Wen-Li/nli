i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i think that thi statement is true becaus often when i watch an advertis i think that the product seem good but when i saw the same product for real , i think the opposit . howev , i is the aim of advertis to make product look good as a result peopl want to buy the product . first i think that advertis never repres the truth and i am often disappoint when i see a product by myself . for instanc the last advertis that i saw wa one for food , some kind of bread which seem to be so good and tasti . as a result when i went to the shop i had a look at that bread but when i found it i wa veri angri becaus it wa n't the same that on the advertis . i know that advertis are often opposit to the realiti but somtim i like to think that it would be what i wa espect to be . thu sometim i tri to see if advertis join the realiti . then i know that the aim of advertis is to make peopl dream so i can understand whi there are often far from the realiti . moreov peopl like to dream behind advertis and like to think that life could be better and could tend to be the one they see in advertis . nowaday , there are a lot of softwar to chang pictur and make them look what peopl want to . as a result we are use to transform the realiti and to brighten it and we are use to see the thing as there are not . the fiction ha bare take the place of the realiti . therfor it is hard to know whether peopl have adapt themselv to advertis or advertis have adapt to t \ peopl 's expect . in conclus i agre with that statement but i do n't think that i can blame advertis for that .
