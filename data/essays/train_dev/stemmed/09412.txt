i disagre with the statement becaus i do n't think that enjoy life ha anyth to do with age . i believ there are more issu that have to be take into consider in order to establish whether a person at ani particular age doe or doe not enjoy life . health , for instanc , is crucial for happi and therefor can be determin for enjoy or not enjoy life . one 's charact and emot stabil are also import factor . i 'm sure there are old peopl that suffer from bad health and are not abl to enjoy life fulli , but thi could also be the case of a teenag suffer from leuchemia and feel miser . he is young but not necessarili enjoy life . on the other hand , there must be peopl that be old , have the bless of have the best health and therefor enjoy life more than troubl teenag struggl with their banal . other factor can infuenc the concept of self-hapi of a person like famili , social or cultur class , opportun , incom level , etc . all these factor impact peopl of all age . i also think that it is a matter of attitud . while there are outer factor that influenc the way we enjoy life or feel happi , it is what everyon make out of the siuation what at the end of the day determin their concept of happi . the way we deal with problem and our abil to solv them , the veri thought of ourselv as free live be and the attitud we have toward our enviro , are factor that will make the peopl that sorround us decid whether we are enjoy life or not . the statement is mislead beacis it inferr that young peopl can do more thing than old peopl and can therefor enjoy life more .
