in my opinion , i think that it is better for undergradu student to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . what is more , it is better for graduat student to special in one specif subjuect . my reason are lise as follow . in the first place , the majoritey of undergradu student face the problom of find job when they graduat from the univers or colleg , except the student who plan to pursu the higher degre . if they have broad knowledg of mani academ , it mean that they have more oppotunitis to reciev a good job . on the other hand , it is obviou that undergradu student just reciev a fundat educ in the univers . with the broad knowledg background , the undergradu student will becom move competit in the job market . as far as the graduat student , sinc their task is be outstand in one special field , and they have not enough energi to studi deepli in variou field . therefor , it is suitabl for a graduat student to special in one specif subject . as far as i am concern , i alway believ that a graduat student is a person who is so intelleg that can contribut to the field of scienc which he or she is stude . ademittedli , have broad knowledg of variou academ subject is definit benefaci for graduat student to achiev success in hi special field . as a result , it is greatli use for everyon to devot himself of herself to enlarg the sphere of knowledg . take into account of what have been discuss abov , we may reach the conclus that the undergradu student should have broad knowledg of mani academ , and the graduat student are more suitabl to studi in one specif subject .
