i disagre with the state idea . i think there will be more car in use in twenti year from now . car have been one of the indispens transport sinc they were invent . and even though there have been mani other transport system were develop , such as subway and airplan , car never been out of peopl 's life . instead of be replac by other transport system , they have chang to better version contion . moreov , some peopl are veri interest in buy or collect old version of popular car , like classic model of `` beatl '' . car may be consid just as a mean of move . but purpos of owe a car ha chang over time , and nowaday some want car to show their life style and person . for thi reason , there will be more car in the futur . howev , it 's possibl that new and better mean of transport will be invent in the futur , but i believ that car will be develop to be a better mean than now . as we 've been do thi for a long time , we can find better resourc for power , and also better design for car . also there will be more car consid peol 's tast today . live in a modern world , mani peopl prefer to stay privat wherev possibl and want to feel at home whenev possibl . in that point , car are the best way to choos . i predict that fancier , more comfort , faster , and safer mean of move than car will appear in twenti year . even if it happen , i 'd choos to stay with my own car . car have been one of the most attract thing peopl can have , and i believ peopl wo n't be abl to resist the urg of buyig a new car and drive on the street .
