i disagre with the idea that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i disagre with thi becaus of the sever reason . the first reason whi i disagre that there will be fewer car is that the main cost associ with the maintenac of the car is petrol . mani peopl do n't want to buy a car becaus of thi cost . with the grow technolog peopl might come up with substitut of petrol . and then it would be easier for mani peopl to maintain the car at low cost . so they will tend to buy more car . the second reason whi i disagre that there will be fewer car is that it could be more cheaper in futur . there are mani peopl who want to buy car but they are not abl to afford it becasu they do n't have the suffici money or the car loan interest rate is too high . so in futur if the new car with low cost will be introduc it will be easili access by each class of the societi . or it is possibl that with the growth of economi peopl can avail loan at low rate , that will again help them in buy car . third reason for expect of more car in futur is that peopl are now leav in the joint famili . one car can be use by the whole famili . as these day these idea of joint famili are not like by mani peopl , there is a consist growth in nuclear famili . in such case each nuclear famili will need a seper car . so that will increas the number of car in use . after consid all these factor i would like to conclud that i disagre with the statement that in futur there will be fewer car in use than there are today . with the expect of growth in each field wether it 's technolog or economi or ani other field we can sure expect that more car will be use in futur .
