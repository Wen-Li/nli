i disagre with the opinion that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun becaus i know a lot of young peopl do help their commun . i have friend who are engag in the group of comedian . they are all from 20 to around 30 year old . wherea they perform at theater to make money , they also perform for children and elderli peopl at daycar center . they say that they just realli like to see the audienc laugh . i know a group which is call `` guardian angel . '' the group is consist of about 50 young peopl . the member of the group patrol around downtown and if they find someon who need help , they help or advis him/her . for exampl , when they find girl who are under 18 or younger after midnight in the street , they convinc them to go home earlier . anoth exampl is that a young woman help her commun develop their sight-se industri . she work at a travel agenc in her small town . becaus she want to make her town well-known , she decid to appeal her town . she plan to have a festiv and carri it out . peopl in the town cooper with her and brought a lot of food , craft and suvenir to the festiv . as a result , a lot of peopl came to visit her town and the town ha improv their sight-se industri . thu , a lot of young peopl are assosi with their commun and contribut to them . they simpli enjoy help their commun .
