in my countri that is to say in franc , at school we are stude variou class . but is n't it better to be special in one specif subject than have broad of knowledgeof mani academ subject ? if broad knowledg let you discov new thing and follow one program without do ani choic . on the contrari be special on a specif subject make you be better on thi subject like a profession and not lose your time . broad knowlwdg make you dicov new thing in some case , and mayb , thing that you never imagin you could be interest in , mayb one can find it vocat . moreov , it can be useful for your own cultur to know about the stori of your countri or about what is happen in your bodi , even if you will not be an historian or a biologist . in addit , the fact that you do n't have ani choic of class subject to make like in high school , help peopl who do n't know what to do . that it 's what happen with some of my friend . on the other side , be special on a specif subject can prepar you for your profession life , and with thi solut you are onli do thing you like or thing that you want to know about . therefor peopl do n't have the feel to lose there time becaus they are do thi in order to be an expert and to find a job which deal about the subject . to my mind it is better to have a broad of knowledg of mani subject becaus i am realli curiou . i will borrow me be onli special in one topic . i like to learn about mani thing it make me feel more intelig .
