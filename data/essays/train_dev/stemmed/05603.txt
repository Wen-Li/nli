i agre with the statement that it is more import to understand idea that it is to learn pure fact . i have sever reason support my opinion on thi topic . firstli , today nearli all fact are avail anywher at anytim . so the import of lear fact is weaken . instead the time coul ; d be use more senseful get concept . for instanc , it is possibl for a histori class student to get nearli all histor figur he need in the internet . there he can get them all day long , and with the help of mobil comput nearli everywher . secondli , concept are veri import to learn , becaus you need them in order to creat own idea and concept . fact do not help much with that . for instanc in my job as a control i do not onli have to know how some special figur , for instanc the return on invest or the earn of one year have to be calcul , but in order to improv our control instrument , i have to figur ot new figur . to do thi , i need to know how to creat them . i need to know which number would me of use to our manag . to creat new figur it is also necessari to have a gener idea of mathmet concept . these can not be learn by heard , but have to be understood . onc understood , i am abl to appli these concept to work on new idea . thirdli , for high develop countri it is veri import to be faster in developmet than for instanc the fast develop countri in asia . they are abl to copi our industri product veri fast after they have been develop by us . therefor we need to be faster in gener new product , new idea and new technolog . you do not learn to creat those new technolog by learn fact . it is onli possibl to learn creat them by learn concept and idea . in my point it is realli import to understand concept and less import to learn pure fact . thi is becaus in futur it will becom more and more import to be creativ and invent . in order to achiev thi , it is highli appreci to have well educ , creativ employe .
