i do not agre or disagre with thi particular statement becuas it total depend on the idea that you have when you want to travel and also where you wish to go . for me , when you 're younger you alway look for someth new even if it get a littl too riski and sometim that risk you are will to take is the main attract of the whole trip . if i want to know a citi and if i have the time to do it the best way to explor everi interest corner , at least for me , is go directli to them instead of wait for our turn in the tour rout for that place . also , know peopl of the place is much better than spend all day with other you dont like in the bu . i think is realli a good expier to be surround by peolp with differ cultur becaus you realiz that we 're not so differ in mani way it 's onli matter of social belief the way we react in everi situat of our live . the best thing of a group lead by a tour guid is the time you save when someon who know everyth about the place you have visit is in your side . i mean you dont have to worri for the food , the hotel or the place you 'll use to rest , the place you have to go and all those thing you have to know about the peopl , their languaj and their costum . mayb a group of friend on a trip can be the better way to travel to a new land for me and even if a tour guid is lead us becaus im not realli look to get lost in a citi i dont even know , at least not for now or ani soon .
