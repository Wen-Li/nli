know idea and concept form techniqu to understand a subject or topic . fact are true statement about the subject or topic . when it come to decid which of these are better for indepth knowledg of a subject or topic , then i complet agre with the statement `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' my opinion is influenc by certain factor which includ ; need to analys a topic to learn better , better remember of fact and have a grip on the topic so that new fact can be easili understood . when we think of learn , the first thing that come to mind is how to understand the content . to understand the subject , we need to analys it content . for exampl , we are deal with a fact that all matter is made up of atom . it veri simpl statement , but we must understand whi it is so to appreci the fact state . here come the requir for analysi . as we analys the topic , we could also understand the need for state thi , which could be that we are studi the structur of some materi say benzen . next we need to rememb some fact of a subject . the exampl quot earlier wa a simpl logic fact . but , some complex fact like the einstein 's theori of rel is not veri easi to rememb . it need understand of the content to memor the fact . without a proper understand of the concept involv which made the scientist to propos the theori , it is just imposs to rememb the fact propos as it is veri complex . lastli , when we are learn someth , it should not be mere memor of the fact state , but , it should be a concret base for furthur development studi . in simpler word , learn someth should be like a foundat to a build . the build could be a research or know newer fact to be understood . suppos , while experi , we make an observ , then without a understand the idea of conduct the experi and concept includ in the process involv in it , we will not be abl to conclud from the experi . so , even to state a fact , understand of idea and concept is imper . in short , understand of idea and concept will help us analys the fact present to us . besid , it also enabl us to memor the fact and other content of the subject . final and most import of all these is that , without a proper understand of the idea and concept , we will neither be abl to understand nor conclud anyth . so , understand enabl better learn that mere know of fact .
