enjoy mean make the life happi . by satisfi the soul of the bodi not onli physic but also mental . if a person can get through both the mental and physic stress . then the person is said to be enjoy hi life . for the enjoy of the life especi the is no age limit . both young ang old peopl can enjoy the life beauti if they plan there life properli . if not the person at ani age can not enjoy hi life . in my opinon old peopl enjoy there life more happyili than the younger one becaus , in thi morden world peopl should run with the time they rearli get the time to enjoy . for instanc if u see a school go boy/girl they alway run with the time . there curriculam schedul is so tight that they are unabl even to talk to there own parent . they are total miss there sweet time by enjoy with there parent which is necessari for a young child to share hi feel , which is not possibl for a young child . but the older peopl are spend enjoy life by do the thing at the time they want to do atleast they are have that liberti . come to the young peopl who are go to job they schedul is also not at all plan accord to them . they hav to do hard work to earn money . the peopl around him will respect him onli if he have money . so peopl all over the world is runnig all around to earn money . such young peopl who are at great stress full job are unabl even to take care of there health . so they are also not enjoy the life . if we see odler peopl who are out of there job are atleast have right food at time . they are enjoy by take care of there own grand children . thu , i conclud that even youngstrer can enjoy there life if they make some free time share there happi and sad with there famili or friend . they can realli enjoy the full sweet of life than older one . becaus they have great time to enjoy .
