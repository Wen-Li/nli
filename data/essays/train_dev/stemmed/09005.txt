understand the idea behind a fact is much more import than learn the fact by itself . thi doe not onli appli to strict scienc like math , but also to subject like histori . in math , there is a set of given truth from which the rest are infer ( proov ) . the statement obtain from thi basic set are formal in theorem , which , in turn can be use to proov further fact ( new theorem or corollari ) . peopl lack the understand of the basic set of truth or how the theorem were proov would not be abl to achiev further learn . in subject like histori , while know the fact is veri import and one may think that their whole field of studi , understand the reason that gave place to an event may give a kind of knowledg much more useful than the mere fact . thi knowledg may help identifi situat that may lead to problem in the futur and prevent them . so , while know someth took place by itself may not be of much help in the futur , understand the factor that gave rise to the situat and what their consequ were , could be veri import . the gain we may obtain in the futur by understand idea and concept is the main reason we studi . fact by themselv may be useless , understand the concept behind them is what is useful . if understand and the reason that goe with it were or no consequ , have an encyclopec knowledg of thing would be suffici . and that is not the case , sinc we have institut whose onli reason of exist is reasearch , that is , understand concept and idea , to gener new fact and knowleg that may better our societi .
