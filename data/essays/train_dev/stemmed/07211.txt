everyon in thi world can enjoy hi life in hi own way . peopl are differ in express thier enjoy of life . how we can ejoy thi life and be happi ? everyon know that life is not easi and it need lot of work to be success person in it . there are two group of peopl who can enjoy thi life such as , the young peopl and the older pepol . first , yong pepl can ejoy life in differ way . for exampl , they can do mani thing in thi life without ani respons for what they are do becaus they know that the respos are carri for thier parent . also , they can do a lot of thing that the older peopl ca n't do as a result of health . young peopl can do a lot of activ on one day , but the older peolp ca n't do that . so the young peopl are the right peopl to enjoy thi life . secound , older poepl can , t enjoy thi life like the young peopl . there are differ reason for that . the firt reason , is that the are respons for eveyth they do . also , the reason of health ca n't help them to do a lot of activ on one day . the logic provid these point in a veri clear way . old peopl had alreadi taken their time to enjoy thi life when they were young . so they have to give the chanc for the other gener to enjoy hi own life . final , in my opinion , i agre that young peopl are the right peolp to enjoy ti life . that is becaus the older peopl had alreadi taken thier own chanc . also , i disagre that the older peolpl must relax after they have finish thier work in the whole life becaus they are the peopl who must have other work . such as , teach thier children the right ting to do and to have the resposibiltiy of what thier young children do . in conclus , thi life is for all the peolp to enjoy , but the right peopl or the peopl who have the chanc to enjoy it more are the young peopl . we must all enjoy thi life in the durat of time when we are young .
