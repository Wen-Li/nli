i agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . my first point which is most import is that , they are young . sinc they are young they have lot of energi to enjoy by the way they want . for exampl , if someon think he enjoy hi life by play some outdoor game , when he ha a plenti of time . now , if thinker is young person he can just grabb hi stuff to play & go on . but suppos thi come in a mind of an old person that not possibl easilli becaus he ha to remind quick what kind of restrict hi doctor make on him . also other point is lack of energi . he may not be abl to perform that task even if he will enjoy in out door game . he ha to compromis with thing like just watch t.v or have famili dinner parti , an easi way of enjoy all older peopl prefer . also second thing which support my agreement is , travel or trip which lot of peopl like & good way of enjoy . when all the friend come togeth & make a plan for a long trip , is easi for youngster becaus they are abl to face all the kind of problem start from weather chang to walk a mile away by foot when there car is out of fuel . but in case of older peopl they need support in such kind of situat . they can not face as youngster can . they need there medicin readi while weather chang happen & even though they are preprepair , they are not sure that there bodi can respond well . so , basic young peopl can enjoy there life more than older peopl as they have enough eneri to enjoy by the way they want . but older peopl also have so mani way to enjoy there rest of life . as , at one time when they were young they also had fun .
