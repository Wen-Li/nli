i disagre with the statement , becaus i still can see the young peopl help their commun whenev they have time . it is veri common that young peopl nowaday have hard time do thier task , such as , for thier job , school an so on . howev , some of the young peopl , whenev they fave thier free time , they prefer to help thier commun , for exempl , teach thier own languag to younger and help to build and paint a hous . these young peopl gather up and help old peopl to build their hous and paint their wall . although they are alreadi tire by thier weekday ' schedul , they attend on thier help day and give hope to the old peopl . in south korea , there are mani commun that young peopl are involv . sinc they are meant to be `` the intern '' , they go to the countri which they would like to help and work there as long as they want . especi , they would like to go to the develop countri and stay there about a month . sinc my uncl wa one of the person who help hi commun , i heard that he help the commun to plan for the trip to ghanna and so on . i think there are also some young peopl who do not put enough time to help thier commun . howev , it is wrong to say most of them are not help becaus there are also mani young peopl who are work hard for their commun and whenev they have time , they alway think about how they will make their commun better . as the world get better in develop young peopl will be more busi than they were befor but on the other hand , i am sure that there will be also mani young peopl who are will to help their commun whenev they have spare time .
