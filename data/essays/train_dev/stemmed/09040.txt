young peopl are less help their commun than befor . that is a fact , they do not spend enough time help . in my opinion that is a sad fact and their are two major reason from thi . nowaday , we live in a selfish sociti where capit is take the biggest role . i talk about capit becaus in my opinion it is not onli an econom fact but it is also a social one . for instanc , the game that my 17 year old brother play are much more differ that the one i use to play when i wa younger . he play video game that are in my opinion `` selfish '' . in those game he play by himself most of the time . so there is no socialis with other young peopl . thi fact doe not teach how to share thing with other and special how to help becaus they teach that help other is a weak . peopl are independ younger than befor . they do not reli on their parent for a long time as befor . most of the 16 year old children dream of leav home and have their own appart . in my cultur , the moroccan one , familli is realli import . but i see that young peopl are loos thi valu more and more . they tend to leav their parent , the `` first commun '' the have been in . they are selfish and they do not like to share thing and help other . we are actual fast for ramadan . dure thi special occas , all the familli come togeth and everyon have to prepar someth to eat for instanc . brake the fast have alway been someth that we all live togeth . but those last year , i see that my younger cousin doe not want to share it with us . it 's more an oblig for them than a happi event to share all togeth . it emerg from thi discuss that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help and be with their commun . that is an aweful fact but that is the truth .
