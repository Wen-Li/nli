i think that if thing are still in twenti year like theyr go today , it veri like to be much more car in use then , than they 're now , so i dont agre whith the given statement . although petroleum is like to run up befor those twenti year pass , i think there might be some other product or substanc to be burnt to take the necesari energi that drive a car . it not an illus and even today there are appear the first car that use other substanc , such as propan or ani other gase , on the market . i think that when twenti year have pass by , thi technolog will be enough develop to let car move with no petroleum need . thi doesnt mean that they wont harm our environ , which might be realli harm by then , but i dont realli think noon go to chang anyth to prevent or solv the environment problem , as long as noon ha until today . peopl could mayb stop use their own car when the earth get so much heaten that live in it get imposs , or at least veri annoy , but i dont think that is go to happen between the next twenti year , and the car 's commerc is so powerful that nobodi is go to take care of prevent the use of car befor heat get to be unstand . as i think thi wont happen , and car have shown to be a veri like product to be sell , i mean , car are veri well posit and adapt to citi and citizen lifestyl all over the world , it veri probabl that car get on their sell as they 've been until now , so the new car should be ad to the old to final detect a big increas in the total number of them . not onli thi , but if look at the rest of the world , and not onli develop countri , we will find that some big countri are be develop nowaday , like china or india , and they are potenti car consum in a veri close futur , which , of cours , includ the next twenti year
