in my opinion , it is more import for student to undersantd idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . there are sever reason whi i agre with thi statement . first , i think that understand an idea and a concept is the first step to learn someth new . for exampl , if you do not know the concept of `` evapor '' how are you go to know the `` process of rain '' or mayb understand some chemic procress that involv the concept `` evapor '' . secondli , i agre that student must know everi concept of life becaus thi is go to give them the power to solv new challegen without know the fact . for exampl , if a student know the concept of `` bowl someth '' , them it is would be easier for he to cook someth by just follow the instruct . final , i support thi thank to a person experi i had live . last year , whem i wa in high school , i had to take a scienc test and i studi hard for it . whem i start to ask it i stope at the most import question and did not know how to answer it becaus of my lack of knowlegd in some sciencetif concept . to sum up , i believ that student must focu on learn all the concept the can and then worri on learn fact becaus everyth goe step by step and the first step here to learn a new fact , is first get the idea and the concept of everi new word . therefor , they would have the skill to learn more than student think they could do without known the concept .
