i would say that young peopl give or may not give enough time to help their commun . it depend upon individu mental . if one wish he can help but it depend on mani factor like time , interest , responsib and mani more . if one want to help he wil help without consid these factor co he may love help them . if one doe not want to help even if he ha all those factor he wil not help . for exampl if one see hi parent suffer from some pain he may not help . there may be mani reason for thi also like not freindli atmospher with hi parent etc . help one need courag becaus without it one is noth in hi life . so one need thi factor also . one might not help becaus he might hav been had busi shedul like work and mani more . if one is busi even if he wish he will not be abel to help one . help communuti not requir young peopl but all the age . nowaday some youngster are becom so busi spend their time in pub , caff day , eatout they wast their tome spend in these place so where will they get the time for communuti . but some are not indlug in such activ so that they get enough time to spend . so such peopl are veri effect toward such communuti . but one is more interest to get wealth so they far away place in such situat they might have enough time ot give their communuti . even they may indulg in some friendship which avoid them to stay far away and not give enough time . henc i conclud say that it depend upon individu mental to give enough time ot give their communuti .
