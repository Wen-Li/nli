accord to me it is import for student to understand the idea and concept as well as to learn the fact . i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept . onc he understand the idea and concept well at the basic level he can proceed in hi learn and can develop hi or her understand to the higher level and can also master in the subject which the student ha taken . the understand will help him and motiv him for further studi and he can excel . idea and concept are basic thing the student should understand . like for an exampl the botani student doe not understand the concept of photosynthesi he can not understand anyth about hi subject becaus concept of photosynthesi is the basic concept the botani student should know . therefor understand concept and idea is much more import for student than fact . onc he understand the concept and idea he can work and build hi understand on fact . as the student get motiv by do well by understand the idea and concept he or she will automat motiv for further enhanc of fact . fact are a part of idea and concept . like when a student understand idea about photosynthesi he will have the detail fact about what each part of the tree doe and how doe the part of the tree particip in photosynthesi
