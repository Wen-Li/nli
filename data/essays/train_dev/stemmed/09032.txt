in my oppinion it is nowerday an import abil to be flexibel and to have a good overal educ . but on the other hand mani compani are search for the best peopl for a specif job . and if you want to be the best in a special direct you will have to studi or learn thi section veri intens to know what exactli you have to do . the main topic in my busi career wa to be where peopl want me to be and do what peopl want me to do , becaus if it wa not the fact , the peopl would ask someon els to do my job and would do thi also in other job . so my task wa to do everyth they want my to do . on the one handsid thi abil save my connect to the peopl who gave me the job and on the other handsid the peopl made propaganda and a kind of advertis for me and my good work . i never ever had a second of save what would happen on the next day in my life . i need job and i need to say ye , becaus of i would said no , my famli would not have anyth to eat on the next day . if i were specialiy in one spezif job or direct , i would have to live with the fear that someday someon would come yo me and say that it is over and that thi section is close becaus there is no more need for the job i do . with my flexibl abil thi could not happen to me , becaus i could do anyth they want me to do . germani with it high unemploy rate is the best exampl for good academ educ peopl , who are after their exam without a job becaus the educ they have do not fir with the jobprofil . with a felxibl educ with broad knowledg it is easier to find a job and to save the job .
