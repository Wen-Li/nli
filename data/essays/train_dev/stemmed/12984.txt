for me , i would agre to join a group that led by a tour guid ; howev , to travel by ourselv in an unknown plave in veri danger and will spend lot of money . let 's imagin a condit . if we travel to an unknown place with onli a map and confus by it , will we have a lot of fun in that place ? i think everyon 's answer is no . we can not just visit an unknown place on foot ; we should drive a car . if we miss the direct , we have to keep drive and spend lot of money for the oil . without the help of the tour guid , we might live in an expens hotel . if there is someth we do not understand about the landscap , there is no one we can ask , and it is not easi to ask a stranger . onc we meet the danger such as medic care , it will be veri hard to seek the volunt who can help us . if there is a tour guid , we can visit the place , which in the place we do not even know befor , with happi heart and good consulor . we do not need to bring a map becuas the tour guid is our map . we do not need to walk or drive the car and spend the oil money ; we will have a comfort bu and pay onli a small amout of money for it . we will not have ani question about the landscap becuas the tour guid will be a teacher . if we have danger , the tour guid will find a way as soon as possibl to solv it . in conclus , even though travel just by ourselv can make us have more freedom and time , but we will also bring anyth that is uncertain with us , such as car accid and miss the way to go . we all sure want the happi and peac with us when we are travel , but without a good helper , everyth will happen easili . if there is a good helper when we are travel , we do not need to worri much about everyth becuas the tour guid can led us to the happi and peac . although we have to pay the money to the tour guid , but the most import is the safeti and a nice spirit in a trip .
