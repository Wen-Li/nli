i would like to agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem better than they realli are . first of all , advertis tend to provid a superfici facad to the actual product . the experi of use a product is subject in natur and vari from individu to individu . it can not be generalis . the user themselv are the best judg about the qualiti of a product . howev , advertis mislead peopl by gener classifi product as good or use . advertis reli on the brand valu of superstar to convey the messag that a particular product is worth buy . in most case , superstar themselv dont use product that they advertis . public sentiment is manipul in an uneth manner . filmstar who advertis for a particular brand of bicycl would have never pedal even a few metr . the sparkl white colour that we see on our televis screen after a singl wash of a particular deterg is probabl becaus the shirt is new . such kind of experi are not conduct in full public view . instead they are care frame behind close door to convey a particular messag . the authent of the claim be made are inconsequenti . the increas number of complaint be file by consum in variou consum forum across the world suggest that someon somewher is be taken for a ride . miner water is advertis as be pure , onli to discov that the pesticid content in the water is beyond permiss level . slim pill will promis weight reduct in a few week time , the fact that the side effect of consum the pill could also lead to hair loss and fatigu is a well conceal fact . advertis never realli tell the full stori . they talk about the brighter side of thing but tend to run away from hard fact which go against them . in conclus i would like to state that advertis have becom an indispens part of our live in the modern world . howev as well inform citizen we should understand that the tall claim be made in those jazzi advertis need to be substanti by hard fact .
