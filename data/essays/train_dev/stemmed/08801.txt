are not sleep well these day . they say that it is becom a harsher world . the develop of technolog result in isol between famili and neighboor . the younger gener is especi thought of as self-cent and unhelp to their commun . some fact might be true , but i disagre with the statement that the younger gener is unhelp becaus young peopl spend a lot of time contribut to their commun by direct and indirect way . the first reason i disagre with the statement is that young peopl actual do spend a lot of time help out with the commun . for exampl , in my colleg , everi freshman 's dream is to join a student oper club to make school life more enjoy and plenti . there are variou choic of club , rang from drama club to tea drink club . howev , out of the approximitli 100 club , one third of the club are volunt club . also , our school ha a cours that give credit for volunt dure the semest . eventhough the cours is worth 1 credit , it is imposs to take the cours becaus so mani student appli for it . it may seem like young peopl are onli interest in themselv , but given these reason , i unquestion believ that young peopl spend a consider amount of time help the commun . moreov , i disagre with the statement becaus the younger gener contribut to their commun not onli directli , but in indirectli as well . unlik the older gener , the younger peopl are expos to advanc technolog and global . in their own way their own way . for exampl , my countri , korea , is a small countri . recent , howev , korea ha been expand quickli into the world . the reason is that young , smart peopl made succes all over the world . becaus the repres our countri , our countri ha a more succes statu in the world . the younger gener may be a littl more self-mind than the older peopl . howev , that doe not mean that they do not help their societi . we are all contridbut to our commun the way we can in our own uniqu way . that is whi our world is still a beauti place to live .
