i do n't agre with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i 've experienc both type of travel , group tour led by a tour guid and individu trip which is plan and schedul by myself . both goup tour and individu tour ha pro and con . group tour is typic much more easier and convini for those peopl who do n't have much time to prepar for the trip and who can onli spend a few day for the holiday . and for older gener , it is way more comfort especi becaus they do n't need to worri about the transport and the hotel when they are in abroad becaus the tour compani provid with the transport and place to stay at night , and as those travel agenc get a discount it could be even cheaper for the travel when they use a group tour with a tour guid . and also for the differ languag and the inform of the place they are visit , the tour guid could give much help for the peopl in a goup . these are all the benefici thing for the goup tour , but there are mani inconvini and unconfort thing when you are travel in a group . for exampl you ca n't visit the place you particualri like to visit , and you alway need to follow the group of peopl and the tour guid who 's hold a flag to indic where to follow . and they are alway in a rush , so it make it quit difficult to enjoy and relax in your favorit spot . as the group tour provid you a cheaper tour packag , you are to stop by mani of the shop center and souvenir shop which even reduc the amount of time you could enjoy for someth els . wait for other peopl in the group to arriv is anoth concern . sometim it take forev for them to come back to the bu to go to the next place shorten the time they could spend in a tourist attract . on the other hand if you travel on your own , thing could be more complic but at the same time you get to see more and learn more . first of all , you have more memori with more experi . you can learn and studi a lot befor actual go to the place where you are go . and i believ that it 's also a part of the travel . it could be quit excit imagin what to do , see and eat and where to go ! second , you can pick the place in accord with your own interest and you can explor and travel around at your own pace and desir . third , the best thing i like about travel on my own is that i get to meet the local peopl and friend from other counti who are also travel on their own and we can share the inform and becom friend ! it can be a great joy while travel . and last person as i 'm a young person , i appreci new experi and it 's quit difficult to be patient when i just have to follow a group of peopl when they are go to a place where i do n't have ani interest in visit . such as shop center or souvenir shop and other bore place . organ where to go and what to do on my own is way more enjoy than mere follow the schedul plan with other peopl . and that 's whi i do n't agre with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . it 's just an easi and confort way to enjoy travel . for me , the best way to travel is to travel by myself or with someon i like !
