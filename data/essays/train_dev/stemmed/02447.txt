what i think about thi case is goin for the first chois which is , it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , becaus when a person have that knowledg about the academ subject other than in one specif subject , sure a person would have a job which ha a one specif subject for exampel , a doctor , hi feild or hi main subject that a doctor should be know about it is medican and bodi sinc in gener , but that dose not mean he onli have to know what about hi job onli , well what wrong about have knowledg about other thing for exampl , a knowledg of art , how great is to find a doctor wich hi clinic is full of hi art work or some he bought in hi own tast of art , a normal person if he walk in a place like that he would say that thi doctor is not like ani other doctor . have a broad knowledg is some thing realli great from some to get usd from it , it can be veri help ful in some posit , for exampl some peopl are site and talk about some field of stude , and they all have a knowledg about mani academ subject exepet one person whose now interest to have aother knowledg of what he have , what if these peopl opend a subject far from thi person field or specif subject , what hi posit would be like , and what if some of these peopl askd him about some thing in the other field of hi , after that , that person would think that he wa wrong about stike in one specif subject know all about it , from that stuiation peopl chang their mind about what they have made . so for not be in that kind of posit i agre and 100 % support have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
