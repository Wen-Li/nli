in my opinion it is in gener better when you have a broad knowledg of academ subject . firstli , in mani academ subject , you need a overview about sever topic to understand the relationship within one topic and between differ theme . i studi econom at the univers of appli scien in nuremberg . for exampl in financ i have to know the theoret basic in financ but i also need the knowledg of mathemat , tax and law . so i am not onli specifi on one subject . dure the semster , we have mani differnt subject which all stand in relationship to econom . for exampl , market , financ , law , tax , accout . english , gener mangament etc . secondli , it is not sure , that someon alway get a job in that subject that he ha studi . so it is possibl , that he had studi financ but now work in a market depart . the situat on tte work market is not so good and so it is better to have a broad knowledg . my friend studi logist and now he is work as banker , but while hi studytim he must vistit lectur of financ and assur . so he ha not that problem to work in thi field . but there are also subject in which it is better , when you are specifi . for instanc in medic : it is not possibl , that everi doctor know everyth . you need someon for skin deas but also someon who ha knowlegd about cancer . in thi case it is of advantag , when you have a specif knowledg . on the other hand it so for the human brain imposs all to know . in a conclus it is to say , that it depend on the subject and how deep the subect is relat to other . on the one hand it can be better to have a wide knowledg , on the other hand it can be use to be specialis in one academ field .
