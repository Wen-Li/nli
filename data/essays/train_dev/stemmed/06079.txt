everyon know that advert are made on purpos to sell , it mean that product shown on televivion or in magazin do alway look much better than in realiti . sometim it happen that you watch an advertis on televis , which tell you that a certain product is exactli what you need . basic they show you mani evid qualiti , like bright color or enorm size , that are suppos to belong to the object , but onc you arriv in the shop you get a huge disappoint : the thing you expect to be big and amaz is usual much smaller and doe n't realli look like the one you have dreamt about . thi point can easili be explain mention the psycholog role in make advertis . in fact , what product realli need for be sold , is expect . it mean that the valu of an object is determin by the psycholoc impact thi object is abl to have on peopl . provid that behind everi advertis there is the long and hard work of a brilliant psychologist equip , peopl should alway tri to look at icon through an object point of view . for `` object prospect '' i mean that peopl should tri not to be influenc by extern - and sometim sublimin - messag . messag i am talk about are gener use by brand to drive peopl 's mind in a certain direct . so , accord to what i have just analys , i think that it is veri import to be awar of what the bid compasni are do through advertis . in my opinion advert - mechan is a clear exampl of brain wash : without even know it , in some way we are forc to do someth they want : buy their product . i reckon that thi situat is veri danger and terribl at the same time : i mean someon is control us , isn ' it scari ?
