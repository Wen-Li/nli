i would not person agre with the statement . life to me is a flow river that is beauti at everi stage . what ultim matter is our perspect toward life , our prioriti and valu we hold most close to ourselv . ultim i guess it all boil down to what we conciev or understand of the notion of ` enjoy ' . for a child play could be enjoy . someth as small as build sand castl could ! as the child grow hi demand and need evolv with him and ultim what he ask from life would determin hi level of happi or enjoy . at adoles the spark of chemistri between the oppsit sex could be excit . later on , find someon you love or someon who love you mayb of most import at a given phase of live . at a latter stage one might want to marri and settl down or may choos not to do so as per one our person choic and whatev give them satisfact . even the birth of a child and everi moment of bring up that child could be a great deal of enjoy !! as you age your grandchildren could be the greatest sourc of enjoy . my belief in thi theori ha onli been augment from empir evid i bring right from home . my parent are old yet happi and content . they enjoy everi moment and live everi second of it to the fullest . in brief i could summaris thi theori in term of a utilitarian . life is extrem short so make use of it to the fullest - use it up to the optimum for as long as you live , your live your life no matter how old or how young you are . therefor enjoy to me is a subject term the interpret of which shall differ from person to person and is not determin by the age .
