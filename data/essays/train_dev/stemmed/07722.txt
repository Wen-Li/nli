i agre with thi opinion : most advertis make product seem much better thant they realli are . there are 3 reason whi i think so . the pictur of advertis are usual veri attract . for exampl , the pictur of the apart 's part of the room . it alway seem larger and brighter than they realli are . howev , the custom actual visit the apart , they say the room is not as good as they expect . also , sometim it is not as clean as the advertis pictur . the good which the compani sell are also more simpl than the compani say such as music player . the compani sing the producton of them can record and play more clear that what the product use to be . howev , sometim there is a no differ between the new one and the old one except the price . there is one more reason here . our imagin help to think better when we see the advertis . if we watch the commeci on tv , we get the good impress at first even thou we do n't know how the product realli are . then we think we want it , but when we see the product with our eye , we disappoint with it . it is becaus the product are not as attract as our imagin . becaus of these 3 reason , i think most advertis are not as good as than they realli are . they commerc just good point of the product , but we need to have critic think . t
