how to becam a success person ? i think that nobodi could have a right answer for thi question , but i 'm sure that it 's someth link with the caracterist of each differ personson . accord to me , in order to start the carrier through the success it 's importand to have a solid base , that mean knowledg and experi . so in the begin i think that everyon should exploit hi qualiti in the best way , buld up a solid structur that help him to grew up . when thi first step is done , you are abl to tri new thing , to go in field differ from the one of the basic knowledg : in other word , to risk ! for me , thi is the characterist that make you a real success person , becaus when someon act in thi way mean that hi realli proud and sure about hi own possibl . i 'll write an exampl , to better explain thi point . my father use to have a good job , not far away from home , that allow him to get enought money to live hi life without ani kind of problem . some year ago he 's got the opportun to go to work abroad , chanch compani work , far away from hi famili : he did n't even know much about the new job , but he decid to take thi chanc , and risk . i can not say that my father is the biggest success man that i 've ever known , but of cours he 's got much more success , than if he 'd chosen to continu hi previou job . so , i think that to risk is difficult , but if you want to do `` someth '' in your life , of cours you have to do it ! and thi is applic for everi kind of situat , that mean success for what concern your job , famili , friend .
