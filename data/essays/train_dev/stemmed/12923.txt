on the one hand , it 's of cours import to have a broad knowledg on mani subject becaus with a broad gener cultur it 's possibl to feel more concern about more subject , to exchang differ point of view with mani peopl becaus the morr the cultur is high , the more you can share convers with differ peopl . a high gener cultur allow popl to develop theirself , to feel more secur when they are talk about someth . .. but on the other hand , have a wide cultur about onli one subject ha the advantag that peopl know on what they are talk about . in some profess like archeologist , historian , physician . .. the peopl have a huge knowledg on their subject which can be veri impress . furthermor , in some profess like doctor , plane driver . .. it 's import that these peopl know what they are do and they know their job by heart . .. also , we can rememb famou peopl such as einstein , freud , mozart . .. becaus they almost special their life on someth , and they allow us to improv with their knowledg , teach us new thing that they could'nt have done if they did n't spend a lot of time on it . my opinion is that i prefer special on a specif subject becaus i think know a few thing on a lot of subject could be superfici knowledg . but of cours if i special on someth it doe n't mean that i 'll have no interest in other subject . for exampl for me it 's veri import to know what happen in the world , to have interest in histori but i special myslef sinc a long time on guitar . but i think it 's a pleasur to know a lot about someth , to be abl to argu on a subject becaus you know it well . but of cours , to special on a subject , it ha to be a passion .
