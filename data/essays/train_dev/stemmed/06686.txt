i prefer have a broad knowledg of differ academ subject that specil in one specif subject . special in an specif field is not a weird decit , we can see in our daili life that there is a lot of peopl that in the last year of degre decid to continu studi in an specif field of knowledg . howev , under my own point of view and experi i prefer have a larg knowleng in differ subjet , becaus thi is translat into a person who is abl to face with differ topic in a discuss or debat . first of all , i would like to explain my choic by argu that in the futur i will like to work in a bussi in which to do a dynam work . i mean , consult , for instanc , chang the project in which they are work everi week , so they have to deal with differ subject , such as telecommun , energi resourc , economi . .. that is what i like !!! howev , as i said befor , mani peopl decid to special in a field . thi is the case of proffessor at univers . for exampl , in the faculti of chemistri we can find differ depart : organ chemistri , inorgan chemistri , thermodinam . .. proffessor have to special in a subject becaus they are deal everi day with the same aspect , and they need to know as much as possibl about a certain field . the best of all would be to have a larg knowledg of lot of subject , but thi is not possibl today for human be , becaus our brain can not retain so much inform . even though , i have heard of peopl that have studi like 5 or 6 degre . i think thi is fantast !!! thi peopl are veri lucki of be so intellig . all in all , i think that in the world should be both kind of peopl : those who special and those who have a broad knowledg of differ subject , becaus both of them are neccessari in differ situact .
