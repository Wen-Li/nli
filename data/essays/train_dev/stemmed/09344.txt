univers as well as high school student are requir to have obtain certain skill by the time they graduat . thi is what make their degre valuabl . the skill can be devid into two main categori : learn fact and understand idea and concept . the chairman of columbia univers 's debat club ha recent provok great disput as he claim that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact . i do n't agre with him . in my opinion , on the one hand , understand idea and concept is essenti for succeed after colleg . onli if one is abl to rethink complic process and to find own conclus , one will be abl to improv one 's abil and will be capabl of manag task that requir improvis . on the other hand , thi is certainli not possibl if you lack the respect fact . fact are therefor even more import than understand idea and concept as they provid the basi for the second group of skill . if you do n't even know the fact about a certain topic , then how can you draw conclus ? for exampl , if a biologist doe not know how to defin and to describ a somat cell , can he investig them and use them for research ? probabl not . henc , it is a must for teacher and professor to provid their student with a broad knowledg of fact , no matter if it is in elementari school , in high school or in colleg . where els should peopl learn the essenti if not their educ career ? in conclus , understand idea and concept is of cours a requir skill for graduat . howev , they by far do not play such an import role as fact , or other skill not discuss in thi essay , for exampl the abil to speak coher and clearli , argu and solv social problem , or teamwork .
