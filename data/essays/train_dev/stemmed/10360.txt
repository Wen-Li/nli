i do agre with the fact that : in twenti year time , there is diffenitley go to be much fewer car in use than there are today . and the reason are multipl and veri logic , first of all and most importantli is fuel , obvious and up to now everi car as ani other machin need some sort of energi to function , in case of car thi main sourc of energi is oil , and as we all know the oil reserv in the plant is decreas everi day , and the support exampl in thi case is veri clear , and it ha been proven scintef that the oil reserv is dramat decreas . secondley is mainten of car , which is aslo proven to be veri costli process . anoth good reason is expans of peopl , build and other thing , which is make space less avail for car these day . anoth veri good reason is the avail of other way of transport , which is make it easi for us to commutt with less effort and lower cost , and at the same time give us other safer way of transport and the support exampl here is the veri bad safeti record of car as method of transport . i person think that the most import reason and support exampl for the abov mention fact , is the effect of car on our environmint , the amount of co2 emmiss car through into our environ everi day is unbeliev , and i think it is the main reason which is go to make the number of car is much fewer in the futur .
