in japan , it ha becam a big issu that young peopl do not participt in their commun . consid thi situat of japan , i agre with that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . the main reason is that young peopl have to studi instead of help their commun . in japan , mani parent expect their children to enter good high school , good univers and good compani . they believ that enter the good compani assur their children 's happi . in most case , these believ do not came true . howev parent forc thier children to studi at preparatri school in addit to their high school . for exampl , ten year ago , i work as a tuter . at that time , aya , who i taught math , wa veri busi girl . she studi five day a week at preparatori school , and she practic play a piano and swim . when i heard her schedul , i worri about her health . in thi case , her parent forc her to studi hard instead of have spare time to do anyth not to relat to enter a good school . as i explain abov , in japan , young peopl wa not expect to spend their time to help their commun . therefor , i strongli agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun .
