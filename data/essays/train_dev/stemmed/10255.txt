i disagre with the statement that a student should have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special on one . studi about sever subject at a time will not give the student a chanc to know complet about ani of the subject . if a student is not allow to learn about ani one subject in detail , he would end up have littl knowledg of everi subject . thi will not help him to be successful in ani of the field that he ha studi about . he ha to decid on one subject or a field and should get into maximum possibl detail of the subject . it is quit imposs for a student to get into detail of each and everi subject . one ha to be gift with superfici power to be abl to master about all subject . consid an expampl of a group of architectur student . learn simpl inform about everi aspect of build design will not help them do a good design individu . if the group is devid and each student is made to special on each aspect of bulid design in detail , the whole group would final be design a veri successful project togeth . thi is more like the idea of devid and rule . so , a student should be let to studi about a subject in detail . in the abov exampl one student could get into design , anoth student into structur aspect of a build , anoth into interior decor and mani more like thi . final thi group turn out to be a veri succesful architectur firm . henc it is clear that when ani student is made to studi about mani subject and none of them in detail would put him in troubl . a student ha to special on one subject . thi help him to gain hi interest and focu hi concentr toward one direct . he may also do good research on the particular subject and invent new thing . so , it is alway advantag to special on one specif subject than to have littl knowledg about mani thing at a time .
