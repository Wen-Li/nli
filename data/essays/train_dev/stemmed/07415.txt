i agre that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guid if the destin is one that 's new to you . if one is visit a countri for the first time , and especi if one doesnt know how to speak the nativ languag , and is complet unfamiliar with the visit locat , it is best to go with a tour guid . tour guid are veri qualifi and have a lot of knowledg about the countri 's histori , custom , food , tradit , cultur and must-se monument . they also provid use help regard hotel and good eat and entertain locat . thi is veri benefici becaus not onli one see and experi a new countri , but also one get to know about it , to grow as a person and as a citizen , expand one 's horizon get to see more than meet the eye , experienc the histori of the place , the way peopl behav and live in that specif place , one get to feel embrac by the countri and it cultur in a way that engag you to it , in a way you 'll never forget and hardli will experi again . the first time i visit itali and learn about it artist , it cultur , music and histori i fell in love with it , the first time i got to interact with it peopl i wa certain i would come back one day and live the rest of my life there , in itali , in rome . .. i learn that there 's more to itali than a colliseum , there 's more than the languag and there 's more than the famou ` gondola ' to it , it 's what 's behind all those creation , the thought , the magic , the inspir and the passion drive what make that countri so beauti , passion and perfect in my eye . that 's whi i beliv it is better to travel with a tour guid , it take you farther , you get to travel not onli with your bodi , but with your heart and mind . howev , if the destin is a place one 's alreadi familiar with , and special if one 's travel with a partner , or in a honeymoon , it would be much more comfort to go as a coupl , without ani tour guid , rediscov the countri by one 's own mean and visit the place one want to visit , not necessarili the most visit and popular place , but for instanc , one 's favorit restaur , one that probabl not much peopl know about , but that it 's excel and bring back beauti memori . also if one 's travel with the whole famili , especi with small kid , it would be veri difficult to pay attent to the tour guid without be interrupt by a tantrum and fight between brother and sister , so it would not be the best idea to go with a tour guid . for instanc , i am from venezuela even though i 'm live in the us , and i think i know pretti much everyth about my countri , so visit my countri with a tour guid wouldnt make much sens to me , sinc i alreadi know it and the place i like to visit and that are so special to me , and it would onli take time from me visit my best friend and my famili , all of whom live there , and sinc my point of visit would be to see my friend and famili again , have a tour guid would onli be an obstacl in the way of enyoy my trip , therefor it wouldnt be benefici for me in ani sens . to conclud , i think it a great idea to visit a countri with a tour guid if that place is new to you and you would like to know and learn about it , nurtur your mind . howev if it a place that 's alreadi familiar to you , it would be much more enyoy to go with a partner and enjoy the countri as you know it .
