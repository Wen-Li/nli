`the sound of a fat woman is much better when she is far away . ` i total agre that most of the advertis make product seem much better than what they realli are . it is like pandora 's box , it look wonder but you do n't know what you will be face with . howev there are some reason whi it work thi way . first of all , there are so mani competit in the advertis world . if i wa one of them i had to do someth which would get the visual attract initi . for instanc , most of us can rememb the quisno sandwich advertis . it is not onli exhibit the product but also compar it with the other item . it is full of collar so when ever i am do someth differ , it distract me and even though i have watch it almost hundr time i ca n't help myself to turn around and stare . it doe n't mean that they make the best sandwich but they do well in advertis . second , as we live in the chang world so rapidli , the advertis must be easi to recogn . not onli they have so mani other option to be displac but also they should be easi to be recogn . when i go to a supermarket i see a lot of product and most of them doe n't have ani match in my mind . what i realli do is , to go to the aisl and pick up the one that i can rememb . becaus they make it look better than the other . besid , if the advertis exactli say what it is , i am one hundr percent sure that they will becom less attract . think of a sandwich , it would be so bad if the person eat that sandwich in the advertis , had done someth as he actual had thought that it wa disgust . as a conclus , it may not be the ethic way to advertis the product but as long as it get the attent and easili recogniz , that is appropri in thi world we are live .
