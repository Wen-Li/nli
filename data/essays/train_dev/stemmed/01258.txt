i do not agre that a group tour with a guid can provid us with the best trip for sever reason . first , if we hire a tour guid , we can not travel by our desicion , which may limit our interst of the trip . second , concer cost effect , we should spend much more money on the tour which is follow by a tour guid . third , i would like to travel with my famili and my best friend . in group tour , we should spend a lot of time with strang peopl . when i travel , i usus plan my schedul and destin of trip by myself . i would like to travel freeli and comfort . i think that a tour guid tend to earn money from their tourist . for exampl , a tour guid may take tourist to a expens souvenior shop which pay money to the tourguid for their contract . in a econom point of view , tour trip with guid shoud be more expens than self arrang trip becus tour fee includ their salari . if we plan our trip by ourself , we can choic a hotel and restaur . howev , we take part in a group tour , our trip would be fix in the select of accomod and restaur . i think that a gouop tour led by a tour gide should be bore . i have never use a packag tour like group tour becaus i like to plan a trip . reserch about travel by use the internet and some timet allow me to be fun . i would like to give a best trip to my famili and my friend . in conclus , i prefer a self-organ tour rather than a group tour with a guid .
