i person do not agre with the follow statement . today , peopl are use to live use their car and i do not beliv that they can chang their habit in onli twenti year . for exampl , i live far from the place i studi and to reach the univers i drive my car for 30 minut everyday . expeci in itali , where i live , train and buss are not realli effic . peopl here need the car for live , differ way of move in itali are realli not popular . howev , i think that in countri like japan , where train and buss work well and are alway on time , thing might be realli differ in 20 year . the conciousn about the fact that pollut is destro natur and wild-lif is higher . anyway , i find that peopl are usual selfish and absolut not abl to chang the world . onli few peopl care about our world and think about the futur human and anim will live here . furthermor , i find that govern should be more responisbl when thi problem is tackl . car will not be fewer is the countri do not give a differ way to move to peopl . tomorrow i have to go to the univers and if even i love my countri and thi world , i will use my car becaus there are no other way for me to get to the univers . twenti year are not enough to chang peopl 's mind . i think that if peopl start now to use less their car mayb in a centuri someth might be seen , not earlier . anyway , the use of car is still attract becaus of the promot compani like bmw , toyota , audi do . car is still a busi , it is still one of the most import busi of a countri and it is absolut not easi to chang someth in peopl 's mind when there is no interest in the societi .
