sinc most of our neighbour are pretti old peopl and sinc i did one year of social servic in a home for the elderli , i think that i have work with enough old peopl in my life to state that i total disagre with the statement that say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i think older peopl enjoy life in a differ way than young peopl do . so if one compar activ young peopl prefer to do in their free time to activ that older peopl like to do dure their spare time , one can easili see that old peopl most probabl enjoy life just as much as young peopl . young peopl tend to go to bar or disco with their friend , for exampl . older peopl enjoy go to a restaur with good friend or like to see an opera or a thatr play . i think that thi is not that much of a differ in joy . it is onli the type of activ they prefer that mark a differ . i would even dare to say that i think that older peopl have better chanc and possibl of enjoy life . sinc older peopl tend to be more experienc and therefor time-effect than younger peopl in mani differ area such as cook , housework , or even task at work , for exampl , they have more time to spare and for thi reason more time to enjoy life ( if one suspect that work can not be ani kind of joy ) . after retir they also have a lot of time to do what they like or mayb even make dream come true . take some of my neighbour , for exampl . after retir they went on a trip around the world to see a lot of famou place and to experi differ cultur for about eight month . younger peopl could not afford such an activ . they usual have n't save enogh money and they usual have a job that wo n't allow an absenc of eight month . to sum up , one can see that even when onli have a rather `` time-bas '' look at the statement that wa made , there is no chanc of agre with it at all . it would even be unfair to say someth like that becaus it impli that activ younger peopl do are more enjoy than the one of older peopl . but thi is and alway will be subject to person bia and opinion .
