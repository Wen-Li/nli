understand idea and concept and leran fact are import for student . howev , in my opinion , i disgre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . to begin with , we can learn idea and concpet in class and our teacher , but sometim they do n't work in the real societi . for exampl , i work in one restaur befor . when i cook the fish by follow the recip which our teacher taugh me , the chef blame me . he said , `` custom wo n't like what you cook by thi way . '' the fact improv what he said is right becaus the peopl who ate the dish i cook went to complain to my boss . i wa upset and depress . from that day , i do n't believ the recipet i took in my class . in addit , sometim fact is veri cruel , but we need to accept them . that 's the reason whi i regard fact are more import . for instanc , i almost lost my job when i cook the aw dish by follow the recipet . my boss told me that the fact wa whatev you cook , the most import thing wa the custom like it , especailli about work . what he said made me trust fact is the most signific factor again . in short , i learn the preciou lesson by realist and pain experi . i would n't say that understand idea and concept are useless or not import ; howev , i realli believ that it is more importnat for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept .
