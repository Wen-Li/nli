young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . thi can be becaus of their selfish behavior or not have enough time to help but it is obviou that thi is not a posit signal for the furutr of a commun . when i wa a student in a colleg , there were some student come from villag . they were go back to their famili as soon as the holday begin , to help their work on farm or etc . even thi situat sometim had bad effect on their lesson , they had never thought not to help . now , when i compar with the new gener , unfortun the scene is not seem to me so help and will . they all say that , they do n't have enough time to help their parent even just for a few week dure their summer holiday . the situat is similar for the public buse also . when i wa a child , it wa a pitti to sit down when a pregnant ladi or and old men is stand . but today , young peopl are rare give their seat to the other . i think one of the reason of thi situat is depend on the chang of the game of children . it wa more train have team game than today 's person comput game . team game are joy as much as the person game and also teach children solv problem and live togeth . today 's old peopl are the children of past 's , and that 's whi , we know help and share more than the new gener . whatev the reason is , none of the excus are accept for me . becasu i believ that as the time chang , peopl are becom to have more theirself-cent life style .
