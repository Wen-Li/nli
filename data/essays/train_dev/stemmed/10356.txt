i do not believ that younger peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . howev , i do believ that at each stage of our life we experi a differ tast of fun and appreci life in a differ manner . when we are children under the age of ten , we have fun play hide and seek , catch , and other similar game . as teenag we go out with our friend and enjoy our time at the mall . when we becom adult we spend our fun time go club or to restuar , and as we grow older we have fun cuddl witth famili member at home . at each stage we feel that we are enjoy our time and we do not realli consid other option . have you ever seen a child prefer to sit with hi parent rather than play in the mudd ? someon might argu that ye younger peopl do enjoy life more becaus they are more activ and more energet and that older peopl most often suffer from one diseas or anoth . then i would have to point out that mani teenag and children suffer from disabl or ill . therefor , if somon is determin to have fun and enjoy hi life , then what 's insid of him is what mattter andwhat allow him to enjoy hi time or not .
