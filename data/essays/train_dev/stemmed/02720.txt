i agre with that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , student must learn what it is mean . they total understand the definit , concept and the idea . for exampl , if a student doe not know the definit , he or she could not prove the theorem . he or she could not combin the two differ problem to solv . if it is not known what the plu mean , it can not be said one plu one equal two . second , know the reason or reason , show the path that goe the fact . student alway seek the reason beyond what they see . onli the learn the result doe n't enough . they have to ask where is thi come from ? i think , to do someth import we expand our vision and dig deeper than ever . we would expos undiscov thing onli when we do n't limit ourselv with the given fact .
