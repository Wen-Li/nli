befor present my point of view , i think it is necessari for me to examin the question care . which one is more import , learn the particular fact or acquir the concept and gener principl . it is a matter of balanc the pro and con of these metho , the decis , therefor , is not easi to make . in my opinion , idea and principl concept are more import . the first and foremost reason in support of my positon is that it is imposs for us to learn everi fact dure our limit lifetim . take mathemat as an exampl , we could not do all the measu the three lenth of everi triangl and it is easi to make some mistak . howev , we could just calcul the length precis and quickli by use the principl . anoth compel fact in favor of my posit is that fact are often to specif and not convienc and we learn littl from particular fact . a strike exampl is that mani fever could be heal by keli . although in some clinic case it would result in some side effect , we could not deni that it is not a good medicin just by observ such a specif `` fact '' . i cite thi extrem exampl mere in an attempt to demonstr that we would make fals decis by observ some specif fact . i can not deni that fact is import some time , for instanc , in studi histori . historist must use numer fact and evid to prove their theori . thi alon lend no strong support to undermin what i have substanti . from the discuss mention abov , i can final draw a conclusit that it is more import for student to understand idea . it make us solv problem more effect and make right decis . i just could not imagin how could we do our work if the know no fundament concept .
