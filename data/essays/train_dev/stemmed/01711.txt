nowaday mani advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i agre with thi statement for mani reason . i could say that in the world of busi the most import characterist is the honesti , so if a compani make an advertis that make a product seem much better than they realli is thi compani will probabl loos a lot of custom . i think that thi consequ that i 've explain is a risck for everi compani . after state that loos a lot of client are a risck for a compani , in other word i can say that if thi compani doe n't chang the advertis it will sure loos all tha custom and fail in the end . i think that nowaday a compani must make larg effort to surviv and the most import effort is to improv the honesti of the advertis to make the product seem like they realli are . for exampl , i recent take a new car that seem a wonder car in the advertis . initi thi car doe n't make nois and doe n't make problem to me but after a mounth it begin to stop more often and it begin to have a lot of problem . furthermor i have to spend more money to adjust thi car than the money that i spend to buy it . the compani that give me the car ha lose a custom and also custom 's friend . in ani experi of mine i would wish that first of all the compani or the person are honest . conclud among all the possibl fact the most import aspect in everi busi is the honesti . as a matter of fact all the compani shold make an effort to improv the advertis of their product .
