in my view , it is better to have a knowledg on a special subject rather than have broader knowledg of mani academ subject becaus if the person is carrer orient then he ha to special in that particular field instead learn all the subject which is a wast of time and money . thi not onli save one time but also give the thorough and coher knowledg and skill about that subject . the reason that i agre with thi point is that i have observ one of my classmat who wa veri much interest in all the subject and plu he wa career oreint too . he spend time gain knowledg of the subject . at last , when the real time came , he wa helpless and final didnt succeed in hi career . by see hi expereinc i have learnt that `` the more you learn , the more you forget '' and final you will be remaun with a singl pie in your hand . so knowledg in term of academ aspect depend on your interest and career . so if you want acquir more knowledg , you have to sacrific the other part of life . by thi a nice proverb can be evolv `` a bird in hand is worth than two ina bush '' . thi impli if you are interest in one particular field then stay tune to that paricular field rather than show interest in variou activ . but some part of the statement sound sometim true becaus through hi knowledg onli we acquir wisdom . if the person have the knowledg with wisdom he can stand tall in life . for ex : - john abraham . through hi wisdom onli america is success today . come back to the point , if one doe hi work in a specif and signific way , he can achiev success , so i total disagre with the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one subject '' .
