in daili life there are a lot of product and some of thi are not so good , but most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are ! ye , i am agre with thi statement becaus i think that a person have to touch with hi hand the product he need becas if we follow onli the advertis he can fall in a not good product . for exampl , if i have to buy someth product the first thing is watch thi prodict and analyz it becaus i want to know it is good or not . is like buy a t-shirt of a famous stilist or a not famous stilist , all the peopl prefer the first one becaus have the name but when they buy it , they do not look the materi ( for exampl ) , they buy it becaus is made from a famou stilist . but if we research more and more in anoth store i think that we can find a better t-shirt with a low cost . anoth exampl is a dish soap that i call with the name ` a ' , the advertis say that a can clean everith and your dish will be white like the best white thing . than a person go to buy it becaus the advertis say that a do miracl , and when he wash hi dish , he observ that what the advertis say is not true ! than , in summari i want to say that is import to think befor to do everyth especi when we have to choos some product to buy , becaus sometim we can take a product that most advertis make much better than thi realli are and everytim thi is a tipic thing for to spend a lot of money for a product that is not good . the first thing to do is think and the second is choos the best product for it qualiti and for it cost .
