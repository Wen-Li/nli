in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than special in one specif subject . my reason are as follaw : first , as a student , a young person just special in one specfic major is not enough for she or he to face the competit world . nowaday the glloballizit is come ture the differ about work abal between employe from differ countri are less and less but the devolop counti worker ask for less paiment . so when we want to get a good job we ought to manag variti knowledg of mani field to improv our interrior valu . second , knowledg from all kind of sudject may give you new view piont when you look at someth , especiali someth you are fammilli with . for exampl histori can tell you how thing happend mani year ago and even can give you some useful advis when you arego to make a import chios , while math will tell you someon is just a formular person are hardli abl to chang it we just use it . that make you clever so i think broad knowledg are better .
