in our modern societi with globl economi improv rapidli , it is veri import to educ high qualiti student cater to the desir of the societi . from my point of view , i total disagre with the idea that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact which will be discuss in the follow paragraph . to begin with , pure learn idea and concept make student confus about the subject . for instanc , if a student just know the definit of someth , he would think it is unchang . but when he meet the chang of thi concept , he will be confus about thi . it is beacas he doe not know about the realiti . if he alreadi ha learn fact about thi , he would face thi in a proper way and not get into puzzl . in addit , student alway get more interest in learn fact than just know the definit . in contrast with just know about the idea and concept , learn fact is more use and attract for student than learn some idea and concept just for understand . that is to say , learn fact about the definit is more interest than know the concept . final , learn fact could make student think in a realist way and it is good for their futur . it is absolut much more use for student to adapt the societi and live in the world directli and more success . becaus they alreadi known the fact . besid , student also can use the idea properli or invent their own new idea . in summari , it is obviou that idea and concept are much more import for student to learn than just understand for the reason of the cleariti of the realiti , student 's interest on the subject and the benefit for their futur . therefor , it is strongli recommand that student should learn fact from the idea and concept . it is veri good for their mental healthi .
