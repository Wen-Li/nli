idea and fact i desagre with the statement , becaus the fact are import as the idea and concept , the are connect becaus the idea and concept give the student the fact , they are alway behind , in ani explic and understand of idea and concept , we have to consid the fact , to have a deeper reason about what we want to learn , but whi some peopl not consid fact as import ? mani peopl think that the concept or mean is the onli thing that matter , becaus they are superfici and do n't look behind to see the fact . for exampl , in a high school , the student are onli interest in learn the concept as it is , not to know what caus it , or whi it is there , thi lack of interest on go deeper on the inform they have , led them to not be well prepar to present some knowleg test , but also the teacher do n't pay attent to thi lack in their student , so the student onli underst the idea but not learn the fact that remark that idea . it is import to alway have some fact , so that we can make a better analizi to the theori , that involv the idea and the concept , analyz all the thing we have in our head , to make a better job . thi doesnt mean that the idea and the concept are not import , thay are veri import becaus with them is that we can take in account the fact , so undestand idea and concept are veri , veri import , to have a clear thought of what we have . thi is like when a bird born , at the begin it is onli interest or focu on the food the mother give him , but later need to know the fact that involv how the mother obtain the food , how she procces it , and how he can do that . are thing that mayb at the beginig it doesnt put attent but at the end would be veri an import thing to him . can be conclud , that the fact , and the idea and concept , are both veri import to have a better knowleg about someth , that when we see the concept , we also have to consid the fact that are behind .
