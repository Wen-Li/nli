ye i undoubtedli agre with the statement that it is more import and recomend for a student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i support the statement becaus through real time experi i infer that most of the peopl who learn fact as they are instead of take the real mean behind it are mostli vulner to take it for a wrong purpos . the fact we learn in our earli stage of life help us throughout our life . we build ourselv and our charact upon the concret pillar of what we infer . so , it is essenti for us to understand the fact instead of learn them . as the later may lead to seriou consequ and wrong charact build . for exampl , let get into the daili life . we learn in physic that accord to newton third law of motion everi action ha an equal and opposit reaction . thi is a broad concept that could be appli in mani case of our real life . let consid the rocket on which we appli it to reach limit of our atmospher and also further . but , when you consid it in case of a simpl daili case of a pressur coocker . the steam build up when it is heat insid it and if you happen to open the lid without allow the inner pressur to escap my remov the counter weight there is a high danger that the high pressuris steam may come burst on to the one who open it caus seroiu burn . thi wa a case i say , that shock me and after consult my physic lectur i came to know the reason behind it . had the person known the concept of the law of pressur and the newton third law of motion he would n't have done the mistak which sent him to hospit for more than a month . thi sever could be the consequ of not know thing for what they are meant .
