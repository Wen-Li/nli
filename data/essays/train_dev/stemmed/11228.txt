in my opinion thi kind of approach to the subject is not elig . becaus if you just consid the fact of their do enough or not enough for the commun you could alway get the conclus that they are n't do enough . i am quit sure that there steadili is a great amount of work to do in the commun . i think if one is think about thi problem you have to gener think about what young peopl are do in their free time . there are a lot of activ which could be done by adolesc like sport or activ in theater group ect . but they do still too much time wast for video game , tv and stuff like that . therefor , i think young peopl should gener rethink their activ in their free time . besid , there is still the great problem that a great amount of pupil nowaday have great difficulti in school . they are not motiv to achiev good grade and tend to forget how import their educ is for their futur . thu i think it is much more import to get teenag to do someth at all befor we argu about the sens of commun work . nevertheless , do commun work could be a way to accomplish thi goal . do some project in their communit could be a great opportun for them to find someth they are realli interest like read fari tale to smaller children for instanc . i did thi as well when i wa younger and discov my great interest in tell peopl stori and join a theater group afterward . the acknowledg they would sure get could be a great experi in order to get an idea of what it 's like when you merit someth you work veri hard for . take care of a small group of younger adolesc could help in improv ther leadership abil which is a quit necessari soft skill nowaday . by keep into contact with younger peopl they could as well help them solv their problem becaus sometim parent are not abl to do so becaus of the fact that they are much older and not familiar with these kind of troubl anymor . final . i like to finish thi essay with the conclus that young peopl should gener do more activ in their free time .
