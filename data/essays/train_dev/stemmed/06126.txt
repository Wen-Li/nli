today , the new gener is not as sensit as their parent . they hid after their childhood and escap from the respons . i agre for the statement . young peopl do not give time to help to other peopl . i guess thi situat come becaus of onli one thing . `` technolog improv '' . technolog refer so mani area . televis , advertis , music , i-pod , game and of cours comput and chat . young peopl prefer watch tv or play a comput game to give time to help their commun . they all friend do thi as well . they spend so much time at their room and do not talk to thei parent as well . in school thei convers with their friend are not about the commun . in spite of the problem they share onli the game and their onlin commun skill . internet is now widespread . it make the distanc closer . the young peopl find friend from other countri . they improv their foreign languag and they learnt the cultur of the countri . they like chat to unknown friend . on my opinion , the young peopl are not guilti but their parent . parent should be a leader for their children . they can coordin and organ the time to play , to studi or to meet the helpless peopl . sensit begin in childhood . sensit is teach onli by parent ; not by teacher or friend . they can learn their children that the life consist of not onli the music , friend , tv or chat but also peopl , tree , ecolog , and the world they ca n't imagin . technolog is a great strength and opportin but it necessari to learn how to use it . be sensit and be awer of the commun . spend time for them .
