young peopl might someti be more abl to enjoy life than older peopl becaus young peopl have a veri import thing in life that unfortunatli elder peopl do not have ; health . young peopl are normal more capabl of do activ or thing to enjoy themselv more becaus they do not have to deal with as mani problem as older peopl have to deal with . the stress that older peopl have to deal with in their life might lead them not to enjoy life as much they want to . my father onc told me someth i am never go to forget . he said that when you are young you have the health and the time to enjoy life but you did not have the money to do so . and that one had to work hard to earn money , which might caus us not to enjoy life as much . then when you are older , between forti and fifti , you had normal made more money , you were still healthi but you no longer had time to do anyth to enjoy life as we are suppos to . later , when you are old , you had all the money you are go to have and you had all the time in the world , but you no longer had health to enjoy life and have fun . to my opinion , one ha to be abl to find the perfect balanc between when you are young , older and old . one ha to be abl to achiev happi when you are young by do thing that do not involv to much money . later , you have to make sure you are leav enought time for thing such as travel and famili to be abl to appreci life . and when you are final old and are normal no longer healthi , you have to be abl to enjoy life with what you have left , such as famili and friend .
