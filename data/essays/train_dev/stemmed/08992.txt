we are live in crowd citi and there are lot of car . transport veri import part of the citi life becaus we chanc place so mani time dure the day . for my self i am almost get crazi with that crowd . we have to solv thi problem , we are get awar to emerg of thi situat . i agre with thi statment . there will be fewer car in use than there are today . becaus thi traffic proplem can be remain like that and also petrol sourc reduc day by day , we have to find anoth sourc for transport and everi thing . most of the govern tri to attact peopl attant to the import of public transport . i think it is easi way to solv thi problem , if they use the public transport there wont be ani traffic jam and peopl can go to job an time besid there will not be air pollit at all . in the traffic jam peopl 's car becam uns thing . becaus there is no point to buy a car . if you ca n't go to anywher whi you have a car . in thi point i think peopl will chang to their mind about car and start to use more public transport . i have anoth reason to sopport thi statment that is limit of petrol sourc . none of the sourc we can use for ever that is whi we have to find other sourg , new sourc will chang the way of transport and mayb in twenti yeari we wo n't use car . instead of car we can use electr machin , i think these day we use one of them , that is underground . it is a first pattern of the altern transport . consequ , i beliv that there will be fewer car than there are today . actual thi is some kind of oblig becaus limit of the sourc and car not veri use at all . i hope we can find new way that is less caus to air pollit .
