have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is so import to me . we live in a global era that meen that mani thing are happen at the same time : war in differ countri , econom impact , environment disast , medic advanc . to understand those thing and to be actual of those challeng the peopl have to focu their knowledg not just in one topic and open their mind to new topic . if that dont happend they wouldnt be abl to follow all the world news that the media is offer in these day . i think that thischang must happend sinc the elementari educ : the school program speacilli in social studi and histori have to be more open to the world realiti . i consid import to have a background of our countri histori but dont forget about the world histori also . when i had to decid what profession carreer i would i like to studi i chose law . i consid that legal studi give the student not just a legal framework but also a knowledg of other scienc like economi , philosophi , logic , sociolog . consid that i have been work in invironment law issu i have also need to open my knowledg and work in differ area like agronomi , forestri , economi and sociolog . after finish my law degre i had decid to do a master not focu just in environment issu but also in the whole sustain develop that our world need . that meen that onc again i will convin mi studi with other subject . that is a good exampl whi i rather choos to to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . in addit of that i think that peopl who ha the posibl to travel around the world may invest their money and time in thi adventur : thi experi abl one to improv the knowledg about other cultur .
