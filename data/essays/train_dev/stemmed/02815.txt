i do agre with thi statement , becaus i think it is easier to use someth you learn in your everyday life if you did understand the idea or the concepept of what you learnd . for exampl if you learn someth in physic , like electr , you learn these formula and you can for exampl say , how high the voltag is or someth like that but if you are not understand what you are do you ca n't keep that in mind . that 's the way it is with me , i just can rememb stuff i realli understood . i am a train vet nurs and i learn a lot about so mani differ type of anim but you never can help them fight their deseas if you are not understand the whole system of a bodi . and it doe n't help you just to learn it you have to understand it . the understand of a concept give you also the possibl to transfer thing you learnd for someth special to other thing happen in your life . like in math if you are not just learn that fact to use it in school you can use it in your home for exampl to reorgan your room in a better way by use formula you learnd . i think the best exampl to see how thi work are kid . you tell them that the fire is hot , so that is a fact . and they know the fact that the fire is hot but they ca n't understand what hot mean . so in most case the kid touch the fire and then they know what is meant when there parent say `` it is hot '' . and they can transfer it to everi other thing in there everyday life like the oven . if their mother say it is hot , they do n't dare to touch it becaus they understood what is the mean of hot . so in the end i think it is alway better to understand the idea of what you are learn , becaus just in that case it is easier for you to use it in your life and it is so much easier to keep it in mind .
