i realli enjoy to plan my trip by myself or with my girlfriend , it 's a sort of pleasur for me to make research on the web about all the detail such as travel , hous and main destin , so most like i disagre with the given stimulu . when you experi a tour organ by somebodyels there are mani thing which are not under your person control . mani import decis are often taken by the group and i do n't realli like to vote on thing when i travel , by contrari i like to spend time where it 's more valuabl accordingli to my tast and person interest . in addit i think that a guid tour usual present event which are design for tourist . i still rememb when i went to thailand with my famili in 1991 and the tour guid basic wa alway show us cultur event and show which were veri far to be authent express of the local habit . i prefer to manag my own time dure the trip and do n't be bother by ani time constraint or schedul appoint as usual happen with guid tour . thu i realli like the intimaci of a romant trip with my girlfriend , so i will eventu consid other option when i 'll be older .
