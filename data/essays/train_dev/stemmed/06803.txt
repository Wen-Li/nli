although some peopl think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , i do not agre with that . there are three reason for me to get thi opinion . first , older peopl have much more experi than younger peopl becaus they are simpli older . for exampl , when younger peopl make holiday in citi they are often more interest in make parti than to get to know more about the citi and it cultur life . old peopl spend more of their time by learn someth about the place where they make holiday . i think that older peopl see much more of a citi when visit it than younger peopl do becaus for me it is import to learn about the cultur life of the place where you in . furthermor , old peopl have much more time than younger peopl becaus they have seen much more in their life . in contrast , younger peopl are often interest in see much in a short period of time becaus in their view they have not seen enough yet . for instanc , in most case older peopl take much more time when they visit a museum than younger peopl do . last , often old peopl have save a lot of money while their time as employe . they have much more money to spend and they have not to attach import on how to spend their money . in contrast , the younger peopl are at the begin of their time as employe and so they have not earn much money that they could save yet . so they are not abl to wast their money as old peopl can . in conclus , thi are the three reason whi i disagre with the statement .
