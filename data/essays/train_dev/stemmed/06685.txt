compar young peopl to older one , peopl tend to think that the youth enjoy life more than it elder counterpart . inde , it is easi to realiz that in most of the case , old peopl are less able-bodi than the young one . thi physic aspect may interfer with one 's abil to enjoy life becaus it prevent peopl from do a certain number of activ such as sport or even the basic everyday act of go outsid to do shop for exampl . moreov , most of the activ in citi are creat for the young peopl , to avoid them get bore and stay in the street . these activ can be as well night club than sport center . .. nevertheless it would not be fair to attribut an enjoy life to the young peopl onli . inde , i realli think that enjoy life simpli depend on one 's state of mind . for instanc , if we are use to get bore of everyth and to critic more than to admir then we will scarc enjoy life . on the other hand if we are use to be posit on the event happen then we have less reason to dislik life and not to enjoy it . thu in my opinion enjoy life is more relat to a psycholog aspect than a physic one and in that way it is possibl for the old peopl to enjoy life as much , inde more , than the youth . the fact of enjoy life can also be influenc by the event happen or that alreadi happen in one 's life . in that way , as i said befor , the eldest person may enjoy life more than the youngest one becaus if for instanc a young ha health problem or famili one while the old no , then the latter will be more like to enjoy life than the former one . as a conclus i would say that enjoy life is not a matter of age but a matter of state of mind and way of think .
