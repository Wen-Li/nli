studi of mani academ subject is good ? we usual studi mani differ class when we in the high school , is it realli good for us ? studi broard knowleg of mani academ subject is realli good ? i can n't agre with it . in my opinion , studi a special in one specif subject is more use . when i wa a child , my teacher away hold the point that all the children should studi all kind of knowledg . but i never think so . in my viewpoint , studi too much differ knowledg in the same time , i will not concentrat on . i believ that studi one thong deepli is suitabl for me . and peopl in the sociati , theri will find the jib which they studi in the univers . but if you studay too much academ subject mayb you will hard to find job , the reason is the boss in the compani will think that you studi too mani differ academ , you should not studi them deepli , so they will not consid to use you at first . and studi too much academ subject will also ue too much money , not everyon can do it . i still rememb one of my friend she studi a lot of subject , but she did not have the good graduat point at last , becaus she did not have enough time to rewview them . so studi mani of academ subject may be is not for all of us , and that is also not have such advantag for us , so i decidecid to sudi one subject deepli , mayb is easili for me , and easil for most of us , we also canhav much time to enjoy ourself , spend more time wih our famili , commuinc with each other , so i prefer the second one , studi one pecif subject is more use .
