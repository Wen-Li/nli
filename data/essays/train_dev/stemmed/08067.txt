as a journal student , i think that it 's more import learn the fact than anyth els , so i 'm total disagre with the statement . i ca n't understand how can be possibl that you can learn and appreci more the idea or the concept than the fact itself . you do n't think is better evalu and re-evalu the fact and then establish your own idea ? in my opinion , learn concept and idea , is learn what other peopl learn about the fact . use other as a referenci group is n't bad or wrong . but the point is that learn fact make you respons for whatev you learn . in other word you just did n't follow anoth opinion , anoth concept or idea . you creat your own , and if they 're wrong , then you evalu your own concept or idea . precis , is more object the fact itself . think of thi : if you learn first the idea or concept , in some way you alreadi know someth and just stay in that line , but if you go directli to the fact you can have your own knowledg . .. creat by you .
