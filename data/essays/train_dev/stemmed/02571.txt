ford , the geniu who creat the assembl line , in order to manufactur more car in a smaller amount of time . sinc then , the product of car have increas rapidli . the cheaper and faster manufactur of car increas the product . suppli the comfort of car to most of the the world 's popul . in my opinion , i think that there will be more car than there are today . today 's scientist are test to creat a new model of car in order the decreas the greenhous effect . there ha been the invent of oil with the use of corn , howev it ha not been put ot effect yet due to the cost of car which can function with that specif type of oil . howev , as the suppli of oil will run low throughout the year , the demand for corn oil would rice guarante the hygien and the cleaness of the air in the environ . therefor , the peopl will not have to stress out about pollut the environ like today 's car . the popul over the year ha risen rapidli . over the next 20 year it is guarante that the popul statist chart will keep soar higher and higher . the increas of popul indic that more car will be need for transport . as i have state in the previou paragraph of the hygien of the corn oil , peopl would not have to worri about the greenhous effect ture the earth into a giant fire ball , or the glacier melt and rise 100 meter abov sea level . due to the increas of popul the product of car will keep increas as well . the increas in popul soon will not be abl to fit all the popul in one metropoli . as the citi becom crowd the peopl will move out of the citi into suburbian area . therefor , travel will be necessari on a dailiy basi for most peopl who work in the center of the citi , or have school in the citi . due to the transport need everyday , mani peopl will consid to buy a car . therefor , the amount of car in the street will increas , along with the area of the citi and the popul in the world . car will soon be a necessari object , which the popul of the world will reli heavili on . therefor , the fluctuat of the amount of car will not happen . as long as ford remain in our histori book as the father of car , the decreas of ford 's invent will not happen .
