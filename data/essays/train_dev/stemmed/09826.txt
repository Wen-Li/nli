in the last twenti year we are complit driven by the power of the economi . it is for thi reason that it is not realli import the qualiti of a product but it is import the messag that that product give . it often appen that we becom complit blind when we are buyng someth . infact we buy some product onli becaus we have seen it on televis even if we realli do not need it . i can say that becaus it also appen to me . two day ago watch the televis i decid to buy a porticular product useful for make sport becaus it help you to get back your energi after the phisic effort . i play basket with my friend dure the weekend , fir of all dure the saturday afternoon and we play for four or five hour long . that is way i need that product but i bought it even if i did not know what it wa compos of . i thing that thi sistm is veri danger becaus the product control are not accur ant the final consum is alway the one who risk . today it is not imprtant what do we buy but it is onli import the economi develop . i think that in order to elimin thi problem we should pay more attent on the control that the govern shold do when allow anvertis to do damn . now i also rememb that last year , dure the winter holiday , i went with to the market of my town whit my mother and there wa a lot of peopl in front of a shop becaus they all want to buy a particoular cristma food . we also bought it just becaus we watchd an advertisemet , think that it wa good . howev when we came home we took it for dinner but it wa disgust . the problem wa that we should have test it befor .
