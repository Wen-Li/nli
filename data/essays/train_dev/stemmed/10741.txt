thi statement is someth that ha alway been said . in the past , for exampl my grandfath ha told me , that they tought that in the year 2000 everyth wa go to chang , machin were go to be abl to control everyth , even us , car were go to be abl to fli . .. but more or less everi thing continu be the same , someth have chang but some other have not . in my point of view thi statement is not true . everybodi now want to have a car and investig are look for some new idea to build the car of the futur , a car which probabl consum less petrol than one normal car doe nowaday . everybodi will tri to have the best car and the one with the most sofist dessign , as now have the best one and the most power one and if it is possibl not onli to have one car even tri to have two or three car , is the same to be an import person everi bodi will tri to be the most import person with the most impress car or car . it is possibl that pollut might be reduc as car have to pass more control each day and that pollut is becom a more import problem everi day , so that engin are search new way to not pollut as much as car do now . in addit , as citi are becom bigger and bigger everi day peopl will need their own car to go for exampl in a big citi from the north part to the south part , a distanc that in the past could be cover by some minut walk . in conclus , all these reason state whi my opinion is that in twenti year there will not be fewer car in use than there are now .
