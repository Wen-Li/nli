everi coin ha two side . although some peopl may think that success peopl do what they alreadi know how to do well , i believ that success peopl tri new thing and take risk , as i will explain below . the first reason whi i agre with thi statement is becaus brave is the characterist of success peopl . there is littl room to debat . peopl who can take new challeng in stride is a success person . for exampl , some inventor success sinc they tri to creat a new invent . they need brave to experi the failur , and then research how to make a use thing for peopl . therefor , success peopl need brave to tri new thing and take risk . the second reason whi i agre with thi statement is becaus the peopl onli do what they alreadi know how to do well may be limit to develop . with the rapid develop of societi , new thing appear quickli . peopl contribut their knowledg ; howev , some peopl just do the same thing . they just want to do the thing they alreadi know . in my opinion , it 's selfish . for instanc , when a group discuss how to make the report look impress , some will put their best foot forward to think about that and tri to make a special way , but other do n't particip the discuss . if that , how can we make the thing be better ? final , base on the abov discuss and analysi , i strongli believ the idea that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onlt do what they alreadi know how to do well .
