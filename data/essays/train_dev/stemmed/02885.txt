i agre with the statement . peopl who succeed tri new thing rather than do what they have alreadi know how to do well . we will learn new thing and gain some experi by tri new thing . these experi are preciou . we can onli gain them when we tri ! and if it dose n't work or we are not satisfi with the result , we can keep on tri and tri until we are satisfi . i have heard of a phrase `` peopl who are success find solut to solv their problem and peopl who are in failur tri to find reason for their problem '' and i think thi phrase realli make sens . we should alway find the solut to solv our problem rather than find reason for the problem . for exampl , a man name toni . he open a bakeri sell onli toast and water . plain toast and water . no one want to come to hi shop becaus there are onli toast and water . suddenli he decid to tri new thing . he decid to learn how to make begel , milkshak and a varieti of cake such as tiramisu and chocol cake . he start to sell them after he have learn how to make them . after a month he earn lot of money after sell all these snack . he becam a success businessman . the reason whi the man had becam a success businessman is that he tri new thing . and while he wa tri , he also learn . i do n't think the man will becom a success businessman if he did not tri and do thing that he have alreadi know how to do such as buy jam to put onto the toast or fri egg . these are just a piec of cake even a children from kindergarden can do all these thing ! there is also anoth exampl . if we lose a job , whi do n't we tri anoth or open a busi ? we can alway tri and there will be a day we succeed . in conclus , agre with the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' .
