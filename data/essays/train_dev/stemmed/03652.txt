in my opinion , i would agre with the fact that young peopl enjoy life more than other peopl do becaus they do n't have to do anyth but diostract themselv , i assum veri young peopl around four or five year old when school is still a pleasur and a kind of distract . while grow up their life will becom more and more complic . homework go along with school will take most of their time until they 'll be graduat of an univers . at thi point most of ani human as achiev twenty-f percent of hi live and it ha been pain . then they 'll start to work . for some of them it will be fine and other will consid work as the worst experi they ever live . dure that time they will be abl to do everyth they want whenev they want onli if is not dure the time they are suppos to work . they will enjoy life but they will alway rememb their childhood as the good old time . then they 'll have children and they 'll have to work to provid them everyth they need or want until they 'll leav the famili hous around eighteen year later . some year after the child will be gone , it will be time for them to get retir . and at thi point they will enjoy life again even more than when they were young becaus they will be total free . itm is the time when peopl learn to take their time and enjoy life . most of them will use the money they save to travel around the world and see all they ever dreamt about . and then after they had had all the fun they want . it will be time for them to accept the fact that they can not fight against get older and they 'll die sooner or later . i will finish with the point that on a nineti year long life , an human would have realli enjoy life around 25 year . ye i agre with the point made in the statement , young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do .
