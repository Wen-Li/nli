it is true that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . if we look at the youth around us , we find them to be self occupi . they are busi with their own life . the youngster are live a life that is all about their own dream , their own happi and their own whim . gadget , friend , movi , discothequ , pub and other such thing are take them away from their famili and the commun . if they are not have fun , then , it is the increas pressur of studi that keep them insid their home after the school hour . their studi and the stlye of the present school curriculum make sure the the student are studi continu . the curriculum of most of the educ institut is design to give theoret knowledg to the student . lack of practic take away the chanc of ani extern exposur from the student . apart from studi , the lack of interest in extend a help hand for the matter relat to the commun can also be observ amongst the youngster . they are becom a bit self-centr . for them it - me first . everyth els becom secondari for them . anoth reason for their non particip can be trace to the fact that they do not understand the import of joint famil and thu the concept of love and share is a littl alien to them . earlier , the joint famil kept the peopl togeth . they were more toler , more care and had better understand of the import of commun . but , the concept of nuclear famili ha taken away the element of ` togeth we stand ' away from the youth . last month , the mumbai blast rock the whole nation and question our uniti and secur both . the terrorirst involv were young boy . and if we look at the peopl who had come to help the victim then we find out that they were not the youth but the middl age or old peopl . it is not that all the youngster are unhelp but ye the major is far too self centr to come out and give time to their commun , to think of it well be . apart from thi , their modern valu , their distanc from religion , their shyness , etc are also play a role in their behaviour . at time , the thought that what can a singl man do keep them away from help other . they need to understand that they have the power to dream and chang the world . they just have to take a step forward . it is high time that they realis that the commun need them as much as they need the commun . their surviv and develop is depend on the commun of which they are a part . their involv will do lot of good to them and to their commun as well .
