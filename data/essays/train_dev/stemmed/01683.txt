the beauti of flower is time . and so , if we as a commun do not use our time appropri , we will dramat suffer , especi young peopl . the major problem aris today and it is that young peopl nowaday do not give suffici time to help in contribut their commun . unfortun , they spend much of their time on futil and fruitless thing , such as watch televis for hour , surf on restrict site on the internet , and spend less time on read benefici and andvantag stuff . unquestion , most dwell today contain at least one televis set . the problem is that young peopl do not benefit from televis nowaday , where instead of watch use stuff , such as ` the discoveri chanel ' or ` anim planet ' , they tend to watch thing that are noxiou and ` brain washer ' . without a doubt televes today are consid ` like a white eleph ' . young peopl nowaday need to contribut harder and use the internet more effici . i am sure that there are abund amount of peopl in thi world use internet unwis by watch porn and bad thing on the internet . my point here is that the internet is a coloss sourc of inform and mani young peopl look at it on the deciet way , which is realli depress and exasper . i strongli agre that much time should be spent on read rather that watch televis . and that is becaus read make the person more productic by give him crucial and pivot inform about mani thing in life . moreov , read is exceedingli use for the brain , as it make it more activ and vivaci . in the long run , i strongli agre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . and neccessari action should be taken for the whole commun to make an end to thi unwant crisi .
