i am agre with that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif . someon around me i like them veri much . it is becaus them have mani knowledg to share with me , and from differ subject . i am a person who alway keep a heart of curiou , i want to know everi thing around me , whi the bird fli , whi machin work , i ask and ask , my friend give the answer , i think they are mr.know-al . it is not the most import reason for thi topic . howev , i may use a exampel to say . there is a chins book wrote by mani centri ago . peopl agru about whether it is wrote by one person or two , and who is the second writer . mani peopl search in liberi , histori . but they had not succeed . about 50 year ago , a peopl who is special in stastic , gave us the answer with stastic moth . he comper the sign , mark and langueg signal , and then , he find out the book wa realli wrote by two differ writer . also , as you know , in scienc , physic and chemistri can not be without each other . with out chemistri , physic can not describ someth happen . be veri proudli , there wa a great chines teacher thounsand year ago had talk about thi topic . he said , if you had studi one subject to the end , then you had alreadi studi other to the end . it is hard to say that to special in one specif subject is not so good . howev , in my opinion , it is too narrow . a wide knowledg will give us a good reason to carri on our studi . that 's all .
