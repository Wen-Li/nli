some peopl know a lot about advertis and so they can imagin that compani have to present their good as perfect as possibl . these kind of peopl antizip thi behavior and know that not everyth told in advert in true . to thi peopl thi statement might be wrong . but i person agre with thi state becaus you can not suppos that a lot of peol know enough about the taktic of advertis . one reason whi product seem to be better is that the compani compet with other good on mark and need to show that their product is better than the other one . thi is onli possibl if they tell and show thing obut the good wich might be not true . for exampl if you take a look at the red bull advertis zou see that they say if someon drink red bull , he will becom wing and can fli . an other reason is that compani have to show the consum whi they should by someth or whi they need that good . onc again they have to creat a situat in in their advertis which present product in the perfect caus . an exampl for that are the axe advertis . they show you that a man who doe not use their product can t get women and men who do use axe will do much better . i think an other import reason for support thi statement is that product usual are shown bigger and nicer than in realliti . imagin a pictur of a new burger at mc donnald . the seem to be so big on the advertis and thi caus you to go and tri one . but if zou have one of those new burger in your hand you don t recognis the burger from the pictur . so altogeth i agre with thi statement and thi caus me to think about thi problem befor i by someth new .
