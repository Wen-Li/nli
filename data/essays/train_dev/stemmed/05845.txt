i disagre becaus travil with a group led by a tour guid is a bad idea for my think . first when someon is travilng with a group led by a tour guid , it make him or her be control , so he or she ca n't have the abil to move freelli . for exampl , if someon need to go to the restroom , everi one should wite for that person until he or she finish . and also if someon doe n't like the place or ha been to the place that group are go to , he or she should go with the group . the second reason is that travilng with a group could be unhealthi in someon 's health . when someon travel with a group , he or she may have healthi problem that could transfear to someon in the group . for exampl , if someon ha inflo , it can transfear ( go ) to someon in the group easlli . the third reason that when someon is travil with a group the travel base on a plan . when a group travel , it ha a readi plan . so , when someon want to chang hi mind about a place , he ca n't chang the plan he should go with the plan or leav the group after pay some money . for exampl , if someon chang hi mind about visitng a musum with the group , he ca n't chang the plan from visit the musum to visit the zoo . so he should go with the group by rhe plan or leav the group after pay some money . all in all , as you see , travil with a group is a bad idea becaus of the abil of move , the health and chang the mind . i think when someon want to travel , he or she should go by themselv .
