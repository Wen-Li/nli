i believ that concept and fact are pretti relat each other , so both of them are necessari dure the student 's learn process . in mani case , concept are the result or the infer made on studi over fact , like for exampl pyshic law of gravit that could be infer after year of observ on planet movement , or demand and offert law , that summar the behavior of the buyer and factori see for mani year . so , to get a full comprenhens of a concept , it is neccessari to review and studi the fact that are involv with the concept , and then tri to undestand or infer what the concept is summar patter or similar behavior that you found . mani professor and student just like to take a bounch of fact and review it , but thi kind of learn approach is meanless , becaus you use fact onli as support inform , so you can realli get a full understand of what the fact are show or what are happen . for other is more like the approach of tri just to understand de concept without review or analys the fact , make veri difficult to get a full understand of the concept and even make veri difficult to appli it in real situat . for my the perfect convin of learn from the fact and undertand the concept , is the best path to a succ learn process .
