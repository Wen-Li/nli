there is a public controversi nowaday that whether we should decreas our car-us in the follow twenti year . differnt peopl have differ view due to their individu angl . the peopl who prefer to drive the car hold the opinion that the industri develop need transport by use car . but some person think these vehicl will pollut our environ , so the countri should limit to use car as traffic tool . as far as i am concern , i would absolut choos the latter opinion . i would reason and provid convinc exampl to support my viewpoint as follow . the foremost reason we can not deni is that the whole world 's eviron becom wors gradual . the industri develop without care consider caus problem even wors than we can imagin . the whole countri overflow by pollut like the white pollut , nosi pollut , the air pollut and light pollut . and mani amout of them are caus by use car . and those pollut will threat our health . also the increas car burn fuel larger than ever befor , the energi in the whole world is decreas fastli . mayb in few year , we could not use fuel to move our car . the reason whi i cast my prefer for car decreas is that a lot of specis have alreadi extinct . becaus they can not accommod themselev to the chang live condit . as a undergradu student major in life scienc , i will do someth for those live creatur . so i hope we can find some other vehicl to take but not car which will produc toxic output . therefor i alway take my short trip by cycl instead of travel by car . of cous , there are some merit by use car . but the advantag and the disadvantag of use car are care compar . we can see clearli that protect our enviorn outweigh the advantag of use car . all in all , consid all support point abov , we can ratino see that deceas the car use is veri import of our dailylif .
