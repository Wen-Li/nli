when i wa a student , i met with differ kind of student . some of them like to give some of their time in order to help their commun , and some student do not . howev , i agre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun and thi is becaus of mani reason . first of all , they depend mostli on the their superior to accomplish their own work . for exampl , in nurs profess , you will notic that jonior depend on senior to acheiv their own work . anoth point , the develop of highli advanc techniqu and machin , such as internet , comput and so on , make these young peopl to depend on these equip and to decreas focus to help their commun . moreov , they do n't take ani responsibili for ani work they are do and thi is becaus of fulli depend on the other so if they are not take respons for their work , how they will help their commun . anoth one is that less guidanc that should be given by the other expert peopl . for exampl , some senior nurs tend to see mistak while the jonior nurs give health educ but they will keep quit without correct her mistak . in addit , less expert teacher are avail nowaday to direct these student to the proper direct and to encourag them to give some of their time to help their commun . final , the famili play a major role in keep thi featur in their children . at the end , take all of these reason in consider will help to have peopl who care about give part of their own time to help their commun and to build strong commun that can face ani problem .
