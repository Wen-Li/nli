everi day in everi part of the world peolp have to ak themselv if it is realli necessari to take risk to be more success or if it is enough to stay on a certain level . everi day peopl have to decid in which direct they want to move . my person opinion wa alway to take some risk . howev i seper it into take stupid risk and take `` intellig '' risk . if you want to be more success than you are , you have to chang someth and to tri out someth new . our societi is alway on the move - nowaday thing chang veri quickli . i am sure that we have to find new answer for new circumst . last year i had to ask myself what kind of univers i want to join . the possibl were to go to a usual univers in austria or tri to get into a special one in switzerland or germani . i could have said that i take the easi way out which mean go to an austrian colleg . howev i want to join a better univers which meant that i had to find a job for one year ( for practic ) and to do exam like the toefl to get in . to make it short - i took a risk . probabl the univers is n't interest to work with me . but even if they do n't give me a chanc i could learn a lot in thi year . if i had not taken the risk i probabl would ask myself for the rest of my life whi i did n't even tri it . in my opinion you ca n't have a satisfi life if you never take a risk to find out how much fun it is if you are success or if you see a posit result of your tooken risk . by the way i could have a happi life without skydiv . but i did it and it wa one of my greatest experi i ever had . to summer my opinion : i would like to encourag everi one to risk a lot and to take a risk again - also if you had bad experi with thi attitud .
