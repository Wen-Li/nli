in my opinion , success is mainli the result of realiz chanc and opportun . as a consequ , i agre with the issu statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i do acknowledg that there may be situat in which it may prove better to stick to what you are use to do . in the cours of a sport examin , for exampl , it may not be too wise to tri an entir new way of jump across a hurdl . howev , even in a situat like thi the basic fact remain valid that without take some risk you may miss your chanc . in my exampl thi mean that thi one differ jump might just have been the one your teacher want to see . apart from that , i believ that you ca n't make ani progress if you stay persist at the same level . and alway do what you know how to well alreadi doe n't mean anyth els but precis thi remain static and without progress . in order to be success , it is , in my opinion , essenti that you make some progress . for usual success is connect with some achiev . thi is just anoth reason whi i agre with the issu statement . howev , the most import reason , whi i affirm thi statement , is that chanc may appear suddenli . and as i have explain prior to thi , i consid take and realiz your chanc to be of fundament import for success . if you alway ponder about whether to seiz an opprtun or not , it would probabl be gone befor you came to a decis . it is often imposs to realiz your chanc with an absolut certainti that everyth will turn out all right . consequ , there alway is a risk in realiz them . and if you are not will to take thi risk and instead stick to what you know to do well alreadi , you may veri like miss a chanc to be success .
