i disagre with thi statement . first , we can approuv thi kind of opinion becaus we often heard about success peopl whose success wa a respons to an new idea . for instanc , peopl who develop the chain-work in the industri of automobil use to take a lot of risk . they did n't know if the demand wa big enough to develop thi kind of mass product , but they choos to take the risk and they were success . that 's whi the statement we discuss is not totali wrong , but i think that it 's not true . my point is that i think that tri new thing and take risk are two of the key factor to be success , but are not caracterist of success peopl . there are other factor to run well a busi , like good opportun . sometim , you have a real good opportuniti and you choos to tri , and that 's the key of your success . moreov , there are a lot of success peopl who had a good idea at the beginnig , but who do n't take new risk for year . for instanc , bill gate is a reali success person , but he doe n't take risk nor than he tri new thing . he had develop the most famou firm in comput engin , but he did n't tri to diversifi hi activ . moreov , a lot of success peopl base their success in a veri particular field . they choos to becom the best in what they do , and they do n't want to chang their imag by tri new activ . so , they do n't tri new thing , they do n't take risk but they are success becaus they know exactli how to do well what they do . thi is exactli the opposit of the statement we have to discuss . and i do n't think it 's wrong . to conclud , i think that there are not onli one way to act when you are success , and that 's whi it 's realli difficult to run a success busi . everi success busi manag is differ , and take differ decis than an other manag in a same situat .
