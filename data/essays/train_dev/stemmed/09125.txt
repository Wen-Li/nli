if you had ask me thi question five year ago , i would have said , that there would be a sharp increas in number of car dure the twenti year time . sinc , i wa not awar of the fact that car have plenti of neg influenc to the environ that we have been live . in addit to that , petroleum price are increas extrem sharpli . nevertheless , i , now , absolut claim that the amount of car will drop significantli in twenti year time , may be shorter . therefor , i strictli say that there will be less automobil in the come futur . the reason that i wa think that the number of car would increas wa my desir to the car technolog and the possibl of a reduct in price . i wa believ that car design were wonder and everybodi wa awar of thi fact . thu , each and everi person would buy car as much as they can . anoth reason for thi belief is that , sinc the brand are get larger and rivalri is increas , the price of the car would fall . i did not come to a conclus about the price opf the car . they are decreas as the day pass by . howev , i had seen that the automobil desir wa onli my characterist . most of the peopl istead of buy car are now invest on other properti , such as flat or cooper . whi i am now think in thi way , that the number of car will decay , is now i am awar of the effect of car to the envoropn . furthermor a consider number of peopl are also agre with me and they are all awar of thi damag effect . therefor , most of the peopl will quit use car , at least they will use public transport , which is a good altern for privat car usag . sinc most of the peopl will be carri just by one bu or other sort of transport , it will be more clean . anoth reason for think in thi way is actual a lesser crucial point that compar to the one mention abov , which is the high price of the oil use for car . after the sharp rise in 2004 , the car usag decreas enorm . especi in less develop countri , driver quit use the priva car . it seem that the current price will not vari dure the come futur . henc , thi will influenc the number of car use on road . if we take all of the factor mention abov into consider after a detail observ of each point , we can come to a conclus that , becaus of neg effect of the car to environ and high ga price , the usag of the car will drop . for the follow twenti year time , i am not expect a sharp fall but degre bu degre . if the usag of the public transport is enhanc and if the peopl are warn and educ due to the side effect of car to the environ , thi fall may be faster to a certain degre .
