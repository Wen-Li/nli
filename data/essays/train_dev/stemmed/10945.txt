some peopl believ that it is better to have broader knowledg than special knowledg , other think not . in my opinion , i would agre with thi statement . there are mani reason as follow . to begin with , we could combin mani differ knowledg into one way . if we learn as mani academ subject as we can , we might put them togeth one day , and invent will happen . take the invent of cellphon for exampl . as we know , somon invent tradit phone , he use hi academ field to invent it . but , nowaday , we increas the profit on mani special kind of cellphon . that is , what will make commerci profit ? it is not onli the profession part but also combin other , such as ad and design . in addit , we can commun with each other by use other sever academ knowledg . in the other word , our friend may apprici us becaus of our wide knowleg . we will not have a good social relationship if we onli concentr on our own field . it is becaus that we are too bore to stay with . thu , we should get more and more academ subject as we can , then we can chat with ani kind of friend who take part in differ field . howev , we should also special our academ subject . it is becaus that when we work in our profession part , we should give a confid to our custom , it is imposs that we put too mani emphasi on other thing but can not answer ani question which our custom ask . moreov , we should studi hard to our own academ field and we could get a better job than broader knowledg . as all reason i have mention abov , the first is that it is import that have broad knowledg to combin them into a new one . the second reason is that it is easier to commun with ani kind of person . furthermor , if you want to get a better job , you should special your academ subject .
