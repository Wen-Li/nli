it is import for everyon to have not onli the substract abil but also the object abil . substract abil is base on the understand of idea and concept , and the object abil is base on the fact . base on the research , kid and children are sensit to the fact becaus they have not the capic to think and solv the complex question . on the other hand , adult and elder youth are more will to understand idea and concept becaus they have the abil to think substract thing . for exampl , in math , a child can onli understand the simpl calcult step , but for adult or youth , they can solv complex question step by step . as a result , i disagre the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept then it is for them to learn fact . in my opnion , everyth is base the fact , without the fact , ani idea and concept are vaniti . for a elementari school student , it imposs to catch the idea and concept .
