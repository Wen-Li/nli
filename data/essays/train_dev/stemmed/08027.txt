in my opinion , in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for the follow three reason . first , even though there will be a lot of peopl that will need car to move , for exampl to go to work , and the popul of the world will increas , peolp will have other possibl to move and travel . for exampl , a lot of place and locat will be connect by train , plane more than today . so that , even if peopl have the possibl , even nowaday , to travel with train or plane , in the futur , they will use better servic . second , if nowaday there is the problem of the pollut becaus of the traffic , the smog , i can immagin what it will be in twenti year . the sky will be so grey that the onli solut , mayb , it will be to not use car anymor or use less car than today . so , peopl will go bike or or will use car with no danger engin . third , mayb in twenti year new model of car or way to travel and move will be invent . the air is not so clean and the street are too full of car that we need a solut and what it is import is that we need somebodi to project and creat a new way to move . the problem is that there are too mani car that fill the street . to avoid thi risk it is import to find other way . to sum up , the presenc of infinit number of car in the world , pollut , and the invent of other way for travel are good reason whi in twenti year there will be fewer car in use .
