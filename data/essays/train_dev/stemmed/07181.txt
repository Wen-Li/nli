i both agre and disgre with those two statem . from my prepact i thik what all matter is your comfor what ever you feel goood about you choos . basd on my experi i travel to mani countriesaroud the wide world . howevr i just travel onc with a group led by a tour guid , and i find it veri interst i have been to place that i have never been befor even thought that i visit the contri befor . the group led by a tour guid can save time and money . have a group led is veri halpful , becous you get to see place without spend ani affert or go around in cricl . it is veri intrest becous befor you travel to the countri , the group giud ha ha sete the shcudual . even it is chepper to travel with a group becous evri thing is go by a group not indivauali . when you travel by you self you are go to spend lot of money if you travel by your self , or even straggl to find good plaec to spend in . the disadvanteg of the group guid you cant havepriveci . let say tat you are go in honey moon you are not go to choos a group guid . you might not get along with the group . one tini disadvatag of the grop guid is some time they the scagual a plan and you might have fun , or you dont like the place to be exact . what i do recommend is if you have not tri the the group travel you got to tri it even thought disagvantg but it 's worth it . the best two advandeg is you are go to save money and time .
