in my opinion the staement list on the right doe n't consid the realiti . the world is turn into a medic knowledg world . by that i mean that medic in thi year save thousand of peopl in the world . the death rate in the world is decreas time after time . nowaday we can compet with nearli all infect in the world , accept the hiv viru . but as we all know , also the hiv infect in the world are decreas . peopl do care more about their health . the govern encourag smoker to quit smoke , the usa help other countri by provid them food . thi all lead to an increas of popul in the world . anoth aspect is that freedom of opportun . in our year we do n't have slaveri or other crimin action , besid war , that can lead to death . the usa and other countri provid starv african kid with food and medic . they also teach them the knowledg which is gener to us , for exampl use a condom to prevent the most known viru in the world hiv . more high econom countri help citizen of countri with lower economi to share tequin knowledg , which help these citizen to grow their economi . thu the peopl have a longer live time . through all these factor in my opinion peopl will drive more car than today . car get cheaper , becaus the product of car will get easier with new tecnolog . thu peopl will buy more car or some might have more than one car for themselv . in short term , when the popul of the world increas the more car we will have in twenti year . we all know that it is comfort to drive a car to get from one point to anoth . thi will in my opinion not chang in the next twenti year .
