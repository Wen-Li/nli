i 'm not quit agre with that the travel would be the best when it ha tour guid . but it is such a good idea to be with a group . and that guid lead you to know wonder site that the guid know them better than the tourist . i would prefer have group guid if i have know idea about the countri that i 'm visit . i will discuss that differ in detail support by exampl . travel is someth nice and let you discov mani thing that you do n't know befor . first , to discov the site that you visit you must have a guid becaus you have ani idea about it at natur . you might be see thi site by the internet or a catalog . in thi case , the leader of the group will show all the site that you came for them . second , the leader will give you a coplet idea about the citi that you are visit . for exampl , you might visit such a countri that ha histor site and some these site 's inhabit home or their ancestor 's home . and the leader ha plenti background about the histori aspect of thi countri the tourist might want to know from him . in the other hand , i as a tourist i might use the tour guid for just some trip or some site in particular . for exampl , i can not use the tour guid when i want to visit a countri that i have an idea about it . also i will not use the tour guid if i 'm go to visit safe countri or small countri which i can go around the countri veeri easili . mani case that the tour guid must be with you . for exampl , if you are travel with senior peopl or veri old peopl . the tour guid would make it easier to move from site to site for the old peopl .
