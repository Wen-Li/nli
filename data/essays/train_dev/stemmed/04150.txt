i realli agre with thi statement . i 'm studi engin and even if the fact and info can be import on everi cours and topic , they realli do n't teach you anyth but they just show you if you realli understood the concept and the idea . for exampl , if you are studi a physic cours , it 's normal to find mani experi made by mani person but these experi are made not onli to give you some info about the result but to be sure that you realli understood the mean whi they made these experi and whi they can be useful or not . i do n't want to say that learn fact is complet useless but i say that you ca n't just learn them , furthermor they 're useless if you do n't know the mean of them . that 's whi concept and idea are so import for student . unfortun , mani teacher do n't think the same as me , that what happen to my own experi dure my year at univers . if i have to be sincer , dure the cours that a teacher put the attent on fact instead of cencept , i complet lost my attent and i could n't follow the lesson . not onli me act thi way but mani of my mate too and the mark that we took by these kind of exam were n't that high . so , that 's what made my opinion , my own experi and i think that onc you have experi to support your opinion , it can be stronger and believ by mani person . i even hope that my opinion will be read by mani teacher even to help them to make their lesson more interest and expeci use for their student .
