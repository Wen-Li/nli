i disagre with the point that understand idea and concept are more import than learn fact . some peopl more concentr to the idea and concept when they learn about new thing and they think learn is done , but there are most import fact what we learn about . for exampl , i just start to attend at a church and start learn about bibl . if i just studi about what god say and mean of the word , i do n't think i can learn about god and what is more import , and also it will be difficult to have strong believ . without learn fact just understa the iead and concept are useless and after a certain time we will forget what what we wa learn . for exampl , when we learn about our histori , if we just concentr the concept and idea in the subject , we never learn about our curtur and our emot . when we are read a newspap and if we just read about idea , we can not see what is import effect or the fact what the articl want to teach us or what is the reason that thi matter have to be in the newpap . when we learn a second languag in school , if we learn about just vocabulari and grammar in that languag , we do not have good reason to learn the languag , we should be spake to the other peopl in thi languag , that is most import fact that we should learn about new thing . if we can not speak to other peopl in the languag it is useless at as a result , learn about fact and understand the point is most import than just understand idea and concept .
