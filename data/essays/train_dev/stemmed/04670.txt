i would strongli agre with thi statement . in today 's learn environ , a student need to focu on qualit learn as oppos to quantit learn . a need for comprehens of the concept and idea becom increasingli import for a person to achiev success in his/her life . as a child , benjamin franklin wa reliev of studi at junior school sinc he would not learn up everyth that he wa requir of him , which he believ it to be unnecessari as they were alreadi provid . he went on to later becom one of the greatest inventor of all time . now i am do not believ that school is not import , but that these ` fact ' , which are mere cluster of inform , are actual deriv from idea that other peopl onc had . onc a concept is understood , the idea can alway be deriv . onc a theorem is known , a deriv can be made . in contrast , if a student is made to onli learn fact with lesser import given to idea , then that student may not be abl to contribut to mani aspect that requir think in hi life . if everyon were taught to do someth but not told whi it is done or what principl underli it , then innov would becom an extinct concept . i would next like to highlight anoth import result - innov . it is the onli thing that ha given us what we have today ; thi pc that i am oper on , the et test system and countless other thing . complac would realli bring us back to the stone age . in conclus , if we were to onli learn fact and figur , then we would not requir school in the first place . everyon would be academ equal or base on the capac of his/her memori , which would be a larg encumber to progress . thi is the reason that all univers stress on concept learn than ` mug up ' . to conclud , i would say that thi statement is perfectli right and that it should prevail .
