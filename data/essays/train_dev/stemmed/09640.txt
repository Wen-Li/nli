i agre with the statement : ` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ' , although it wa not such an easi question and furtermor it ha neither an easi or definit answer . i believ that some ( some , becaus it is imposs to generallyz in abstract theme as thi one ) young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl mostli becaus they have less respons . as it is said : ` those whom do n't know anyth , do n't fear anyth ' which mean that the less you know the less you have to worri about . by exampl , a six year old boy need to be feed and he worri about it when he feel hungri , buy he doe n't worri about who is bring the money home to buy the food . so , he enjoy life by be satisfi on hi basic need and by be abl to play and experi life at thi young stage . on the other hand , older peopl , adult for exampl , gener have an incom , they have money , they drive , they have an activ social life and they can practic do whatev they want . .. thi , give them a sens of freedom . i said befor that thi wa not an easi question and either it wa not easi to answer becaus it ha mani point to be anallyz , so mani that i believ it could be the topic of a profession research . there are mani variabl : what can we consid as young peopl ( teenag are a young segment of the popul and they certainli do n't feel happi alll the time ) and what can be consid as old peopl ( veri old peopl are most of the time sick ; accord to jose saramago : the old peopl live go to noth while the young peopl goe for everyth ) . but , in conclus i think that is better to know mani thing , to be awar of what life ha for each one - you can reach thi state when you are an adult , even a young adult - and then enjoy life , know the advantag and challeng that life put on your way to get almost anyth : when someth cost one a lot of work , it will appear to be better when it is obtain . so that : i am older than other peopl and i enjoy life more than some younger peopl .
