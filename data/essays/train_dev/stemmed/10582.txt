i agre with the point that `` better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than go for a special in one specif subject '' . i support thi point becaus we can learn mani applic by have mani subject in academ . the main reason is by learn more subject we can interpret them and can appli the knowledg one through anoth . for exampl if we have to work on a project like develop a machin . we have to about the strength it will withstand , to know thi we have to work for stress that appli on the part of the machin . but it is difficult to find manual , becaus first design the machin the load that with stand on the machin , etc . now day that we have simul softwar that can work by produc a model in that . for thi we need a comput knowledg and how to work on the softwar . and then how to design the model , load , etc . for all these we need differ subject like , for work with comput we have to comput knowledg , for work to design we need to know the draw , for find the load we have to the mechani of materi , then to solv we need mathemat , and then for assembl we have to learn how to assembl the part . by seem all these for one thing we have to work on for differ subject . we need to appli all the skill in on project . after learn basic in all subject then we can go for a special one becaus we work for a perticular model . so i prefer to have knowledg of mani academ subject in order to have a specisl subject , becaus if we know all the subject we need not go for some other specialist we can appli all those .
