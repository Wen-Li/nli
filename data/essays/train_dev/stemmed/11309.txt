now a day the way of gain knowledg chang verymuch for the student . some will prefer to learn by understand the idea and concept . some will prefer to learn by face the fact . it 's depend upon the age of the student also . if i were ask i 'll definit prefer the idea of learn fact . the reason for thi is , it can last for a long time . it will be use to the student in the futur field of work . the student have veri less chanc to commit the mistak also . learnig the fact make the student to think practic and also allow them to think independ . now a day if we take ani eductaion system it is go on the wrong track in some countri . the school and colleg are not give much chanc to the student to think practic . they encourag the spoonfeed . even for the small thing also he need to depend on the their teacher . becaus of competit they forc the student to understand the concept and idea . if a student learn the concept by face it or experienc it it will be last veri long time in hi mind . learnig the fact also make student to be veri effic in the futur field of work . here the student can easili implement whatev he learnt in the student day . he can distinguish among mani peopl . here hi job will be veri easi to him . anoth thing is that student have veri small chanc to commit ani mistak . becaus he learn by hi own experi he wo n't commit ani mistak . from the abov cite point i conclud that the student who learn by understand the fact will definit effici than the other . howev it may be time take proce for a studnet to learn by face the fact i 'll definit prefer the concept of learn by face fact .
