i agre , i beliv in a say that state `` high risk equal high return '' . from erali cours i have taken in school i learn that one should place their egg in differ basket , which mean that invest should be invest in differ new idea instead of concentr on one sort of new busi or idea . one can never grow and develop if they keep on preform what they alreadi know how to do well , inord for somon to grow and develop they must tri new thing , take chanc , and make mistak . for exampl , when a babi first learn how to crawl and becom veri good at it , the babi is never gana crawl for the rest of hi life so the babi will take the risk of walk , even tough the babi will fall sever time , the babi will tri again and again that 's where not be afraid to make mistak come in . the babi can not run unless it can walk , thi point emphasis the imnport of take risk to achiv great success . there are a lot of exampl one can speak about , for exampl . for exampl , bill gate a well recogn busi man in the unit state start off with a busi idea in colleg , and instead of continu hi studi he took hi idea and put it into action , he now is the owner of an intern recogn comput softwar compani microsoft . microsoft is alway take risk and introduc new idea and tri new thing in the market caus microsoft to still grow and strive in the market . tri new thing is never a risk i beliv , how can somon have potentail to grow and strive in today economi if one is not will to take init and tri new thing . faill should never hold someon back from succed in someth but it should be a lesson to learn from to do well next time one tri again .
