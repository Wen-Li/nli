i agre with the idea that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i believ that tri new thing and take risk are good for us . becaus do such thing will bring new knowleag and experi for us . and we are grow now , so , we do not know that what is best thing for me yet . for exampl , my brother love to play basebal and he play veri well , so he desir to be basebal player in futur . but i want to recommend him to play other sport . becaus he never play other soprt befor so he doe not know that how much fun do other sport are . mayb , if he play other sport , he can find more interest sport than basebal . i think we have to be more activ in order to be success peopl . i think success peopl are not afraid of make mistak , so they can tri new thing and take risk . i am take spanish class in high school . but i do not want to take it befor take it , becaus i am japanes , so stude english is too much for me . but i feel take spanish is veri fun and i think that i want to studi more . learnig onoth languag brought me new opinion and new world . so i am abl to speak spanish now , i can make new peopl who talk spanish , too . tri new thing and take risk are hard , and peopl want to avoid such thing . but tri is import for us to grow up and to be success peopl . when we talk with success peopl , we can find fact that they have mani knowleag becaus they have mani experi includ bad and good . thi awar them someth . do not be afraid , you can tri new thing even if you make mistak , you can tri again . that experi that you did tri is not wast thing in your life . you can have confid .
