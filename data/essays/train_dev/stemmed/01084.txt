i myself am consid a young person and live in a commun compromis of both young and old . it is a common percept that young peopl enjoy themselv more than older peopl do . howev , i think thi percept is faulti . in fact it is the older gener who enjoy life more . youth ha mani advantag . it is perceiv that young peopl enjoy more becaus they have more energi , enthusiasm and time . howev , what they do not account is the societi and it demand . with time our societi ha been evolv , it ha becom more demand , more particular and much younger , even though the younger gener doe have more energi , enthusiasm etc. etc. it doe not have then time to enjoy . `` i wish the week had eight day '' - thi is a common phrase heard from all young peopl across the globe . younster are push themselv to becom respons and success citizen everday . they are alway want to do more in less time . their life ha peer pressur , studi pressur , exam pressur , job pressur , person pressur . ad to thi are variou famili , friend and other social oblig . there is too much to achiev in such less time . thu the attribut which should have assist them in enjoy life more becom reason for them to work and achiev more . time is alway short . in thi rush of thing when doe one get time to even breath ? in contrast , the older gener is at a stage where they have undergon all pschylog , commun , religi , physic metamorphisi . thank to variou state and public polici they are no longer financi depend in old age . thu they are free to experinc life as it is . though they lack in the attribut favour the younger gener they compens by matur , patienc and motiv to truli enjoy life . it is commonli said `` life begin at sixti '' . thi is true , becaus by thi age one is free of all responsibl and oblig and can enjoy life at their own pace . there is true enjoy onli when one ha time to experi everi minut particl .
