i disagre with the statement ' it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject ' . in case of broad knowledg of mani academ subject we need to studi all the subject and becom familiar with all the topic in the subject . it is difficult task to do . where as in case of the case of special in one specif subject is an easi process to know abt the subject . in special one specif subject , we can learn more about the topic and we can learn veri deepli about the subject and becom a gem in that particular subject . when a person go to a job he just see that in which stream or subject the candid is more intellig and the interview ask the quieri relat to that subject onli . interview see the candid that how much deep knowledg the candid ha in that subject . when we would like to do postgradu cours we will be specizl in a specif subject . special one specif subject is a good and easi process . we can get deep knowledg in the subject and do some researsh work relat to that subject . as an exampl if a person is special in artifici intellig , he can make mani program and make intellegen comput program . he can write program self . borad knowledg of academ subject is we should learn all the subject in the academ year . we need to grasp all the topic which is big problem . it is veri hard to grasp all the subject and a tuff task to rememb all the topic and point in the subject . we can not be abl to special in ani field . it is difficult to understand each topic in the subject and it take much time to prepar all the subject . it is not an easi task to have broad knowledg of academ subject . broad knowledg of academ subject is some what helpful to shift to differernt stream and also differ special . but we cani be perfect in ani subject thu special in one specif subject is better an we can deepen knowledg . broad knowledg doesnt help and we will not be perfectrt in
