i disagre with the statement that success peopl are the one who tri new thing and take risk . if i ran a busi , i would not take risk becaus i think it is not worth lose money . the possibl loss would probabl do bigger harm than a gain of money would do good . in these day it seem to be crucial to know which risk to take and which not . yet it is my belief that stick with a good techniqu , mayb one inherit by a famili member that hat run the compani for a long time , can be more effici than blindli put everyth at risk . alway chang strategi to the newest model will not work as efficientlz as will a good plan that is realiz over a long period of time without interrupt . of cours , thi way of manag will not make a compani rich quickli . but in my opinion , it is better to start slowli and work thoroughli , than risk not onli money and time , but also job and final the most import of all , the compani itself . an other exampl is educ . i could have gone to school less year , compar to the rest of the famili . i would have tri someth new . but with thi new and veri riski move i could neither count on the support of my peer , nor would i have an idea about what to do . i would be helpless . chanc are , that probabl other peopl could succeed in such a situat , but i am absolut posit that for me , the `` safe way '' is the better opportun . all togeth i find it more logic and matur to stick to known procedur that do work in everyday life . if somebodi risk someth , he or she can gain a lot on the one hand , but on the other hand , it is also possibl to lose a lot . and lose a lot can not be call success .
