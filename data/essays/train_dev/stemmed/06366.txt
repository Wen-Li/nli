is there anyon who is success through a entir histori without challeng to a new thing ? i absolut agre with the idea that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know for some reason . at first , tri new thing mean get new chanc . secondli , if they fail , they can learn someth that other peopl never know by their experi . the first reason whi i believ success peopl tri new thing and take risk is about chanc and possibl of be success . if peopl just do what they know how to do , that mean they will have no chanc to learn new thing and achiev new goal . speak of busi , nowaday if someon want to start his/her own busi , she/h will contempl about the field that other peopl doe n't tri yet or is not varifi enogh about the success . tri new thing somewhat mean seiz an opportun . it 's clear to take high risk in a new field but onc that busi get a right way , it also can get much more success . the higher risk are , the bigger success will be . if there is a someon who just follow the familliay way , it would be safer and esier but success , the result , would be limit in return . the other reason whi i think be success requir to tri new thing and take risk is learn new thing . in a challeng , there is a lot of possibl to fail . howev , peopl can learn lesson or new knowledg from that failur . thi experi is never exchang with anyth . it also can be a sturdi foundat of their next step . most success peopl got through the sever failur but they never kneel down to that bitter experi . if peopl could get over it and learn someth , they would be success with it .
