what are student go to school for ? do they learn the thing that are nescessari for them ? student are ask to understand idea and concept from the subject they are learn . they are also ask to learn fact from past experi . howev , which one is the thing they need more , understand idea or learn fact ? in my opinion , understand idea and concept is more import for student . to begin with , student go to school becaus they need to gain knowledg that are need for their futur . student should be abl to understand that the idea and concept of the subject they are studi , so that they will understand the subject easier . for exampl , the use of a mathemat formula , the rule of a chemic equat . without the understand the idea and concept , they do not know how to use it and when should they appli it on . as be a student , i think that when student have the idea and concept of someth , they will eventu understand the fact of someth too . sinc a fact of an event or object is actual the result of the develop of a centain kind of idea and concept . in the other word , idea and concept are the basic requir for student to learn a fact . moveov , some peopl think that learn fact is more improt for student than understand idea and concept . it is becaus they believ that fact is more easier for student to understand someth nesscessari for thier life . but their never understand that fact can onli tell use the surfac of someth , not the mean that are behind them . in conclus , it is improt for student to know both the idea and concept and fact of what they are learn . howev , idea and concept are the basic element for them the studi a subject . fact may not be abl to show the main point they need to know . as a result , student should focu on the idea and concept befor they take the next step to learn the fact .
