in everi part of our life to have more knowlag about life is import for all of us . especi if thi knowlag is about acedem subject it will be more interest for student who tri to maintain themselv . for some peopl it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject which i do not agre . i think it is better for someon or a student to have full of right knowledg about one suject . first of all it known that if someon have not right inform about one subject how can he or she will know about other subject . for exampl , if a person in a famili dinner want to talk about polit and start to talk but he can not finish hi sentenc or can not answer the question that hi famili member becous the inform that he have in hi mind can not let him to express himself well . on the other hand if he had known well about polit and tell and answer th equest about thi subject it will be more affect for himself , i think it is not so much import for him to not know about intern relationship which can be talk in the tabl . he can say he did not know about thi subject and want to know about it now which will be better answer for that convers . secondli , in today 's world to have full of academ knowledg about one subject is veri import . all the parent want their children have an one job which they can take care themselv . thi will be possibl onli if that person educ in a univers . in these year no one give a job to someon who do not finish univers . for exampl , when someon appli for a job no one ask for that person what kind of thing do you know about differ subject . they just want to no if you your aduc in univers and capabil for that job . to sum up , i think to know about one specif academ subject 's more import than ani think . everyon have to consantr on their onli subject to be more successful then anyon .
