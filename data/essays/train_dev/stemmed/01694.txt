i disagre that understand idea and concept are more import than it is to learn fact . with thi a do not mean that understand idea and concept are useless , of cours you need them for everyth you do , like in your person life , in your work , etc . the point that i think that is more import learn the fact it is becaus you are actual live in real life the problem . understand idea may give the basi for the problem but mani time when you are in the real situat it is not like they taught us it would be . like for an exampl when you are studi in the colleg , they teach how the compani work , they give you all the idea and concept of what you are suppos to do in such situat , and mani tool to resolv mani problem in your profession life . but thi is no even close of what actual happen in real life . when you graduat and finish school and a compani hire you , thi a differ stori . the problem are much bigger and stress than the one you studi . for resolv thi problem you have to implement all the knowledg you have studi . the fact give you a wider vision of what is happen around the world . i think that studi fact give you the knowledg and the experi to face the problem in you profession life . experi is one of the most important attribut that a persona can have when you are look for a job . thi will help you to resolv the problem in a way a lot easier than your collegu and it could be a valu that you your superior would evalu like a principl asset . in conclus a think that learn fact are much more import than unsterstand idea and concept , of cours not make the second one less import .
