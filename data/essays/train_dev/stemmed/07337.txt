actual if we dont have idea and concept about anyth then we can not understand that . but what is meant by idea ? the idea is that have gener inform about that topic and what is concept is that know about that area or particular task . in my opinion have to have idea and concept is better than learn the fact . becaus if we dont even have the idea about that topic then how can we have the concept and if we dont have that to then learn of fact is also wast and it is unnecessari time wast . for exampl if i dont have ani idea about how to use comput and doe n't even know anyth about it then if i start learn about it is wast and if i learn also i will not rememb that fact for longer time . i can rememb for shorter time but that doesnt realli help me . i befor learn ani fact first of all i will get an idea about that topic and then i will tri to have littl concept about it and then learn fact so that it will be help for me . onc i had a subject name daa and i dont even know that subject littl bit also i have an idea but i dont have the concept . my professor to that subject wa realli to bad , so when it the time for exam i had to studi that subject , i realli rememb that wa a realli tough time i had ever gone in my life . i just mug up the whole subject and went to the exam . howev i could clear the test but i did n't even rememb ani topic name also in that subject . but in some case learn fact is veri import than to have the concept on that . i am basic an engin so i will not have ani idea or ani concept about how the medicin will be prepar as scienc student have . so at that time i will just know about how that medicin is help to me to cure my particular diseas instead of know about how that is made and stuff relat to that . at that time onli fact is import to me. that whether my diseas ha been cure or not that is import to me that it . depend upon the situat the method of uderstand or learn will chang but have concept is realli import .
