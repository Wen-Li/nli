at the begin of 19th centri , the fisrt advertis appear in the public life . in fact , certain good are meant to describ as much better than they realli are . howev , in my person opinion , i believ it is not fair and logic to just simpli say that the ad maker are over promot their good . first of all , human be are the anim that full of desir . we want ourselv to be respect and popular among other , so we usual will to pay to help us make that target . for exampl , most of us use shampoo to wash our hair everyday , and we believ thi matter is abl to make our hair look better and cleaner . yet , is that true ? is there ani scienc data ever prove that shampoo can clean up our hair ? look at the tv show , magazin and internet again , there are still full of sixi women who make themselv more charm by use certain brand of shampoo . as soon as we believ tthose advertis , and presuat by them , we will go stright to spend money on buy their good . and at most of time without even a reason . also , if you pass by a fanci shop mall and see the huge ad of a sport star wear a pair of nike sport shoe and look so happi and cool , wo n't you strat to have a idea of `` wow , that shoe look so good '' ? even so , is the truth trune out as a pair of nike shoe is the reason that we becom cooler and happier ? easi enought , the answer is no . actulli , it is not the game of advertis make most of prodeuct seem better , but persaut you by connect differ signal and messag into your brain so you will own the idea of would like to have them . such as the shampoo and the pretti , sixti girl with their good look hair , and the sport shoe plu the cool look sport start . therefor next time , if you see anoth great-look product advertis that make you own the desir of buy , think twice about are those good realli that good , or just yourself is simpli think that way .
