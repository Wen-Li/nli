i agre with the opinion of those who believ that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i do not think , howev , that young peopl are the onli one that have to be blame for thi behaviour . as a matter of fact , our societi , the media , and even politician contin trasmit hedonist and selfish messag , encourag peopl to care about money more than about other peopl , to be competit and succesful without think about the other . the result of such messag is , then , that young peopl consid themselv as individu rather than as part of a commun and that everyon ha lost the sens of the commun : we basic consid the other as stranger and as a potenti danger . in a context in which we do not talk to and even to do not know our neighbour it is then normal that young peopl think that help their commun is onli wast time . befor help a commun , they should , in fact , understand what a commun is . for thi reason it is common to observ that help a commun is much more frequent in littl villag than in big citi . littl villag still mantain a `` social '' life-styl . in littl villag , in fact , peopl still talk to each other and take care of the other . the result of thi approach to life is that all peopl are proud of their commun and readi to spend their time to help the other . in big citi , on the contrari , we have adopt an `` individu '' life-styl that destroy the sens of the commun . it would be then veri strang if young peopl want to give time to their commun in a context where commun do not exist .
