understand is an import aspect of the student educ nowaday . it is veri import to understand idea and concept that should help the student to be awar on it subject . in some area in the world and at a certain level of the educ , student learn fact and do not tri to understand the topic . thi ha a great consequ on the abil of student to express themslev on ani topic . understand concept and idea help student to implement the idea and concept they understood by tri to make realist as possibl . in the same way , student abil to to think is reinforc and their critic point of view would aris . for instanc , when we explain a concept to a student and then we ask him to use that concept in hi real life experi , he would be abl to do it perfectli and at the moment we are sure that he understood instead of just learn the fact given by a teacher in class . furthermor , a student who understand idea and concept should be abl to give hi own point of view in differ manner . base on my own experi i encoout some student that learn fact and are not abl when you ask them think question relat on that topic to answer correctli . one day i help a student to learn hi biolog lesson on root system , they learn that are two type of root system . i ask him to give me the differ between those type and i wa amaz becaus he wa not abl to do that , but when i ask him to give me the two differ type he start to give me all the write of hi notebook ; thi mean that the student did not tri to understand but onli learn . in conclus , base on my explan and support abov mention , i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
