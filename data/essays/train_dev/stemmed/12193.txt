i 'm agre with thi statement becaus i think that sometim most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the advertis is made gener to achiev the custom 's attent becaus in thi way there are more possibl that the costum buy the product . there are some person that studi for a lot of year to learn the rule of market and to learn the right way to achiev their costum . today , on televis , we can see a lot of beauti advertis . we are often interst and enjoi from they , but when we buy thi product in a supermarket often we are not so happi for our purchas . i think that often the advertis that i see on televis are realli marvel becaus they captur my attent . for exampl next week i saw the advertis of barilla , a famou firm that product some type of pasta , and i thought that thi is made as a littl film . it 's beauti becaus it talk about the life , the way that children have to see the world and the love that is between a mother and her babi , through all of thi the advertis speak also of a new type of pasta call `` piccolini '' . i think that thi is a beauti advertis and each time that i watch it on tv i realli want to buy the product . few day after to have sought thi advertis i have eat thi type of pasta and i understood that it is not so good as i believ , infact i prefer so much the normal type of barilla 's pasta . therefor i say that often most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are as for exampl i can understand in tha case of pasta .
