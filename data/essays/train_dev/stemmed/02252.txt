throughout our educ life , we have been subject of differ kind of teach style . some teacher teach through make the student learn the fact , while other tri to make student understand the rational behind the fact . also \ , no matter what the teach style of the instructor is , some student focu on understand the idea while other prefer to learn the fact . in my opinion , a student should first tri to understand the idea and concept rather than learn the fact , becaus idea help student build a vision , they are more implement and they are easier to keep in mind . first of all , when a student understand a new concept , it add to that individu ' vision . everi concept or idea you understand make you a person with a larger view of life . it will help you see daili event see in a differ way . howev , if you onli learn the fact , they will be minor memori in your brain ; they wo n't help you built your person experi quota . for exampl , when i learn about some concept of behavior in my ` organiz behavior ' class , my perspect of look to my everyday relat have chang enorm . second , onc an individu understand a concept or an idea , that will be implement to everi situat she/h will face in the futur . while that individu is tri to make a decis on someth , that concept will automat come to his/her mind thu help with the solut . for exampl , at enginn colleg , i learn the concept of ` muda ' which is a japon word for loss . if our professor onli taught it by a specif fact say that you should elimin ani extra loss in a specif machin , then that would be too narrow . howev , she taught us the concep so i could implement it to my light at home . forget your light turn on while you are not in the room casu muda wh'ch is a loss that can be elimin . lastli , concept and idea that are understood well are easier to keep in mind wherea specif fact memor are harder to rememb after a certain period of time . i rememb read in amn articl that you forget 75 % of the thing you memor in the first 24 hour and 90 % percent in the second day . therefor , the fact learn wo n't be with you for a long time ; howev , the idea that you manag to understand will stay with you for a lifetim . as a conclus , i definit agre with the statement suggest that student ' understand of idea is more crucial than their learn of fact . student should focu on understand the concept becaus the idea will be more perman , they will be more applic and they will help them creat better view of life .
