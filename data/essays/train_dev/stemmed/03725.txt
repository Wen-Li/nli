both young and old peopl could enjoy life . it entir depend on the individu . thi can be better describ by explain the term ` joy ' and ` happi ' . the chief reason for my view is that the way peopl enjoy their life entir depend on the way they perciev happi . some peopl tend to experi happi even at their bad time . we see defens personnel of a countri show a lot of pride when they loos their live in a war . thi is unusu in the case of other individu . the other reason for my view is that joy and sorrow are part and parcel of the life , and one ha to encount these two situat in a happi way . we see great sport person on the televis who , at worst of their time on the field tend to carri a smile on their face . some of them , win match even out of such situat . the reason be play the sport in the true spirit by understand the complex of the game . other might argu that the way peopl enjoy their life is influenc by mani factor such as their econom statu , freedom and liberti . i.e in make their decis , ambienc , health statu etc . but the point i emphas in my view is that one can not have all the mention factor which are materialist . everi individu lack someth . in sum , i concur that peopl who learn to get satisfi with what they have and who do n't obsess on what they lack tend to enjoy their life more . it is not the age factor ( . i.e young or old ) , but , it is the attitud of the peopl which determin how much they enjoy their life .
