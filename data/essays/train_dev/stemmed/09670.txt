i am agre with the statem that most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are . to support my opinion i have a seri reason . i think that the present of a product is the most particular advertis . you imagin a person that go to buy a product and that at the supermarket he ha in hi front two product that are the same but they are differ seal . of cours a person will chose the product with the most beauti packet even if the qualiti of the two product are the same . thi is an exampl to demostr how our idea about a product can be influenc by simpl factor . i think that televis is the most import advertis that doe to seem a product much better than it realli is . it is incred how televis influenc the think of the peopl about a product . i have mani friend that state that they purchas onli product that they view at the tv . they think that if a product is merchandis at the tv there is a good reason . thi is true in some case but it is complet fals in other . i think that it is necessari to valuat a product in all it characterist and onli after that to judg it qualiti . howev peopl have not time and in some case the knowledg to do all thi work to valuat a product . so they buy the product that usual view at the televis . enterpris do their intererst and out of dubt thi is correct to merchandis a product . so enterpris do their game but custom would do attent at the real qualiti of a product .
