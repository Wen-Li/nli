`` old is gold '' goe a famou quot . i disagre with the statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . young peopl are alway busi with someth or the other , like complet assign , head for meet etc etc . where as the older peopl , they complet everi thing and now relax . for them there are no assign to be finish or meet to be attend . for exampl let consid a young man and an old man . we will consid some of their daili routin . young man need to wake up earli like 5.00am in the morn go for a gym or jog to maintain hi bodi . he should again rush to hi home as he must get readi to attend hi offic or univers . it a tight schedul . where as an old man , he can wake up whenev he want , can go for a walk whenev he want and can return leisur . so who is enjoy life ? old man . now we will consid and old woman and a young woman . young woman. , she must also wake up earli to go for a jog or a walk to remain fit and return to home quickli as she must go for an univers or offic , ofcours there is an except for housew but if the housew have children then again she is respons for the child 's upbring . on the other hand the older woman can wake up whenev she want and do whatev she want as she ha lot of time with her . some woman enjoy cook so the old woman can tri new dish or she can write peom do whatev she want . so i strongli feel that older peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl . younger peopl are alway associ with more respons than older peopl , build up their career etc etc .
