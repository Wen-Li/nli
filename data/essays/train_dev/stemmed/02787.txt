on a personn account , i think that everyon should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . accord to me , special in one specif subject is extrem danger and could undermin the way our societi work . firstli , i assum that be special in a particular academ subject is most harm to your intellectu skill and the way you think . when you are be taught about a particular subject , you not onli learn fact , theori or histor event but you also learn a way of think . for instanc , learn mathemat will help you develop a ration process of think , nonetheless you will not improv your human relat by resolv equat . thi could explain whi some engin , with a scientifc cultur background , find difficult to evolv in compani . secondli , i think that in our develop societi it ha becom imposs to remain special throughout you entir life . imagin an artist , she ha never taken ani cours but artist one . she found a galeri to expos and sell her work , how will she be abl to make it if she ha never learnt account or market method ? she will certainli go on bankrupt in a few month . had she follow manag cours , she would have made her galleri flourish . i recogn that societi still need veri special peopl . what make thing work ha becom so complex that you can not hope to succeed if you do not have deep and acur knowledg . howev , extend thi special to everyon could jeopard our societi . if peopl did not share the same knowledeg and the same cultur background , they could no longer support themselv and live togeth . knowledg creat bound within peopl and should alway be share . in conclus , i assum that knowledg is a preciou gift , you have a right to protect it and share it . by endors broad academ knowledg , you have a clearer acount about peopl and societi , and will be more use that if you are too special .
