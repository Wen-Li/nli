i disagre wit the statement . i do not think there will be fewer car than now at least in twenti year . i would say that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in fifti year . now the earth is get warm , which doe not effect in good way for neither creatur includ human be nor plant , for instanc , forest . thi thing call gloval warm are consid that it will melt gracier around polar region . it caus the increas of the surfac of the sea . mani peopl would have to move to somewher higher altitud . also the warm would caus skin cancer . becaus of realli strong x-lay . some peopl even these day have possibl to get skin cancer , but if it get much hotter and stronger x-lay more peopl would get it . one of the method to solv the problem or allevi the matter , we should decreas the emitt of carbon dioxid from gase of car . peopl are actual tri to do that , but it is realli hard to make it in a coupl of decad . first of all , peopl in all of the world need to pay attent and focu on do that . i do not think everyon would pay attent about it till it becom obviou that the earth face to real danger . moerov , not all peopl , but also all countri , govern need to work on it with citizen . then they need to work on it togeth . there is anoth reason that i disagre with the statement . mani more kind of car are invent and made recent such as car with new function . if product keep creat car , the number of car would not be chang . i think it would rather increas the number of car . more new technolog such as car we have , more problem we have in the futur . decreas number of car is pretti hard so that i do not agre with the statement .
