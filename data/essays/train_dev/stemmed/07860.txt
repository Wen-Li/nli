i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i believ that there is no requir of an age for peopl to enjoy their life . i do not claim that young peopl do not enjoy their life , instead older peopl do too . those who support thi statement would say that when peopl get old , their enthusiasm die and due to old age health problem set in . but i would say that onc we are old and free from the daili work schedul we actual get time for ourselv , your famili , and our friend . it give us the time to pursu our hobbi or passion which we could not attend to when we are busi earn money . we enjoy our grandchildren more than we might have enjoy our children . we have the time to take care of our health , which we probabl neglect when we were young and busi with work . we are more matur and more toler due to our experi , and thing do n't affect us as much as they did when we were not so understand in our youth . we enjoy our hard earn money after work dure all our youth . we have the time to go for holiday with famili and see the world which we did n't see earlier due to lack of time . in youth due to lack of time we miss out on a lot of thing which we can come back to later in our old age . in our youth , we are immatur and thing that we enjoy are more materialist . wherea , in our old age , have known the world and becom wiser we know that true happi lie in be a good human and be content with what we have . old age bring with it , a lot of good thing besid a few bad one , of cours . but be old doe not mean that one can not enjoy it . there is rare a time in your life when you are fulli content with the way it is go and when all is actual well . it is all about the attitud that one should adopt to enjoy life not the age one ha . old peopl enjoy life as much , mayb more , than young peopl .
