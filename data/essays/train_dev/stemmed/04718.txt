there are mani movi about the futur life which doe not contain a type of transport with car . it is dispuat how much they are reflect correctli . but there are sever reason matter which mean modern car wo n't live forev . i meant that car which run by petrolian by express of ` modern car ' . the biggest signatur modern car have to evolut is lack amount of petrol all around world in near futur . becaus , oil reserv are decreas speedli . the main factor in innov of modern machin wo n't be enough for futur by today 's consum amount . but there are anoth option to put in place of petrolian energi sourc like water or ani other materi which can be ransform into electr energi . so car ' fuel type will be last , even it is chang now . so , in my opinion it wo n't be the main reason for there will be fewer car in the world . as a second reason for there will be fewer car in the world is huge improv in scienc knowledg and technolog . technolog will make car unnecessari or non prefer transportatioan vehicl or devic . accord to thi approach , there will be altern transpor type for car , like molecular transport center or fli object ( fli car ) . improv in scienc and technolog obvious show us there is no possibl to succeed the molecular transport with today 's knowledg . as a reason we do n't have a technolog which transform materi to photon and trasform photon to materi . in addit to thi , there are mani research in modern physic which have to be accomplish for knowledg about transform photon . in addit to thi , we have never seen a fli car except jetson ' . as a result , i do n't agre with decreas in number of car in near futur . becaus our histor experi show that human be is the most adapt creatur in the worl . so if we wo n't have enough petrolian ' we will find anoth sourc .
