everi year , million of travel , everywher in the world travel . from a rich busi man take hi wife on vacat to a kid and hi bundl in a hurri to explor the planet . a trip in an unknown locat need to be prepar obvious . .. and a tour guid is alway readi to take the group to visit the local wonder . but is it the best way to travel ? i personnali disagre with thi statement , i think it depriv us from the spontan and adventur aspect of a trip . when i travel , usual to unknow countri with my friend and famili , it is of cours to have a good time and see odd sight that i may not have the chanc to see again . but mostli i like the feel of freedom that i get : i can go anywher anytim . but be led by a travel guid kind of take that aspect away : follow an exact map and program of the visit . .. and mani time the guid is n't a person guid , for that you have to follow other to see thing that you did n't even want to see in the first place . a person experi : dure a guid tour of pari , few year back , i wa stuck ( so to speek ) in a art exhibit that i did not plan to attend . but sinc i had no car , and no money for a cab . .. i wa oblig to stay with the group , be bore out of my mind . more then that , of cours stay in a nice hotel with a minibar full of drink is nice , but i also love backpack : go from place to place without a perfectli plan trip , stay at hostel , without the feel that i have to follow the map exactli as plan . in that case be led by a tour guid would be deni the whole definit of adventur exit backpack . to conclud , i would like to say that follow a group led by a tour guid is a great way to explor the citi , you get to see all the import sight , but it might not be fit for some peopl such as me who enjoy adrenalin boost .
