i do not agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i base my belief on a number of reason . first of all young person ' most import duti is to concentr on school . they should be abl to focu complet on their studi rather then be concern with what they can do for hi commun . if they fail in school they would later becom a problem for their commun becaus tehri would have to reli on public benefit in order to surviv . likewis i believ young person should be abl to spend some of histtheir free time with ativ that are distract from school and help to relax instead of invest that time into help the commun . to be success they need opportunti to relax from their school work . so for exampl young peopl should be given time to do sport or other distract activ instead of forc them to invest their preciou free time into commun work . beyond that i think young peopl nowaday have certain duti at home , too . rune a famili is not just the parent ' task but also requir the children ' help . thu they have anoth import duti to fulfil . also , happi famili that do not reli on commun support for exampl becaus it member are abl to run their everyday life do not reli on the communti 's help . so young peopl give import time to their commun as they help run their famili . in the end i can not support the statement that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun becaus they have other duti like school that need to be fulfil in the first place . howev , by help at home and do sport they contribut to a healthi commun . thi way they give preciou time to help their commun .
