is it better to learn mani academ subject or to limit oneself to a specif one ? in my opinion , there is no true answer to thi question . a young student who doe not have a clue about hi futur job will need to get broad knowledg to make up hi mind . contrari to him , a student who ha alway known that he want to becom a scientist for instanc will have to attend special class . first , i think that most student who arriv in univers do not know exactli what job they want to do , so they need to attend gener class . inde , they often expect univers class to help them make a choic of carreer . in thi case , i am convinc that get a broad knowledg through differ academ subject is well adapt sinc it give student the time and the inform to make a relev choic for their futur . in like manner , gener class are an asset sinc they provid student with the necessari base of gener knowledg . a signific evid is that a student who want to work on the stock market - which is a pretti specif and technic field - will have to attend account class to know how the account of a firm work . likewis , a student who is plan to set up hi own busi will need to have a clear view on the ground like market , law , financ , manag and the like . second , when a student is total convinc that he will do one specif job in the futur , i think that studi one specif subject can be more strateg . inde , to becom effici in one kind of technic job , you need to get specif knowledg by attend a specif class . for instanc a student who want to becom a dentist will have to do hard studi to be abl to exercis thi job . in order for him not to wast time and to go straight to the point , he will need to learn subject taught in one specif class . all in all , it depend on the carreer you want to have .
