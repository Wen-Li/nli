some peopl will like to understand the idea and concept while some peopl will learn it from the fact they experienc . but i agre with that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept rather than they learn fact becaus if they understand the concept of the particular they can face the fact confid . that is if you understand a problem and the concept behind that problem then u can understand the type of problem and you can think an idea for the problem and you can solv the problem when you realli face it with much better way than you face it directli as you have never face that situat befor that time . for exampl , in the studi of medicin whi to teach about how to deal with patient and how to recogn the diseas by readig book first than go to the hospit and examin the patient , it is becaus we need basic theorit knowledg first to face ani situat first we should know how the patient will be then we should know how to recogn the diseas of the patient then we can eamin the patient about the diseas he is suffer with but we can not go to the directli to the doctor room with out ani knowledg about that and go and ask the person about their symptom of uneasy , as if they say also we do n't know the diseas first to give medicin . it is also import to learn from fact but befor that we should learn some what from concept and idea about the thing that wa been done by the peopl befor us that how they face the situat for that instanc if it is well we also follow the same way of approach otherwis we will think of the better way how to solv the same thing in a more effect way when we face such a type of situat it not onli in the field i mention abov but it is also applic in all field of work and thi is mainli for student as they learn thing newli so gain more theoritical knowledg for student is better than learn it from fact .
