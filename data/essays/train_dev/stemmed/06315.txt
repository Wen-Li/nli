i do think , that success peopl are tend to take risk and tri new thing . if one is success in work , then he or she get work faster and more effect done than other . what doe thi one do with the remain time , while the other are still work ? first the one would tri to redo work to do it in a better way of qualiti . second he would tend to do differ thing like gather with collegu or flirt with a woman . in thi case he would loos the enhanc of flirt or gather , becaus it would not be , what he is satisfi by . third thing that would happen , is one would tend back to hi work and do what he is pay for . evalu hi work would lift him up in a posit abov hi collegu and in conclus the one would be miscredit . at the end he would spend at least a part of hi time in do new thing and in take risk . in my exampl , a person is automat brought up to tri new thing and to take risk , becaus he is better than the other . it could be a member of a compani . think about a more daili term make the statement common . everywher in the world peopl tend to do thing that make them differ to other peopl . if you take a group of children for exampl , that are play with a doll , then after a while of be involv , one of them leav the group in the mean of play with a ball . ther is and there will alway be one out of a group , who is leav or who is go to take a risk . almost everyon in societi ha got a special thing of do . peopl are bunge jump or are hold on to a farm with ten hors although it a lot of work to do . these are suppos to be exampl of peopl privaci . they all tri someth riski in time , when they start with thi special kind of sport or privat activ . probabl there have been rel in ani of thi exampl , that were wonder about the risk part of the activ .
