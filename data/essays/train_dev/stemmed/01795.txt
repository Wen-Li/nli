my grandmoth often have mention like thi . `` young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their commun . absolut , you are not an except . '' i agre the statement my grandmoth becaus of the follow reason . first of all , young peopl like to hang out themselv . in other word , they do not share their think and behavior their commun and do not spend time their commun . let 's recal `` friend '' , the most famou sitcom in the world which there are three women and three guy . dure their 20 's and 30 's , they just hang out themselv . i do not see an episod which abov charact have spent the time with their commun . secondli , young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their commun becaus they think cyber communit more valuabl than real their commun . in my case , i am an activ member of korea volunt teach program for kid . but i do not know my neighborhood and their children . owe to technolog develop and novic , young peopl are familiar with global issu and internet world and their interest are not limit in thier commun . lastli , i would like say that commun it self becom more isol and individu . a hundr year ago , peopl depend on each other and they were a huge famili . but , there are no depend , cooper , respect for senior and origin tradit in modern societi . to sum up , i agre with the statement that young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their commun for these reaseon ; they do not like spend the time with their commun , they are familiar with cyber commin than their neighbor and modern societi is differer from past societi .
