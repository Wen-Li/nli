i agre with the satement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . there are some reason for my opinion . firstli , young peopl are much more energet than old peopl . so , young peopl can travel around and do a lot of activ , and thse make a life more enjoy . there is my person experi to spport thi idea . my famili onc plane to visit new zealnd with my grand-moth . she wa excit to go . howev , as the depatur came closer , she stare to hesit to go becaus she thought it would be stress for her own health . final . she decid not to come . it wa veri shock for us becaus we had plane all the trip with her . even if she could had come , i guess she could not have walk around the place and enjoy the trip so much compar to us sinc she is no longer stong enough to do so . thi experi made up my idea that old peopl are not abl to see mani place and do mani kind of activ . secondli , sinc young peopl gener have more curios , the world could be more excit to young peopl . as a man grow up , he learn a lot and becom wise . of cors thi is a good thing . howev , thi mean that hi desir to know is somehow fullfil . on the other hand , young peopl are still new to the world , and there are mani thing to learn and tri . it is true that mani old peopl are still curiou and tri mani new thing , but what i want to emphas here is that old peopl tend to be inact and do not have much desir compar to young peopl . thirdli , i think young peopl have more hope in the futur . for exampl , a boy dream to be a superman or a movi star . hi mind is fill with hope and enjoy . he may enjoy hi life chose hi futur . same thing can be said to elder young peopl , not to say superman , but perhap a doctor . after their life to reach to a last decad , there would be less hope for the futur . therefor , the life is more enjoy for young peopl . in conclus , i think young can enjou life more than old .
