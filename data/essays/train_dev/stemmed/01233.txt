i do not agre with the statement . i think that one first need to special in someth . then , after thi is achiev , one can interchang idea with peopl who have other special . of cours i do believ that while sepeci in some subjet , one ha to keep in mind which is the place of the subjet among the rest of the other subject . and in thi sens i think it is veri import to have a broad knowledg of subject . of cours thi knowledg will not be deep , but just an idea of the import issu of each area . i think that in the last 50 year scientif knowledg ha grown in such a way that it is imposs for anybodi to domin all the branch of scienc . thi may could have happend in the past , where the entir human knowledg wa smaller . but thi is no longer the case . so i think it is not sensibl to intend to have a full and deep knowledg of all or mani subject . anoth relat point is the labor issu . i think that someon who ha special will have greater job opportun than someon who ha a broad knowledg but ha no specif special . at least when i read for job opportunit , all job propos ask for specif proffess or special . i also realiz thi with my friend . those who have gotten the better job are those who have special in someth .
