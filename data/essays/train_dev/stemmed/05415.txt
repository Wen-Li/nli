i do n't agre with the idea that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . we watch tv , listen to the radio , or watch internet everyday and while we watch tv program , listen to radio program , or watch internet websit , we often see or hear numer differ commerci that explain about numeour kind of product that the compani want to sell to us . although some advertis are realli exaggerta and give fals inform , i think most advertis provid us with correct inform . the advertis we often see dure the commerci break on tv is the car advertis . when it come to a car advertisemt , it show us the outsid and the insid look of the car and provid us with the engin inform , safeti inform or warranti inform . there is no way for the car compani to exagger or lie about their car . becaus for exampl , if they lie about their car 's safeti , they can easili get su or prosecut by the govern . there are also electron wheel chair commerci too . the commerci tell us that teh electron chair is safe , use for elderli peopl and also ha warranti . now , is there ani way for the compani to exagger or give flase inform about the wheel chair . absolut , no . commerici of the comapni that sell mechan product are mostli not exagerrer and therefor , consum can reli on them . also about pill for headach . those pill just work fine and they are not exagger . if they do n't work , the comapni would not be abl to sell their product in the first place becaus the govern check their product befor they sell . therefor , i do n't think that most comerci make product seem much better than they realli are .
