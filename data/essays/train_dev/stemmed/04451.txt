i will be agre with the specifi point . as i know student grap the idea and concept veri faster by interact learn then expos to the fact . as i think the experi with the concept make him to understand it clearli , while fact are the written statement which often make the student obcur or uncear with basic idea . i will like to put forward some reason to clear the view . understand the idea and the concept behind the idea by the experiec of the student make him alert in futur when he expos to the same situat . while idea and concept can be made clear by demonstr such as visual effect or audio effect . one of the exampl i will like to make , if a person is prone to car part such as cluch , break , accelar , engin and given a demonstr over it . he will be confid about to drive it and will make him drive smoothli . and thi basic idea or concept he will never forgot if ani difficult situat aris in furtur regard car . for some if the undestand the concept veri counsious they might tackel the difficult situat uncounsi also as they are previous prone to it . while the fact are the given statement which are not explanatori , which leav a neg or posit remark over a person . infact he might be not clear of the fact given . which lead to mislead and aslo loos of some confid over it . exampl over it is , a given satement of fact about the car part over break , cluch , accelar or engin will not make him or put him in to reliabl to drive a car whiout given demonstr of it . and their is chanc of mislead or damag a car . thu for the student who are learn much of new thing should requir a basic concept veri clear so they can easili and confient approach the test and also get higher grade . while if student are been told to refer the librari or other materi for the test without give a explanatori lectur over topic may often confus them and result will not be expectori . thu undestand the idea and the concept behind idea will leav student confidenti to approach .
