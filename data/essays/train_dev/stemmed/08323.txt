i disagre with the previou exampl becaus i do not consid one is option is better from the other . i believ that concept or idea are as much import as it is to learn fact . of cours there exist a differ weight of thi concept depend on the field the person is studi , work on or leav in . but in gener i consid concept give the knowledg about a certain topic and give the opportun to the individu to form a person point of view of someth , then after the individu creat hi or her own perspect he or she could learn fact and later on review them and anal wich fact are in favor or against it individu perpect , and gener a conclus on what postur should take ; chang the person perspect about someth or keep it . also it doe not exist a theori that stablish what to learn first concept or fact , it could be better for a person to fisrt have knowledg about some fact and then revis the concept of the same topic . but for other peopl shoul be better to particip in the learn process in the opppossit way . as an exampl we can see peopl that did not have the opportun to studi but they can have a good perform on differ kind of job , just by know first the fact and then review the theori to solv the problem . for exambl a lot of mechaninc , special in mexico , doe not ha a formal studi format but they know where can be the solut to a certain problem and then get interest in know the concept . in recent year the combin of both statement is becom the best way to succeed in live . ust ask how mani univers includ in their program a 50 % practic cours and 50 % theoret cours . and look for job that ask for expiri and ahigh univers degre .
