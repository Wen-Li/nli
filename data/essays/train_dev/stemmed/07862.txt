as a mater of fact , the issu of whether there will be fewer car than there are today is a complex one , requir subject judgment . differ peopl hold differ view due to their distinct background . therefor , there are no easi or certain answer to the question and final answer would reli on my own experiencr and person . i do agre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in the follow discuss , i would develop my poin of view and constitut aspect of detail as suffici as possibl . in the first place , the most import reason that i can not ignor is that nowaday , peopl have realiz that the car will produc serious air pollut and thi situat ha becam a big issu around the world . to illustr , it is appar that air pollut ha rai the attent of the global citizen and the most effect way to solut thi problem is to decreas car in use . in the second place , anoth reason for my statement is that the oil price would be more expens twenti year than today . the amount of the oil will decreas but the demand of the oil will remain the same even increas . therefor , there will be ferwer car in use becaus onli a veri small portion of peopl who might be veri rich can afford the price . last but not least , i believ that peopl will use mrt as their transport in the futur becaus mrt is not onli conveni but also in a reason price that everyon can afford it . therefor , there will be no need to buy a car as transport . to sum up , the air pollut caus by car and high price of oil made me agre with the statement that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today .
