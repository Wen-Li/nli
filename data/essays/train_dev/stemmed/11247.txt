the statement advoc that have broad knowledg of mani acadm subject is better than have specil on one . howev , in my opininon , the question can not have a binari answer . there could be situat when a broad knowledg of all concern subject is realli need . on the other hand , in some case specil os more import . in some case , one might just need particular skillset and other skill might not be of much use . for exampl , an mba student who is ame to becom an invest banker need not be strong in all the manag subject , but he/sh realli need to be special in fiannc . on the other hand , sometim job requir a good overal understand of all relat topic . continu on the last exampl , if the same mba student want to be a genral manag in a firm , he/sh should have a broad knowledg of all the manag practic and subject . in thi case , specil can not be of much use . there could be case when secil is need ` on demand ' . onc one might be work in some area , and sfter some time he/sh might need other skill . in such case one need to have good knowledg of all relat subject . with a solid foundat like thi , one can gain specil skill easili if need and thi wopuld not requir seper acadm specil . for exampl , so , in my opinion , while one must have some knowledg of all the concern area he/sh is suppos to work on , whether specil is requir depend on specif case . sometim , it better to be master of one , while sometim be jack of all trade might be more use .
