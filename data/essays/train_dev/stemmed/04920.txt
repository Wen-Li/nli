throughtout high school , student learn sever differ academ subject , one which some do like or dislik . for a fact , it could be said that most student do not like all the academ class they must take in high school . howev , after graduat for high school , there is a wide opportun for student to enter a more specif area of studi , where they will be abl to choos to do someth the realli like , and not becaus it is a requir . both part of learn , whether it is broad or specif , are both part of the process or learn . nevertheless , if i were to comment on whether have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to special in one specif subjet i 'd say that be special in one specif subject is better becaus you know what you want and like to know , you can do what you want to do , and help other in what you know the best . be special in a specif subject doe not come without have the broad knowledg of mani academ subject , but inde , it is what lead a person into do what they realli want to do . as person experi , in high school , mani student hate either one or more subject that they rather not take probabl becaus they do n't understand , or just dont like do it . howev , you do get a sens of what everi academ subject involv , and you can get an idea of what you like and what not . know that , for exampl , you like math , you will go to colleg , to studi someth involv math , which besid be the area you like , will encourag you to work even serious becaus now , it is the onli thing you must work for . after go to colleg , you are alreadi veri practic in the area you like and chose to studi for the rest of your life . part from there , know your area , you can find jod in sever differ thing that involv you area , and for the rest fo your life , do someth that you will enjoy do . not like in school , where you did n't enjoy pass some class , and you had bad grade in it , it would be like have good grade in a class that you like and understood . a person would just feel better do someth they truli love . onc , you know do what you like to do , come the import part of specil in one specif subjet , the one of help other in what you know best . specif know , for exampl , about children diseas , you could help so mani peopl , who die endlessli becaus they do not have neither resourc or anyon to help them . have a borad knowledg would also allow you to help , but not as profoundli as you could know specif one subject . eventhough i believ that special in one specif subject is better than have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , i believ that we could n't specifi in a subject we love without have the knowledg of mani subject . if we would n't know what biolog is , how can we dislik it , or how can we know if that is what we like . like i said in the beggin , both are a part of learn , it just that one choic , perhap could be describ as go further into achiev higher goal .
