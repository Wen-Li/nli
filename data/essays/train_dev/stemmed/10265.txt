i agre with the statment `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' for mani reason . first you will go with someon who know the place where you are travil at . secon you will get to know more peopl . third , it is more fun to travel with a group . final , you will discov more place with the group . the first reason whi i agre with the statment is becaus you are go to travel with some one who know the place veri will so you will not get lost there where if you went alon you will get lost or even you might face troubl with the peopl if you do not know their trdition . for exampl , i travel to south africa four year ago and i travel with a group of peopl who were from differ counti and the person who were take us in the tour teach us everi thing about that place and teach us what is the best way to commiun with the peopl there . the second reason is that you will get to know more peopl and you might be a friend with someon . for exampl , in my trip to south africa i got aquaint with someon call john . john is my best friend know and after that trip we have gone to more that three countri togeth . the third reason is that travel with peopl is more fun than traevel a lone becaus if you travel in a group you will find someon who speak your languag so you will not fell alon . for instanc , i travel onc befor to indonisia a lone to spend a vacat there . i found the place gloriou , but it wa bore becaus i wa there alon . the last reason is that if you travel with a group you will see most of the thing there where if you travel a lone you will not discov everi thing . in conclus , i prefer to travel with a group guid by aperson than travel a lone for the reason i have mention .
