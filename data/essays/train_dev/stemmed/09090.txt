i am inclin to agre with the statement that the peopl who take risk and tri someth new rather then do what they know make them success . i have certain reason to agress with thi statement which i would discuss later in my essay . i would also like to highlight the fact that take such risk might not get the success in1st attempt , sometim peopl need to attempt multipl time . the main reason for thi my view is that i believ in `` more risk , more gain '' philosophi . if i decid to get into some new business/idea , which nobodi ha tri , i need compart more resourc in term of money , time and effort to purs thi new ventur . there is a chanc that thi new venur could fail , but on the posit note if that business/idea suc , i would have a tremend potentail to make money in thi new busi as i will not have much competit . i will give an exampl of john chamber , ceo of a network compani . thi compani wa tradit in the busi of sell network devic . as it buinsess becam more matur and competit increas , john decid to take some risk and expand into telephoni busi and becam success in thi new busi . thi compani rank as number one in telephoni buinsess . the 2nd reason for my view is that unless i ventur into unknown terrotori i will not know what lie there . as a human , we alway have thi comfort zone which we do not want to leav but there is no guarnte that there is no risk in what we are do today . my brother ha a gift busi and he wa veri comfort in that buinsess . i insist him to tri export busi , though he wa initi reluct but he tri and becam success . in conclus , i believ that risk take is a shirt cut to scuccess which we should tri .
