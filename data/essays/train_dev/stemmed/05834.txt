some peopl may believ that there will be more car in use in futhr , but i disagre . i ca n't imagin that there have enough space and street can be use for more car . first becaus the traffic jam are more and more common in nowaday . so mani car in our countri can not be use effic becaus there are lot of traffic jam in everi street at earli mone 7:00-9:00 , and afternoot 5:30-7:00 . in work hour , i onli need to spent 20 minut to get school from my appart , but it 's taken nearli 90minut in rush hour . it 's a wast of time . a lot of friend of mine told me that , they would not go to buy ani car becaus ther is n't enough road can be use for solv the traffic problem . second , there are more and more pollut made by car . when i wa 6 , i could alway see lot of star in everi even sky . but i can not see them recent , becans the pollut are to heavi to cover the sky . the smoke that seek by the car are make a lot of pullut in the air . and it 's seem so harm to our heathi . third , the price of the oil incress a lot , that made mani peopl did n't want to buy a car . i alwani saw so mani car onli park in the park space that are did n't drive in . and when i ask a owner whi he did n't drive hi car , he told me that , that the money he must spent on oil when he drive hi car for 2 year can buy anoth car . that seem like we must spend as much or more moni we buy the car to buy the oil . taken the abov reason into account , i think in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than today . not onli more car mean more space will be taken , also mean few pollut and lot bebefit for our heathi .
