when it come to the question of whether it is import for student to understand idea and concept or for the student to learn fact , differ peopl might have total differ answer to the question . in my view , it is more import for the student to learn fact . the reason go as fellow . first of all , the fact are about experi . to learn the fact can make the studi more practic . consid that if a student just learn the idea and the concept in hi or her studi , he or she just know what it is becaus the concept told him or her . howev , he or she may not understand how to use it or what it is for to learn such thing . the problem is that they did not relat the idea and concept to fact . they should learn to analysi fact use the learn of concept , make their studi more practic . in addit , it is more usefl for the student to learn fact . as we know , the purpos for peopl to studi idea and concept is to use it and make contribut to our live . our live consist mani of fact , and we need to studi the fact and make them use to us . if we just studi idea and concept , it mean noth to our scocieti . the idea and concept are just the basi of fact . it is ture that we need to learn the idea and concept first and then we can learn and understand the fact better . it is also true that lean idea and concept is the basi thing for us to practic our knowledg . i also admit that idea and concept play import role in human studi . howev , in comparis with the import to fianlli get use to our live , fact is more import . in conclus , base on the reson i discuss abov , even though other may have total differ opinoin with me , i still beliv that fact is more import .
