` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid ' ... i would certainli agre with the statement . travel is a lot of fun and also a good learn experi . if one want to enjoy as well as learn the abouth the histori , cultur and habitat of the place a tour guid would certainli be help . educ oneself about the place prior to visit it by book and the internet is veri help too but have a guid who is local and ha the knowledg is defin better . i feel that in a group with a guid one can have a plan itineari and can organ the trip in a better fashion . if i would be by myself i probabl would get lazi most morn and wast time get around . by be in a group i would probabl use my time and money in a more effici way . for me even while im travel go by a schedul realli help . be by oneself i feel one wast lot of time first collect the inform and then decid where and when to go . with a tour guid one is in better hand to travel and sight see compar to one own . by have a tour guid one can learn more . i feel that i rememb more after see a thing / place and listen about it rather than just read about it . a local guid might have some stori to tell about the place which one may not find in ani of the book . person for me a group of peopl is more fun to go out with . i strongli agre with the statement - ` more the merrier ' . travel , sing , danc and eat out could be more fun for me with more peopl around rather than be by myself . go to a new place might be intimid at first but be in a group would just make me feel at home all the time . i love make new friend and go out in a group also help cultiv new relationship and friend . henc i would strongli recommend anyon to travel in a group rather than be on one own .
