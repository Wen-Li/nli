sinc a long time at univers and elsewher a discuss is go on on how the educ of peopl should be organ . there are basic two differ way which have an import effect on the qualiti of peopl 's later way of work : you can build your educ on a veri wide basi and tri to collect knowledg of as mani academ subject as possibl . or you can do it the other way round : you can special on one specif subject and tri to get as good as possibl in it . at first we 'll have a look at the method to tri to gain a broad knowledg of a varieti of academ subject . with thi strategi you are abl to see how thing are connect to each other , in which way they work togeth or influenc each other . thi later make it unlik to you to produc product that work fine in one special way but do not fit the need of a larg number of custom . when develop product you will have an eye on each group of custom , on the compani aim , on the natur , and so on . howev , a big problem of the previou mention strategi is the follow : if you are good at practic everyth you can not do veri well at anyth . so , in fact , you have to gain a special knowledg of the topic that is most interest to you . in thi way you should be abl to achiev veri good or even outstand result . thi can bring you , your compani , or sometim even human one step further . in my opinion the best solut lie in the middl of those extrem . special is good becaus you can not perform veri well if you do not have in depth knowledg . on the other hand , if you just have knowleg on one specif topic , you can not see in what way your decis influenc other area . so you should special on one subject and tri to get basic knowledg on other topic , at least on topic relat to your subject .
