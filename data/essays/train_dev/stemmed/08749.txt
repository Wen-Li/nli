veri hard to understand mani fact , if it is not relat by idea & concept & exampl . .. i think both attach to each other cose with out the the fact their is no idea . for exampl in the war , whi the war doe not stop . it is been sinc the old centari we have war , and everyon know the bad result of thw war : hungy , pauvereti , too much peopl go away , frit , peopl with psycholog problem , kid who lost there parent , famili who lost there own home . .. but for my opinion the student understand all the idea and concept , in the histori about all the war , dure all the histori , but if they can learn from the fact thi will not happen again . anoth exampl more closer . when the teacher explain about a psychologi problem at class if he say the fact like : peopl still they have psychologi problem , everi student will wonder whi ? when he explain that mani peopl who have emot hungr ( their mother didnt realli offer to much let say love to there kid ) and didnt teach her kid the right and wrong . thi peopl love to still not becaus they need it , but sometim to satisf there emotionel . in a busniss class when the proffessour said `` the costmer alway right '' .when he conyinu explain hi ida we understand what he mean : the busniss with out custom doe n't work . it doe n't matter the compani what she think , but the custom who consum thi product . for exampl when the constumm is been treat good he will be your door to anoth customm , ( friend , neighbour , cousin , famili . .. ) . but if he is not satisf he will tell everyon and it will be a veri bad reput . everywher not onli at class even at home with our kid , famili i think it hard to learn fact if their no idea and concept to understand .
