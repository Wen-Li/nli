i agre with thi statement . the peopl who want to be success must do someth special . you ca n't just stay there and keep the thing you have alreadi known . the most import thing for a success peopl is creativ , you must do someth that nobodi did it befor . for exampl , at the earli of the nation basketbal assosi ( nba ) , that time , everi plyer all shoot without the jump , i do n't know whi they did n't shoot with the jump , mayb just becaus nobodi thought about it , they all just stay there in that littl circl . then on day , somebodi suddenli thought about it , whi we ca n't shoot with jump ? if we jump , it hlep to close the hoop , and it also help improv the shoot point , it 's harder to be block . so , thi person began to practic the jump shoot , and then he becam a veri good basketbal player that time . thi is the stori that realli easi to see , whi success peopl tri new thing and take risk than onli do what they alreadi know . that player could just practic no jump shoot and becam a good player , but he tri someth new , and he chang basketbal histori . i think `` tri new thing '' is a veri import skill for a success person , nobodi can be success without thi skill . when you learn someth , you just stay where you are , do n't go to blaze a new area , you are still just same as other peopl , you will never be success . tri do someth new is not that easi , when all the peopl do same thing , onli yourself against them or do someth differ , sometim you will ask yourself are you do the right thing ? but it must cost you someth to be success , you must do someth differ so you can be success , do n't be normal as them , tri do someth new .
