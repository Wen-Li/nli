at thi day , mani peopl think that it is the best way to travel in a group with a tour guid . in my opinion , it is better to travel alon becaus you can do what you want to do and you appreci more your visit . i prefer choos what i want to do becaus i do not like do someth when i do not want to do thi thing . for exampl , if i am tire i must follow the tour guid to visit a monument . when i wa in cuba , i visit a lot of citi and monument alon . i wa happi becaus i do what i want . if one day i were tire , i would stay in the hotel and took the time to relax . with a group , you can be independ and i am independ . when you visit a countri you appreci more your visit when you are alon . for exampl , when i go to a museum i prefer to visit it alon becaus i am not with mani peopl . i can move if i want , i can stay a long time to see a paint . and if i want to stay just one second to see a paint , i can . when i visit the louvr , i wa happi to be alon becaus i could stay one hour to see one paint and by contrari , i could stay thirti second in front of anoth . you can have a lot of advantag to travel with a group ; but in realiti , i prefer stay alon when i visit a countri or a citi . i am an independ girl , and i do not like be with a group .
