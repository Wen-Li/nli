i 'm agre with thi statement becaus in the futur there would be new type of transport . i also think thi becaus the the oil someday will finish , and the oil will be onli for the rich . but let me explain my reason point by point . the first point and the main one for me , is that car are not veri safeti , even nowaday with the new intellig car . onli in my countri there are 45.000 death each year . thi is a big number of death , so that whi i think there are a lot of peopl work in new type of transport . and i imagin you ask your self whi doe thi guy know that inform , i know thi inform becaus in spain mani famili suffer the consecu of thi type of accid . anoth import point is that the oil someday will finish , but i think we do n't have to wait until that day , i say thi becaus in europ the price of the oil is veri veri expens , mani peopl ca n't pay it . as i read the other day in a prestigi newspap there are a lot of compani work in altern type of oil . thi is someth that i do n't know too much , so let keep it for the scientist . final i wanna express my conclus , and it 's that one of the gratest invent of the human bean in a few year will finish . i do n't want to look like a dramat person but the onli thing that car give us are problem , for exampl mani peopl suffer stress becaus the traffic jam . but on the other hand car also help us now the trip are more shorter than befor , but thi is onli a littl advanteg . there are more disadvanteg .
