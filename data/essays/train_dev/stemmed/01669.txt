i 'm not sure that in twenti yer there will be fewer car in use then there are today . probabl mani nation , for exampl china and india , will increas their number of car becaus today in that state not mani peopl have a car and mani person use the bike or go on their foot . but these nation now is work so much that i think that probabl soon more peopl than now will have the money to choos and to buy a car . and we have to rememb that in asia there are more than one billion of person ( onli in china there are now 1 , 2 billion of abit ) ! in europ ( expeci in the west europ ) and america ( natur the north of america ) , instead , we are in a differ situat : we have mani car and the traffic in our citi is veri strong and danger for our life . mani famili ha two or three car and the italian spend mani time in their car : all day there are much traffic in all the most import street of the countri . mayb it will be better if mani italian leav their car at home , so they would need of onli a car for famili , there would n't be the smog ( even if thi would be a myracl ) and mani peopl would be more happi . sure our natur and ambient would be more happi . but the situat of east europ is similar to china 's one ; that part of europ is poor and i think that in futur that state will becam richer than now , so mani other peopl will buy a new car . so i think that thi problem ha n't a solut : probabl in twenti year there will be fewer car than today , but probabl there wo n't . onli the time will can solv thi partcular and difficult problem .
