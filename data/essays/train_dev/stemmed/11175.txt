i thi grow popul and devolop technolog , peopl show up with more need everi day . but these need can easili be display in an ostentati way like make the product seem much better than they realli are . even though the consum alreadi now that the product in not go to be a real solut to their question , they easili can get amas by the showi advertis . i believ the best way to sell a product hide under the showi advertis . let say there are to differ componi which are tri to sell their hair loss product . the x compani say that thi product is not onli go to be the permen solut but alsoth costum will be abl to see the result in 2 week , even though it doe not work like that . on the other hand , the y compani just say that the consum will easili see the hair loss problem end in 3 month , after finish the first bottl of that hair solut . also they add that if the buyer would like to see the permen answer they have to use 3 bottl . i believ it is not that hard to decid choos the product that work for you . my answer would have been say ye to the first compani and buy their product which they empys their product under the name of permen solut . with that word group they can easili get the buyer attent , becaus the person who ha the hair loss problem do not want to face with the problem or spend their my on 3 bottl instead of 1 . as buyer we should not believ everi word we hear on commerci . we should be more picki .
