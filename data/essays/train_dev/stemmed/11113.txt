thi statement ha some truth to it , but the level of truth depend on the situaion and stage of life . also , capabl differ from person to anoth . in my opinion , as a child one must be subject to a wide rang of subject and as one grow older he or she will be abl to make life affect choic , one can then chose a specif subject to special in and studi in depth . children are young and naiv , it will be a crime to allow a seven year old to chose whether he want to continu learn mathemat or not . in mani school , student are oblig to take certain subject as part of the curriculum , but as they approach higher level , such as high school , they may be ask to chose whether they would like to continu take a specif subject or not . moreov , by then , the student should atleast have an idea of the field ( s ) he or she would like to special in at univers , and persu a career in that field in the futur . as a child grow older , he or she will come to know hi or her interest , strengh and weak . in most school , onc a student is in high school , he or she will be requir to chose whether to be in the art or scientif section , thi is veri benefici becaus the student will be abl to promot hi time and think to subject he or she is like to persu and major in for the rest of hi or her life . univers is the most import stage of life , here one will be abl and oblig to chose the field of studi he is interest in and is passion about persu a career in . normal , thi will be the final stage of choos a special . thi is whi the statement abov is rel true , but not in all stage of life . and one must be veri care in choos the specif subject to studi .
