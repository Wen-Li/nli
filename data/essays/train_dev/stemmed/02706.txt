i agre with the follow statement that it is import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . when a person want to learn the fact first he ha to have some idea how he can come to the end point . first of all he ha to make clear about the concept he want to includ to reach that destini . for exampl , if we want to do some project to submit to a professor we have to have some dead time to finish , then we have to concentr how we can finish that assign with in the time . first we have to creat some idea like which book we have to refer , how we can present that paper , the order of the paper , we have to show to someon who can give us the some more inform that can be includ , put the paper in clear format and submit the paper . factual inform may be the true inform to learn that befor we have to understand what are the hidden idea and the concept . when we be in a famili everyperson tri to reach a fact so easili about other but befor go to a conclus about that person we have to have some idea about hi behaviour that is how he talk , how he move , how he behav with in the hous , then we have make a concept about that person then atlast give the fact about that person . i conclud my passag by say that everi person , for exampl student should creat an idea about which graduat he want to complet and what cours he is intrest and prepar a concept that what is requir for him to complet the graduat . take some suggest , know how difficult it is and then enter in to fact that he want to end up with that certif of graduat in which he is intrest with joy .
