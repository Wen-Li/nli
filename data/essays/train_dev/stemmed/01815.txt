thi statement point at a veri common and recent devellop way of think . nowaday , peopl tend to believ that all-includ trip led by tour guid are the most inexpens and pleasant way to travel . accord to my travel experi as an '' aventur '' backpack , i will tri to demonstr in which extens , thi unfortunatli too common way of think is veri far from realiti . first of all , it is common sens that the less intermedi you pass by , the cheaper your trip is go to be . consequ , the number 1 rule for a cheap trip is to avoid travel agenc , especi on internet , which practic abus fee . deal directli with airlin compani and hotel or hostel will alway make your trip cheaper sinc , thi way you 're not go to have to pay ani commis to anyon . regard accomod , you can reduc your budget to a veri low price if you feel like stay in a hostel . contrari to what might be thought , mani of them are veri clean and realli cheap . it also ha to be seen as an opportun to meet , share and talk to foreign travel from all over the world . thi is , in my opinion , way more enrich than stay with peopl with whom you share the same cultur in regular three star hotel , sinc you unescap have way less to share . still in my opinion , the tour schedrul , and the unescap uninterest random tourist visit are the main reason whi i 'm totali against all includ trip . if you find yourself in a situat , or a place you do n't like , you 're oblig to handl it , and suffer in silenc , wait for your group to go back to the hotel . as for the guid , he ' s total option sinc lone planet exist .
