in thi era , where it is possibl to underlin an increas of the product , most advertis can make product seem much better than they realli are . thi is a result of a great number of product that the owner of the compani ha to sell to the consum . for thi reason i agre with that statement . i think that , in thi period , everyon who have to sell anythink want to show it in a better way than it realli is . is possibl to find a product that have a veri low price but at the same time it is problabl not a veri good item . now where internet ha increas it import in sell product , all the peopl tri to show them in a fantast state with a beautiful pictur and one veri accur descript . for exampl one year ago i bought a support for mobil phone for the car . when it arriv at home i observ it and i note that wa not well as in the comput . the materi that it wa made wa veri veri bad and an option item , that i bought with the support , did n't arriv at home . it ' s possibl to find a lot of advertis on televis that show all the item in a veri beautiful way and i think that anyon have to pay attent befor buy a particular product . i think is better to buy an item of a brand that is known . in thi way you are sure to buy a good item event if it price could be expens . the most import brand have a great experiec in work and they use all kind of machin or materi they need . in thi capitalist era infact there are mani peopl that open an industri to sell a product . to have a veri low cost they use a materi that is not good . thi is occur for exampl in cina where the price of the product are veri cheap . i had a lot of experi in buy a product that are not good as they are show , for thi reason i suggest to buy a veri famou product !!
