car are the indispans part of our life . i ca n't imagin how life would be if there were n't ani car . they are like the member of our famili . becaus peopl like car even more than it use to be . they are tri to make their car more comfort and beauti sinc they spend so mani time at road . some peopl consid that car wo n't be the part of our life in twenti year becaus the oil reserv of the world is decreas veri rapidli . so mayb onli rich peopl will be use car in the futur . can you imagin thi , mayb there wo n't be traffic jam . and also thi is not a real proof . i think we wil be more depend on car in the futur becaus our life is chang in so mani way . the densiti of popul is consider increas . so these peopl will need car to go somewher . i am total disagre about the idea that we will use less car in twenti year becaus peopl have began to use new sourc instead of petrol such as biodisel and electryc . from my point of view that will help human to save the environ sinc that doe n't give harm to environ like petrol . and also technolgi is still tri to develop new kind of thing to support car to work . what is more , what will the peopl do if there will be fever car . are we go to fli or someth like that . i think what is said about thi is not base on scientif evid becaus we need car and we will drive them at least a hundr year . we can also say that the woman driver are more than in the past and they will be more in the futur than now . so the factori take these kind of thing in to account . nevertheless they do n't seem to stop produc car . to sum up , i believ that car are the part of our life and peopl do n't seem to leav them for a long time . although the bad impact of car to the environ we ca n't disregard how use they are .
