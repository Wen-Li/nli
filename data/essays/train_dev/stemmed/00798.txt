in thenti year from now it doe n't look possibl , in my view , to have fewer car in use in our societi . inde the car market is veri import in countri ' economi . it ha been import almost in the past centuri , but it seem like it 's becom even more import today . the resaon for thi develop is that develop countri , or new develop one are develop their industri . and it 's well known that one of the major sector of the industri is the car industri . therefor more and more car are get built everi day in the world , and they will be in use in our street sooner or latter . for exampl asian countri are becom veri powerful in thi area . we all know brand like toyota , honda . .. and if we pay attent to the car around us we 'll nottic how usual it becom to see peopl with those car . besid thi develop doe n't mean that the other develop countri stop make car . they actuali tri to catch up with those countri and are make new car too . for exampl , we have wolkswagen an bmw in germani , chevrolet , gener motor in the united-st . .. and much more . they are all tri to be more competit so they are all deveop new car and sale more car too . car industri is an import econom area for everi countri today , that 's whi i personali think that a huge amount of car is come , and in twenti year it wo n't be solv at all . but , today we can also see the develop of environement concern . more and more organis are open in order to protect our planet : greenpeac wa the first one but defin not the last one creat . and in my opinion it 's also becom a polit strategi , so me may have a `` solut '' to thi environ damag : a new kind of car that wo n't polut as much . for exampl car use electr . to conclud i would say that econom strategi wo n't let the car industri disapear but they might find new techniqu in order to combin strong economi and protect of our environ .
