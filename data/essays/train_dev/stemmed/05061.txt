i am agre with thi statement . it 's true that most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are . as advertis are use to attract custom and to make the product more popular , the compani would n't lose thi chanlleg to show the best side of their product . sometim , they also give an imag which is not true of their product to custom . thi is an imag which custom desir but not an imag which below to the product . we kow that most compani face to a great competit , there are son mani comapni produc the same product . so compani have to do much effort in order to be more stronger . meanwhil , if there is one comopani have atop some advertis to make it product more attractif , it 's not fair that other compani of the same sector do noth . but should custom be victim of compani ' competit and profit ? no , we are the custom , and we have the right to know the truth . we want to buy the product which we want . we pay for what we desir , and we wo n't pay for lier . in some paticular sector , like medicin , some peopl die becaus advertis did n't give the truth . but there is n't a rule again thi action . so between moral and rule , we should have a correct choic .
