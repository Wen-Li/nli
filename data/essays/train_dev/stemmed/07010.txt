'' financ , are a big deal big deal in your younger year , you are live on a tight budget and most of the time you can not adher to it , becaus all the media , peer pressur and nevertheless inmatur . finac can veri easi make your younger year hard and like we all know that gener an snowbal effect on everyth els . move on , careles and `` know-it-al syndrom '' , what can i say , in a way they all deriv from eachoth . these theori are back up by fact and figur that wont lie , i live through them . these are the reason whi i do not agre with that statement ; older peopl are wiser , more thougth , financiali secur and of cours more care about do again the stupid thing they did in their earlier year . also when you are older there is a great chanc that you are finaci secur , and can afford the nicer thing in life . in conclus , as we all know , life is a race . .. so by far older peopl the winner in thi race .
