in our daili life we encount advertis frequent . it start by listen to the radio in the morn , continu on our way to school and doe not end until we switch of the tv or comput at night . advertis - that is so mani thing : billboard , tv spot , commerci and so on . and the reason for it ? well there are two signific reason : for one thing to inform about a product but first and foremost to attract custom to buy the product . in my opinion the major of advertis make their product seem prior to it actual statu , but in our time of life it seem like it ha to be like that . i am awar of the huge number of product there are for ani purpos anyon could have . so therefor i can understand the market agent , when they tri to get just a littl attent for their product . sugger an imposs result seem like a well-work market tool - if the buyer can take it with some humor . red bull for exampl : the drink is suppos to help you to be abl to fli . obvious , consum know that thi promis is over the top , but when thi drink first came to market i also thought thi idea wa funni and i tri the drink . or take the exampl of the snicker bar . in a recent tv spot the produc claim that thi chocol bar would give anyon who ate it magic super power . of cours thi is not true , but it is a humor way to attract attent . the onli time i think thi kind of market strategi is not appropri is for medic suppli . in my opinion medic suppli , like special technic applianc or medicin ( prescript drug ) should onli state the featur of the product that it truli ha . otherwis it would be life-threatn . to sum up i can say that most advertis make their product seem better than it actual is . but in my opinion everyon should , if he or she is not sure of what the product is realli about , get more inform and get awar of possibl hazard .
