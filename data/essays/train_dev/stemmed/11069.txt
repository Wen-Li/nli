i agre with the idea that young peopl do not support their local commun nowaday . there are two reason whi the young do so . first of all , the mobil of young peopl is support by the econom power of their famili . long ago , typic japanes life depend on their local commun . under these circumst , young peopl can easili help their local commun becaus they are familiar with that region and have mani friend and neighbor . in these day , young peopl tend to move for the seek of their ideal universit . they are isol in the new region becaus no one know him or her and no one inform them of the content of the activ held by the new commun . thi is the one of the reason whi peopl keep a certain distanc from the commun . anoth reason is that that young peopl seem to be not interest in the activ of the local commun . there are variou job and attract activ in the countri and even abov the countri . while the activ of local commun are still the same , new job are apt to enchant the curios of the young . for exampl , in our citi , the event of local commun is the volunt activ for local elder peopl , but our univers look also look for student who help the poor children in other countri . if the cost and time and other condit is the same , it is obviou which is more attract for student . in fact , our univers hold mani attract program like thi throughout a year . as i mention so far , young peopl do not spend their time in help their commun becaus of their mobil and their low attent . and these tendenc will progress more rapidli in our futur with the advent more attract job and other intern activ .
