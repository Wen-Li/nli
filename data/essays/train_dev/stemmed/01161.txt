system that academi adopt are much differ . some academi give a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , and mani academi give a special in specif subject . two differ way to interpret the wide rang of teach . in the first one you have a knowledg of mani subject , but it could be a gener prepar doe not give you the right prepar of what you are stude for . in the second one , about the academi that prefer special the student in one specif subject , the risk is that they give to the societi peopl who are abl to work onli in their specif subject . for exampl the ingen are veri good in their topic , their work could onli be realis from theirself becaus is much difficult and it requir a particular prepar , but when you ask them to talk about art , or literatur , or perhap hystori they are not so good as in their specif subject . so i think that it could be better to prepar the student about mani subject , but there is some subject that must be special . some academi divid the cours . for the first three year you reach a gener prepar , and in the last two year you wil reach a specif preapar . that is the case of myself . i am studi architectur in milan . here we have two kind of degre . the first level degre and the second level degre . the first level is long three year and you becam a junior architect with mani academ subject . the second level is long two year and give you a specif subject prepar . final i think that the method adopt in my academi is may be one of the newest but it give me the better prepar .
