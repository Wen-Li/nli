as an engin student i do think that understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact . eventhough sometim there are fact you must learn in order to understand concept . one cannnot build a boat float if one doe not know whi it float and therefor how much it can carri befor it sink . the concept of physic need to be understood in order to adapt to everi case and make the best choic in materi , shape etc . a historian can not explain a revolut onli by fact . the understand of the idea share by the differ layer of the societi is necessari and a simpl descript of event can not replac the analysi of the histor situat which is at stake . howev , in order to understand subject like biolog or chemistri you need to learn a certain amount of fact . which element is to react with an other one , how the fast and how strong the reaction is . a doctor must learn where are all the bone and the muscl in our bodi befor he can even learn how to make a diagnosi . he ha to learn which drug can cure each ill . the learn process is not just about fact or idea and concept . to understand a concept , a fact can be help becaus our brain can associ an imag to the concept . and the other way is also true , learn the idea of romantic without read exampl and fact is not worthi . global comprehens of a subject can onli be reach onc both idea and fact are learn . to introduc a concept , it is a common easi way to start with a fact , someth that can be observ , befor the ide behind can be explain .
