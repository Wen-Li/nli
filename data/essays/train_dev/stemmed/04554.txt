it is more import to understand the idea and concept than to learn fact becaus if one is not clear with the idea , one can not get the detail of fact . understand idea can be relat to histori or and event . let say you are ask to write a detail about your countri , for exampl india . you will be abl to see the present situat that it is an independ countri which is the fact but what were the consequ it underw at the time when british peopl rule the countri and how did the the freedom fighter gave up their live for the independ of the countri cant be achiev . so it becom necessari to understand both fact as well as idea behind it . if one is watch a paint , one wont be abl to make out the idea behind that paint but as the matter of fact he will pictur it accord to hi own point of view . it might be that for a painter it is a paint of hi famili and he s express hi view in that paint but for the viewer it might just be number of peopl stand . but if the student is provid with the idea and fact togeth than a student will learn as well as understand the concept behind it . i onc experienc that one of my frind told me that my best friend is just use me for some work to be done and i start hate her for that becaus that wa the idea i got from the inform but i could have spoke to her and understood the fact behind . just by not be awar of the fact i almost ruin my relat . so at time it becom necessari to understand the whole thing than to just go with the idea . teacher have a bigger hand in use the idea and fact in a proper form to make the student awar of the import of both the fact and idea play an equal role in understand ani concept . they can incalc the idea from begin so they grow and give equal import to both .
