the standard of live ha been chang over the year . due to all the modernis and technolog peopl tend to enjoy a lot these day . i believ that now a day younger peopl are enjoy more than the older peopl . becaus in the era of lot of invent and sophist technolog younger peopl are have a great time . mani way of entertain came into exist like amus park and shop mall where younger peopl are get veri much attract while the old peopl are not will to get into these parti becaus they prefer home . on the other hand younger peopl want to enjoy themselv like have diali parti , go to picnic and have a drink . i think that there is consider amount of chang in enjoy these day rather than few year ago . younger peopl are becom more success in their career which impli that they are search for new way of enjoy and have fun . while old peopl dont have eager to go for daili parti and picnic and they prefer a calm and peac life where there is not much pollut and traffic . younger peopl are veri much eager to do someth differ and they want to have fun all the time . there are variou way in which the younger peopl enjoy like , take part in sport activit that consist of car race , water sport and mani other game . by particip in them they enjoy veri much which releas all the burden and all the stress of thier work . while in the case osf older peopl they prefer to be at home sleep in their bed eat their own meal . while younger peopl prefer eat outsid with their friend have fun all the time . moreov younger peopl want to drive away the boredom and they dont want to spend their weekend in their home rather they are find new way of enjoy like go to movi , arrang special parti in costliest hotel while older peopl alway prefer their home . and when there is an instanc of ani success in their job the younger peopl want to share their success with all the friend and they spend lavishli for the parti . in my opinion i think that younger peopl are have a good time rather than the older peopl .
