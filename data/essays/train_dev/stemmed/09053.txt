i person would n't agre with that statement for few reason . first of all , young peopl , sometim , enjoy life in a veri stupid way , not take into account the result and sequens , while older peopl usual have more wisodm that younger peopl . it is hard to argu about thi topic for a simpl reason . sinc we have to consid differ point of vew , `` enjoy life '' have so mani differ mean . for instanc , a priest might be enjoy hi life with no wife or children , stuck in hi hous and the church in what might be enjoy for him . other peopl might be enjoy their life by addict to drug and smoke . i might not seem vey right for me , but that 's the fun of life for other peopl . so what i am tri to say here is that it is import and crucial to know and interpret what doe enjoy life mean . anoth thing here is that we have to take the circumst . for exampl , if i am live in a countri of peopl . in the simplest case senario , let 's see how peopl in differ regoin on earth are live . i don not think that young peopl in poor countri of africa or in iraq are enjoy themselv ver much . if we now compar those young peopl to older peopl live a better life , them i can assur you that those older peopl , have a better tast of life , are enjoy themslev much more that young peopl . i know that i wa suppos to discuss the statement it self , but accord to the inform given , i could n't tell who is go to enjoy life more . the statement doe not tell the circumist of peopl , so at the end i will ask you thi question '' ; who is go to enjoy life more ? is it misrabl young peopl or old pepl ride fasni car , live in million dollar hous ?
