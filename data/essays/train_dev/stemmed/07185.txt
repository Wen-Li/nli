as the say goe `` roll stone gather no moss '' . sucess lie in explor involv risk . from the exampl of the famou person i infer that risk must be taken to achiev sucess . by keep in view of the life histori of mani scientist sucess wa achiev onli by experi and not by just do research on thier known one . the electr which is an essenti part of our life wa a fruit of experi . it is thi experi which bring the sucess . we can take the life of few succesful person such as the world 's richest man mr billgat and mani more all of them were popular by tri out new one rather than just do what they know to do well . we can even cite the exampl of the famou sport icon saurav ganguli who wa initi a footbal player but now he is famou for hi cricket capabl . it is the experi of a new field which made him such a famou and sucess person . great person have achiev the glimps of sucess by tri out variou field . late dirubai ambani ha a vast empir and ha establis himself as a gaint in mani field . he ha a lot of determin too along with experiment of hi thought in variou field and attain sucess . if neil armstong did not take the risk of travel on to moon he might never have been in our page of histori , he might have just ben pass away as an ordinari astronom . one must not get disturb when he fail in hi attempt rather he must shift to anoth field and tri hi capabl . our life is a short one and it need to prove it worth . so we must acquir as much knowledg as possibl in as mani field . but befor tri out a new one we must learn some basic aspect of the field and know the key to sucess in that field . as we all know failur are the step stone for sucess we must tri out new thing though there might be failur . so in thi present gener sucess can be attain by tri out new thing and take the requir risk .
