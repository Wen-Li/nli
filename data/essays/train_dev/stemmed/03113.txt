person i disagre with that statement think of the global develop of the car market . in order to support my opinion i would like to talk about differ kind of aspect of the develop and the import of car in the industrialis and the develop countri . so if we think of the industrialis countri first , for me there is no sign or hint that there will be fewer car in the futur . first of all it 's still an import statu symbol and an import mean of transport . the second point is probabl due to the fact that societi in europ and the us tend to get more and more individualis . in thi context it mean that if you drive your own car you can be all alon and - for exampl - turn the music on that you want to . of cours one could say the traffic will collap veri soon but if you recognis the invest of the govern in addit street and the develop of navig system make the traffic smoother and more effici i think thi develop will compens a great amount of addit car . anoth thing is that the product of car becom cheaper and cheaper . addit peopl are abl to financ a car a lot easier than in former time due to the upcom of leas contract . final the most import reason whi i disagre with the statement is the develop of countri like china and india . more than two billion of peopl live there and still most of them do not have car . and if these countri and the peopl live there do not ceas to gain econom power in the futur there will be a huge demand for car . a hint that support thi point is the fact that a lot of huge car compani invest a lot of money in the develop region of the world becaus it 's obviou that the futur market for car lie in these countri due to the huge amount of peopl that still do not own car .
