`` peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what theyalreadi know how to do well '' i agre with thi statement becaus take new thing we can learn a lot adn becom famou in what we are do . by tri new thing we can know some thing new and discov new thing . for some peopl after take a lot of risk they may not get success and so they go on with there same work . i dont agre with thi statement becaus with out trking new thing we can not move forward . for exampl : if the countri is a develop countri it remain a develop counti for ever if they dont tri new thing adn make there countri a develop countri . anoth exampl , if a person want to becom a top ranker or becom an engg he need to take a lot of risk to reach hi destini , by tri differ thing , think differ and work on it . i think it will definetli give sucess to the person . an exampl for wich i disagre the statement , if a person is not work hard or not tri anyth differ , then definetli he will not reach is goal and he can not he a success person . similarli take sachin tendulkar , he wa veri poor in studi adn wa verymuch intrest in cricket . hi fater took a lot of risk and start practis him cricket rather than give coach in thi regular studi . so becaus of take lot of risk and tri new thing now we got a world class cricketar , and india is veri proud to have such a player . so thi all happend just noth but take risk and tri new thing rather than countinu thi known work . so final i say , `` the peopl who tri differ and like to take risk rather than do the same work will definitli get sucess and stand on top of all '' .
