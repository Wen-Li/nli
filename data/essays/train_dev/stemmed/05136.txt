i do not think young peopl nowaday do n't dedic enough time to help their commun . if by `` commun '' other concret , fulli fledg peopl like them , also presum live in the same countri , are meant , thi is certainli not the case . at least , to the extent that young peopl fulfil their duti properli . a typic young person is , inde , one who ha a job and spend most of hi time with it . well , i take thi to be exactli the most effect way of help other peopl in a commun . by carri out hi or her work properli , as well as with all the compet requir , a young person realli doe serv the other peopl at hi or her best . mani young peopl do not have a job , to be sure , as they are still studi and spend most of their time at the univers . even so , i think they are of great help to their own commun . for their studi will eventu result in some skill and qualif . these will hope enabl them to serv the societi as soon as they accomplish their duti as student . there are , of cours , possibl object to such a line of thought . one could argu , for exampl , that a typic way of help a commun is be engag in polit and that thi is what most young peopl actual refus to do . there might be some truth in thi remark . but i think we may not legitim expect peopl to exhibit what they did not receiv . as long as polit is so confus and discourag , it is not fair to expect from young peopl a sort of interest they could not get from their model in societi . let 's take a differ exampl . help a commin is often thought of as go to hospit and vise ill peopl . these are veri good deed , of cours . but , come back to the point i made abov , these are also thing that can better be done by quilifi guy who have been especi train for thi purpos . sum up , if we assum that young peopl are gener good guy and that they do what they are suppos to do , i do n't think they are selfish or do not spend time for the sake of those commun where they live .
