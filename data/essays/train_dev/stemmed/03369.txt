there is a gener discuss today on the issu of whether the most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . as far as i am concern , i agre with thi statement . there are sever reason i want to show you . first of all , the compani need to make better advertis to attract more peopl to buy their product . if the advertis look bad , no one want have it . for exampl , the icecream seem veri pretti in the pictur or on the tv . in additon , in the advertis when a person eat it alway show amaz express becaus the tast is so good . from that , we do be attract . so we choos buy one , but it alway not as good as the advertis . in the second place , when we saw the advertis on tv or whatev other place , we may expect the real good are better than the one they show us . it is obviou that our mind influenc us when we saw the reali one behind we alreadi saw the advertis . that the one reason whi we often feel the product seem much better than they realli are . the think of long for the better thing play an import role in our commun . that whi i believ thi statement . i think also there are some advertis may make product the same like they realli are . howev , the other which seem better than the real one are more outweight it . in conclus , i agre with the statement that most advertis make better than they are
