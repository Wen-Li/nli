although the act of tri new thing might be accompani with a risk , most success peopl are use everi new oppotun as the chanc . work on the thing that they alreadi know how to do well is bore and uninterest . peopl have to face the challeng in order to be success in their live . i lean thi through read the play call the raisin in the sun and from my experi of move to the u.s. and tri new thing . in the play , the raisin in the sun , one of the charact in the book , walter , tri to pursu hi dream of start hi own buisi . despit the opposit from hi famili member and social unaccept , he tri hi best to grant hi dream . in the book , he said that success person is the one that take a risk and that he want to do the same with hi father 's insur money . although he fail to make hi dream come true , i thought that tri new thing is certainli the one factor to be success . it is lot better than just do thing that doe not interest a person and even if he fail to use the chanc , he still lean someth that he could not have gain if he wa work in the same , mundan situat . when i wa in middl school , i wa tire of the bore classroom of eld class that i have spent most of my middl school year in . everyday , the class did the same thing over and over again . although i wa eager to get out of eld program , i did not have a courag to lean in complet differ situat with peopl who can speak english fluentli and without help of a dictionari . but one day , i wa told by my teacher that i am elig to get out of the eld class . i wa excit but anxiou at the same time ; i even thought about stay in the same class with my friend . howev , i chose to take a risk and decid to take class with nativ speak student . although i had hard time adjust to new environ and make new friend , i do not regret make that decis and i think that my experi will be use in futur . the play that i read in the past and my experi of take risk make me think that success peopl are the peopl who tri new thing and the peopl that are not afraind of take risk . do same thing lower peopl 's motiv and it doe not do ani good to them .
