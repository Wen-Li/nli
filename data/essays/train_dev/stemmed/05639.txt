peopl go through differ stage through out their life span , start from childhood , teenag , matur and then get old ! for the past 23 year ive been hear differ comment from differ age start ; `` i cant wait to grow old '' to `` how i miss my old day . '' the question now is when exactli is the most enjoy period in our life time ? `` younger peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . '' let focu now on young peopl and what they do . young peopl start their live start childhood live with their parent have the support they need , have the time to play and enjoy everi moment with their friend and famili , not to mention that they have no respons . if we put in mind that teenag are consid young , i believ that the onli differ between a child and an 18 year old girl will be the same onli put into consider that respons will be more obviou but onli in-term of studi while on the other hand they still got the time to have fun with both friend and famili and have the time to travel across countri and visit new place . as for older peopl , start the matur stage which is after graduat , at that time although respons start increas rapidli , on the other hand new factor are be ad to the equat which add to it the senc of excit . to illustr my point ; as we grow older and start get into the real world , thi is where we start make a famili , meet our spous and creat a foundat of our . the idea of provid the support to our famili and creat thi opportun to our children to have fun just as we did , is enjoy in one way or the other . we all know that achiev thi is challeng and in my own opinion the senc of challeng is fun ! move on to an older age , if we manag to accomplish the foundat that we were work on , we will be abl to feel the senc of achiev by also creat support to our childrent ( who are now matur ) creat for them the support they need to build their own foundat . life as a whole is enjoy , if we tend to take it from it dark side and it difficulti start our first day at school it will never be enjoy , but as for me i believ that when we are young we enjoy the idea of have free time , no respons and at the same time creat our life time plan , which is if we manag to accomplish one day we will be forev happi . in conclus the time which is more challeng to us is more fun and that whi i disagre with the statement .
