i disagre with the statement : i think young peopl are as support to their commun as they have alway been . of cours `` be help '' ha chang rapidli becaus of technolog and scientif progress chang veri quickli , also there could be a sociolog explan to the actual chang of commun which is in my opinion veri import to consid . commun have becom more and more divers , difficult to defin and cosmopolitan , a good exampl is the notoiou american melt pot , which of cours mean that not everyon meet for exampl in a class at school or in a neighborhood or also in a polit group might be particip to the same type of ethnic or econom commun . not everyon will therefor know what type of activ a young person is actual do to support the commun he feel more integr in , or how much time he is dedic to it . that doe n't necessarili mean he is n't particip in commun activ . also , our era is move slowli toward a situat where physic work becom more and more unimport and replac with technolog . that mean young peopl may be perform veri econom sustain task , for exampl buy commun product per internet , but you still wo n't see them in the actual commun supermarket or drug store perform manual task . i actual think that in the situat we live in now , it is much easier to have a strong consciou commun ident compar with the ignor necess of particip of the past , when mani peopl probabl could n't even imagin the exist other parallel commun . in thi way , young peopl are often more activ and spiritu involv in their commun life than in the past , a characterist of which for exampl we have proof in the still grow popular of volount work , natur influenc by the greater wealth progress in time ha brought to a grow number of peopl . the so-cal `` death of ideal '' that probabl would be relat to the essay statement in the sens that particip in commun life repres a form of activ express your ideal , is n't realli happen in my opinion - it 's just that the sudden incred commun possibl which were given to my gener and the nation boundari open along with a situat of peac between at least western countri ha thrown us into the void of thousand of contact and knowledg possibl through other cultur and commun . but now , when the gener cultur compris more and more of a wide spectrum of cultur , religi , econom and polit possibl , i have the impress that an enorm number of peopl still feel attach to the cultur they come from , their parent , their ancestor etc . gene and commun are strong valu i doubt histori or time will ever distroy . we are not in the brave new world yet , and i do not want to believ that that indiffer is the direct we 're go in .
