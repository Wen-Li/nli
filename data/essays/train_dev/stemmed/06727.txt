basic i do not agre with thi statement . actual , travel with a tour guid are confort . the reason compris the follow two fact . first , most of tour guid usual know and provid a lot of use inform , such as good place for visit and view , delici restaur and dengeour area . the other reason is that we do not have to care ani problem relat to speak foreign languag e.g. reserv hotel , buy ticket or order in restaul . howev , guid tour have a seriou problem , at least for me : we can not arrang the schedul as we like . tour cours are strictli determin . thi impli that we can not take a rest even if we feel veri tire , and we have to go to place where we do not want to go . we can not get up late . .. anoth reason whi i do not agre with the statement is that we are not abl to have privat time due to the group travel . privat time is quit a preciou for eni situat , especi for travel . we must alway go with the group and the tour guid . on the other hand for the privat travel , we can go anywher we want to go , we can have a tea for a rest , we can stay for a long time as we like . if we want to know some use inform , travel inform center will be help . we may appli half-day or one-day tour found in the inform center . in summari , i prefer privat travel . if i need some use inform or some option tour , i will go to travel inform center .
