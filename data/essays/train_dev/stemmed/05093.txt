man 's pursuit of technolog ha brought him in today 's world where everyth design and made by him give an affirm to the dream he had sought for , the dream to live happili and comfort . in the light of that dream , and variou cogent reason , i disapprov of the statement mention in the topic . we are certainli go to have more car in use in twenti year from now , as we have now . the question put up in the topic may be valid on two count . firstli , becasu of the deplet of oil in earth 's reserv , fuel 's shortag could be a drive forc of reduct in number of car . secondli , the alarm rate at which the pollut is increas may amount to a strict ban on the car that emit harm gase . but both these reason fail to assess the paramet complet they seek to build their case on . the argument against these point is altern . neo-malthusian economist beleiv that increas use of natur resourc will tend to increas their cost with time . howev , the famou simon-elrich wager in 1980 toppl that theori . while elrich said that price of five natur resourc ( which they select ) is bound to decreas in ten year , simon place a bet that it would reduc . the price actual suffer a declin ! the simpl reason is altern . as societi 's need grow and resourc fall short , variou altern come up and keep the momentum aliv . in the similar vein , we can expect the car run on altern fuel rather than petroleum . billion of dollar , today , are spent on research on altern sourc of energi . we even have countless citi where use of cng ( compress natur ga ) ha replac petrol as the fuel . the advanc in technolog are sure to pave way for the solar car in futur . all thi will experi a rise in the number of car . the same altern fuel act as harmless substanc to the atmpspher , and amount to a reduct in the pollut . it is imper to mention here , that apport studi of the air sampl ha suggest that most of the citi , the air pollut is caus more by the factori than by automobil . with the kyoto protocol in place , the countri have now decid and taken firm step to curb pollut , not necessarili by remov vehicl pli on the road , but by ensur that they conform to the euro iii , euro iv standard , and also check the constitu of exhaust from factori . with possibl of more ore countri join the protocol , car remain invulner . the past also corrobor the fact that car will increas . the question of reduct in their number is not new , and even earlier , skeptic share thi viewpoint . but data suggest that countri , especi after the globalis and liberalis , have suffer a dramat rise in the number of car in past few year , and research have predict that becaus the purchas power abil of peopl in most countri is steadili increas , product of car is not go to ceas . the space is also not a problem . with the advent of newer mechan of build high rise build with park at the basement and also the construct of variou flyover on top of the other , assur that man is ever think and persev individu , who work hard and keep hi invent aliv . the rise in the love for automobil , whether in the form of formula 1 race or automobil engin , constantli over the year , is go to ensur that new car with newer design and comfort level continu pli in the street . when we live in the inform superhighway , transport remain crucial point of improvis . in thi view , if we need to pace ourselv with the fast move world , we need to save time and act modern . give argument against the technolog develop that ear impend is belittl our own selv . we must look at the bright side of the pictur . the car today , have impregn into the veri social fabric of peopl , and it ha becom inalien part of their live . separ of car from human is veri difficult , given the fact that it ha becom a necess rather than just an accessori . come time will wit a surg in the number of car , whose concept , design and power will outweigh the one that we have today .
