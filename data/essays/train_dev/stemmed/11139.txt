some peopl think that the success peopl have to onli do well in what they alreadi know . it is realli import to do well in well-known part . howev , in my opinion , success peopl tri new thing and take risk . first , tri new thing improv their abil . as they tri continu , they face variou problem , it would rais their abil to overcom the hardship . for exampl , there are my friend who have realli differ characterist . one of my friend alway tri to speak with foreign in english whether it is correct or not . he did hi effort to improv hi english skill , he can speak english fluentli . howev , anoth my friend did not ani effort to improv hi english skill . he did n't studi english except learn from school curriculum . so he hate english , and never attach to it anymor . second , experienc risk is also help . it can make peopl more strong and develop their abil when they face to difficulti . for exampl , in my case , i wa poor at physic work . as i work in militari , i experienc variou risk such as use gun . when i wa soldier , i had to keep my countri , so i alway practic the use gun . it requir realli high concentr on use . a simpl mistak could be a big accid . so i alway did my best when i control the gun , it rais me up to get more self-confid . peopl have their own thought about the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . some peopl might say that success poepl have to do well in own part indtead of tri new thing and risk . howev , for these reason , i think the challeng attitud enabl them to improv their abil and get more self-confid .
