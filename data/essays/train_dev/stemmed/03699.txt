in twenti year there probabl will be a much better system of altern way of movement , like the train , in the most industri countri . so peopl there wont need their car to go to vacat or even to their job . also there will be a big rais of the oil price in the next 20 year and , becaus of the grow enviromental-pollut , a lot of restrict on car-driv , which mean car-driv will be much more expens than now , so peopl will tri to minim car-us . but there are also mani reason whi the nuber o car will grow up in the next 20 year . first of all , mobil is get more ond more import in the buisness-l . the distanc between the workling-plac and the place you are live will expend , so more peopl will use a car go to work . second , the number of car in the countri of the third world will rais extremli . nation like china or india , where most of the peopl dont have car by now , will becom more wealthi . so the peopl live in these countri will be abl to buy car . and rememb , the number of peopl live there is much bigger than the number of peopl live in the industri nation . cunclud , i think the number of car in the industri countri , like the usa oder germani , will declin in the next 20 year . but in the same time , the number of car in the third world countris will rais much faster . so , all in all , i disagre with the statement in the question . i think , in 20 year there will be more car on the earth than now .
