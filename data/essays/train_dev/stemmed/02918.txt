it is a challeng question that whether it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . first of all , i want to mention that both of them are good but it is imposs to be the best in mani academ subject . in my opinion , unlik have a broad knowledg of mani subject , be the best in one specif subject is much more valuabl . i think that the special in one specif area can give person much more advantag when we compar it to the broaden knowledg . for exampl , if you have onli broaden knowledg about mani subject , thi tell peopl that you are not a qualifi person . it onli make you more intellectu but spacial is requir in order to have a good job opportun . today be intellectu doe not enough in order to live well . unless you have ani special , you can not earn good amount of money . moreov , be special can be seen as the reflect of the success . you can be the most success person in your special area with research and work more and more . for instanc , you can be a well known scientist or professor in your field . thi is imposs for the person who ha a broaden knowledg in mani area becaus life is short and you do not have lot of time to learn the everyth about everi subject . instead of thi you should use your time in one area which can make you the best . in order to summar , as i mention in my essay , i am disagre with the idea that it is better to heve broad knowledg of mani subject . accord to me , be the best in one area is much better than have a broaden knowledg . special is not onli the chanc of the good posit but also the reflect of the success .
