i am to give my opinion on which is the most import thing for a student between undersand idea and learn fact . first of all it is self evid that those thing are both essenci in a student educ . anyway , as far as i am concern , i think that understand idea will help more a student in hi futur life . inde , an idea can be useful in much more area than a fact and moreov , a student have to understand idea in order to understand more deepli the impact and the mean of fact . a student that have perfectli understood some concept is suppos to be abl to use them to interpret the fact . moreov some concept or idea are so import for our societi and the way it is function that noon can be part of the societi without know them becaus the fact are most of the time base on the idea . for exampl to understand war in gener , onli event wo n't give you a proper opinion but understand the basement of it , for instanc the concept of the quest for power , will certainli help you . but on the other hand , be total disconect with the realliti is not a good point , and a whole theoric learn is n't a good thing for a student becaus he must be abl to use hi learn in the real life , and know fact would help him to identifi differ situat and understand them better . inde , some concept , like the concept of democraci can not be propr understood without the hisor background of it and it applic in everyday life . furthermor , some histor fact are so essenci in our societi that we can not , for instanc , understand the current news , without know them . so a perfect learn is suppos to make sudent learn both concept and fact , in order to be readi for their futur life , thank to a complet leran , that we are in fact
