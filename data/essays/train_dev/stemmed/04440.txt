with thi set of materi i 'm realli disagre ! car will be fewer is a fantast futur ! in fact in the last year the number of the car on a road is moltipl ! onli if an organ like a govern or much importatnt like onu or nato will make some mesuerd like a law for thi problem we will see fewer car turn around ! my thesi is support from the known of human mind ! some year ago peopl everi day walk , go by bike or take a bu for go to work , to studi or to do other thing ! today man is abl to buy a car and use it for hi thing , thi becaus the world chang and are chang on ! mani year ago peolpl got up in the morn and think what the best way for find a food ? later in the year when man got up think : how can i do for live better ? thi is one of the mean of evolut ! so , i 'm sure , next year peapl will think , for exampl , how mani car can i buy for live better ? anoth exampl to support my opinion you can find in the last year . famili ten year ago ha onli one car for famili , that father usual use . today for each famili you can find minimun two car , one for a wife and one for a husband . now number of car are increas and next year you will see better in one famili everi compon of a famili ha a car ! i know some my friend that have two car for each one . the evolut can help us to find a way for limit a pollut for exampl or increasi the use of a car , but modern peopl want to have everythind to take with the hand . .. the strang thing is that thi man or woman that doe n't want to walk or take a bu or move , in the even will go in a fit center for have a physicol activ ! for thi reason usa that is a rich countri peopl are becam fat ! in fact fact is one of the problem of modern soceti . becaus machin like a car are do the all thing that man did befor . so i think that that sentenc is veri funni and fantast !!!
