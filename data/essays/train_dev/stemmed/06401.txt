it is wide believ that youth is synonim of happi , health and well-b . accord to my experi , i think that in thi respect youth is a concept that should be more relat to the soul rather than to the biolog age . i have met two group of young peopl . the first group is form by those peopl who realli enjoy life and live in a healthi and happi way . despit their age and few experi , they are abl to handl life issu in a veri creativ and optimist manner . the second group is form by those who face life as a battl where they have to fight with each other , as in a competit , miss the beauti of the journey , alway look to the goal . most of the time , the latter group , becaus of their lack of experi and wisdom , may find themselv trap in their own person psycholog conflict , which prevent them from enjoy life fulli . it goe the same for the elderli . there are , accord to my experi , two group . on the one hand , there is the group of healthi peopl who realli enjoy life , most of the time even much better than most of young peopl . these peopl are wiser and have learnt how to better deal with life challeng . they are healthi and are engag in plenti of outdoor and indoor activ . they realli deserv admir and respect , and should be regard accordingli . on the other hand , there is the group of peopl who is alway live in the memori of a past that is never come back , with regret and sad . peopl , who have not becam wiser but , instead , melancol and angri . peopl who , probabl due to person circumst , have lost their joy and the tast for life . so , i do not agre neither disagre with the above-ment statement , sinc i believ that age is in the soul and in the person 's feel rather than in the physic appear and biolog age .
