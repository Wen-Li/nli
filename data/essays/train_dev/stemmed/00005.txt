in my opinion the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . the other option would be to go alon or in a small group of two to three peopl without a tour guid . the advantag of travel in a group led by a tour guid are : 1. the vacat time will be util effici . 2. we can concentr on sightse and enjoy more . 3. it is safer 4. we may get discount ticket for tourist attract . let me elabor on these point . sinc , the tour guid is well familiar with the tourist destin , he can make a detail schedul of our day to day activ . also , he will manag our time in such a way that we are abl to visit all the import point of attract . and becaus he will be involv in plan and drive we can spend more time relax and enjoy . thi is special import for coupl , as they will get more qualiti time to spend with each other . on the contrari , if you travel alon or in a small group without a travel guid , you are respons for manag all aspect of the trip . thi may lead to ineffici plan and wast of time . it is also safe to travel in a group and with a person who is awar of good and bad neighborhood . one of my friend onc went to a foreign countri for vacat . he did not arrang for a tour guid . unfortun , he wa mug the veri first day of hi trip and wa stab in the stomach too . thu , ruin hi vacat plan complet . addit , most of the tour guid have contact with local merchant and attract manag . henc he may be abl to arrang for discount food and entertain ticket . who doe n't like to save some extra money ? final , i would like to repeat that i strongli suggest travel in a group led by a tour guid .
