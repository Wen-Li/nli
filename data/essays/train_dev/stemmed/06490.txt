peopl may tri new thing for which risk ha to be taken , and if the risk pay of they becom success . i strongli beliv that when there is a risk involv the chanc of be success are equal to chanc of fail . definetli onli new thing give greater magnitud of success , sinc peopl are more inclin to newer and innov thing rather than the thing which are alreadi exist , there would certainli go for someth new in the market . i know of a person who becam veri sucess after introduc polyst into the nation market where all the major buiss sold onli cotton as their main product , the person tri someth new though he knew that risk wa involv and becam a great success stori . on similar ground one of my friend want to tri out someth new and he open a chain of cloth store on a newbrand name , though everyon advic him to take up a franchis with an alreadi establish brand as their wa reduc risk of fail and reduc cost in new idea and advertiz , he did not listen to their advic and setup hi own thing , but unfortun for him the store did not do good busi and he could not get to tast success . i also know of a person who open a franchis of a popular compani and do great bussi , here he did not tri anyth new went with do what peopl alreadi new about , that way it wa a sure thing for him and he did not have to invest as much as he would have if he start someth new and he is enjoy success , although hi success might not be of an equal magnitud compar to the one who have tri new thing and becam success . i conclud that as there are two side to a coin there are both advantag and disadvantag in tri out new thing or do someth which is alreadi well establish .
