some peopl might argu that it is more import for student and some might argu that it is more import for student to learn fact . i most certainli believ that it is more import for student to learn fact rather then just understan idea and concept . the reason is that understa idea and concept onli offer brief summeri of matter but not specif detail . there are mani are that student are requir to know detail rather than just idea and concept such as mechan and histori . first of all , mechan requir student to know all the specif detail about machin . for instanc , if a student is to learn how a heater work , then the student need to know not onli the concept of devic in the heater but also the fact and detail about how it all work togeth . let say that one student who understand how heater work want to creat a heater . even if he ha idea about heater , in order to actual make one , he need to know all the fact and detail how the machin work secondli , histori requir student to know fact rather than understand idea . let say there is a student who is learn avout the world war two . understand the concept and idea how the world war two start would be import but know the detail and fact about the world one two would be moreimport . thu , as can be seen as abov , i certainli believ that learn fact is more import for student than just understand idea and concept in that there are mani case that understa idea and concept would not be suffici .
