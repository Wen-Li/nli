i agre with the statement which is success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . it depend on what the valu of the success is , so i take success as becom famou and chang better world . one of the exampl of success compani is mcdonuld 's , the famou fast food chain in the unit state . i just read the book about mcdonuld 's . the founder of the mcdonuld 's is mcdonuld 's brother in the south of the unit state . they were sell humberg at the store which can buy food get on the car , drive-through . it wa the major think of restrant at that time . but they chang the style . they chang all of the cycl to make humberg . it mean that one person do onli one job , like just bake the meat . befor that , there were one person did everi step to make humberg . thi idea made more faster to serv food . becaus of there effort , mcdonuld 's becam the biggest humberg compani in the world . tri to do new thing is alway with some risk . it would be good if the new thing brought success . but if the new thing fail , it would be a nightmer . i think chareng new thing is a kind of lottari . we can not know if the thing would be success . anoth good exampl of success peopl is the person who maid the i-pod . thi product is the most hit product of appl compani which use to produc appl comput . the idea of make i-pod as the lightest and have a big capac of music is the fashion idea . appl compani is the first compani to creat product such as i-pod . the attitud of challeng of new thing would make appl to accomplish to be success . becaus of these reason , i agre with the idea of success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know how to do well .
