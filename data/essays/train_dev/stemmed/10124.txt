no , i firmli contradict the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . car are use for the purpos for the travel from one part to the anoth and it is consid luxuri and the most import medium of travel . so , we can expect a develop in the technolog to provid more and more car which will have a veri good mileag and will be comfort with seat and it 's pick-up , instead of declin in their number in the next twenti year . say for exampl , there were old fashion maruti car ( maruti 800 , maruti van ) and ambassador car in the 1980 but with the recent develop in the technolog of car ( like the maruti suzuki swift , scorpio , tata indica ) , it ha improv the vehicl capabl veri effici . that is accept from more individu that maor and more car will be seen on the road in the next twenti year . so revolut is in all the field and also in the automobil engin , so that research will make better car in futur and the purchas will purchas it and so more car will be seen . anoth import exampl is that the busy of the big citi is more increas day afterday . so , we can say that there are more and more car seen on the road as it wa seen twenti year befor and so the predict are accept with evid . from the pollutio 's point of view it is seen that the citi get heavili pollut due to the carbon monoxid and smoke which is more and more enforc into the air by the vehicl but the increas in the vehicl is the obviou thing from thi point of view , and the most import factor from thi the increas in the number of car , purchas by the peopl and run on the road with more and more in number day by day . so , i support the develop of technolog , so i , not onli support the increas in the number of the car in the next twenti year , but firmli agre it . so , the abov statement is is not at all accept from my point of view .
