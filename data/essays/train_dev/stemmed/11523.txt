mani peopl are tri to find the way that lead to a success life . the propos theori mean that to be success you have to dare do new thing instead of focus on what you alreadi know to do well . i do not agre with such a thesi . first , mani peopl are success onli by do what they know how to do well . if you do thing better than other do , you have great chanc to succeed in your project . for instanc , a lot of sport champion onli focu on their sport and do not lose time besid . for exampl , roger feder , the current best tenni player in the world , wa learnt tenni sinc he wa veri young and went on in thi way which lead him to success . wherea a lot of well known singer who tri to play in film did not manag in thi way and went back to what they did well . neverlethess , mani amaz success stori happen to peopl who tri to do someth new . for instanc , the famou former tenni player yannick noah , after a good carrier as a tenni player , ha becom a veri famou singer . consequ , if i do not realli agre with the thesi i have to acknowledg that it is possibl to be success in other field that the one you are meant to . so , my point is that even if you are do well in someth , thi doe not mean that you can do well eslewher . on the contrri , i think that peopl who have been success in the field they were prepar for have better chanc to have great achiv in other field becaus they have been learnt how to commit in a project , to be profession and to believ in themselv .
