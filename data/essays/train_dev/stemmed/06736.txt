it is good to have knowledg on mani academ subject , howev , upto what extent we need that amount of knowledg is question . in my opinion , specil in one specif subject will bring lot of good academ work . suppos that you are a person who have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . thi mean that you studi a lot and learn a lot of thing . but first question appear is that doe that person realli need that amount of knowledg ? and , more importantli , by use that knowledg , can he focu on the topic properli ? i claim that specliz will bring effici , time manag , and gain in focu . for instanc , in societi , almost everybodi is special on a specif job . in other word , as a ration peopl , everybodi want to do the job in which he ha a comper advantag . by do so , not onli the person will be happier but also the societi will be more close to a pareto effici alloc . on the other hand ; if peopl know a broader knowledg of mani thing , then they might have some useless inform and lose their focu on subject . anoth exampl would be relat to an academician 's situat . when write a paper , almost alway specif on a certain topic is as much as desir . for instanc . if that person specifi in the field of industri organ and game theori , the paper that he will be write will certainli be affect by the knowledg that he creat in that field befor . howev ; if he focus on differ field and tri to special in a lot of field at the same time , there might emerg some problem regarg to the accumul of knowledg in the futur . everytim he write on a specif area , he need to focu on that field again , and thi will take consider amount of time and bring ineffici . in conclus , i think that it is better not onli for peopl but also for societi to specil on certain subject . it might sound good to know everyth at the first place , howev , a deeper think on thi topic show that there might be loss on the time and effici concern .
