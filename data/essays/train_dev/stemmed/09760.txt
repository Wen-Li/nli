i dis-agre to the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' i believ that when one travel , one need to explor the place to the fullest . travel is a passion which teach you to explor , learn and experi . although i agre to the fact that tour guid have a first hand experi about the place and they have been time and again experienc the place , i believ they are do their job . but the actual thrill which i believ about travel is the experi of find it urself . when with a tour guid , one doe not necessarli make an effort to find about the detail of a place or the zest of it . one just goe by the tour guid and assum that he ha cover everyth . tour guid is like a book , i agre , who open out the entir pictur to the travel whom he is guid , but the benifit of a research which one get by meet the local peopl , their food , cultur and place and the rest through book or guid is phenomin . the tour led by guid ristrict the intens of explor a place . one ha to go with the pace of the rest of the group led by the guid . thi prohibit not onli the learn or explor pace but also the freedom of other decis you want to take dure the travel experi . i as a person love to meet peopl , learn cultur and custom of other by be around them and by interact with them . for that reason , i total would like to be on my own or in a comfort group who ha similar think and love travel . i believ that when one is spoon fed , one doe not make an effort to learn beyond the paradigm . similarli when one intend to explor a place and it peopl , a group led by a tour guid doe not do justic to the place . the hidden fact that the tour guid convey can also be infer from a book or a tour guid . travel is a form of freedom in my eye , and i believ the best result and the knowleg of a place is when one make an adventour effort to explor it .
