advertis is the most effect and power way of commun . compani and corpor spend big a mount of asst on advertis to make sure that peopl will buy their product . in my opinion , advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in order to convenc costom of buy certain product , comani have to convinc them that thi product is effect in do whatev it is suppos to do and that what they see is what they get . compani 's will have to make that product look like it serv it porpus and more , regardless of be honest or dishonest . an adversit will exaggur the qualiti and the effect of a product in order to be convens . for exampl , some product like hair shampoo have a woman with a long silki hair that emplay that your hair will look like thi if you use that shampoo . thi is mislead becuas a shampoo will not make your hair long silki and shini as shown in advertis . therefor the adversit in thi case is not do what it is suppos to do . most of dvertis are dishonest and mislead . when peopl see and advertis and decid to buy it , they expect to have what they have been promis to have . for exampl , some airlin advertis say fli with us we are alway on time , while when you expect that promis , you end up be delay 5 hour . thi dishonet mislead adversit lead to resent and the compani loos it credibl . adversit are not alway what they seem to be . comani and corpor will do anyth to mak their product look better than they realli are in order to get as mani custom as possibl . the most effect way is to commun thier product to the costom through adversit . adversit work on a consiou and a subconsi level , therefor peopl should use their critic think when look at an adversit becau what they see is not usual what they get .
