i partial disagre with the statement that `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . becaus accord to my view most of the student can gain knowledg by learn the fact practic and i beliv the principl `` practic make man perfect '' thi proverb say that by learn the fact that is practic experi will lead a sucessful life . suppos if a medico student who newli enter into hi field he may not have an perfect idea how to treat the patient and the patient may lost hi life in such condit the doctor or medico student should not get depres and shouldnot give up hi job , if he do that then he is unfit for hi profesion field . dure such sort of condit he should be veri sprotiv and should learn the fact . so that he may not repeat the mistk next time . and i partial disagre with the statement that it is import for student to understand idea , becaus each and everi aspect we can not learn by face the practic experi , so by read good book which contain the histori of succesful person like famou writer , politician , social worker etc we will get and clear idea and concept so that student lead their lifein a successful way . by the understand the idea , concept and leaniong fact will help the student to build up hi career in better field . attitud + creativ + talent = success of student so due to the abov reason i partial disagre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
