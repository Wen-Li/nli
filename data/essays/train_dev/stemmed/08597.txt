first of all have broad knowledg of mani acadim subject is not better than special in one specifec subject . becaus if you have mani acadim knknowledg in diffrent subject you wil never by succes in one of them becaus you have a shallow knowledg , howev if you are realli special in one specif subject you will realli be succes and acheiv a veri high postion in your side . you can be the best in you major and u can realli score a veri big acheiv . but if you have a mani acadim knowledg from everi thing you wo n't be that succes person . you can be succes if you realli get deep in some of them or all of them it will be the best . in other term if you are special in one specif subject you and you do n't know noth about a \ other thing that will be the worst thing becaus these day you have to know about a lot of thing about what goineg on in the world that whi in school they teach us alot of subject and a lot of knowledg becaus you have to know about a lot of thing . after that when you go to the universti you special in one specif subject or major , becaus you handl a lot of knowledg from school that whi you have to special in one specif subject . in my opinion you have to make a balanc by the two of them becaus you have to know a lot about knowledg of mani acadim subject and to special in one specif subject so that whi you have to make a veri big balanc in the two opinion . some peopl think that you have to pick up one thing but i think you have to combin the two of them togeth so that whi you have to make a balanc between the two opinion .
