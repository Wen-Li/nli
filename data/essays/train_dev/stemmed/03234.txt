there are mani peopl understand idea and concept but they do n't know what they are . the student have to do what they are from do to learn fact is better than to understand idea and concept for student . here are some reason to support my idea . first of all , there is a soccer ball . everyon know what to do with the ball . if there is two peopl that person awho ha naver play soccer ; howev know the soccer ball veri well , and person b ha experi to play soccer but , he doe n't realli know about the ball . person b know about a soccer ball becaus he ha learn fact to play . person a know about the ball ; howev , he doe n't know how to play becaus he onli ha idea . second of all , there is a blind , and he understand to play soccer . howev , he ha never seen it and play . the blind ha idea ; howev , the idea is not worth becaus he ha naver done . to do what he think will make the blind to learn play soccer . third of all , there are student in the classroom and a professor is give a lectur . the professor make student understand idea and concept ; howev , the student do n't know what they are becaus of no experi from the idea . final , there is a korean adverb which is `` to do onc is better than to listen to idea . '' accord to the adverb , even if a person had idea , there would be noth befor do thing . therefor , he will learn what the idea are . in conclus , i believ that to learn fact is better than to understand idea and concept . i 'm write an essey with learn fact . if i onli understood the idea of write , i would never write anyth .
