i would agre on the point that most product advertis are not as good as they are portray in the advertis . the reason for my belief is that the advertis compani get a lot of money from the manufactur to make their ad look better . and due to thi the make the product look veri flash and attract in the advertis even if it is the most hideou product . advertis is the best market stratergi that decid the sale of the product and the compani success . in order to ahiev certain target and to attract more custom the compani advertis their item in a manner that make them more desir to the viewer . to do thi they add certain featur which the might not be abl to provid . they spend a lot of money on these ad . for exampl , a cell phone compani x adverstis it phone that ha all the featur except a veri bright colour handset that might attract peopl . so the advertis usual enhanc the colour of the handset in the add that peopl like to see . they modifi the product with the help of the comput techniqu . thi might be mislead for the viewer of the ad if they order the handset just becaus of it colour . most peopl believ in what the see in the advertis and order the product on the basi of the ad . thi can lead to viewer form a wrong opinion about the product too . give a person exampl , i order an entertain book which accord to the advertis had all the address of the tourist place in and around newyork but when i final got the book in hand i discov that the book had onli a few select place and it did not includ all the import tourism spot for eg. the museum of modern art or the radio citi hall in manhattan . how could ani book miss that ? on the basi of the reason and exampl citi abov and on the basi of my experi i would final conclud that the advertisemnet are often mislead and do not provid the exact inform and the viewer should go into the detail of the product befor buy them .
