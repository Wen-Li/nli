i disagre with the statement becuas young peopl have some time a better way to express their emot , in some case they have more energi than older peopl but , it doe n't mean that older peopl lack energi to express what they feel about life , it just a natur behavior that older peopl are more reserv than young peopl on express emot . older peopl know the great valu that life mean , that is whi i beliv that older peopl realli know how to enjoy life . perhap they have in their mind difer type of problem or diseas they alway tri to be posit in those advers situat . young peopl doe not matter about some aspect that older peopl have in mind so they can express more easili their actitud relat with life , but they can not visual all the time they have live and they can give a true valu about life mean , while older peopl have live specif situat , problem that mani time they affront , thi type of situat give a more complet think or sens in what life mean . i consid that older peopl in some way are consid person that are not useful anymor , and thi is a wrong statment that mani young peopl have in their mind . older peopl are great teacher of life , youth peopl need to be more relat with older peopl is a good form to find the true mean of life . for instanc , older peopl can help with their knowledg and their skill to young peopl on difficult situat , and advis is alway accept if becam from an expert or a person who had live an specif situat . perhap older peopl in some need to fight with special situat like diseas , demis of a rel , econom issu , they alway tri to give a posit actitud to peopl , and they also give an idea that perhap all of their problem they enjoy their life as much as they were young .
