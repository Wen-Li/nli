i think that broad knowledg of academ subject is ever a good thing for a student . at first becaus in thi way he can know differ aera of the human knowledg and he can also decid to insight one of that subject that is not extrem similar to hi effect academ pathway or even radic chang hi pathway at all . at second becaus onli earlier in hi life , a person ha the skill and brain resourc for achiev a lot of inform of everi kind of subject , that may have util in hi futur or simpli serv to increas hi cultur and hi knowledg in humanist subject . in my opinion is import , for exampl , for a student that choos a scientif pathway or studi a lot of scientif subject , to cultiv ani interest in humanist subject like literatur , philosophi , art etc. becaus in thi way he can achiev a differ point of view of the thing that sourround him and even of thi life . i think that have a broad knowledeg is import for person format even spirit format but , at the same time i think that if anyon decid to special in one specif subject he can realli excel in that subject and becom a true expert of hi favourit subject , so special is import for profession format .
