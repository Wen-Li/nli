in the past 10 year , i have travel in my own countri and in all over the world . the best trip wa go to australia by myself in my earli 20 's . it wa my first travel oversea . and i enjoy to experi the new world . there wa onli onc that i travel in a group by a tour guid which wa one of the high ivent . i had a lot of fun with travel in a group though , but now , as i am look back to the old memori , i do not agre that the best way to travel in a group by a tour guid . there are two reason whi i would rather travel by myself than take a group tour . they are feel freeli to plan my own trip and spend time and expenc as i want . first of all , i do not want to go a place where i am not even interest in visit . i would like to plan my trip for just for myself , to visit how , or where i want to go . anoth reason whi i want to travel alon is that i do not want to spend time and money to go , or to watch thing . it is a veri preciou and limit time when i decid to travel . for those reason whi i do not agre with the statement are feel free to plan my trip and spend time for myself that the best way to travel is in a group bt a tour guid .
