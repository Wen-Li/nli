educ institut should train , their student in such away that they can understand idea and concept to bulid a better societi . i agre to the topic that , idea and concept should be understood than just learn them as fact . a student should have a clear view of the fact befor learn it . offcours some fact like 2 + 2 = 4 need not be understood , but the student should know how to implement it . in physic like the law of thermodynam should be clearli understood , inord to know where it can be appli in real world . for exampl a student should just not learn fact about graviti , but chid should also understand , what actuali it mean and how is it relat to natur . the student should understand it concept , to know it import and valu . the idea and concept should be clear , so that the child can think of the concept which are relat to it in a differ way , through thi he can develop a broaderway of think and henc improv imagin skill . the concept should be clearli understood , inord to rememb it for a long time . if a student understand the fact then , there are lesser chanc for the child to forget it . whenev , chid see someth that is relat to fact , then the child quickli analys the fact , and will do necessari action if requir . in subject , which are practic like biolog , then it veri import for the child to understand each and everi concept relat to the fact , then onli the child can get success in that particular feild . so i feel that student should understand the concept and idea than just learn them . for everi fact the student should rais a question , to have a clear knowledg about the fact .
