in my opinion success peopl are more relat in tri new thing but they are not necessarili more atracct in take risk . the reason for my thought is that peopl who are success normali lead a compani or are the owner of some kind of busi . therefor they have respons for mani employe who are work in the firm . for exampl when the boss of a compani want to develop a new , let say , a new car . the car work with a new technolog which is much better for the environ but is not test good yet and will probabl not make much money . in my opinion the busi leader should not take the risk to develop the car until it ha been well known in a countri and ha reach high interest . becaus if it doe not work and nobodi will buy the car the compani will eventu be lost and the employe would be unemploy . nevertheless i think that successful peopl are more will to tri new thing . they probabl develop new thing and also give impuls for futur . that mean that they are pre - thinker of futur idea . in spite of my opinion i could imagin that there are success peopl who take risk . these peopl normal are veri self-confid and assur of themselv becaus they do not care of the peopl who depend on their decis . anoth topic to talk is the possibl to take risk in there free time , like a hobbi . when someth wors happen they will just be rispons for themselv , expect they have children and wife . in conclus i would say that successful peopl tend to be more risk love than other but they should be awar of their respons .
