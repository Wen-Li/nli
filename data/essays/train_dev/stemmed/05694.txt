in gener i agre with thi statement . when are too fright to beginn new project , activ or somethink els , you do n't give yourself the chanc to develop . in my opinion especi in a busi environ you could have no success without new idea and inov everi day . you must face challang everi day . if you just relax and do onli the think you alreadi know , your competitor wo n't give you a chanc . in the modern societi you alway have to be the best . you must be the owner of mani abil . if your mind is not open you ca n't have ani success . when you regard famou success peopl , like ... for exampl , they all had idea and no fear to fight for them . but on the other hand , if you do the thing you know well you are get better and better . at least , i would say , you have to be open for new thing but you also should improv the abil in the think you alreadi know .
