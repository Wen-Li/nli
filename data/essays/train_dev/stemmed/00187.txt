sinc i wa a littl girl , i have heard and read mani success stori of differ peopl . i believ and agre that success peopl are the one who tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . first of all , my danc teacher alway told us to get out from our comfort zone when we are choreograph the danc . the dancer are tend to choreograph their favorit genr . for exampl , a dancer , who like a genr of modern , ha more possibl to choreograph a modern piec . howev , if that person take a risk to choreograph a hip hop piec , there will also be a possibl to be a success choreograph . my teacher told us that we are go to research and think about the choreographi if we tri new thing , which in thi case a choreographi . mani of her student creat masterpiec by take risk ; those piec were select for the state festiv and other honor show . there is a chanc to becom success , but also not success . it is a life . some peopl take risk and then lose their properti such as money , famili , and more . take risk ha a huge risk . howev , if we tri again and again , success will come back to us . one of the famou cartoonist in the world , walt disney , had to tri new thing . becaus hi compani stole hi charact from him and gave it to other cartoonist of that compani , he lost hi job . but , he never stop to put effort ; the micki mous wa born . even though he could earn so much money , he tri new thing such as make a long anim film for the first time . the thing he tri had alway risk , but he becam success eventu . he wa a person that if he love hi job , he will alway tri new thing . thi is one way to be a success . in conclus , we should never stop tri new thing in our live . even we face hardship , if we tri so mani time , those effort we put will be paid off . thi is how to be success . therefor , i agre that success peopl are one who tri new thing and take risk .
