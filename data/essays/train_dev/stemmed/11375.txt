i disagre about the opinion that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . i think it is true that young peopl , like student , have much time for go out with their friend . but after their graduat school , their life style are go to be chang so suddenli especiali in tokyo . first of all , they lose their privat time . they have to work hard that they have to improv their ablil in job to earn more money , for the payment for the apart fee , havi date , save futur marriag , or have holiday . old peopl have more money and time than the peopl in young gener . that the main reason whi i disage to the thi opinion . first of all , they have a better experi than the younger peopl . fine food , shop good qualiti funitur , cloth , go abload by crues etc . from my experi , it could be said , i 'm have more better life in my 30 's than i experienc in my 20 's . i could enjoy eat out at good restaur , go preciou classic concert , buy good qualiti cloth . onli one thing i can said about neg point about old peopl is , they do n't have enough energi physic sometim . for exampl , my hobbi is use to be ski , but i feel like start lose enogh physic tough recent , to keep high speed in the big snow slope , keep move from mountain to montain . i know it is natur chang for everyon , and not onli me to face it , but actual it is kind of sad for me . but i 'm sure about that peopl could enjoy better life after get old thant the yonger gener . they know what they want . and more , they could have enough financi confid and much more free time for leisur to enjoy their life style .
