advertis usual make product seem much better than they realli are . when a person walk down the street or is walk around in a mall , they are abl to see all kind of flyer that exageratet the best characterist of the product they are advertis make them look better than what they are . from my person experi i can say that thi is true . onc when i wa around twelv a compani call me to see if i want to do a comerci for a new cooki that wa go to be sold in panama . sinc i wa a kid and they were go to pay me , i said that i would do it , no problem . when i got to the place , they hand me a script , i wa suppos to eat the cooki , and it didnt matter if it wa good or bad but i had to pretend that i like it anyway . i went to work with other kid that were go to make that cooki look good . when we start film , instead of hand us regular cooki out of the box they were special cooki , these were taken appart and they had been ad doubl fudg , so they look better , and they were made present by some guy who wa fix the vanilla fudg insid the cooki with a knive . instead of us use normal cooki from the packag , they had to make special cooki that look better than what they reallt tast , becaus i can sure say that the cooki look good but they didnt realli tast that good . not onli thi happen with food but also with toy . for exampl the hot wheel comerci for kid look great . on tv you would think the car are abl to do flip and land back on track and keep go no problem , but onc you buy that item , the thing fall appart . the wheel of the car start fall , it jump out of the track to never land on it againa , and to put the track togeth is almost as hard as tri to build a rubik cube . in conclusioin item in advertis alway look better than what they realli are , so peopl can sell them . thi is a sell techniqu , but you have to be care , becaus you can exagger what an item doe , but you can make it up . therefor , to be abl to sell someth , in the advertis it ha to look better than what it realli is , and that is what peopl usual do , and base from my experi i think that is exactli what goe on .
