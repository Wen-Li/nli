i do not agre thi opinion . in my idea , older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl do . when person is young , he and she do not know what is the life and how import of the life is . becaus they have less experi of life . they mayb catch up with money , they mayb aband themself in the luxuri . they can not recogn life is import to them . when person grow up , they work for life and they marri and then have the babi of their own . they begin to realiz that life is more import for them . a lot of person thought that young proson have the opptun to enjoy life , and older person is late for enjoy the life . i ca n't agre the idea . young person begin to their new life of them own . they just enjoy themself not the life . life includ famili , associ , work , friend and so on . older person enjoy more famili and associ , compar with young person enjoy more themself and friend . in the sorround of me , there are a lot of youni person selfish and compet . they can do whatev they want to achiev their goal . when they got about 30 or more year old , they began to realiz the life . they found they have lost a lot import life with their famili and friend . they becam peac , and began to enjoy the real life . when they enjoy the life , they found which is more import for them yet . in my conclus , older peopl enjoy their life more than young person do . but when young person got enough experi of the life , they will begin to love it . recogn the life need a long courc of experi . recogn themself is also import to enjoy the life . so young peopl enjoy life less than older peopl do .
