student are be ask to be more and more competit , they have to learn a great amount of thing and they also have to understand what they 're learn . but , do we consid that understad is the main qualiti they have to get or do they have to challeng their memori for everyth ? in order to answer to thi question , i 'm go to think first if we can understand without learn and then i 'll evok the import of both learn and understand in the studi . when you 're in class listen to a lectur , you want to focu on the main idea develop by the lectur : you want to know if , onc outsid , you 'll be abl to explain what you 've heard to a friend . first the fact are n't the thing you want to keep in mind ; you desir to rememb onli the major concept and idea you have understood . but for instanc , in a histori class you can understand the caus of the second world war except that if you have forgotten all the date about the conflict nobodi will follow you ; inde the date help the listen to understand what ha happen and give him some hint to understand caus of the war in a global way . so it seem pretti hard for a student to understand everyth if he doe n't begin with learn . consequ , a student ha to work with hi memori , he must be awar that he ca n't understand the whole subject main idea if he ha n't learn a littl . you can explain easili a concept to someon if you have in mind all the background that you 've learn about the subject befor . for exampl , if you know which event ha happen when and where and if you can link it with other event then you understand thank to what you have been taught by your teacher ! to conclud , i 'll sum up the previou point i 've discuss about : it 's obviou that you can tri to understand everyth you 're told without learn but you 'll have some issu to understand the whole thing , you might understand a part of it . if you complet your understand with a seriou learn then you get the opportun to master your subject and then you becom what we can call a great student .
