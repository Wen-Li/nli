it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . first of all i would like to talk about the broad knowledg of mani academ subject . it is so much better to know alot of inform about differ subject , at least a background inform about everi subject . thi is becaus if a person read about someth that he/sher had read or learn about it would be easir for him/her to understand what he/sh is read about , at least a background of it . for exampl , in school everi student studi so mani subject , some subject relat some not . student in school learn about differen background of everi subject they take . thi would help them to see and choos what they want to be in futur . secondli , i can say that learn about one subject would be much more deeper inform about a subject than a background . moreov , it would be much useful to choos what mager or what sort of jobe he/sh would like to be in in futur . for exampl , if a student chose aspesif thing to laern about like bussenss she woul lear alot about busenss more that ani thing that it would lead him/her to be a bussenss man/women in futur . howev , i think that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject can relat with learn about one subject . thi is becaus without a broud knowledg student can not choos there futur job if they want one , or it would be harder for them to choos what path they would go in the futur if they dont have a broad knowledg . in my opinion , i prefer to have at least a background about mani differ subject . then use my broad knowledg to help me choos what sbject i prefer to studi about more , so that it would be easier for me to have a job in futur .
