i know lot of older peopl enjoy life after retir their job or grew up their children becaus they can have time and money that young peopl have , so they can do anyth they want . howev , i agre young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . there are sever reason . first of all , young peopl are helthi becaus they are young , so they can be activ and cheer than older peopl . helthi is veri import to do anyth . it is easi to get sick or ill for older peopl that young peopl . for exampl , my uncl who had hi own bussi got ill after retir hi job . when he wa young he had lot of hobbi and he wa enjoy hi life . eeven though he wa busi , he did make time to have fun becaus he wa helthi and veri activ person . howev , sinc he got sick , it wa hard time to live , even though he had lot of money and time . secondli , young peopl can have dream more that older peopl becaus they can have time to live . older peopl feel limit to live , but young peopl never think about their death becaus they think it would not happen soon . it give young peopl lot of dream . when peopl have a dream , they can enjoy the time to achean it . therefor , for these reason i agre young peopl enjoy life more than older peropl do .
