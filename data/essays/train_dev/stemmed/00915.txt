here the topic is about whether to have broad knowledg in mani academ subject is better or in one specif subject is better . i agre with the concept of have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better . have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better becaus now a day world is grow in everi aspect , whether it is technolog or scienc etc . i dont think special in one specif subject is enough to enjoy thi growth . for exampl everi present engin other than comput scienc student also should have atleast some knowledg about the comput even though it is not present in their syllabu in the univers , as it is necessari for lot of need like appli job on line and also for the commun purpos etc . at the same time knowledg in mani academ subject give you a wide varieti of knowledg and you will be have lot of chanc to go through and also for the job . now a day peopl with konwledg in mani academ subject are given import for the job compar to those who have special in one specif subject . those peopl have special in one subject will have less chanc and oppertun to get job compar to other . knowledg in mani subject will also give some refreshmet to the mind as we go through differ aspect of the world . some time our person inters will chang , at that moment have knowledg in differ academ subject will help you to set your mind easili for your new interest . but have inters in one subject you cant detract youself to anoth subject if you get bore in the present subject . for exampl i wa interest in the mathemat dure my school age but afterward i found that polit is suitabl for me when compar to mathemat . i just chang my opinion and went through polit in my post graduat , as i am have knowledg in mani subject , i wa abl to set my mind easili . but my friend in the mathemat post graduat are say that it is bore , while studi mathemat but they cant chang it as they are not have knowledg in mani academ subject . in my view , for thi fast chang world have broad knowledg in mani academ subject is better .
