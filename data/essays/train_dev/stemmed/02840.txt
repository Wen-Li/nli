advertis wa creat in order to make peopl buy thing . nowaday , competit is veri signific between brand and each brand ha to struggl in order to convinc peopl to buy their product . market depart deal with that . as for me , i do agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . becaus of globalis , we can nowaday find almost whatev we want in each countri and more particularli in develop countri . which impli that competit is veri rude sinc there are so mani product avail for custom . the choic is huge and how can we decid which product to buy when we do not know them ? as a consequ , brand launch mani advertis campaign . they do their best in order to do the best campaign . thank to advertis techniqu , they enhanc their product as much as they can . becaus they need to have the product that would the most catch peopl 's attent usual , when someon look at a billboard or watch a commerci on tv about a new food product , it is so well promot that we are most of the time veri interest by the product and we are veri excit to go and test it . but we are unfortun often disappoint . inde , if i take the exampl of a new burger launch by mcdonald , the burger will seem veri veri good in pictur . howev , when i will go and tri it , the bread will be too dri , the chees will not have the same aspect . .. and onc again , i will wonder whi thing are almost never the same as in the advertis . advertis agenc usual deal with signific budget and they use amaz techniqu sometim to enhanc the product . not onli , the aspect are not the same , but also the featur are not what they tend to be . actual , some product ensur to do thi or thi and when you tri them , the result is not the one you were expect . final , i would like to add that thi doe not onli occur for product but it also happen for famou peopl . most of the star you see in magazin are gorgeou but in the real life they are not the same , you can be veri surpris . all thi is due to the market that make everyth or evyon be perfect .
