have you never observ gener behaviour of a group of peopl , let us say a school class ? if you have , you probabl distinguish some particularli shi student , some other more quiet or polit . among these behaviour , you sure have been abl to notest the most brave one , the one who did someth that nodobi els did . thi is the leader . the leader is , for instanc , the student who have the courag to tell the professor about someth inconvini . if we bring thi situat out of the school , we can say that the leader , the success person , is the brave one . thi mean that those person who have never the courag to tri someth hard , differ and new , have few possibl to succeed . one reason for wich i believ that brave peopl are like to be success is that they normal love challeng , and challeng are opportun to learn . a genuin curios also character brave peopl often . curios mean aquir a wide knowledg , which a good start point of a success life . on the other hand , those who never pluck up the courag to measur themselv against challeng situat have few possibl to enlarg their skill . moreov , such a behaviour reveal scarc curios and featur peopl who are not will to learn and improv themselv . the second reason is that success peopl definit need to be self confid , and brave peopl necessarli are . in fact , a success life is often the result of mani success battl . in order to win all these , peopl must be confid in their abil . i consid brave peopl to have thi approach when they chase new challeng . in conlcus , i definit believ that a brave approach to challeng is requir from those who want to be success in their live . brave peopl are not frighten of the event that may occur , and thi approach in my opinion is the right one in order to lead the situat .
