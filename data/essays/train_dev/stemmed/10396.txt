tradit , mani peopl , includ those who are go to advertis their own product , believ that adversi make product seem much better than they are and thi enhanc imag from the advertis help to increas the sale of the product . howev , my opinion is that thi common sens doe not alway make sens . the cheif reason for my view is that ill-manufactur advertis could have bad effect on the product imag or sale perform . if inform about a certain product which custom want to know from the advertisemet are not provid in the advertis , most of custom may forget the product after look at the advertis . moreov , mani advertis could not succeed in focus on the characterist which the custom want to catch in the advertis . the anoth reason for my view is that core valu or qualiti of product could not be invent even though most famou artist or advertis agent manufactur the advertis . real valu or real qualiti could be diffus by anoth type of advertis such as blog in the internet , word of mouth , or articl in the newspap or megazin . some might argu that even though advertis could be ill-manufactur or creat diffrent effect expect , most of advertis could creat product effet . but there are mani exampl that show how much sever effect the ill-manufactur advertis had . for exampl , a car manufactur advertis put a stress on more security-guarante facil in a small car . but most of prospect small car custom wanto know how much low the price of the new small car becaus the most of prospect custom will use that car as a second car and have alreadi security-strengthen big car . in sum , i concur with the opinion that advertis could creat good effect on the product imag or sale growth . howev , i believ that thi rule could not appli to most advertis .
