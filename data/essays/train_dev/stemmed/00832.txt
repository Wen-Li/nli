i think that be a succes person includ the fact of be one of those peo new thing and , therefor , take the risk relat . if a person is openmind and ha as much experi as possibl , thi person will have a lot more opportun . the experi offer the possibl of have new origin idea : for exampl in busi , you will have the opportun of start a new market if your idea is origin ; and that is what happen , for exampl , to the chew gum market : the person that start thi busi did not sell chew gum at the begin . thi product wa given as a present to the peopl that bought soap ; thi idea wa origin , but it work ! so the busi chang from a `` soap busi '' to the chew gum one . tri new thing also mean , in my opinion , be a competit person . a person that is competit with himself , with hi life , alway want new challeng . be a person that can afford to face a challeng with himself , he will not be scare when he ha to handl with someon els , and with the relat risk . he know hi own skill and how to use them ; and he is also awar about hi weak alreadi . thi self confid rise the opportun to be the winner of the challeng . last , but not least at all , peopl that tri new thing not onli have to deal with risk , but sometim with failur . thi is the other way of learn while make experi . peopl know what is `` wrong '' to do in situat , and how not to fail again . for all these reason , i definit think that success peopl are those who tri new thing , learn from them how to reach success , how to implement it , and what to avoid so not to fail . they must be a littl brave and learn from their own experi .
