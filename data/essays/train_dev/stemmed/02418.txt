i love my car and ca n't give up use it and i do n't agre with the statement that say there will be fewer car in twenti year than today . i have three major reason to say that . one of them is newer type of car are be produc and the second is the transport with car is ok for mani peopl and the third one is the expens of the chang that to be done for peopl to transport the first reason for not agre the statement is that i think rather than extinct , newer type of car are be produc . these type includ car which work with electr power , hydropow and in the next futur i 'm sure there will be car which will work with mani other thing . there are also plan to creat car which is fli near to surfac and thi will provid place for some more car . the second reason is that i think there is no other way of transport rather than car which are so effect and so cheap . now the usag of car are veri huge . there are other way of transport for exampl plane . they ca n't belong to anyon in the world but car can be use by most of the peopl . nowaday mani peopl have car and in my countri thi number will increas as the develop of the countri . car are effect for transport for mani peopl the third reason for not agre thi statement is that to give up use car there should be radic chang . they should be veri expens chang , that is need to compans for the need of transport of the increas popul of the world . instal a new system is requir and for thi system mani new research should be conduct which will be expens and construct will requir money veri much again . to conclud , as i state the reason abov there will be more car than now in twenti year . one of them is newer car type and the second one is the effici of car and the expens of the chang . there is an air pollut problem becaus of the usag of the car unfortun but i believ if thi problem is solv car would be more critic and would a better place in the peopl 's eye .
