i fervent agre with thi futurist statement that in twenti year , fewer car will be in use than there are today . firstli , i believ that in the absenc of effect and econom solut to the problem of fuel today , with pollut and traffic on the rise , there is a press need to revitalis our public tranport system and take approprait measur to discourag privat transport . car , that are the symbol of privat convey not onli heavili contribut heavili to the increas pollut in everi major citi of the world , but is also unnecessarili clutter up the scarc space that we have left on the earth and it road . thi also is lead to a disastr number of road accid that are the caus of more death today than ani epidem or war . twenti year from now , i do not see the sever of these problem allevi unless we take some effect step as reduc privat transport , which i think is inevit . in countri of europ , the privat transport even today is minim use . secondli , with global all around us , with boundari of distanc , cultur and languag rapidli dissolv , i see the car get obsolet simpli becaus our need would be larger . with technolog , i believ that local distanc would becom inconsequenti and car would give way to more advanc form of travel . alreadi , the first space tourist ha made a success trip and is back ! with an orwellian outlook of the world , i have a dystop vision of the world ; a world where for stabil and effici , the state would assum power , where perhap person express is render unimpor and the societi or the commun is primari . in such a societi , the car which is basic a symbol of prestig and statu ha absolut no space . today , where we stand , with the all pervas internet grow beyond limit , in twenti year the world would be more of a virtual commun . you and i would have a more predomin virtual exist than a real one . our basic need to surviv everyday , chore that requir us to move around on a daili basi would be conveni done away with with the virtual world . believ me , we 'd be thrive on our virtual entiti a lot more , depend on it for our daili need without move an inch ! what doe a car have to do in such a scenario ? with the abov point , i have made a cogent and strong statement assert that car have no place in our world twenti year from now .
