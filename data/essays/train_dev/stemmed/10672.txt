we could probabl get two complet differ opinion for thi question that is ask which is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or have one specialis one for specif subject . i think it is better to have one specialis knowledg of the specif subject than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , becaus we can learn more detail fact of subject , can be proffecion about thi topic , and it 's much use for our live . first of all , by learn one particullar subject , peopl can learn more detail fact . it is imposs to learn everyth with detail . howev , it may be possibl to learn about one thing quit well . then , how come we need to have mani knowledg with less detail or inform ? one specialis thing is much more helpful . for instanc , it wo n't help anyth if we know hundr of `` hello '' in differ languag . it is much better to be abl to speak one langaug quit fruentlli when we visit somewher or meet peopl . second , peopl can be profession for the one thing , if they learn about the thing well . a littl borad knowledg for mani thing may be useful sometim but it will not help if we need the proffesion advic for someth . in conclus , i would like to say that it is better to have one particullar specif knowledg of somet than have littl knowledg of mani academ subject .
