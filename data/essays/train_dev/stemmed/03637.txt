i strongli agre with the statement . most advertis make product better than they realli are . first , advertis enphat the qualiti of their product with catchi slogan : for exampl it is like to see a pictur of a beautiful woman with the shirt or dress they want to sell take your attent away from other inform . sometim advertis give true but incomplet inform : it happen to me with adsl connect . they assur free assist call a free number , but when i call that number i heard a record voic tell me to call anoth number with expenc fare . second , they usual do not talk about disadvantag : for exampl it is easi to observ advertis about sport car and seldom do they give inform about how much gasolin they need for run one mile or about tax owner ha to pay . in addit , advertis often do not give ani advic about where or when the product can not be use . that is veri import in particular if item are medicin or noxiou substanc . for exampl it happenen that , after the ii world war , larg amount of pesticid ddt against insect wa use in agricoltur , and mani peopl use it also on hi bodi in order to keep danger insect away , in the spite of it toxic . coclud , i do not say advertis should be ban , howev i think that advertis inform and suggest from product advertis should be taken care
