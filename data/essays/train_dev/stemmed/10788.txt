progress and develop in a gener way wa made by hardwork peopl who special themselv in a specif subject . one question could be ask weither it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . in my opinion everi one should have a minimum of knowledg in mani academ subject but sooner or later we have to choos a specif subject otherwis progress will stop or grow veri slowli . for exampl what would had happen if no one had studi biolog specif ? medecin would n't have evolv and diseas and virus would have spread without vacccin or medecin to stop them . we could give similar exampl for transport that are progress rapidli sinc the invent of the wheel peopl work veri hard to invent new way of transport ( the bycicl then the car then the plane . .. ) if everi one had a broad knowloedg of mani academ subject mankind would have veri slightli evolv from the stoneag . all the studi 's , the research help the world not onli in a scientif way but even in a econom way , studi 's of busi have help the busi owner to know how to manag effect their compani 's on a larg scale thi would help a whole countri 's economi and will then help the fight against poverti . it is essenti for a healthi world to understand and studi specif subject that could help us in our live but thi doe n't mean that the person that is specialis in a subject should be complet ignor of all exept thi specif subject ; like i said befor we should all have a minimum of gener knowledg of mani academ subject but for the sake of progress we should special ourselv in a specif subject .
