i would have to say it is more import to understand idea , i will explain to you whi . first of all we have the memori problem . most of the school around the world and also most of the univers want their student to learn fact and concept , and everi student is capabl of do so in an affect way , howev thi is just temporari knowledg , those concept and fact will be eras from their brain probabl right after the test , if not , they wil be there for jsut a littl longer but not enought . on the other hand , when a student understand the idea he doe not have to memoric anyth , becaus he use he logic to infer thing . that is the kind of knowledg that will remain with him for a longer amount of time . second , we have the learn and appli factor . when a student memoric or learn fact , is perfectli abl to approv the test and gradut , but when thi student turn into a proffesion , a doctor for exampl , if the onli thing he did in colleg wa learn by heart averi littl concept and fact , when he get to the real life as a proffesion , he wo n't be abl to give a diagnosi as good as someon that actual understood instead of learn . whi ? becaus not everi case , and everi problem ( not just in medicin but in ani other major ) is exactli the same as the one befor , and most of them are not exactli the same as the one we saw on the text book or the one we learn by heart . so the student , now proffesion , that undestood the materi will not tight himself to the definit he learn but he will take into account all possibl explan while the one that just memor will see the problem within a fenc . final , it is cientif prove that understand concept help the knowledg to prevail with time . i 'm not say memor is bad , i 'm just say that it should n't be the onli thing to take into account when you are train a futur profession , becaus at the end , the most import thing is not the knowledg you have or how mani text book you learn by heart when you were in colleg , but the way you use all that knowledg .
