there are two way of travel . one is travel in a group led by a tour guid and the other is travel by our own . there are advantag and disadvantag in each way and peopl have differ view of choos which one is superior than the other . my opinion is that travel with a tour guid is not better than travel myself . there are sever reason of my opinion . firstli , mani peopl choos to travel in a group in order to save money . it is certainli true . howev sometim a tour guid take travel to shop and make peopl to spend more money than they expect to . thi issu ha been point out mani time in the news . secondli , the time for a travel is limit when travel in a group . usual , tour guid ha plan their schedul for each day . for exampl , when we are go to a museum , tour guid give certain time for stay in that museum becaus they have to move to anoth place . in thi case travel can not go through the place care becaus they have to hurri . thirdli , the reason i prefer travel by myself is that i can visit anywher i want to . i do not have to move within the group . for exampl , if i visit the foreign countri , i alway go to the market first . it is becaus market is the place that i can feel their cultur and meet peopl origin live in that place . howev , usual , tour guid do not take travel to the local market . instead , they take peopl to depart store where they can spend money . lastli , sever disagr can occur when travel in a group . when i wa travel china with some chines , we have to argu for the food that we want to eat . therefor we had to travel rest of the day without talk to each other . peopl travel in a group have to consid characterist of peopl in the group . otherwis they have to travel in a uncomfort condit . in colclus , the reason i prefer travel by my own is that travel in a group can cost more money , the time and place for travel is limit and disput can take place . i love travel therefor i travel a lot , these point are base on my experi .
