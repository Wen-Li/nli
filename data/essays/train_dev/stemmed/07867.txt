travel in a group led by a tour guid present mani advantag . first , you can share and exchang your opinion and feel on site you visit with the groupmat . it is often veri enjoy and refresh to listen to other peopl ' feedback . second , the tour guid take you onli to locat that matter the most or that are the most repres of the countri visit . therefor you avoid wast of time decid where to go and whether the design locat worth the visit . the guid is often a great sourc of import inform about the visit site . he can turn the visit in a veri interact way , someth you could n't get from a book . final , the tour and the guid make the travel much more enjoy as everyth is alreadi plan . there is no need then to bother with organ detail and unexpect event . everyth is handl by the guid and the tour compani . howev , travel in a group and a tour guid may also have some disadvantag . in my eye , be in a group mean that you no longer master your time . unless be selfish and impos your idea to other , you can not do what you want . you got to stay within the bound and respect other peopl ' wish . and listen to someon whine the whole day becaus the schedul doe not pleas him is inde extrem annoy . besid thi , a tour mean everyth is alreadi plan . there is therefor no room for sudden chang of schedul or unexpect locat to visit . the exit might be undermin . if the tour compani provid poor servic or the guid lack knowledg about the locat , then your experi may turn out to be veri disappoint and frustrat . anoth veri bad habbit of tour compani and guid is the fact that they often take you to locat , restaur , museum with which they have a partnership , a deal , so you are invit to purchas item in those locat and not other . person i dislik veri much those practic as i have the feel to be a kind of toy in their hand . my best advic is to choos care the tour compani . to reli on other peopl 's feedback , friend in order to determin which tour compani suit the best our wish and need . about the group , my suggest is to welcom thing as they come and all the time to focu on what pleas you the most and to sweep away ani littl annoy detail .
