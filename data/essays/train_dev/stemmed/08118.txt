i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i have two reason to support my opinion . first of all , i believ an understand of a concept will lead to further understand . for instanc , without the primari understad of how muslim is practic and worship , one will not be abl to fulli understand whi a certain ritual exist in that religion . by understand idea of a fact , one will also be abl to develop hi or her abil to think , and to interconnect differ aspect of numer inform on variou topic . an exampl will be understad the concept of darwin 's evolut theori . through thi understand , a student will not onli learn a new biolog fact , but he or she will also be abl to connect thi inform in a histori class when a discuss on the industri revolut ( the time period when the theori wa first introduc ) . the student will learn that the revolut had allow quick spread of the scientsit 's idea than befor . with the combin of the biolog and histor aspect of darwin 's theori , the student will be abl to recogn the difficulti the scientist face when he had inform the societi hi new idea , and had receiv mani critic about it . secondli , i am against simpli learn fact , becaus i seek no point in mere memor a piec of inform . even is one wa abl to answer a question correctli , if the person wa unabl to explain the reason for the answer , not much credit can be given . let 's say a man knew that mix an imputiri in water will lower it melt point . even if he did know that fact , if he did not know how thi could help him in a real life situat , how much would thi knowledg mean to him ? what would be the point in know such thing ? on the other hand , if the man had the understand that an impur lower water 's melt point , hi understand will allow him more think , integr thi fact to the other knowlegd the man possess . the man will incorpor hi knowledg that salt is an impur , that snow is also a form of water , and that the ground becom slipperi when snow melt . as a result , he know that he can pour salt over snow to prevent it from melt quickli , prevent peopl to slip . with these reason , i beliv it is more import for student to understand idea than to learn just the fact
