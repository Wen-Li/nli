i think that tri new thing and take risk is not necessarili of condit to be successful but that it is a condit to get out of mass . i think peopl do good work should be recognis for it and have success in their carrer even if ther do n't do anyth new . i know a small shop where the man repair show and bag . the man is do veri good work at a veri reason price . it is noth special but the qualiti of it < s wor is known in the town and he alway have client . howev , the man is neither veri rich or veri famou . if thi is the kind of success one target , then i think the person must absolut tri new thing and take risk to distinguish from the other peopl . among the peopl we rememb the more are the inventor and discover . they often tri a lot of thing befor do the iinvent that made the famou .
