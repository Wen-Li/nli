i am agre with the statement of young peopl 's not give enough time to help their commun . it is my belief that , there are sever reason that caus thi situat . but , not onli the young peopl , but also the environment situat are the reason of thi problem . thi problem may be first explain by the chang in the young peopl . it is my belief that we are get more selfish from gener to gener and start to think onli ourselv . a few year ago , when our countri is in a difficult situat , everyon ha the conciou to do someth for his/her countri , but now we onli think about what can we do for save ourselv . one of the caus of thi problem is the conciou that is given to the young peopl in their home , by their parent . the most import place where a person learn most of the thing that he/sh will use dure his/her life is his/her home . in the older time , parent are more care about thi situat , but as the time pass , as the problem of the parent increas about their children , give commun conciou is not anymor an import problem for the famili . anoth place , that the young peopl are educ is school . at school , the teacher are the peopl who is respons for teach the import of the commun and help to these children . teacher should give the conciou , explain the good way of help the commun and describ the posit thing that they will gain by help the commun to the student . for exampl the teacher should explain the difficulti that the peopl have who have mental disordinar to his/her student . by thi way he/sh can affect the student and caus them to want to help that peopl . we should start think about our commun again and tri for someon els . help someon els make the peopl feel proud of him/herself and caus to feel good . if we do not help our commun , we can not expect someth from our commun . we should think our expect , other peopl 's expect and behav accord to thi . we should also help the next gener to gain thi conciou again .
