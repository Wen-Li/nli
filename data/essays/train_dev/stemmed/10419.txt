from my point of view , i would say travel alon is the best way can go and have fun an dnot worri about anyth els . travel alon mean , someon is abl to go at there own pace , not worri about other , have a good time , meet other and have an alon time . travel alon is more relax , you have no stress , no on etel you what to do . it 's also a great experi . you learn on your own , it 's alway good to have acknowledg other thing . if you were to travel with a group led by a tour guid , it would probabl not be a good idea , from my person expereinc . i wa to go onc with my class to a citi call jacmel in port - au - princ haiti led by a tour guid . everyon want to do someth differ . peopl were get aggrev at the tour guid , becaus she wa n't listen to what we want to do . but her job wa to show us around , but she wa talk more then show . it wa n't a great expereinc . although , we actual did have a good time togeth my friend and i , becaus we were togther an da a class trip that 's what we want . fro all the class to go somewher and sati togeth . our goal wa accomplish . from my own experi , i disagre with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . mayb if i were to travel in a group it would have been differ then with a tour guid , becaus you are to do what a tour guid doe . and person , i usual hate when someon tell me to do someth , i get vex . travel alon is a better idea , becaus of mani reason . when travel alon , you do n't have ani respons , but onli yourself , which is a huge burden of a shoulder . experienc , visit , learn alon is great , no one bother you and you do n't get annoy , and i beliv that is a great way to travel , with no stress , it 's all about have a good time , relax and have no worri .
