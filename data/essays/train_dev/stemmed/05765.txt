i agre thi opinion and think there are some reason for it . befor i state possibl reason for that , i explain whi i think young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their communm . in my own experi , i did not attend commun activ like clean or help older peopl veri much . i think it is not onli my case but it hold true of other young peopl around me . therefor i feel thi opinoin is true . then whi thi happen ? it is often said that local commun bond wa much tigher befor and peopl help each other and give much time to help thier commun . for exampl , if it is hard for a famili to take care of their children or elderli peopl , other famili near the famili help them . opposit is also done . if there are some problem , local commun help each other . i think it work well befor . that is so-cal give and take spirit . moreov , there were not tv game or comput , so children play with neibour . that help children to mede friend with other children or commun other adult member of the commun . howev , theseday such commun bond bacam weaker . i don not say it doe not exsist at all , but few commun work well . becaus societi bacam rapid and young peopl busi with their own work and prefer to do thier own thing . they lack time and also lack effort to join . that is a problem . therefor if thi tendenc continu , it would cycl gener to gener . i think we have to see our comun more and engag in help .
