in my opinion tri new thing that you never did befor is the apportun to have more chanc to succeed . becaus peopl would know what they are good at by tri . it is veri import to know what you can do well and also you can enjoy as an exampl , i use to play the piano when i wa young . and i alway thought that i wa good at play piano and it would be my career in the futur . but as i grew up , i experienc that i lost the interest and the joy from play the piano . after that , i start to learn play the violin for a year . but it wa onli interest at first sever month . then i start to take an art class in school . i use to draw and paint when i wa young , but thi time i felt the passion and joy from it . now i look forward to attend in art school . the sever art award that i receiv are alway make me to think learn new thing are so import . although i alreadi decid to studi more about art and work in art industri , i tri to learn new thing to improv myself and for my futur . i learnd tae kwon do two year ago and i tri to meet as mani peopl as i can from volunt work to understand differ kind of peopl and their cultur . also i join mani club in school that i want to do . i think success peopl tri and learn new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . it is like to explor yourself what you are capabl of . also i believ that the tri mani thing will becom your valubl experi and knowledg to make you success and it will be also veri help for your life .
