accord to my person experi i can say that it is true that sometim advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i agre with the statement becaus i think that produc are interest in sell their product even if they know that product they made are not as good as they are describ by the advertis . i think that produc spend a lot of time ( a lot of money too ) tri to creat advertis that make product much better than they realli are . if an advertis is well done , you will probabl buy a product in order to tri it , even if thi product is not realli necessari to you . you simpli buy the new product althought you do n't need it at all onli becaus the advertis impress you . and when you tri the product you bought , or tast it , or use it , you can discov that sometim it is quit differ from how it wa present or describ by the advertis . for instanc if you are look for someth to clean away an oil 's spot from the floor and you see or read about a new product wich is the best in solv problem like thi , you 'll probabl buy it . but , onc at home , you 'll probabl discov that the product you 've just bought is not as fantast as the advertis said . someth like the situat i 've just describ occur to me . i wa search for a new type af nail and i saw on a magazin an advertis of a new nail with a great brigth . for thi reason i went to a shop and i boutgh one of thi nail . when i tri it i discov that it wa ident to a nail that i have befor .
