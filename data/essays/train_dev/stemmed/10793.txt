it is import to have a good background and have a broad knowledg but there is a point when special in one specif subject is need . there is no doubt that a proffession need a broad knowldeg of mani difffer subject to build a strong background . for exampl a petroleum engin , like me , must take a lot of subject which could appear not be relat to what a petroleum engin need to learn in order explor , exploit or process oil . such is the case of subject like learn techniqu , comput program or environment educ but those subject definet help on the way you learn the special subject as in learn techniqu , or how a program can be use to solv a problem on comput program or even how to prevent an environment impact dure ani stage of oil process . although all those subject mention befor and other , can give an engin a good background , after that point an engin must special to focu the atent on a major in wich , as i can see , the more work an attent you pay on the more you will be abl to suc on . continu with the exampl , on petroleum engin , there are three major specifiqu branch : reservoir , drill and product , acord to wich the attent will be focuss on find and character the locat of the place where the hydrocarbon is , to creat the condit to bring the oil to the surfac or to handl it when it ha reach the surfac respect . in order to special on one of those field or branch , specif subject must be taken . accord to what i 've previous point , i think that is import to special , as in the exampl mention abov , in one mayor field wich can lead to an focus attent environ in a major that would be studi and research result on an improv and focus knowledg .
