i do not agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . the reason for my believ so are sever . first of all peopl have divers interest and tast . travel in a group led by a tour guid follow one path for everyon . just as one shirt can not fit all , similarli one tour can not fulfil the need of everi tourist . a tour guid take peopl to major attract of the destin and some peopl may like one place more than the other and henc may want to spend more time at the place of their like . thi is not possibl when one is travel in a group led by the guid . secondli there are some place where one would want to travel alon . travel in a group may compromis one 's privaci so in such situat travel in a group doe not make sens . i know of some coupl who went on their honeymoon to a tourist locat in a group . i believ that travel in group can take away the romanc away from such trip . furthermor some peopl gain more pleasur in travel alon becaus of sens of adventur that it provid which travel in a group with tour guid just can not provid . anoth disadvantag of travel in a group led by tour guid is that you dont have control over your itenari or travel plan . if due to some reason one loos the group then one may have to face a veri hard time to complet the trip just becaus that person did not plan the trip but tour guid did . lastli by not travel in a group led by tour guid you can plan your trip accord to your time and your financi condit . you may choos first class air ticket if that is what you prefer or may choos to stay in a cheap hotel if you dont want to spend a lot of money on the trip . you may choos to extend your trip if you like or shorten it if there is an emerg . in sum , base on the reason describ abov , i disagre with the statement that travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best way to travel .
