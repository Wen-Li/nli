in my opinion and in my own experic , i have trevel with my parent sinc i wa a child , and normal we book the hotel and the rest of the trip is invent it , i mean we decid where to go and how much time spend in each place , we do not have to depend on ani guid . if you want to travel in eruop for exampl and you have onli one month , sometim is better to have a guid becous he know 's the best place that you can visit , but the problem is that he go to tell you when you have to eat , when you have to rest and even worst when you have to wake up . when i went to work in bangladesh , i did an internship there , anyway , when i finish my job , i start to travel in myanmar and then in the north of india , i bougth a guid book , call lonli planet , with that book i knew which place i could visit , where can you eat , sleep and even better how much money you have to pay . i like to travel by myself becous you can learn more about the cultur of each place and sometim you can take part of it . when i arriv to bangladesh i never thoung that i wa to find a girlfriend there , i did not tri to meet a muslim girlfri , i met a girl from switzerland and actual she is my girlfriend , thi kind of experi i think is more difficult to live it if you travel in a group . for exampl in myanmar i met one local person and when i saw him again , he invit me at hi wed , thi aspect are the best of the trip becous you never think that is go to hap . anoth good thing if you travel by yourself is that you go to meet new friend and you can join them in their trip . i do not say that in a group you are not goin to meet peopl , of cours you will . my advis is : if you are young and you can travel like a backpack , do it , becous when you are old and you can not walk long distac , i think is better to pay a tour guid , becous you do not have to worri about anyth onli you have to wake up earli . you go to remeb more if you face some problem dure your trip becous you have to handl it .
