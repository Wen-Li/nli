i think there are mani way to trip . but i think travel with just a few peopl is much better . there mani reason can support my think . one of the reason is travel with group led by guid , peopl should adapt their think . the travel in group can be contrast to work in compani . work in compani i should follow my leader , so i ca n't do what i want to do veri well . also it just contain my opinion littl bit . but work in own busi or small busi , they can share there opinion , and they can have dicuss , they can find best way to solv . the trip with few peopl is same case as work in own busi . trip with few peopl , they can share there idea also they can choos best way to enjoy there trip . anoth reason , travel with tour guid , i feel not comfort . i should follow the trip rout which plan by tour guid , also i should be part of the group . for exampl , i trip the franc for have great time in effel tower in pari . if i trip with group led by a tour guid , the tour guid will set up the schedul for trip but there are just 3hour for tour in pari . so i ca n't have enough time for effel tower , and i tour in anoth region that im not interest in. and it can cost much more than travel with few peopl . becaus you should pay for tour guid , and the hotel which chosen by tour guid . last reason , peopl can develop their respons and abil of independ by travel with alon or just few peopl . and it can be more excit . becaus you should have to ask to the peopl in that region and search about that area . sometim it make you cost money and time but it can be good experi to you . therefor travel with few peopl or alon is the best way to trip and have fun in trip . also trip is not just for fun , you can learn the cultur by search that area .
