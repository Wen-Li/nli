i do not agre to thi point of view , that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . there are a lot of aspect , which speak against thi . the best exampl is in my opinion a doctor . a doctor help peopl , when they have physic problem . i do not think that a doctor tri new thing and take risk , becaus thi can lead to veri neg effect , if he doe thi . so he alway ha to do , what he ha learnt and nevertheless he is veri success , although he alway doe he know how to do well , but he help other peopl . anoth exampl is the race sport . the car pilot can not take risk , becaus also there thi can lead to veri neg effect and they would risk there own life , if they drive danger just to win a race and to be succesful . there are a lot of other job , where you can not take ani risk becaus thi would have great effect on your own or other peopl ' life . but zou can also be success , if you take risk or trz new thing , what the exampl show .
