i total agre with thi statement , caus i think it realli the best way to discrib a success person . i will start by mention whi i think that true , let say some bussi man think of start a new busi , and the man who is realli consid a good exampl in my opinion is bill gate . he start the microsoft while it realli wa a veri riski and new invest to the world who realli didnt know anyth about oper system and so on , so intorduc thi new oper system by bill gate in microsoft wa realli riski and a new thing , but bill gate took thi risk and now he is the richest man on earth . well ofcours we cant just say that take a risk and do new thing is enough for a success person , thi person need to keep track hi busi and have thi kind of enthusiazm of be better and better . let say bill gate just start hi bussi with microsoft with the first window ( oper system ) and then he just took a rest and didnt think of what he could do next or what he could do more to make hi work keep go , that would total led the compani to a break down as there is lot of other compani who are work on the same firm . all i want to say is , if someon is just happi for what he got and know , and dont tri to search for better result , that would end him as a unsuccess person sooner or later . may be a person is so success now and he is take risk and do new thing , and for some reason thi person just stop care or thought that is enough for now , in my opinion in our new world thi (( i think that enough for now )) think would not work anymor , caus life is chang so fast and peopl keep ask for more new and better thing all the time so we have to keep runnig in the right track . my opinion may took the bussi side of the statment but i realli think our world now is realli just live by busi and manag and the more you are success in thi field the more you are success in your life , as life is all about how to learn new thing and risk to accept the new challang that encount through your life everyday .
