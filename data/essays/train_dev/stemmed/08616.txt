accord to thi statment , i think that student should learn the fact more than just understand the idea and concept becaus if they just understand the idea and the concept , they are n't realli understand what they have learn . and , if they just understand the idea and the concept , they ca n't use what they have learn in the futur . if student just understand the idea and the concept , they do n't know what they have alreadi learn . for exampl , a student want to learn how to swim , he know the idea and the concept , but he doe n't tri it befor . he thnk that he know how to swim ; howev , he doe n't . or if a student is learn how to play piano , he listen to the teacher teach him how to play the piano , he know mani thing about how to play a piano , but he doe n't play the piano befor . doe he know how to play a piano ? the answer is not , he doe n't know how to play it . becaus he is just a paper soldier , he just know how to talk , but not to play . nevertheless , if student learn the fact , they can use it in the futur . student studi mani thing at school , but there are onli a littl knowleg they can use in the the futur . for exampl , if the studen studi busi at school , after they finish the school . they can be the businessman . if some peopl studi nurs at school , they can be a nurs in the futur . howev , if those peopl just understand the idea and the conceptsat school , they will mkae some troubl in the futur . there are mani thing happen suddenli , if they do n't now the fact , they ca n't slove the problem if they should face the problem at that time . howev , if they have learn the fact , it is easier to slove a problem than they just understand the idea and the concept on everyth . therefor , student must learn the fact of everyth when they are at school becaus it will affect their futur if they just understand the idea and the concept about everyth
