mani peopl say that young peopl these day do n't give enough time to help their commun . i agre with thi statement becaus modern societi is a fast-pac world , capit 's basi is individu , and that mani peopl do n't live in one place for a long time . the first reason whi i agre with the statement is becaus the world we live in today goe realli fast . everi day is a busi one , with not mani leisur time . young peopl are busi get their educ , and adult are busi work and earn money . thi gradual lead to less notic the commun we live in , which decreas the help given by peopl . also , almost everi countri in the world is run by capit , and the basi for capit is individu . individualim mean that each person care onli about oneself , especi thing that are benefiti to him . help the commun may be benefiti in the futur , but it is not an immedi one , so peopl tend to not care . the final reason is that peopl nowaday do n't stay in one place for a long time , so they do n't feel interest in the place they live in . in the past , when transport wa n't veri develop , a major of peopl live where they were born for most of their life time , so they love the societi thay live in . they will be happi to help the commun that they have known for so long . in contrast , it is veri easi to move around in modern societi , so peopl do n't feel the love for the commun . there are mani more reason that back up the fact that young peopl nowaday do n't give enough time to help their commun , but in my opinion , i think that these three are the main reason . if a commun gave advantag to peopl who help the commun more , everyon would be happi to make the commun they live in a better place .
