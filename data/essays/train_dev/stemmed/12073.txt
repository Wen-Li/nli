some peopl say that have a varieti of knowledg is better , believ that special in one specif subject is more desir . i think that a lot of invent which enabl our human live to be more comfort did n't emerg without specif knowledg offer by some brightest scholar . besid , we can get bigger responsibl and money from specif knowledg . here is the more detail illustr below . first , a lot of ingeni scholar which had a great amount of specif knowledg have invent prodigi invent which make our live use . to put it anoth way , onli such a peopl who have deep knowledg can contribut new find which lead human societi to advanc . for exampl , i think peopl who have wide but shallow knowledg are not capabl of invent the airplan or spacecraft that which enabl us to be transport veri quickli . thi typic show that specif knowledg or researsh in one subject is so import for human societi 's advanc . my second point is that we would benefit from the specif knowledg more than wide and shallow knowledg . in other word , we can get more respons and contribut in our societi . in some job , there is a role that onli such a person who ha the specif idea , skill or knowledg can deal with . in those job , as onli such a person can do , they are to be given bigger respons . moreov , in such a job , we tend to make more money becaus the number of peopl who can deal with the task is so few . when peopl can feel that they have a good respons , contribut to the societi . and make more money , they are definit satisfi . thi idea clearli teach me how specif knowledg is import also fo individu person . howev , some might say that wide knowledg is also import factor to live in the societi . of cours , when we travel to anoth countri or watch some art , we had better have wide ide on it becaus we would be more impress . but i think thi fact yield noth to our societi , thi fact onli make individu person feel content . therefor , thi posit dose n't disprov my point . for these reason , i think have specif and deep knowledg is better than have wide and shallow lnowledg . my idea contribut not onli to the individu but also our societi .
