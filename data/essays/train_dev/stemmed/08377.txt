i believ that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the first reason whi i feel thi is the fast diminish petroleum and crude oil reserv across the world . accord to one survey which i have read in the newspap , all the oil reserv in the world may cater the demand for a maximum of anoth 100 year if the usag continu in the same phase . so the govern may forc the public to use less car to save the petroleum for other import task like cook etc . , anoth reason is that even if we develop car which use electr in the form of charg batteri as fuel instead of petroleum or diesel , the gener of electr need water or coal which are agian non-renew sourc of energi and they can be replenish . thi mean that there is no guarante for those model unless scientist come up with some sourc of energi like hydrogen ga which can be use as a fuel in the broader perspect without ani problem in futur . the third reason for my belief is the chang life style of the peopl around the world . one may wonder how thi effect the usag of car . now a day , the life style of the modern man ha chang a lot , thank to the luxuri provid by the advanc in the technolog . man ha so much been addict to the technolog that , even to go to the nearbi groceri shop , he need a mean of transport like car . so the problem of obes ha start . thi problem is not now confin to onli develop countri . even develop countri are face the same problem . in fact , obes ha becom a global problem . so the doctor are advis the peopl to have more physic exercis . so i think the mean like bicycl may provid the dual benefit and the usag of car will come down . so , given my reason , i agre with the statement that there will be fewer car in use than they are today .
