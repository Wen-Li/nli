the problem of help hi commun is veri difficult to deal with due to hi complex . mani peopl beliv that teenag do not give enough time to help their commun becaus they do not care about it . on the contrari , the statement that peopl give time to chariti can also be partli justifi becaus nowaday peopl tri to be closer with the poor peopl . howev , all aspect into account , i stronghli feel that young peopl do not give enough time to their commun . first , i agre with the statement that explain that young peopl are more interesst in video game or get out than in help peopl . for instanc , when we need to go the see my grandpar , my littl sister alway tri to find a solut to do someth els thi day ( chat on internet , meet some friend , ... ) . anoth exempl to illustr that young peopl do not care about elder is the bu . i can bare understand what cost to young peopl to ask a old man or woman if he or she want the sit . besid it better to stay on your feet after a whole day of lesson where you have been sit for hour . but it is true that is difficult to realli help hi commun , it take a lot of time and nowaday it is hard to find some free time . howev their is some peopl who like to help peopl of their commun , they do a veri nice job like . to illustr my point , i would like to talk about peopl who give some warn food for peopl who do not have enough money to eat someth hot dure the winter time . therefor not everybodi do not care about hi commun , but a lot of peopl think that other peopl do that for them . i am not particularli activ to help my commun , but for me it is a lack of time . but thi year i have decid to help some young peopl to their homework in order to give them the pleasur of work . to sum up we could say that not everybodi do someth for hi commun but i am not sure that 50 year ago it would have been better . i have the feel that peopl help more and more their commun with money for associ . their is an age for everyth and , perhap , the youth who do not care about commun will chang their mind and becom an activ helper . the commun need help whenev and whoever give thi help .
