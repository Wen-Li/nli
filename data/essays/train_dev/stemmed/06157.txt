in my view , it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani acafeim subject . of cours there are some disadvantag of broad knowledg becaus it mean a greater invest of time and tuition . howvev , there are even more compel advantag that i want to explain . i think broad knowledg is effectic for mani area of the life . first , you have a common core of knowledg with other student . if you are an intern student you need to commun in mani part of life . broad knowledg make it easier to have an intellectu exchang with other peopl . in opposit , special lead to a narrow view of thing . thi peopl are not inform about a lot of thing so they can not share their knowlegd with other peopl . an addit point is that broad knowledg increas the opportun of career that you can choos from dure life . from the begin of their studi , peopl often do not know what they want to make in their futur . therefor , broad knowlegd of mani academ subject offer more career opportun than special . perhap , it help or show you a direct in what their job should be in the futur . of cours , peopl often chang their job in their entir live , mayb becaus of their own decis or other circumst . in thi case , broad knowledg can find anoth interest job . final , you get more opportun for leisur time . thi mean , that you are interest in a lot of thing becaus broad knowledg provid a lot of aspect of life . later , educ peopl , when they are older , they will retir their job so they can spend their time on their hobbi that they have develop dure their studi of mani academ subject . in short , i think it is good to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . first , you get exposur to a lot of thing . second , you can choos between mani career . final , you get a broad view of leisur time .
