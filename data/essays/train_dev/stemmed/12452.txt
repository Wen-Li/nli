i claim learn fact is more import than understand idea and concept . i explain my idea by use the exampl of controversi of articl 9 of japanes constitut . just know the idea and concept do not directli mean we have the understand on the topic and have the opinion to act for it . think about the controversi over articl 9 , the argument wether revis it or not . sure , understand it histori that have kept our countri peac for 60 year , and it idea and concept of renounc the war after the traget memori of hiroshima and nagasaki is veri import . but by just `` understand '' the idea of exsit of it , we can not protect ourselv from the threat of terror . so what are we need to live ? we are strongli need to be `` learn '' the fact of the japan face now , and the way we can take for maintain the peac . what happen when north korean missil are launch to japan ? do we not fight for it ? or we fight with self defenc forc which is well known to be not suit the articl 9 itself . therefor , understand the idea and concept are not help in our live . it is a veri ideal . it good to have , but doe not do anyth to us . it 's not practic . what i want to claim in thi essay is that is not the import of articl 9 , but that learn fact and to know what we can do for it next , is much more import in our real live .
