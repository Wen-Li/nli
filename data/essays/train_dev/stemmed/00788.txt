so far as the question is concern , i am not quit at home with the statement that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . although it may be argu that the young popul is not interest with social and polit affair as it wa in 1960s. , i believ that young peopl have willing to help the communti in which they live . it is a well-known fact that the young popul is awar of the commun issu as they are part of a famili which belong to the commun . in other word , the more they live in famili the more they give enough time for their commun . for instanc , in a villag or in a minor group , the young popul do not hesit to particip in the chariti program such as visit the hospit , help the oldest member of the commun . they even becam a member of ngo in order to demand or to help for the commun interest . on the other hand , we may acknowledg that there are some current problem to keep the youth intact with their commun as well as with their famili . the process of globalis suscit a global villag where individu gain univers attribut and goal rather than interest with their commun . therefor , it becom difficult to keep the interest of the internet-bas youth appropri with that of the commun . howev , thi situat can not abandon the young willig to help their commun . consequ , we may consid that young peopl prefer interest in privat and global object rather than commun or social one . yet , we should not ignor that they are also activ in especi help their commun and they find time to help even if they feel themselv busi and overload by the educ or professionn life . briefli , young peopl nowaday give time to help their commun in spite of the difficulti in their globalis and internet-bas live .
