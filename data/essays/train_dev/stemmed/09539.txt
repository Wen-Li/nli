mani peopl want to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . they think other will show respect to them becaus of their broad knowledg . of cours , to know a lot cost time and energi . it 's a provement of one 's abil . if one doe have broad knowledg but not special in ani subject , doe it good for him or her ? i do n't think so . if one ha broad knowledg of mani academ , he or she would n't have enough time to special in ani of the subject as the human-b 's abil and energi are limit . but the fact is , most peopl should or would have work in a certain period of time . a certain work need one to own a specif abil to solv certain problem . that mean the one who have lot of knowledg of mani subject ca n't do anyth at all . their knowledg are too superfici to deal with ani problem . so thi kind of peopl are like to loos their job as their knowledg ca n't help anyth . they are like some old-fashion liberari . anoth ineffici is that they do n't gain as much satifactori feel as the peopl who are special in one specif subject . their broad knowledg may come from book , lectur or internet . but they just recit the thing which are provid by other . they ca n't make up anyth or develop ani idea as they spend all their time in search other 's comment or point of view . in contrast , the peopl who are special in one specif subject can think of idea they are interest in more thoroughli and deepli than other . they may gain someth by their own . we all know that creation can make one pride and content . of cours , repeat other ' thing ca n't be call creation . so the peopl who have broad knowledg can never feel thi kind of feel . what i mean is not to suggest peopl to studi onli one subject . to know mani thing can bring benefit to us . but at the same time , you should special in one subject or you 'll find there is noth you could do in the futur .
