i do agre thi statment but then they can not generalis thi . we have got some statement to support our proposit . nowaday peopl are becom busi with their own work and not find the least of the time to help and bring up the commun around them . the generalis is unfair base on the fact that the voluntari organis are still hold their servic and they are not extinct . ofcours thi proposit is valid in a way that atleast their number ha gone down . thi is becaus a few of the young may be realli interest in help the societi . also veri few class in young student may find these activ help their career in turn . for exampl human and social scienc student find that these activ are improv them in their academ career . so even if they work they may not be work wholeheartedli . in that way the no of peopl find a career in these scienc are in turn veri few . so partli the propon is true . peopl who are more interest may not find time to carri out these activ besid their career . the career head in one direct and themselv in the other . in that way the current societi lose the devot peopl . there should be an organis program to bring up these peopl toward stream like human and social scienc . thi may be a pratic difficulti . so , i am say that thi statement is true to some extent . some peopl are lead their career to dual career . in that case obvious those peopl are more devot . and atleast they ar also peopl are more or less selfinterest and they can n't help other . the reason be their need and desir are not satisfi and they spend almost all of their time in meet their demand . not the least they take care of other in such a case . one possibl reason for such an attitud in young peopl is that they are new to thi world , they look at other and tri to imit them . thi in turn bring in desir to these soul . and they want to enjoy their time meet their demand . so even if it so there are peopl commit enough to live for other . we have got sever exampl in our histori to support our statement . for exampl everybodi in our countri know the name of mother teressa . becaus she is one of those devot to these activ . she made her life `` live for the poor and the diseas '' . when you rememb certain peopl like her we may feel that the given proposit is unfair . but in most other time the statement is true and we have got our soul to give the evid .
