i believ that the degre of stress that a particular person is expos , or ha to be expos , throughout hi or her entir life is veri import . most of us are not awar how stress consum our energi and final , limit our abil to live in a more relax way . i am convinc that stress doe n't contribut in the level of happi for a person . i 'd say that the more stress a person experi , the less happi he or she will feel . happi is the state of mind that help a person to enjoy life and it 's the emot that make us appreci the thing that life ha to offer in a more posit manner . there are peopl who consid that young peopl just do not appreci life with the import it ha . young peopl just do not pay attent to small detail and their way of life goe rather faster in comparison to somebodi who ha reach certain age . on the top of that , a young person is expect to make major choic that will chang him or her for the futur , such as find the proper school and studi , start a famili and other stress decis . on the contrari , some peopl would claim that is is older peopl who are experienc a better way to live their life . they do not have to be worri about what most of the peopl do dure their whole life , such as educ , profession goal , and so on . instead , they live with greater experi and emot matur that allow them to be less aprehens and stress . howev , i think that age alon play no signific role in term of enjoy life . i strongli believ that happi is the result of a number of factor both in the environ and in the person of a particular person . medic speak , depress can be associ both in young and older peopl as well as there are peopl that consid themselv happi regardless of their age . final , i think that we all have the opportun to enjoy life no matter how old , or young , we are .
