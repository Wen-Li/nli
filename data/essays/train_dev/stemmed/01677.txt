i disagre with the given statement , especailli in the context of the modern world . the statement is probabl inspir by the larg number of career base peopl who may appear to be too selfish . in a world of competit , thi may partli be true - to get to the top , you must not let anyon els get past you . howev , take a broader view , mani of these peopl are veri help , especi when they are need the most . basic in everi societi , be it a contemporari one or of the past , there are peopl who are natur more inclin to commun servic and relat activ . mani of these peopl have actual experienc or have been influenc by some touch social event . exampl may be peopl who have been near a tornado struck place and have seen peopl 's hous and famili get decim . such an event probabl had a signific impact on their life and made them start help peopl in need . someth veri ubiquit about the modern world is the avail of commun . live footag of an earthquak in the indian state of kashmir is avail throughout the countri . call of a weep mother for monetari help resound on the ear of everi person of the nation . the plight of hundr of dead children shake the heart of even peopl who have religi and poilit conflict with the territori . how then , one may ask , can someon remain pois in such a situat ? the earthquak strike not in a singl state but in the heart of everi citizen of the countri . it is in these time of tragedi that the young , so far busi in make their career , suddenli come to rescu of other . they fall upon their basic instinct - the need to help the needi . the satisfact they get from such servic usual chang their life style for ever . success and rich businessmen , who even find it hard to give time to their daughter , come out and provid the much need monetari help . thi wa someth obvious not possibl in the olden day . it is thu the young who fuel the rescu work in these time .
