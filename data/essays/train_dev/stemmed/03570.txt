i agre with thi satement . let me say definit of car first . accord to our common sens car is a kind of transport . it ha a wheel and engin to make power . it consum gasolin or disel . thi is tradit concept of car that we knew . but in the futur those definit are can chang . for exampl , futur car can move without wheel and driver . may be it dose n't have to run on the street . futur car can use solar power , elecrt and water . it will be semi-airplan . but shape look like a car and function will be quiet diffrent . sometim we see in sf-movi like `` star-war '' . these day air pollut is becom big issu in thi world . main caus of air pollut is a car . mani motor compani are develop electr car and hydrogen car . it can be a solut for reduc air pollut . but still it is not a popular car . price is veri high and function is not perfect . howev within ten year it will be more popular car than present . modern hig-technolog is chang rapidli . think about comput and electron . it ca n't compar with just ten year befor . chang is more faster than our imagin . i believ that ten year of tufur ha same valu of era with 50 year of past . it mean twenti year of our futur ha same valu with one centuri . dure last ten decas how much chang our world ? it wa realli beyond our immagin . we will experi again , those kind of rapid chang in our cultur within twenti year . therefor i can say twenti year later we will use diffrent kind of transport with car . i do n't know what we call futur transport . but it will be diffrent with tradit car . tradit car we will see in the museum .
