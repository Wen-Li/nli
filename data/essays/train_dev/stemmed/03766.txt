is it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif suject they choos ? it is not so easi to say which is more desir . often it seem to be depend on the characterist of the person . but i disagre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg concern mani area than to special in one specif subject for the follow two reason : firstli no one can reach the full knowledg of everi aspect , secondli it is more profit for each person to studi in hi or her own area and then share the result . at first , no one grasp the entir knowledg of everi subject . what is easi to scientist may not be easi to sociologist . also what is natur to sociologist may not be natur to scientist . we have the limit of intellig , thoug we do not have the limit of interest . so if you tri to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , eventu you can find your knowledg veri superfici . in addit , it is more desir for each person to studi in hi or her own area and then share the result . for exampl , life scientist concentr their capac on studi the system of life . their result help mani peopl who do not know about the system of life . that is more help for our societi . all thing consid , it is better to special in one specif subject thant th have broad knowledg of mani academ subject in respect of individu abil and social advantag as well .
