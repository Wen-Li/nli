the thesi if there are fewer car in use than today can be discuss controvers . mani point have to be consid in the global progress of economi , cultur and und mayb even event you can not calcul with . in my opinion the number of car in twenti year will most probabl increas . there are differ reason whi . the economi tri to sell more car and did veri well the last decad . so i would n't expect them to work less effect dure the next twenti year . the trend goe to more consumpt and the automobil sector is huge in a time where flexibl and local indeped is want from compani . also the basic for drive a car , petrol , is secur for the next hundr year . that make it even more unlik that a branch will increas it product . one actual topic is interest when i consid it might be the way that fewer car will be produc . the global warm is so impressingli awar in the last year , e.g megatornado or wide spread flood caus by melt pole , that peopl might be lead to think about anoth way of be mobil . i can imagin that a new kind of car will come , hybrid car , that will have have anoth sourc for their energi where the exaust will be pure water . that save the natur from acid rain caus be carbondioxid . under these circumst the number of car will increas . i am just not sure how long it will take to establish a new lobbi for these kind of car , a lobbi that ha more power than the oil lobbi today . at the moment car dealer have on the one hand problem to sell their car , on the other hand there are come more and more other car brand in the open market ( globalis ) . the result is that price fall . with lower price more peopl can afford to buy a car . and so the will , i guess . a problem with more and more car is the infrastructur . even in germani the street have more and more traffic . thi can lead to more traffic jam than we havetoday , what make is more expens for firm or more stress for usual driver to drive a car . that could becom a reason that the number of car will increas slowli . as a conclus i can say that firm will find a way to sell more car than now . one good effect on thi can be that in spite of the more car the qualiti of car refer to oecolog reason will becom better becaus of public pressur or becaus of a refus natur .
