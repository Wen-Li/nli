` it realli work ' thi is what i can hear everi commerci . everi product are not best in the world , and sometim it doe not work . howev in the commerci everi good are fabul . in my opinion , i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than their real . advertis exist for advertis the product . even though , the product is realli good . there is a limit of until everybodi know about thi product . becaus of thi reason , peopl want to make commerci . for instanc , near my school , there is a realli delici restaur . almost everi my school student know about that restatur . we get imform from our school friend . howev , my friend whose are not attend my school , never know about that restaur . the other day , the restaur itroduc in famou tv show . after that the restaur is all the time crowd . even my anoth school friend know about that restaur . the restaur ha a purpos when they are on the show . it need to provoc custom . mani peopl buy product that they do not need after watch commerci . the advertis need to stimul to custom . owner of product want to sell product as mani as possibl . get to result , they need more strong tihe than their real product . therefor , they make their product more fanci and look good . if it work product can earn lot of money . when i wa young the castl for doll wa so wonder in tv commerci . i keep ask to my parent to buy that castl . final i got that , howev it wa so differ from the commerci product . color wa differ and there wa no bell and it wa not automat . even though commerci disappoint me , it wa enough to make me buy doll castl . in conclus , most advertis make ptroduct look good better than real , i think that advertis ha a purpos . becaus commerci 's initi work is advertis to peopl and via stimul custom make them buy to product .
