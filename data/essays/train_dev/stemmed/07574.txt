well , the first thing that came to my mind when i read the statement wa oh my god thi is so true , becaus we all experienc at least onc in our life , buy thi perfect shampoo that will make our hair smoother and shinier , becaus you know the girl in the advertis seem so happi and beauti and then we go back home tri it on the next minut to end up realli disapoint when loook in the mirror . or when you tri that new ultim fantast diet that promis you to lose one stone in a week and then a week after you are sit on your sofa eat two bar of chocol becaus it did n't work . it realli seem like a big lie but then i thought that as witti as it can seem it is somewhat logic becaus then whi would i buy a product that doe n't make thing better , that everybodi wear ? if you see in a newpap the pictur of a car with no featur ad that you just have the crude photo of it without light to enhanc the color or a particular settin , you are not go to buy it in anyway . i mean it is the whole aim of advertis to sell us a product that is n't common becaus common equal to bore or bad qualiti in our head . it ha to make us dream in some way . in a way i think that when we buy those product we intimatli know that it wo n't make us skinnier or perfect as the model in the advertis but there are still the hope , and that with what publicit play , that after all thi product might realli work . but i do n't realli blame the publicit becaus althought it can be perceiv as lie , it is their job to do that and the onli solut to that problem would be that us , custom , we stop fall for the advertis they creat , that we go beyong all the fuss they are creat to face the realiti ( come on you know anyway that you would n't lose a stone in a week , that just doe n't make ani sens ! ) . besid who ha n't tri to make realiti better in hi everi day life , i mean it is a human reaction , you know when for exampl you tri to convinc your kid that spinach do tast good , and i just think that it is how it work the same with advertis .
