there are too mani differ way for a student to learnd and undesrtand differ kind of topic , but there is huge differ between understand idea and concept and learn fact . first of all , the fact that a student it 's onli understand the concept it mean he is learn . understand is the base of educ , and the base of knowledg . for exampl , if one student ha a test , and he memor everyth , he migh be good at the test , but week later , if you ask him about the same topic and if he is not abl to answer ani question about the topic , that mean that he did n't learn anyth about it . secondli , understand idea is the best way for learn , and rememb differ fact . for exampl , when you are abl to understand some topic , and you are abl to answer ani question about it , that mean that you actual learn someth about , mayb not everyth but just what you thougt it wa import for you . final , the main reason whi student now a day feel confort when their are go to present ani kind of test or exam , is becaus they undesrtood what they read and the undesrtood the main idea of the subject or topic they where ask to studi . for exampl , when a student ha hi final exam and he wa all night stude and he did good on hi test , that 's becaus he undestood most of the inform , and that 's one of the most import thing for a student to be succesful . in conclut , i total agre with the statement becaus i think that by understand the idea and the concept you could better learn they way that thing happen , and by that you could understand the fact . if you learn , it 's becaus you understood . understand idea and concept will make you learn about everyth you want , whenev you want .
