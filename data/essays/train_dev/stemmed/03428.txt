i think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the first reason is that the car is necessari to do most of tha activ that a person doe . for exampl , if a person want to go to swim and the swim pool is far from hi home , he take hi car to go there . the car is veri import for the famili . infact parent need the car to bring their child to school or to go shop . anoth reason that i think will make the number of car increas is price of them . infact forti year ago , for exampl , car were veri expens and so onli a part of the popul could buy one . today there are lot of differ model of car and almost ani famili can buy a car . i think that in the next twenti year there will be fewer car in use also becaus they are reach a veri high comfort level . today a person can have a long trip without arriv tire . anoth reason is that car are be more and more safe . for exampl twenti year ago if someon have to make a long trip he probabl had taken the train . infact if a person had an accid with an old car he probabl hurt himself serious . for these reason i think that in next twenti year the number of car will encreas a lot .
