due to better possibl of commun and optim waz of transport , in the last centuri a process took place that incorpor the world : the global . one result of the globilaz is the increas advertis for product all over the world . on the one hand advertis help us to inform about product . but on the other hand you have to ask yourself if thi process of advertis is realli neutral ? and in my opinion the answer is no . when you watch tv , you can see beauti car drive through the landscap and beauti woman sit in it and enjoy it . but the question is if you also will enjoy to ride thi car ? when you go to cinema you see sever advertis for film that are promis to be excit . but again there | s the question : is it realli that excit when you see the whole film by yourself ? there are case that confirm that the promis becom true . but in my opinion , in the most case you will be disappoint of the product you decid to pay for . the global certainli ha posit effect on the world if you just think of the possibl to convey product or inform . but in my opinion it caus that qualiti isn | t anymor guarante in everi case . let | s take the exampl of the advertis for the car . in tv you saw the car with all the beauti impress and it | s great equip . but you | re not abl to judg the qualiti of the car by onli see it . so you may be dissappoint when you actual buy the car . thi is a typic exampl of the thesi that advertis make product seem much better than they are . in earlier time , you offer someon a servic or a product and what you got back wa also a servic or prduct . thi wa the process of exchang thing directli . and you there you were abl to judg qualiti . but the global caus competet . and competit caus lie , so that the product seem better than they actual are . becaus of the increas competit between big compani , the promis becom better and better , the qualiti of product instead becom wors becaus of mass product . so you can definit say , that , not in all case , but most of the time advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . and in thi case the question i ask at the begin of thi text is answer : global doe not have onli posit effect .
