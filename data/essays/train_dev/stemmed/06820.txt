sure most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . we have alway to rememb that behind ani advertis , when we watch tv , when we listen to the radio , or just when we walk in the street , there ha been a deep and accur research to make the peopl like that product . it 's not just a matter of what is the product , what is possibl to do with it or if it is definit the best in the market , there is peopl studi and work to find out how to make it impress . the advertis work ! and so , or we believ that the product that we see in tv are realli better than the otehr or we believ that the compani want to show it in a better way . sometim the compani creat advertis even nice to watch , tri to creat in our mind a nice pictur of the product . everi day in tv it 's possibl to find exampl , it happen to me to notic that even for product that are prove to be harm for the health as cigarett or drink , the associ is alway with someth posit , beauti or cool . whi ? for sure becaus nobodi would buy someth is not attract by and becaus a brilliant imag is much more attract , and thi make us think about the posit side of the product . in thi way we will go to buy what we have seen even if anoth product ha the same qualiti . i could never say : i do n't agre with that statement , it 's so true that probabl there would be the need of a stronger regulament .
