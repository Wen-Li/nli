while a larg number of student realiz that understand the idea and concept are the basi of a learn process , i tend to believ that learn fact is more import . first , the fact let the student know the implement and design base on the abstract iead and concept on the textbook . a student who conduct and manag a softwar develop team may have deeper understand over the area of softwar design and human resourc manag than the one who onli learn from the book . for exampl , a design may have more detail and deepen comprehens of the intern core think , which is the most valuabl part in hi job , after he finish a design by research and review a lot of book and articl includ concept propos befor . in addit , it make more sens for a student to learn the fact brought by hi or her own hand-on experi . when i wa a member in the web develop team of our univers websit , i learn a lot from the practic of instal and configur the web server and write code for a web applic , which is not fulli state on ani book in the book store . thi make my way more broad and easier to go to achiev expertis on the field of conput scienc . lastli , learn fact is a higher level that just understand the origin idea and concept . the student who know how to put the principl into the daili work may show a stronger abil to master not onli what to learn but also how to learn , that is to say , they are more like to becom a quick learner , an abil which is call for by mani intern busi compani such as microsoft , googl and ibm . from all the discuss i mention abov , we could safe draw a conclus that learn fact take a more signific posit that just understand the idea and concept in the learn process .
