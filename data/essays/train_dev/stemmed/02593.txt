i disagre with the statement that `` in 20 year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' . becaus the main reason for the idea of non-exist of the car is due to the non-avail of the fuel that make the car run i.e ; petrol or diesel in next 20 year , but the car can be , made to run with other sourc like electr or some of the non-convent sourc of energi like solar or wind energi . as we all know that the petroleum and it product would be exaust within two or three decad , but how would the peopl move , transport of necess good would occur without car . so there should be an altern to be found which is noth but the non-convent sourc like solar energi or wind energi . present , the scientist are research in find an altern base on two aspect ; one is which doe not pollut the environ and the other is how we can use the present non-convent resourc avail with us now and to it best . as the popul of the world is grow rapidli day by day , there will be a great necess of car i.e ; transport . i think for the popul to sustain , grow , develop it is necesssari to have the basic amen like food , water and cloth which ha to be transport to the region which do n't have these amen . also , accord to the recent survey , the luxuri , fashion and cost of live is grow in all the countri . the presenc of car show the rich of the peopl and the secur travel they can make . so it is necessari that car are essenti . as the popul is grow , there is and will be a grow demand of car even after 20 year from now . also if some say that `` how in the age of aeroplan and jet , car are use in futur ? '' . the answer is that we can not use the fli machin to all the place and if the place is too near mean how would the peopl use the aeroplan or someth . henc the statement `` in twenti year ther will be fewer car in use than there are today. '' is fals .
