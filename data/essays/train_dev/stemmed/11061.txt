in my opinion young peopl have to help their commun becaus in thi mode the younger can improv their person experi and thi fact is veri import for everi work that they will do . on the contrari , even if a young person might help commun , he or she can not do it becaus they have not time for thi purpos . infact , usual school steal much time to student and free time is not fair to help commun . at the same time a person must enjoy her or himself in free time to not explos ! . so , if a person want to help commun he or she renounc to free time and thi question is veri difficult to deal with . infact , after an hard week of studi i believ that a young want to go out with hi friend or make some sport . in my person experi , i want to entri in red cross beacus i think that it is import organ to improv our societi . the lesson of thi organitazion are made at monday and friday even in a period that i have to prepar exam and i can not follow lesson . so , i did not follow my purpos for school reason . anoth experi in my life is relat to church activ that i don not want to follow becaus they are made on saturday afternoon and thi is the onli free day of my week . i am veri sad for thi , but after a week in a place not near to my home i want to visit my friend for exampl or to play tenni . so , i believ that if school need less time younger can help commun but in these condit are veri dfficult to realiz it . a purpos that can be made is to put in scholar schedul voluntari activ like red cross or to help in hospit . it might be a mode of stimul younger to be near to their commun .
