i agre with the statement that the success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . there are mani reason for thi , some of which i would like to present in thi present . the success in one 's life make peopl to explor mani thing . they get intrest as they succeed in the thing they do and tri to take risk rather than fix to the thing they have done befor . they some time tri to see the same thing in the differ perspect so that they can do even better . the statement `` success peopl tri new thing '' can be even much explain with an exampl . let 's take thoma alva edison , the great scientist who had mani invent to hi name . edison had more than 1000 invent to hi name which prove that success peopl tri new thing . let us consid the invent of the bulb . if edison had convinc with that invent and tri to do the same thing repeatedli would not have fetch him anyth . he be a success person tri the new thing and took the risk involv in it . eventu , he succeed in everth . he kept on invent mani new thing which were veri use to the peopl . thi show how the success peopl tri differ thing . in my view , success peopl should tri new thing which would help him to gain not onli knowledg but also increas the creativ , see thing in differ attitud . tri new thing even help one to learn more from hi mistak which would be veri help in hi further thing . success peopl influenc the surround in which they are , help the other peopl to succeed in their part . in sum , the success which the peopl get make them to tri for mani more new thing rather than stick to the thing they alreadi know .
