i do n't think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . it can be veri conveni , of cours : for exampl you do n't have to think about anyth ( for instanc car hire , hotel , restaur , museum ticket ... ) ; you simpli sit down in the bu and enjoy the trip . furthermor , the guid is suppos to know everyth about the place you visit and so she ( or he ) can tell you interest stori about , as well . at the same time , though , travel in a group led by a guid ha a lot of disadvantag that , accord to me , are not worthi . first of all , you have to respect a strict and not flexibl timet ; you ca n't choos what you want to visit or where you want to eat , for exampl . usual dure tour there are thousand of thing to do ( and some of them pretti awkward ) so you do n't have enough time to enjoy the place you see along the way ; in mani case you have just the time to get off the bu , take a pictur and go back to the bu again . then , have to follow thi strict plan , you ca n't ask to stop when you see someth you think is realli nice , even to take a pictur . and , abov all , you can stop to go to the toilet just when the plan tell that you are allow to ! sometim you are oblig to do thing you do n't like , as well . for exampl climb a mountain even if you are afraid of it or sleep in a camp where there is no water at all , except for a river in which `` friendli '' crocodil live . last , but not least , you never know peopl you will travel with : if you are lucki they will be veri nice and you could go on with them quit well . on the contrari , if you are not lucki , you could have to stand for some day ( or a coupl of week , that is even worst ) the compani of a group of peopl that you realli dislik , veri differ from you , sometim veri bore , sometim too excit . all these thing consid , togeth with my person experi , make me prefer a journey by myself or with some veri reliabl friend .
