today there is nearli no product which can be sold without ani advertis . and the past ha shown that those product who tri fail more often than were succesful buy by their custom . so thi indic for me that advertis make prouduct more that they are becaus if it would not be like thi a product could exist without it advertis . so i agre with that statement ! it is clear that advertis give the imag of a product and also help to reach the buyer . and most of the compani know how they can use thi . they tri to give their product the best imag they could becaus than the custom will recogn it and buy it mayb next time in supermarket or somewher els . to give an exampl i want to explain how it happend to me when an advertis make me buy a product . a few week ago i mention an advertis shown on televis . it wa a new hair-shampoo which promis nice hair and a great experi by wash your hair . than the next day i went to the supermarket to buy such an shampoo . but when i wash my hair i could not feel the great experi of wash hair . plu , and thi wa more import , my skin on my head wa red becaus of the shampoo . thi make it obviou to me that thi product wa not as good as it wa on it advertis . so my own experi show me that advertis make product seem much better just to sell more of them . but i think it is normal that advertis make product seem better than they realli are becaus it function is to atract peopl ! today you seem silli if you believ in what an advertis promis to you . so , it just thay goe today when you want to sell thing !
