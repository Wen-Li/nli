i do not agre with the propos statement and i will give differ exampl show that young peopl nowaday are not as selfish as present . first of all , i must confess that there is a common imag of young peopl depict them as more and more selfish , onli worri about themselv , play on their comput and wait for the diner to be readi . thi pictur is usual compar to the one present young peopl some decad ago , help their parent at the shop , in the field or simpli at home . howev , my opinion is that thi selfish imag is too limit . more and more young peopl spend time and effort in social organis . for instanc , the number of boy scout in belgium is increas . scout is typic a place where peopl learn to care for their commun . they organis activ to help homeless , they help at the church and take part in social event . anoth exampl is the social work which is more and more propos by school to student . student are propos to work for social organis dure a definit period of time . these social work are more and more popular , show that young peopl are readi to give time to their commun , as soon as they receiv the opportun to do it . furthermor , there are plenti of young peopl that each year leav their countri dure summer holiday to go and help other commun in need . some are go to build school in africa , other entertain small children in asia , ... thi show that young peopl nowaday care not onli about their commun but are also readi to spend time and money ( they usual pay their fight ticket ) to go and meet other commun that need their help . to conclud , i think that thi imag of the lazi selfish youg peopl which is veri strong in belgium as well as in other countri should be correct , lookimg at all the other young peopl who work hard to help their commun and even other .
