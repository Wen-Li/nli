some peopl think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . in a few aspect , i agre thi idea , but generali i do n't agre thi idea . i do n't support the idea that young peopl enjoy life more than the older peopl do . becaus , accord to my life concept , enjoy of the life doe n't depend to peopl 's age . enjoy of the life depend on the person ' characterist . in my compani , there are two exampl to thi topic . the first exampl is that one of the my colleagu is who is twenti year old is veri pessimist . she doe n't enjoy life . she act as if she is go to die tomorrow . for that reason , she doe n't enjoy life . second exampl is that i have a fifty-thre year old cowork . she enjoy life more than my young friend who is twenti year old and veri pessimist . the old ladi is alway happi . she make plan for night and weekend for fun . everi year she travel abroad , take pictur and tell all of the colleagu . also , she is veri funni , someday she praper small joke for our young and for pessimist colleagu to make her optimist . also , i am familiar with that some peopl ' age affect their life vision . for exampl , with my mother we go wed ceremoni , i invit my mother for tradit danc . my mother sometim refus me and say that she is too for danc old , intead of older peopl younger could play . i think my mother age affect her , and diminish her enjoy of life . some peopl think that enjoy of life ha coherr relationship with age , but on the contrari i believ that peopl enjoy of life is depend on their characterist . as i impli befor one of the my twenti year old cowork less enjoy life . but , on the other side my fifty-thre year old collegu enjoy life more than my younger friend .
