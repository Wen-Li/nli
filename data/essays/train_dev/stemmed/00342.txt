as the technolog advanc , mani young peopl enjoy the benefit like comput game , tv and so on . howev , there ha been neg factor such as broken uniti between peopl , weapon use in young peopl such as kill person without think . and also there ha been neg factor by technolog . in my opinion , i can not agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . first , technolog advanc cut the uniti between peopl . for exampl , the past gener doe not have the machin such as tv or comput . so , peopl must reli on each other and must be activ . accord to scientif experi , the activ person are happier than the inact person as young peopl . howev , nowaday , peopl do not reli on each other and do not move activ becaus they are alway in the world of conveni , entert with machin . but , young peopl get stress out becaus they find no purpos in life or get bore in life becaus they are just do same thing everyday ! also nowaday , in mani case , technolog is use in bad way which would harm peopl in nowaday gener . second , as mention in second paragraph , peopl need each other anyway in order to live . but when societi lose the uniti of peopl , peopl would fight each other becaus they onli think of their conveni . as a consequ , the societi and even individu would lose mani thing and could not be happi . third , from my neighbor , there are mani old peopl . i sometim ask that past is happi . and they said to me , `` well , we do n't know how you will feel you life , but we are happi although we had to work hard at past compar to nowaday . we all had hope . '' in addit , there are mani news that young peopl kill themselv or kill other peopl . it is becaus as mention in second paragraph , peopl tri not to adapt with societi becaus in the home , there is everyth you can entertain . but becaus you have to live with societi , peopl must corper with societi . these could caus young peopl who are so deep in the technolog machin to be stress out . i think that young peopl enjoy their life less than the older peopl becaus of follow reason : first , uniti is broken in mani way and caus troubl and mani consequ to young peopl to live on . second , becaus mani of young peopl are deep in game or tv , they find their life bore and think life as without hope . third , technolog that past gener never ha sometim is use in bad way and decreas happi in life . becaus of three import reason , i can not agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do even though life becom conveni and advanc becaus of technolog .
