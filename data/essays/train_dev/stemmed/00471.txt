i do not think travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best way to travel . there are some reason i do not prefer . first , tour will limit us where to go . although it will be much cheaper than go alon the tour might not be as what you have thought . you might want to see around other place but sinc it is move with group , you will not abl to go by onli your feel . secondli , the tour guid will decid the time they are look , so you are not abl to see it as long as you want . differ from travel by yourself , a tour want to go mani place as possibl to have more custom . so they are not abl to take enough time to see each place becaus they have to go next on time . thi might be ok for some peopl , but other might think they are not satisfi . thirdli , there will be mani other peopl that you do not know each other . thi will make you feel tire and no priverci . it will make you feel tire by it is not onli by yourself , so you have to make rule to have the trip smooth . but for ani reason you are go to the trip , i think they want to get away from everi day life . so thi will not let you feel freeli if you have to make rule . from these reason , i prefer travel by ourselv might be the best way to travel . travel by ourselv might cost higher , but you are abl to plan the trip freeli as you think and do what ever you want to make it satisfi . i am sure thi kind of trip will be greater than go in a group led by a tour guid .
