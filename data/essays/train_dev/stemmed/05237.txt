i think , we are a human societi and the human knowlegd is limit . but there are a lot of except . for me , knowledg in a yield is essenti becaus it is the onli possibl to prove we exist in our individualist societi . in short men are complementari and they have to special in a yiel . if we compar a situat with an econom situat , we can notic it is the base of the capit principl . we can find an illustr with the theori of compar advantag of david ricardo . it is a theroy which explain that a man ha to specialis in a yie where he is the best in view to impov hi capabl . howev , it is not the same for alll the yield . dure antiqu period , philosoph wa doctor , mathematician , scientif in the same time . it wa a point of view differ of nowaday . if i explain my situat , i prefer control one think in a one yield better than know much imform , on sever yield but no control one think . we are more six billion of peopl in all over the world , it is imposs to know all . nevertheless , broad knowledg in mani academ subject for exampl poilit , histori , econom , scienc is an avantag becaus in the gather with our colleagu , friend , boss we can hold a discuss and say our opinion . the person who said anyth is not respect generally. `` who say anyth , consent '' final i think we have to control capabl and improv our knowledg all the day . the educ is a process even when we will a respons parent . to conclud , with the evolut of societi and the metal , we have to strengthen our knowledg to have to compet with the other . competitiv is essenti !
