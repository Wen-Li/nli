accord to my point of view , learn fact is import for student as well as learn concept and idea . inde , they are the two side of the same icon , let 's say `` the learn icon '' , becaus fact show that concept and idea are right or wrong in the real world . in addit , they show how differ idea can be interconnect or influenc by each other and provid an effect way to make a concept understand . concept and idea must be learnt , but how to verifi them ? physic is a veri import exampl . you can learn much about physic by read a book and solv mathemat equat . but how to show that all the learnt knowledg is right and applic ? you need to know about experi which show the constraint of your theori , therefor you need to `` learn fact '' . then , fact are import to teach how differ concept and idea are relat . think about mechan scienc , for exampl . there are mani concept , often come from other differ field . student can learn them but how they can truli understand how a system work without studi a machin which is an applic of all those idea and therefor a fact by definit ? final , let me highlight that fact have alway provid an effect way to understand a concept or an idea . einstein wa veri famou for mani funni exampl which he use to explain hi own theori . anoth exampl is informat . if you want to learn informat , i am sure you will be told that you can compar a processor to a brain , a folder to a desk where you store paper and document and so on . summar , it is my firm opinion that fact are necessari for an effect learn . you need them to verifi theori , to explain how mani concept are relat and to provid exampl for a better understand . a famou statement is that histori , here fact , is a great life teacher
