i think that it is a common opinion that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . in my opinion thi is not so far from the real situat , but it can depend on what you mean with enjoy . there mani differ aspect in thi statement so i think that it is difficult to give a uniqu and clear opinion . for instanc , if you like play footbal you will not probabl enjoy yourself if you are an old man . a young boy is more powerful and he can play for a long period of time , while an old man will probabl lose hi energi in few minut , not so much time for a good and amus match . on the opposit , if you like to play your guitar , your age will not be a real problem . even if you are ten year old or seventi year old you can enjoy yourself as you want . mayb we can say that a young boy may have less problemat thought than an older person , so hi innoc can let him the possibl of enjoy much more hi life . for exampl an adult man ha mani more thing to do than hi son . he may have no free time so the young child can do anyth he want to enjoy himself , while hi father ha a life full of problem , so he can not enjoy as hi child . there is an anoth aspect in thi discuss that is of relev imporat . older peopl are often more rich than young peopl are . so they can do anyth they want , becaus they have much more money . for exampl if you are a twenti year old boy and you like yacth you may have some problem to buy one yacht . mayb you will buy it in your adulthood . at the end i think that the foundament aspect of the topic is the possibl to be sick when you becam an old man . thi is a big problem and make me think that if you are a young person you will enjoy much more your life .
