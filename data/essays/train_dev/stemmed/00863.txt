the issu whether it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than special in one specif subject is a controversi one . on the one hand , some peopl believ that we can experi the differ interest of mani academ subject . on the other hand , other believ that we have to learn thing more specif then we can train the abil of concentr on thing easili . as far as i am concern , i prefer to studi broad knowledg of mani academ subjuect . in addit , i will argu over the issu in the follow reason . the first reason for my belief is that we can learn more and appli the subject more . in other word , in such busi and competit world , we can not close ourselv in just singl subject or specif knowledg . furthermor , we ought to open our mind and eye to experi new field . for exampl , i have studi child educ for sever year and i teach in elementari school right now . howev , i deepli consid that i face too much other difficulti that i have never met befor or stude befor such as how to connect with their parent effect or how to reduc my person anger when i come in class . therefor , as long as i teach , i think i have a lot of thing or subject i need to studi . henc , i come back to school and start to learn other academ subject . the second reason for my belief is that i can make other frind in differ area . as matter of fact , we have less chanc to meet other peopl that do not studi the same class . i mean we all consid the whole thing in the singl opinion that we stand . therefor , we have to widen our mind and reopen it to other area and make some differ friend and mayb sometim they can give us other aspect idea . for instanc , i like to play piano and i have learn it for mani year . one day my friend told me that whi do n't we coper with each other . he is good at danc . when we conbin our idea togeth , we find it veri interest . to sum up , i firmli believ that we must have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus we have to live in the competit world and you do not believ that how beauti that we can spark out . in the end , i will conclud the issu by emphas that not onli do we consistantli studi differ subject but also we encourag other to do so .
