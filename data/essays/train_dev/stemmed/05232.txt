it is the basic tendenc or natur of all human be to explor thing around them . although the amount a person explor thing and take risk may vari from person to person as it depend on the opportun and situat of a person . i strongli agre with the statement that success peopl tri out new thing and take rsik more frequent than do what they alreadi learn . i feel thi way due to sever reason . i think , success peopl have more resours like capit , labour etc. to experi with new thing . thay do not have the fear to loos . plenti of resourc encourag them to explor thing more . for instanc , a famou businessman mr. anil ambani , who is among the most affluent peopl of india , is frequent engag in invest huge amount of capit in bring new stratigi , product and idea to the market . i think that as he ha enough money to experi , he is readi to bear the risk involv in it . eventhough if he loos even a part of it , will not make a big differ in him . thu in my opinion , more resourc mean more opportun to experi and bear the risk . furthermor , i believ that success peopl are more intellig and hard work . they are success as other have valu them for the hard work and intellig . so they can util their knowledg in a more construct way . they can appli knowledg wise and reduc the amount of risk involv in it . in thi way such peopl can explor more thing without loos much . i also believ in an adag that `` necess is the mother of invent '' . mani time it is found that a person discov thing due to their need . like the primit men invent fire . henc some success peopl may tri to discov thing which they need . in additon to thi , they believ less in do the thing they have alreadi learn , as they will not be abl to bring anyth new to their countri . in the nutshel , the success peopl experi more as they have more knowledg and resouc to minim the risk involv in carryout ani work .
