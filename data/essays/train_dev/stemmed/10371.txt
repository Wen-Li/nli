i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand the idea and concept rather than to learn fact becaus firstli , the student ha a chanc to improv when he learn the idea . for exampl ; if the student is taught about spheric mirror in physic class , he should not be given the simpl equat . he should rather be told to prove how these equat are deriv so in thi way he can actual improv himself in spheric mirror . in thi way , the student can learn better in further topic such as lens . secondli . understand the idea can help the student look at thing in a broader way becaus by analys the idea , the individud can examin the life around himself in mani differ way . for instanc , in my extra lesson the teacher alway want me to memoris the equat in the scienc class but in the school my other teacher want me to look at the topic in a broader way and think on it and she wa actual right becaus i now know that memoris a fact in ani scienc class is not effect for me to look at how the natur work scientif . if i know where all the equat and main point come from , then i can examin the environ around me in a broader way so understand the main idea effect help . on the other hand , memoris a fact doe not definit help me examin my environ becaus after a while i forget that ` fact ' and i may even never use it again . thirdli , understand the idea will give the student a confid becaus when the student achiev a goal in that idea ; he feel pleasur about it . when i first start write my essay on sociolinguist ; my supervisor did not teach me the main fact but he guid me about which book to use and which keyword have to be mention so in thi way he did not want me to memoris but he want me to ` get the idea ' and eventu . after use the book and the keyword , i realiz that i definit understood what the topic is mainli about . when i hand my essay in , i wa veri confid of myself and i felt joy and pleasur becaus i actual improv myself and i learn the topic all by myself . even my supervisor wa surpris becaus i wa not take sociolinguist class and the fact that i learn the topic all by myself made it much more better and interest . to conclud , understand the main idea are better for student to learn fact becaus firstli , by learn the idea they can improv and becom more confid . furthermor , they can analys their environ in a broader way by learn the main idea . in addit , if the student achiev a goal about that topic by understand it , he will be happi to be success .
