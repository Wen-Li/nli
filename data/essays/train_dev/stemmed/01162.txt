i agre with the statement `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . let me begin by say that time ha chang . in former time most of the peopl live in small villag and everybodi know each other . it wa common that young peopl help in their commun . nowaday , for exampl in big citi nobodi realli care about the other . they often do not even know their neighbour . so it 's difficult for young peopl to help . secondli in former day parent were stricter than now . young peopl had to help in their commun , becaus their parent did it as well . they had no chois to do other thing they might prefer . and in my opinion thi is a good system , becaus peopl at thi age often do n't think of help in their commun . today parent let them decid theirselv if they want to help or not . and if it wa not expecet to them , onli a few peopl at thi age are kind enough to help . i think parent play an import role at thi question . last but not least nowaday peopl might have n't enough time to help their commun . they have to go to school and after that they have to do their homework . today thi could be a lot of work and in some area school last till late in the afternoon . after finish thi most children or teen just want to relax or do some sport . it might sound egoist but they do not realli care about their commun . becaus they are still young i think they need to play after work and they do n't want to help anybodi . in conclus i agre with the statement becaus time have chang and peopl realli do n't spend much time to helpnig their commun .
