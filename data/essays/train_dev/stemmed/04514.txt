of cours i agre to the statement that we have to be well awar of mani academ subject . first , the inform nowaday are organ each other too complex . like the system of educ are alter , the form of inform and the shape of busi are becom differ from the past . for exempl , the soho shop are emerg promin in internet , we can see the tremend of shop in there also a lot of so call ceo exist . they start their busi as a whole compani even if it is too small to have one employe , not subordin to big compani . the ceo must know a lot of knowledg not restrict to the good , he or she made . she need to know how to make the money . then she need the skill to manag the schedul , make the strategi to sell the product , and how to pack and so on . he or she can get that inform in the internet nowday easili , even if it is veri profession like expert but thi could be the good exempl . second reason is , the world is turn so fast and young person doe not persist to stick to one compani , or the same job . thi tendanc is not the subject that we can tell the right or worth . it is enduc by the differ thought of the new gener . so as we perceiv the market we involv is corrupt , young peopl would have no atit to leav and might want to move anoth job or might search the utterli diffren file where they 've been . in conclus , it is good to expos us to all the circumst that we can confront , mayb it could be the issu of aquaint and assembl the knowledg not the knowledg itself if we probe it discreetli . anyway the reason whi i prefer to choos the prior statement is becaus we must be readi to the uncertain next societi .
