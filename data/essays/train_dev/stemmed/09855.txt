i believ that in twenti year , there will be more car than there are today . popul is increas , the age requir for driver 's lincens are drop , peopl choos person car over public transport and the build boom in third world countri have increas the need for transport matiri . with all of these reason , it is more like that there will be more car in the futur despit minor setback . the popul in the world is rise , and with more peopl there will be more car for them to travel in . in mani third world countri , like china and india , where economi is boom a famili normal ha 6-10 children who grow up to fill up the ever grow job caus by the grow economi . and although not all of those children surviv , half of them grown up to work that requir car becuas most of their work place are not walk distanc . also , mani peopl today seek comfort and so a famili might own more than one car so that the father could go to work , and the mother could drive the kid to school , ect . i have seen mani famili that have more than two car actual . also with more and more peopl today choos to stay singl and not marri , thi caus there to be more car becaus famili share their car and singl peopl own their own . ( or mayb even two ) thi doubl the number in car and will continu to do so as long as peopl choos to stay singl for a longer period of time . also mani peopl also get sick of their current model and covet a newer model without sell their old car which doubl the car number in each household . the age requir to aquir a driver 's licens ha been decreas . for exampl in kansa it is now 15 instead of 18 , in the philippin it is 17 instead of 18 , and in korea it is now 18 instead of 21 . the younger they allow kid to drive car , the more car you will need , becaus there will be peopl reach the requir age sooner than befor . i also would n't be supris to have the age requir lowerd even more within the next 20 yera . anoth reason that we might have more car in the futur is that we are a grow world , econom and industri . there are a lot of factori , resort , hotel , hous and other build be built and they all need car ( truck ) to transport matiri to the alot place . citi are expand and more and more peopl are want to find reclus place that they can resid and rest in which requir truck and car to haul thing down to those place . you might say that ga price keep go up which will counter act the increas in car , but statist show that if peopl realli want to use car , ( and they are veri conveni ) ga price will not daunt them from drive and own car . also hybrid car are be develop , which can be charg by solar batteri rather than use ga consumpt . so with the increas in popul , decreas in age requir , increas in builidng construct , and the increas of comfort seek peopl , i think that there will be a lot more car in 20 year than in the present .
