i agre that most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are . ye they do , by hire big celebreti and well known atleth by show someth el and sell someth el most compani like to hire some well known person that they know the public like for their advert just to make money . becaus they know that when the public see the face their product will sale , so they will pay them a big sum , and sell someth differ to the mass . for exampl the cloth compani they hire a big name to advertis there product , but they sell someth differ though the public do n't care becau they wear the cluth becaus of the face of the star on the cloth . i bought a kelvin clean jean , it 's a big name in cloth busi and i bought becaus of the big name . but it did not last for me as i thought it wa go to last the first time i wash it the colour chang authomat . the same with the cosmet compani they will tell you to tri there product and your face will be as smooth as you want it to be . these are just market stratefi . they just want to sell there product . also the phone compani they will make you to switch to there network it is the best on the long run you will come to realis it 's the same everi where . and the worst is the credit card compani they use there advertis to lure you in and give a differ servic and you end up own them for life . haven seen all these reason and exampl i think it is veri clear that not all the adverti is good becaus they seem much better than the servic they will offer you . so i agre that most advertis is much better than the product .
