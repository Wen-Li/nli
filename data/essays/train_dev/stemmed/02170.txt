`` the object of travel is not onli see other scenceri but also experi a lot of thing . '' thi is my opinion about the travl . thu , i do not agre with the topic . i will state briefli the two reason support my opinion . first , the reason whi it is better to travel without tour guid is that peopl can feel foreign peopl those who live in that countri . actual , in my experi , i went to the uk with my freind few month ago for enjo holliday . we just walk what we want to go , dure go to other place , we need to ask how to we get there to someon . dure thi , i did talk mani peopl , also i made a foreign freind . howev , if peol in group with guid , there is no chanc to meet and talk to foriegn peopl . second , the reason whi it is better to travel without tour guid is that if there is ani limit to travel , peopl could enjoy your trip freeli . there is no time limit , so peopl can go anywher what they want . for exampl , i went to snow festiv in seol ak mountin with tour guid . there are so mani routin in mountin but i should fellow the guid . and there wa alway time limit to comback somewher if i go someplac what i want to go . it wa bad memori to me . if someon go to trip , so , i will recommend enjoy travel without guid . it let them have a time more happier trip . to be encapsul , the 2 reason which i mention abov make your experi abundantli such as make a freind who live in other countri , go to a lot of place what you want . thu , i think travl without guid is better way .
