i 'm from a coutri in which histori is more than millenari , and it is absolut true and right that 's alway use and need to learn from the past to look up to the futur , but in my person life and experi i 've alway found that the fact itself ca n't stick perman in to our memori ( but thi may be becaus i 'm not a huge fan of histori too ! ) , more often it 's the exact contrari , we kind of filter what the fact wa trough our sens and what most ha captur our attent on the matter . if noth ha captur our attent it 's more than probabl that we wo n't rememb it for as much time as need for the growth of a critic mind . i 've often been in the situat of have to choos between format and inform ( where for inform i mean thetwo or three pointer that can help me in a short time , but wo n't leav me noth for the futur ) . well , i 've attend classic studi in high school and one of my professor , who ha been a real menthor for most of our class , use to say that school ha the primari object to form peopl , not to inform them , and it can be done onli by give the instrument and possibl to approach a new fact with a proper critic sens . in other word the student deserv to think with their own mind , prefer open mind . it ha to be assur to them the possibl to dig under the fact , understand it 's logic , by analyz it from differ point of view , discuss it , in a certain sens make it of proper own , infer the essenti content andthen desum a lesson for the futur . all in all if we want peopl think with their own mind we have to give them the right instrument and focus , so it 's way better to understand t
