the topic of discuss today is whether it is good to travel in a group led by tour guid . i believ that travel in a group accompani by a tour guid is a better option for sever reason . travel in a group with guid enabl us to visit all the place of import which we may otherwis miss . it give us the opportun to know about the place we are visit in a better way than what we can do on our own . secondli histor place have certain histori associ with them which we would never come to know if we do not have a travel guid . someon with appropri knowledg can onli guid us about the stori behind variou momument . suppos if we go visit taj mahal in india without a guid we would just be abl to see a build and would not know what it specifi on the other hand if we are accompani by a guid he would tell us the stori behind the taj mahal which would make it more interest and attract . moreov travel in group make us enjoy more than what we can do alon and have better memori associ with certain event happen dure the trip . we can have more peopl to share with what we are feel and enjoy with . addit travel in group prove to be more cost effici than travel alon as the expens are share amongst the group and one individu is not overburden with all the expens . so we can conclud that travel in group led by the tour guid is the better option for visit place as it turn out to be more opportunist and cost effici morev we enjoy more when in group rather than alon .
