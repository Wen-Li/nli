young peopl are often said to mostli have themselv in mind . thi thesi might aris from decreas number of young peopl that are activ particip some sort of commun . but is thi true ? in my opinion thi theori is too simpl and the topic need to be view from sever aspect . what kind of commun are we talk about ? church , sect , club or onlin commun ? in case of the first two i believ it may be alright . young peopl would like to be free in mind and not spend their life be afraid of an evil lord who will smack them down unless they serv certain peopl . turn their back to religion for me is the right choic . but on the contrari i believ that privat and onlin commun are not lack motiv and care young peopl . a lot of commun have been form - or should i say boom ? - dure the past few year . the word itsself is probabl one of the most frequent use one among young peopl . their activ particip help these commun and , as it is the idea behind it , it also help themselv gather social contact exchang inform and opinion . but ye , some children certainli spend too much time play video game or watch tv instead of make someth that is more product or creativ . they wast their time they sit in front of their monitor seek short-term satisfact . of cours they are wrong but their are not the one that tell themselv what is right and what is wrong . they also will not find a way to commun themselv . it is their parent that are respons for them so it is them that need to be harm if young kid some day lack social skill . they determin where their children go , what media they are confront with and what social activ their children are part of . but the parent are not sole respons . teacher play a role and have to provid a kind of ethic educ , too . to conclud i would like to say that thi sentenc is full of prejudic but mayb total nonsens . it is true that societi forc most peopl to take care of their own as there are less and less reward given for sacial action .
