whether have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or be special in one specif subject also benefit the societi . the societi requir both type of scholar to develop smoothli . i think that be broadli train and special also depend on the personn abil . what level you are educ is addit a concern issu for such consider . our societi need specialist such as engin and doctor as well as broad train peopl , politican for instanc . all of them have their special role in the societi and the societi would becom choatic without either of them . of cours engin and doctor could onli be special in one subject as they are the expert in their field and they should then spend all of their time on their special subject . howev , for politican , mani of them are rather broadli train in sever subject includ econom , histori and languag so that they would be abl to know what the resid want and how to promot the polici . a second crition on be special or not is depend on the personn abil . some peopl are gift in certain abil they should then be special while some peopl learn sever differ thing veri quickli , they might then be broadli train in variou academ subject . educ and learn would be a funni process if you realiz what your strength are . moreov , the last but the most import reason for choos between have broad knowledg or be special in one subject is what are your educ level . if you are the primari and secondari school student , you should probabl have broad knowledg instead . a good basic knowledg in everi academ subject is essenti for the choos what subject you would be learn deepli in the futur . you could not choos your right subject if you do not have ani knowledg in it . also much knowledg is base on the same basi and theori such as physic is stick to mathemat , you could not then learn physic without know ani mathemat equat . if you are a colleg or postgradu student , you might be special then . as time is limit but knowledg is unlimit , you could not thu learn everyth els in depth in such a limit time . therefor there is not absolut good to choos have broad knowledg of differ academ subject or special in one certain subject , it all depend on the abov critia . our societi need differ type of peopl and everyon should have a right to find out ani subject they want to learn .
