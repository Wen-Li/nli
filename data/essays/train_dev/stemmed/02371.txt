nowaday it is possibl youth is consid selfish as regard as not help their commun , but i 'm not sure it to be complet true . as a young person , i understand that young peopl is receiv much pressur in their format period , to improv their studi and for get good job . all we want to afford pretti hous , good and travel , what impli to spent spare time in cours and studi . it 's possibl i wold have been agre few month ago but i 've recent meet some young peopl veri openmind and commit with world concern . those person show me that there is a big web of facil for help in our commun or in a wider area . truli i can not compar today 's youth with previou one sinc i 've just live thi period , but i believ there are two main flow of peopl , possibl more and more separ . firstli those who have their person challeng and tri to achiev it as fast as they can , and other who includ other strang peopl and social or ecolog concern in their challeng . if i 'd compar both group popul , it 's sure that person challeng are predomin . it 's logic if we notic that we are live a period of luxuri and market . but , on the other hand i also think there are mani social commit peopl with veri good and new idea . i trust in thi last group to educ the futur next youth and to increas the peopl who dedic some of their time in help to the other .
