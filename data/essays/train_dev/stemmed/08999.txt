there will be less car than nowaday , in twenti year time ? my answer to thi quetion is no . as the technolog improv , there must be other transport that can replac the car , which is the most importatnt transport to peopl these day . peopl might invent someth much safer , faster and more comfort . howev , i think it is just go to be an improv . what i mean by improv is that they chang the shape , fuel that car use or even electron and technolog thing that car requir . for exampl , automat car . automat car is control by the comput system in the car so that driver do not have to drive him or herself . if they wish to drive then they can chang it back to mannual mode . also , fuel that car need migth be chang in twenti year time . these day most of peopl use ga or patrol . but in the futur we might use solar energi or electrc instead of ga or patrol as it fuel . there are some car alreadi use electr but it need more improv to make it perfect . futhermor , car might be abl to travel abov the water or under the water , not just on the road . i 've seen a bu onc in liverpool that it can travel on the road and abov the sea . it can be easili changabl so that peopl can travel with their car abov the water as well as on the road . to sum up , there are so mani improv can be made without invent someth new . besid , i think it is better to improv car than invent somethin new as we are use to it .
