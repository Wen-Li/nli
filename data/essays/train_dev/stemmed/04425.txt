i agre with the statement . today young peopl think onli about themselv and their problem instead of give time to help their commun . they want onli enjoy themselv have a lot of hobbi and go out with their friend . i know few young peopl who do activ for athey withdraw from the realiti which sometim is full of peopl that is sad and have phisic or econom problem . young peopl do n't want to see that there are person who have to be help and are near to them . but there are also a lot of associ that want to do someth to help who is in a difficult condit . i think that everyon should care their commun becaus he is part of societi and if he tri to chang a bad realiti he live better too . young peopl should have more respect to other becaus they are the futur and it should have to be better than the present .
