it is sad to say so , but i am afraid it would be complet the opposit . not onli there will not be fewer car in twenti year but there will be more car that our road , fuel resourc and special , environ will be abl to take over . it seem that in these day everybodi ha a car , new , second-hand , blue or red , compact or station-wagon , whatev the shape or model , when a young man or woman reach the appropi age to drive , they get one car . and thi is special true in the case of usa , where a person ha noth to do without a car . everybodi get a car as soon as possibl , not onli becaus it is cheap . also becaus long-dist commun throughout usa may be realli good , but that is not the case when it come to short distanc . moreov , when you are drive , if you take a look around other car next to you , what you see is that most car are onli fill with one person . mayb most of the peopl are head toward the same direct , but nobodi agre to share the car , which will result into less fuel expens and from that into less air pollut . my opinion is also base on the fact that public transport is alreadi well develop , except in citi where there is a possibl of build an undergrown net . i do not see ani futur perspect of an altern vehicl but who know what will happen in twenti year . those futurist film where we could see spaceship float on the air seem to be veri faraway . it is true that everi day there are more low-cost airlin that provid veri cheap flight . but car will never be replac for short-dist travel . there will be more and more car and thi will have a terribl impact on our environ which alreadi damag by the pollut that car produc . the best thing would consist on find a new type of fuel , base on natur compon instead of petrol , a new effici and friendly-environmen
