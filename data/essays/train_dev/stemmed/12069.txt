i agre that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani acadam subject is import a student up to hi secondari school level , that is up to hi ten plu two level . becuas we should be famili about all basic scinc . it is impart to inculc bodi function , and bodi clean , so we need biolog . one should learn about the natur and environ in which he live . basic mathamat calicul are impart in day-to-day life . a person should be import that how he should behav in the societi , what are hi right and respons , so he should learn social studi . there is multidimension devlop are occur in variou field of studi . there are also differ interest and talent exist in each person . it is difficult to decid a career for a person inth earli age . so everi one should be famili with mani acadam subject . on the other hand deal with mani number of subject at the same time is veri difficult thing . even there are more number of sub field exist in a group today . for exampl let us take technolog . in technolog there are mani number of branch exist like comput scinc , electron , mechan and civil . each field is differ frome other . one ca n't reach the apex in everi field . to have good knowledg on a perticular field , it is better to devot entir time to get masteri of that perticular subject . do reaserch in order to get practic knowledg is impart . so in my opinoin , read mani acadam in secondari school level , and read a singl special subject from under graduat level is better to one .
