i am 24 year old and i have been studi electron engin for five year . dure my studi i have often ask to myse lf it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . from my experi i realiz that the best way to attain good result is to special in one specif subject . in particoular thare wa an event that convinc me of that . in fact there wa a semster in wich i had four cours at the same time plu the develop of my bachelor ' s degre thesi . i wa go to begin my master 's studi and in the same period i even had to present my bachelor 's degre thesi work in a confer . i wa veri busi with my thesi howev i decid to regist for four class . it wa a big mistak . in fact i could not attend all the lesson and when i had the exam i did not took good grade . moreov i did not have a broad knowledg but just a superfici one . thi wa an import experi for my futur choich . in fact i realiz that a broad knowledg is someth that come with time . in the next semest i chose to regist for two or maximum three class . i could attend all the lesson and when i studi at home i had enough time to go depper in the topic that i have had listen in class . in thi way i took veri good grade that now permit me to appli as ph.d. at the m.i.t . . from my experi dure my master 's studi i realiz that it is quit difficult to have a broad and deep knowledg at the same time . therefor i think that it is better to special in one or few subject . in thi way it is possibl to have a deeper knowledg and after few time even a broad knowledg . with thi porpous in my mind i am go to appli for my ph.d. and i am sure that in thi way i will abl to have other success .
