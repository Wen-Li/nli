although i do believ , that lot of peopl still invest energi and time for their commun , i tend to agre with the statement . as a matter of fact , even i do not invest time in work voluntarili for the well-b of other around me and when i reflect about the activ of my friend and famili , i see no differ to me . to understand whi , one should see the bigger pictur . in time peopl more and more suffer from econom pressur , in time they have to focu on two , or even three job to bring home money for their famili member , it is a logic consequ , that they do not have addit time to take care of other . a good exampl for thi phenomenon is the life style of a univeritz collegu . in order to be abl to afford hi studi ( which mean : entri fee , cours fee , book , ... ) , he is forc to work veri hard besid univer . it 's just imposs for him to addit work voluntarili . and there are lot of case like him . but it 's probabl not just a matter of possibl , but of will . peopl tend to be veri focus on their own life , their own progress , their career . in order to achiev respect ( which in our societi is veri much associ with materi success ) , one ha to be veri focus one himself or herself . `` if you want to achiev someth profession , you should'n wast time '' , thi is more and more common sens . and although i believ , that mani posit , rather abstract advanc aris when help other voluntarili , i do not believ , that these advanc are well recognis in our societi . and as individu is more and more a maxim at least where i live , it is a logic consequ , that peopl do not care so much for each other anymor .
