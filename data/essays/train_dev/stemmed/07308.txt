i disagre with the statement . i think there will be a increas need to own car around the world majorli due to ( i ) worldwid popul growth and ( ii ) industri of under or less develop countri . even though the rate of increas seem to modifi , the global popul is still in increas , therebi creat basic ground for the need of new car . as you may easili imagin , the more peopl live in the earth , the more person vehicl they will need , and certainli no other person vehicl ever invent will outbeat the car in the forese futur . the industri of under or less develop countri , such as those in africa or asia , will also creat new need for the car . look back the histori of 20th centuri , it is reason to think that there will be mani under or less develop countri will grow to be more industri in 20 year . the industri will stimul the construct of the infrastructur , such as the road and increas the level of incom of each peopl . when two thing combin , the massiv need for the new car will be creat . take for exampl , korea , my home countri , there were not mani car in 1980 's . howev , togeth with the rapid industri , a number of car use in korea ha increas dramat . one may argu that as the peopl grow older , they tend not to drive a car and as the averag life of peopl around the world get longer and longer , it will cut the number of car use in the futur . i agre , in part , to such argument , but in my view , when peopl get older , they normal do not buy new car when their car get outdat , rather than immedi dispos of the car that they own . therefor , such an impact , even though it may be real , will not be huge . put such factor into consider , i trust that the car which will be in use after 20 year will outnumb the be
