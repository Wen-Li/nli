i believ that age doe n't matter when it come to enjoy life , it is up to each person to make the best of it and squeez everi drop they can get . sometim when we are young we tend to think that old peopl had their time and that becaus they are so worri on their grandchildren , the cold weather , money problem or about their health problem they do n't enjoy life the way young peopl do . we believ that age is everyth until that a day come when you look back and think of the great memori you have and the great one that will still come . my grandmoth wa a great exampl . she alway use to tell me what her life wa like when she wa a littl girl grow up in a small town and move to a big citi , go out with her firend , her curfew and when my grandpfath propos . i thought about how great her life wa but never thought about how great her life is . sinc we see the present as someth common and even unrelev sometim i did n't see my grandmoth 's life as '' excit '' let alon fun when she wa 60 . now , after mani other convers , i got to know that life goe on and that everi day is enjoy , even if it 's your last . my grandmoth goe away on field trip with her friend while i am studi for a never end test , cook becaus she want to and not becaus she ha to , ha great stori to tell and alway wait for us with a great meal . enjoy get a differ mean while you are grow up . when you 're littl an ice cream and your mom is everyth . when you get older a toy or a new friend is veri import ; when you 're a teenag enjoy life is have friend around you and have someth you can identifi with like sport ; by colleg the challang of live alon , travel , go out to club and have a boyfriend/girlfriend is enjoy your youth . by the time you graduat hope you 'll get a good job , marri the man of your dream and watch your kid grow up . everi step of the way is enjoy then . in my opinion there are no time when you enjoy thing more than other , it 's up to you to make everi effort for everi moment to be worthi and worthwhil .
