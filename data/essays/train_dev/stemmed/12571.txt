i disagre with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i think the best way to travel is alon or with a freind . there are two reason . first , it 's more free . second , bagpack is more excit . the first reason is that i have much more free time than in a group . th be specif , i can go wherev i want and spend a lot of time in some place without ani resist . if i want to go shop , i do not care other peopl . so i can go small shop and see aroud where i interst . that mean i have freedom in a trip . second ting , it is more excit . for exampl , when i visti itali last year , i stay youth-hostel . in there , i made friend who came other countri . so , we went popular space , restaur , park and river togeth . until now , i contect her by email . even if i had not plan go concert in itali , i saw the pamplet and went there . i can not forget that concert . that 's whi i think best way to trevel is alon or just with a friend .
