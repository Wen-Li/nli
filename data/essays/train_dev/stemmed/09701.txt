some peopl believ that is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid but i disagre with sentenc . first , if we should n't travel with tour guid , we can sight see ani where for exampl , in the past year i went to japan with my freind without tour guid . i think it is not at all also we could arriv to the japan well and went on a shop , took the pictur with nativ peopl . ect . in thi travel , we get along with my freind . second , we can be known to travel place histori . by without a tour guid , we can studi about the travel place histori . nowday , accord the intern social develop , we can saw mani japan 's informationg and histori . such as read a tour guid book and the internet web surf . in thi reason , i think i like the best way to travel is in a group without tour guid leader .
