the lifestyl and activ of the young and old peopl are alway compar . while the young peopl think that the way of life old peopl lead is slow and bore , old peopl complain about the speed of the young peopl 's life . peopl , young or old , have a limit time to live . . in addit to thi peopl should live their life full of enjoy and with activ . wecan clearli observ that there are more activ for the young peopl around . it can be seem as a discrimin but it must be accept that in today 's world young peopl spend ore time at outsid and also spend more money . in thi situat it can be conclud that young peopl have more chanc to enjoy life . on the other hand , what about the peopl whose age is old but young himself ? i mean that sometim age doe not the mean of everyth . person who ha had a enjoy life can continu hi life in same way . in addit to thi , the concept ` experi ' is veri import . when the peopl are young they do not have the chanc of awar of what is true and wrong . therefor it is possibl to make mistak and destroy hi life . ofcours it is not someth certain but even it is just a possibl it is a situat that must be thought on . on the other hand old peopl who had sever mistak befor gain experi and make less mistak . and in my opinion it is a good way of enjoy the life . anoth import thing is that enjoy life is also up to the prefer and idea of the peopl . there can be young peopl who enjoy do thing that associ with the old peopl . for instanc , a young person may not like the night life . instead of thi he may prefer to dtay at home nd chat with famili at night . anoth exampl is fish with a boat . most of the young peopl think that it is bore but it can be also a sourc of enjoy for a young person . in conclus , it is import to beliv in life and it beauti . if a person know how to enjoy life it is not importanr if he is old or young .
