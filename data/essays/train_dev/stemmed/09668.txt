i disagre with the follow statement becaus if we as student are to learn and understand idea and concept we need to learn the primari fact . without fact learn someth won Â´ t be useless but it will be hard to understand . fact tell us about someth real that happen or is happen now . fact or non-fict talk mostli on the subject histori and scienc . in my point of view whi would we need idea if the fact have all the idea we need to write down . concept like renaiss ( french for rebirth ) and atom are all histori and scienc concept so the concept would be useless without the fact be laid in front of you . a student for exampl might know what an atom or proton is but would they know the complet definit or where the word origin from . he might also have an idea of the renaiss but he might not know the main idea of the renaiss like famou peopl like leonard da vinci or michaengalo or origin of the concept . the fact we read and write are all necessari for student to fulli understand and idea or a concept . also a student might have troubl defin a certain concept on a histori exam or test . he or she might pass with a 60 or 61 but what would have happen if he or she knew the fact and got a 70 or 80 . also a student may get an assign about identifi the main idea without hi or her textbook . he or she may not have read the page of hi textbook and might not know a thing about the assign and get a 0 or 50 . if he had studi the most import fact in hi textbook he would have gotten a 90 or 100 . all the thing i am talk about explain the need to know fact in order for a student to understand the word idea and concept .
