in gener i agre that most advertis let peopl think that product are better as they are in realiti . there are three differ type of public that make it product better as they are . the first group of advertis is the one that simpli lie about the qualiti of a certain product . it say that product are abl to do thing that are not true to make the product seem better . a product is better the more thing it can do . today often it is not enough if peopl can use a certain machin just to do one thing . becaus peopl need mani thing today and they do not have a lack of space ( and often also a lack of money ) to buy for everyth a new machin . so today a mobil phone need to have a camera , a radio , a alarm clock and mani thing more in addit to a telephon . so often today compani use lie to make the product seem better as it is . the consequ of thi is that the custom are disapoint and do not buy product of thi compani anymor and do not recom thi firm to their friend . so the compani often is not abl to surviv a long time . there is a second type of public . mani compani exager when they discrib their product . one way for exager is to make the advertis thing seem nicer on a pictur or at televis as it is in realiti . mani technic product look after a short time of use veri old . in the advertis a shaver look veri new although the man in the public say that he is use it alreadi for a long time , a year or so . or often product look bigger or packag give the impress that they are fuller as they are in realiti . the consequ of those advertis are not so grave . peopl are use to the fact that advertis exager and ofthen peopl do not complain becaus of those detail if they like the product in gener . those exager are not essenti . the third group of public are also lie but thi group differ from the second group mention abov . those lie are lie that peopl do not believ . a compani sometim say imposs thing about a product just to make it famou and to let the peopl think about it . a veri famou exampl is a drink that is call red bull . the advertisemet say that if somebodi drink red bull he is suppos to get wing and to fli . but everybodi know that today it is not possibl ( or not yet ) to drink someth and then be abl to fli . so that is a lye ( it can be call also a white lie ) that nobodi believ . it can be also seen as a strong exagger that doe not harm anybodi . final it think that most compani make product seem muck better in the advertis as they realli are . but today compani often do not have anoth possibl as to do so . becaus there are so mani advertis and peopl just look at the one which seem interest and innov to them . so there is a big battl of the best advertis .
