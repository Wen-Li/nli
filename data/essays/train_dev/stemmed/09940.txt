i believ that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it follow that , learn the fact is ineffect for the student as the memor fact would easili be forgotten . howev , student will not forget what they learn if they understand the idea or concept . now i shall state the benefit of understand idea and concept rather than fact . firstli , a student should tri to understand the idea beneath a certain fact in order to rememb how that idea work and lead to that fact . what i mean by thi is that , if a student learn the reasons-concept of a fact it will be much easier for him to use that knowledg in the futur as he can use the concept to reach to the fact . secondli , learn concept make it easier for a student to see the whole pictur or in other word to look in a broader perspect . it follow that , learn through a systemat path will be more useful for the student as through gener and special student may learn better . for instanc , when i wa in high school i wa not abl to memor the mathemat fact such as theorem but then i found it more easi to learn these theorem through learn certain concept and idea that are relat to those fact . furthermor , learn the concept and idea appear to be more import as the fact will not be use in daili life situat . what i mean by thi is that as peopl do need to cope with the problem of life by themselv , it will be more reason to teach them the idea and concept in order to provid them a model by deal with their problem . it follow that , fact do not make student clever although they make them wise . howev , the idea and concept can make the student clever if they tri to adopt these in their live . to sum up , learn the concept and idea appear to be more import as they provid a long-last and effect learn . therefor , instead of learn fact student should tri to learn the idea and concept as they can rememb these in the futur and use them for acquir the fact they need . last but not least , systemat learn is the key to achiev success so learn idea and concept provid thi systemat learn .
