i disagre with thi statement becaus i guess that in the futur there will be a lot differ car becaus the industri will produc more differ model of car and the peopl will be attract by evolv futur technolog . nowday the govern are make a lot effort , but not enough in my opinion , to fight the pollut , and one of these is to give econom support to someon buy electr car that doesn ' t damag the enviro . for thi reason i believ that a lot of peopl will be need to buy new car and will be attract by new futurist model . anoth import reason of the car ' s number increas in twenti year is that the peopl , like today , will consid to own a veri nice car as statu symbol and will tri to demonstr to each other to be the most actract and respect person onli for have a beati car . furthermor anoth aspect that we have to consid , is that our societi will be alway more sedentari becaus the peopl will not toler to go to work or shop by public transport and will like rather than move toward the downtown drive a veri new car with all option in order to show to other peopl . i think that thi aspect is veri stupid but i see everi day thi behavior and i guess that it will not chang . in conclus i believ that the number of car will be greater than today , and we will have alway more enviroment probem , and the traffic and car accid will increas . thi is my pessimist view of the futur
