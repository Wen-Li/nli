today , gain braodband inform gain more anf more import with the develop of scienc and technolog , basic , the academ environ is the one who follow the technolog more close than the other institut and compani . it can be easili state that the peopl who want to be involv in so much inform should be in the acdem environ . the peopl who invent new thing that chang our live had come from the academ enviren . for instac , take a look into the histori of scienc and technolog . you will confront with einstein , pasteur and etc . the common thing in all these peopl is that these peopl come from academ . in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . if you again take a look at the histori , you can easili see that the invent had been made by peopl who can combin their knowledg from differ area . for instanc , did you know einstein wa work as a patent offic befor he came up with the famou rel theori . thi fact should not be a surpris for anyon becaus he wa read lot of patent document dure hi work in patent offic . he combin these subject that he had gain from patent and hi academ experi . it is also good to be an expert in one academ area but the person , who build hi academ carrer in thi way , is gener limit with the inform in one area . the good thing is that he know all the detail of informaton in one area with an enorm depth but it gener requir to have intemedi level of informaton in all academ area to come up with innov idea . these peopl who have inform in all area take inform from the expert in specif area . i think that it is gener better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . the histori of innov is full of peopl with intermedi level of inform from all academ area . think again if a person can go much further in gener if he is an expert of onli a small academ subject .
