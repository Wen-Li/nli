i totally agree with this statement . and i think a lot of example can be found in everyday life . just look at the advertisement you can get in the normal supermarket , like food . in the advertisement everything seems very healthy , even the choclate nut cake with cream . the company of the product tell you how much vitamin or other healthy thing their product contains . maybee , that there is a huge amount of a special vitamin found in the choclate nut cake , because of the nut it cotains . but the advertisement doe n't mention how many fat is in there because this of course would n't turn out to be a very healthy figure . in the past year the advertisement tried to capture probable buyer of their product with the sign `` zero fat '' or `` zero sugar '' . but honestly , who ever expected a lollipop for example to contain fat ? other non-eatable product like detergent or facial cream a well are not the magical liquid and fluid they pretend to be . many people let the advertisement lead their trolley in the supermarket . and when they are at home they discover the truth behind all the colorfull promise . one thing that show , that even the politician are aware of the danger of the all to promising advertisement is the prohibition of tobacco advertisement on tv and in newspaper . the tobacco industry ha a lot of money , so they can afford the best advertisement which promise the consumer freedom , coolness , cleverness and a lot of other thing if only they lit a cigarette . the fact that wealthy company can spend a lot of money on promising advertisement on the other hand mean that that smaller company that ca n't afford expensive advertisement ca n't promise too much to the cosumers . of course this doe n't mean , that product with le promising advertisement necessarily are healthier product . but in my opinion it is more likely .
