i believe that it is better to have wide knowledge of many academic subject than to one specific subject . the reason is , narrow knowledge is very unuseful . for example , when i am a student studying about only one academic subject , and if i must change the theme of study , i will in trouble and at a loss . because in the situation , i must study other subject from very basic part . but if i have widespread knowledge about other subject , i will change my theme easily . but studying broad subject is giving up to gain profound knowledge in the same time . one subject taker can spend his time for the subject only , therefore it make him a professional of the subject . on the other hand , many subject taker must spend his time for each subject . so , wide subject taker may have just sharrow knowledge about each subject . this is the wrong point of studying many subject . but , i think , there is no reason to have profound knowledge . because profound knowledge is useless in the social life . example , while i am working , i use no deep academic knowledge . deep academic knowledge make no money .
