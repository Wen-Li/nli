do young people enjoy life more than the older people do . i do not agree with the given statement because , young people are very immeture to their age and can see thing only in one point of view and analise thing to a limited extent , in fact will not be able to enjoy anything to the fullest . in contrast older people analise thing in broader way which facilitates them to understand thing better ultemately lead to more enjoyment . for examlpe if any good novel is read by both the young and old people a older people have experienced much more thing in life these experience help them to enjoy the situation in novel better than the young people can do . as older people have broader knowledge about the wrold around them have better understanding of the thing and are able to analise thing better secondly when tour is planned by the older people with their maturity in thinking they are able to arrenge the thing accordingto the need and try to take fuul enjoiment of the tour , when it come to young people in their over enthusiasm they tend to neglect thing to plan early ultimately may get into onconviences and problem on the trip . if we take any relationship into cosideration young people lack understanding about the depth of the relation and will not be able to enjoy the relation emotional affection to the fullest . for example in a father and son relationship the feeling of immence pleasure a father can enjoy when he spends time with his son , a he treat his son a a invaluable treasure and cherishes every action of a child where a a son may not be able to enjoy the time spent with father a a very plesant a he is not matured enough to understand the depth of the father-son relation a the father doe . thus in my opinion i regard older people can enjoy life pleasure better due to maturity of thought and the contribution of rich experience of their long exposure to the world . which younger people lack .
