i completely agree with the statement . i think that the only way to be successful is to fix a target and , once it ha been achieved , to move it forward and try to get it again , even if there are a lot of possibility to drop . many people think that the fortune ha a big role to the way of success and i agree with them but i also think that fortune kiss just few people . i also think that success ha not to be , always , linked to the money : there are a lot of good example of doctor who are , of course , success person , but they are not rich a a big manager or owner of a multinational company . i also do n't think that success people are better than not-success people : there are people that naturally tend to the success and others that judge their life good enough without any kind of success . it happens that not-success people are happier than the others . i think i 'm a person who is forced to tend to the success : i do n't want a normal life a a lot of my friend have . i 'm fighting every day , fixing target , sometimes impossible to get , in order to be able one day to say : `` ok , that ' s enough for me '' . i absolutely do n't think to be better than the others , a i said before , but i feel inside something that push me forward every single day : it 's not a good sensation because there 's always something i have to do or to run for . after the university , i moved to china for work : it ha been a big chance for meut a lot of my friend disagreed with my choise because china wa too far and i did n't need to go there to have a job . the problem wa that i did n't want a normal job and it 's exacty what success people want : they want to do something that is not common to other people in order to build a good career .
