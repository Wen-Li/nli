do you agree or disagree that successful people try new thing and thak risk rather than only doing what they already how to do well . as far a i am concerned , i agree that successful people only try new thing and taks risk . in my opinion that successful people must have some kind of the special capacibilitis that normal people do n't have . these are my opinion in the following reason . first of all , i wander that what kind of people will have a lot of gut to become successful ? they must obtain a greatness dream to stimulate them keep moving on . for example , if they want to finish this hard work that bos ask for them to do , they must work on harder and harder , even no time to eat . this target is one they want to achieve and want to get the bos 's praise , so they take the risk may become unhealth to conqure the goal . secondly , no pain , no gain . i indicate the people who are willing to take the risk must have the scene of confidance . for stance , there ca n't be complete the whole thing without confidance . however , the successful people show their confidance in when they are find the way to deal with the problem and figure out the tough issue . moreover , the hard-wroking people represence the most confidance when they have no way to do , they can utilize their individual ability to overcome the problem . to sum up , i utter that the successful peopole that try new thing and take risk make them become success . in the end , i will conclude my opinion by emphasizing . people need to have the creatibility to think the new method to deal with problem , espesially when they get stuck in the awful way .
