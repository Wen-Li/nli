i agree with this statement . in my opinion , if you want to be successful in your live , you have to take some risk on several moment . for example , people who only do thing that they know it always go well usually do n't settle for changing their job . because of that , they can lose a magnifical ocassion for getting a best job and also for earning more money . on the other hand , on numerous ocassions successful people start new bussiness although they are not sure they will go well . but , they do n't bother doing that because they usually are very positive people . even thing do n't go too well , this kind of people can see the positive side of thing . in contrast , taking too risk have also some drawback . before taking an important decission we have to think slowly about all thing and risk it ha . we must be very careful with our money and with the people who love and do n't take risk with them . if we always take decissions quickly perhaps some day we will have problem .
