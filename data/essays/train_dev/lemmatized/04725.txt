i disagree with statement : `` in twenty yers there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' , because i do not think that our society could live with le car , even if i would be totally pleased if it happened . i disagree with this statment , first of all because i can see , in every day life , that the number of the car is increasing . for example , when my mother wa young her family wa composed from four person and they had just one car , but they were completely normal , now , in my family we are just three and we have two car , and we would like to buy another car . another important fact is that industry are always trying to make new car with new thecnologyes inside , to emit le pollution . in this way , it would not be a problem if ther will be more car . in addiction , car have become foundamental in our culture both in big and little cityes , and in particoular for whose who live far from the city . everyone nowadays who ha an emergency need to have the car , to go to the supermarket , but also to the hospital etc . there could be different solution , instead of using car , even if it is not easy to make people understand it . in particoular in big city people should use public transport wich do not creat any pollution , and they are quick and confortable . in smaller city , where there is not the possibility of using publing transport , people should use the bike or walk , when it is possible , wich are better both for the pollution of the enviroment and the health of the people . in conclusion , unfortunately i do not think that in future there will be fewer car in use than today . however there are several solution to the problem given by the car than can be adopted .
