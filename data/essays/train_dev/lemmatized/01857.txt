if it is about student , it is more important to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . there is pro and con for this issue . however , i think it is much more important to learn about idea and fact . first of , we all sure that education is the most crucial subject that influence a society development . today the competion between country and company is global . so how can you differ your product or company from the others ? the answer is creativinity . if you can think different , you will eventually produce different and live different than others . to improve creativinity we should urge the student to think different . nonetheless , it is impossible if you just make them learn the information . secondly , we have to consider the aspect of learning . the natural way of it is experience . that is why the best school around world have also the best lab . you should let them experience by themselves . since the experince is the most valuable and the expensive knowlege . just consider how the civilization rise . it is more permenant to help someone to comprehend someting than to force them to learn . i think , this is the problem , which we have in my country , turkey . for instance , i study engineering . the more i make experiment , more i feel confident about my knowlege . therefore , it is more essential to learn the idea and the concept . if you just memorize somethink , believe me you wo n't keep it for a long time . third of , we also should consider the joy of learning . would it be enjoyable just by learning the fact . for example , let think about the magnetism . i can assure is is quite boring if you just give the fact to the student . on the other hand is really interesting when you see it yourself in a lab . in conclusion there are many way of learning . learning by understanding idea , concept and principle could have some drawback . however this wont change the fact that it is the best way .
