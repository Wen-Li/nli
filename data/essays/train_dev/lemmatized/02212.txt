transportation vehicle are among the necessity of today 's modern urban life . it can be argued that all kind of transportation vehicle facilitate our life . it is needle to say that car is the most effective and widely used transportation vehicle today . however , the development in public transportation and the fluctuation in oil price bring my mind that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in this essay , the reason that influence people to change their transportation habit in twenty year will be explained . to begin with , urban life becomes more crowded day by day . as a result of this , people hardly find space to park their car . in addition , in order to solve transportation problem in urban landscape , municipality and other agent develop project . thanks to these project , underground system , municipality bus and other kind of public transportation are provided . moreover , air transportation is highly developed today . as a fruit of these change , people prefer public transportation facility more than they did before . for example , i saw this trend in new york city . although people afford to buy car , they prefer to use public transportation . one of the citizen whom i talked with said that twenty year ago there were more car in new york city than there are today . therefore , we can say that twenty year later , there will be fewer car seen on the street . another factor that affect poeple 's choice in term of transportation is oil price . oil price fluctuates every year . thus , people can not predict how much money that they should pay for oil . although oil is relatively cheap in developed country , it price can be rocketed suddenly . for example , during the gulf war , oil price increased too much . in short , oil price is profoundly related to the development in politics especially in oil prodcing country . as a result of this unstable structure of ol price , car become an expensive vehicle for transportation . to sum up , in my opinion in twenty year there will be fewer car i use than there are today . this will realise because of the development in public transportation and the unstable price of oil which make the car an uncomfortable and expensive transportation vehicle .
