i 'm going to have to agree with that statement with most case around the globe , but the attention that young people give to their community relies mostly on their culture . in the western world , in country in europe and north america mostly , the notion of `` duty '' and `` honor '' have almost entirely disapeared from young people conscience , parent are not teaching their child to love and defend the communites they 've grow in and there is no mistery about why young people don'y contribute much time , that when child are going to turn into teenager , then young adult they wo n't give much about what happens in their community . today `` community service '' in the west is a form of punishment for the minor who draw on wall , sell drug , steel or commit other violation of the law . take for an example the number of young people who would go to a rap a concert where they are encouraged to consume drug and told to sleep with prostitute , and compare that number to that of the young volounteers who wanted to help the catrina or 9/11 victim for example . in other part of the world , or in `` the third world '' a the westerns call them , young people still care about their comunities and country much more to dirty music , we can see a much diffrent atmosphere . take the last war israel waged on lebanon and the countless young men and woman who volounteered to help the red cross or other humanitarian organisation in order to help the civilian victim who might 've survived the israeli raid . when you see young one still helpingthat much their comunities , you ca n't say that every where young people do not give enough time to help their community . to conclude , we can say that wether the young one help their community enough or not depends primarily on the culture of the concerned country or community .
