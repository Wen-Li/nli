i naturally have to agree with statement . nowadays , one can easily see that a lot of element are forcing u to put our car in the garage and not to use it . we will try to analyze in the following part all these reason which can make u think that in the future , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . on the one hand , it is really simple to see that today , a car seems to be the best way to go from a place to an other one . but we must ask ourselves if it will stay like that forever . prices of plane company are cheaper day after day and price of car ' insurance are still expensive . moreover , since the war in irak , i do not think that the price of oil will fall soon . one ha to think clearly about the reason which will make him use his car a it will cost him a lot . and a people are more and more conscious about it , we can hope that government will help to support people to take the bus to go to work . on the other hand , there is one point that we certainly do not have to miss : the pollution . how can we accept to use something which will kill our planet and our child in the future ? it is totally unbelievable . it cost a lot of money , it is not good for u and the planet and finally that is definetly not the fastest way to go somewhere you can not go by walk . i trully think that in the future , people will choose other way to go at work and more than that , will not buy car anymore . come hell or high water , we can not accept to live a we are today , it is an egoist state of mind . if we really need car , we should keep it for the rainy day and not use it everytime we have to do something . to put it in a nut-shell , i personnaly think that in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today a it cost a lot and it will kill ourselves if we continue . people will understand that the planet is more important than going somewhere quickly , and if it is just a matter of speed , they will take the plane or the train .
