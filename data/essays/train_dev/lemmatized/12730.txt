there is an increasing number of traveling per unit person from the year of 2000 to 2005 although the event of september 11 happened in united states in 2001 . it may due to the fact that more people like to travel outside from their country in order to acquire knowledge of culture and value from other country . from my point of view , i firmly believe the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . first of all , i dislike the feeling of being alone . i would even invite a friend or colleague being with me in the journey from school to home . as a reult , i surely suggest the best way to travel , especially for the long trip , should be in a group . there is a sentence i read from an author , ` the shortest distance to go to usa from hong kong is any route you chose but should be with your best friend . it is because the time go the fastest . ' it surely indicated that the happeness to travel with a group of people . moreover , travel in a group can faciliate the interaction between friend . it is because the whole trip will bound all the people together in a certain period , the relationship will become more closer . secondly , most of people go to travel solely want to have more knowledge in history , culture and living style of other country . if there are no expert from your friend in trip , a tour guide is very important . the tour guide no only can be the dictionary for certain district area , but also can be the helper for you to understand the culture of a country since most of them are native person . thirdly , the cost will be much cheaper to travel outside in group than individual . in many case , the cost can be shared by friend . for example , it is very usually to hire a taxi to go to different location including those of art gallery . football match pitch or other scene . a taxi can accommodate four person and the cost can be shared . in conclusion , it is wise to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
