for this question there are two main way of developed it . the first is that today there are an incredible number of car in the world , in europe and in the north america the market is full , but in asia , for example , the rapidly grow up of population could have increase a number of car . the second is that in europe and u.s.a. the public kind of transportation are forever in amount and the car began an older kind of transportation . i think that the second way is the best solution for this big problem of car number in the world , and so i agree with this question : in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
