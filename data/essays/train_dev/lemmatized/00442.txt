whether one enjoys or not , depends mostly on the individual definition of enjoyment . if a person find one work interesting , he/she will drive immense enjoyment in doing it , even though the same job might appear extremely drab to another person . in order to do justice to the statement made here , we need to understand how the preference of young and old people differ in term of their activity . this statement seems to be written by a young person who feel that his/her present pursuit of vibrant physical activity , adventure and long vacation spent in travelling to exciting destination are his sole source of enjoyment . because he feel that he might not be able to do these thing in advanced age , older age might be boring in all respect . however looking from the perspective of an old person , having lived his/her younger life in constant activity , lot more enjoyment is found in doing the other kind of thing . these can be small little thing like reading book , soaking sun in the garden , gardening , playing with child and the like . we need to understand here that it is not that they have to do this , but because they choose to do this which in turn is simply because they enjoy doing it . i am not generalising all the elder people a dormant personality who indulge in le physical activity . there are case that one come across in which people in old age resolve to do something very demanding in physical term just because they could not do it when they were younger , and they feel that doing it would bring them lot of satisfaction and enjoyment . thereby we have story of some 60-70 year old trying their hand at trekking or a cross-country run . i agree that there can be case where a person might become physically unfit to take up an activity that he would really want to . this might happen more often in old age , but we need not forget that young people are not completely excluded from that . there can be case where people in young age are incapacitated in various aspect a well . but even in such case one will surely engage oneself in some activity that he/she might eventually end up enjoying a lot . it is apt to mention here that enjoyment emanates from an initial emotion of accomplishment . when one feel having made an accomplishment in any field , he/she start ` enjoying ' it . to conclude , i wish to reiterate that enjoyment and happiness are a state of mind and matter of personal choice rather than absolute entity . hence to say that criterion of age , sex , education , opportunity and the like will bar someone from ` enjoying ' , is not correct .
