understanding fact are more important than understanding concept . some people said `` we have only some real fact and others are theory . '' but i disagree about that because of make problem when we make standard , make confuse , and attitude . when i wa in high school in second grade they have problem in korean sat . they make a question about universe . but the fact is different from the answer because our text book is old one . some student complain about the question . the goverment have to agree about that . so they have to make two answer at one question . even it suppose to ha one answer . our country usually think fact is more important than concept . but this kind of problem always happend when they make standardize test . make confuse is other important reason that i disagreement . if school teach concept more important than fact they have to make mistake when they teach their student . they have to make some example for explain their concept . but concepts is more important than fact they use wrong example but easy to explain that concept . maby this problem make student dum . if school teach concept more than fact student atittude can go wrong way . in every work or problem they just think about the problem 's concept . if they get bad grade because they use wrong fact they always complain to teacher and school about their grade . they think they are right because they use right concept . their fact are not important for them . learning concept is useful for study ; because it 's one of the easy way to unerstanding problem . and it 's work pretty well at socail work . but in math and other important sceince subject it never work because it doe n't need wrong fact for explain their concept .
