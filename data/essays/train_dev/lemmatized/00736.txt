the question askes to discus the usage and the effect of advertisement on product . first of all , my opinon about this question is that advertisement do change the point of view in term of it quality or usage . many customer become manipulated in the way how a product is presented . for example the store aldi in germany sell many different food product . these product are not advertised at all and have no nice branding and design . that make them cheaper and many people buy these to save money and still get very good product . these people are the minority of all customer in germany . most of the people buy their food in great warehouse . these market use a lot of advertisement to offer their good . even these good come from the same production or have the same quality a good from aldi . the people buy them because of the better style or the higher price . quality ha it 's price they think . in fact this show that people trust more in the quality and taste of product if the advertisement tell that . another example are televison advertisement . usually there are nice-looking people acting to manipulate the spectator . the spectator think he or she could be this human and get more atractive if he or she buy the product . the importance of the product is not important anymore . to manipulate the customer and giving him the illusion life can not continue without buying this product is a very common procedure nowadays . therefore many magazine offer testing report on product of main interest . they test each item and rank all of them afterwards in term of quality or price . many people today do not buy electronic item before they have researched testing report and comment from other people . it is too unsafe for them to buy in an affect of a nice advertisement . it is more important to get what is needed .
