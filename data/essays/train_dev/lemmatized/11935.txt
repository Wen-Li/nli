we are dealing with the issue of whether it is more important for the student to learn fact or is it more relevant to understand the idea and concept behind them . the issue is important because it is very essential to keep this requirement in mind when teaching the student . i personally feel that learning concept and idea is definitely more required than memorizing the fact . the first reason i would like to present for this belief is that fact can be obtained from a various variety of resource like book , internet or any other knowledge center whereas the idea and concept are not that simple to obtain . they require considerable effort and time both to teach and assimilate and they are compulsory for the better understanding of a topic . they are much difficult to unlearn for a long period of time and hence are more useful and play a much important role in every person 's life . secondly , the student need to be provided with practical knowledge on how to survive in the world after they cross a certain age limit and they do not have their parent ' support and constant guidance . they will have to fend for themeslves for which they will need logic and concept more than fact . therefore , these should be provided without fail to all student . finally , if the student are provided with more number of fact then they are prone to forget them easily a they shall not be able to apply them to real-world situation . the concept provided to them will have numerous example that can be cited and hence this form of education is likely to be retained by them for longer period of timeor most probably will last them an entire lifetime . to conlude and summarize , i feel that providing a student with education based on logical reasoning and fact is benificial than just helping them to learn fact a this will make them independent and will help them in every aspect of their life and will be with them for their entire period of their life unlike fact .
