nowadays most of the people could n't do without their car . there is no doubt that the grade of dependance upon the car varies considerably depending on the culture and the country we are focusing on . for example , in the american way of life a car is simply essential , while the citicens of amsterdam , for instance , make a greater use of bicicles than car . however , we desperatly depend on something that must have and end and whose end is unlikely very close : oil . therefore , everybody would agree in the fact that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . perhaps twenty year is n't a long time but i 'm sure that we are at a turning point . in my opinion there have already ben made incredible improvement that would have helped u to move towards ecological car . however , i 'm certain that at this point it ha n't been interesting economically speaking puting them in the market . more than once have we heard in the news that an engineer ha finally discovered how to build a car that work with hidrogen or other organic material . however , just a happens with the powerful industry of medicament , sometimes an improvement is ironically not benefitial . i probably sound tremendously skeptical but i must say that i 'm hopeful that someday not in a long time somebody will make a car that doe n't pollute and depends on a renovable good . that would definately cause an increase in that car 's demand , what would mean a dicrease in the use of the traditional car . anyway , even if my best wish do n't come true , i would still believe that in twenty year time a decrese in the use of the traditional car will occur in the developed country . to ilustrate my point i will take china a an example . the population in china is huge and , while most of europe and north america ha already experience a crazy developing period that ha lead them to industrialisation and our actual welfare , china and many other asiatic country are now at that point . and , unlikely , we can not demand en ecological consciousness from them , when we ourselves have had non of it . and if all the chinese buy a car . ..
