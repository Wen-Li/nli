the idea in question is that whether young people nowadays give enough time to helping their community or not . i personally feel that the statement is valid and absolutely true . the benevolence and the kind of caring that young people posse have dwindled down the year . firstly , young people are faced with stiff competition from their peer nowadays than they previously faced . this requires them to work very hard in order to earn a decent job and to even have a dignified life . young people of late , being over burdened , are obsessed with their own life and the adage ` the survival of the fittest ' is becoming more and more appropriate and hence they have very little time to devote to the society . the community matter are clearly second preference subject for them . secondly , set aside the young people , the ethical and moral value and feeling of attachment with society have reduced over the year in all people both young and old . today , we boast of internet facilites and other advance of technology that help u to easily keep in touch with a large number of people but we are hardly bothered about the person who life the next door ! all segment of the society , whether young or old , have become more egotistic and insouciant to the need of their community . and hence young people have naturally followed this trend of being indifferent . lastly , the community nowadays are many time larger than the community that had existed previously . in older community , every member of the community knew every other member and they coexisted like the member of the same family . but in modern time , small community are replaced by gigantic metro and cosmos where million of people dwell and hence the community , which is typically a small congregation of people with shared interest , is displaced by huge group of people that can no longer be logically called community ! people have diverse interest and thus there is a drastic decrease in their interdependancy and the need to co-operate . thus , young people who are a subset of the these people have become naturally inconsiderate about the need of their community . to sum up , i feel that the statement ` young people nowadays do not pay any heed to their community ' is indubitably true . young people in the modern time have become narcissitic and more selfish . they put themselves first and are more concerned about personal gain rather that progress of the community a a whole .
