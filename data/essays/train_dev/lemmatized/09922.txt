i disagree with the statement that having a wide knowledge in academic subject is better then beeing a specialist in onlz one subject . there are several reason to confirm my opinion i will list . the first argument for this is that with having a special education you will recieve a great job and earning much money . i will show the example of an architect . for this job you need a special education in only one way of an acedemic subject . arcitects for example are looked after on the job market and because of this they would earn much money and having fun in their job . but when you have a great knowlegde of many acedemic resourses you might have problem with fining a job , having a career and earn much money . reasons for this is that in the most company you are required to have a special education . so there will not be any job challenge for this kind of broad educated people . a second point why i prefer having a special education is that in my opinion you are more satisfid with you life and yourself . being a specialist mean a great feeling . you have ability only a few other people have and then you know why having studied for a long time . this creates also respect in the society and kind of personal honor . i think this are great feeling which make your life otherwise when you have studied a huge area of subject you are also an academic educated person . but is it realized by the others or are you happy with that . i think no because there are always other people who are better than you in a special topic . if you have studied a bit math a bit physic and a bit biology . there will allways be speacialists af these subject who know it better than you . this i think creates sadness or depressed feeling to your own and is a reason why i disagree with the statement . concludet it ha to be said that no matter what education it is important to have any
