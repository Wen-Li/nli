history of succeful people clearly tels that without risk develapment of human kind will be only a big zero like sun or moon . i totaly agreed with the statement success come only in the way of risk . take an example of sceince world thin life without electisity , computer , aroplains , butiful car and most importent life healing madisince . without word `` experiment '' scince world is nathing and the other name of experiment is risk , and trying new thing is risk . which it self show the importance of risk in succesful person like eanstine and manu other scentists who made this world comfertable and energetic . know take an example of field of politics . in field of poletics take an example of mahatma gandhi who took risk and applied new way of revolutin in india he work on the princeple that `` peas '' . while during the revolution he ford against britisher with peas no wepone no violence fight but onle the peace wich worked very well and he got the success in result of indipendence of india . he is not the only one person in politics who is successful while taking risk or tring new thing but there are many . know take another example from the history , the great sea explorer who discoverd america , india and many country if they have not taken the risk and tried new path definatly our the world will be like a hevenly body like moon , black and dark . in the conclusion i again state that without taking risk of tring new thing life is nathing but only like a wild life ie bournd , lived and fianly died . for me the meaning of life is to work for success by tyring new thing and taking risk . and achiving my goal and target .
