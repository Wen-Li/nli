how to became a successful person ? i think that nobody could have a right answer for this question , but i 'm sure that it 's something linked with the caracteristics of each different personson . according to me , in order to start the carrier through the success it 's importand to have a solid base , that mean knowledge and experience . so in the beginning i think that everyone should exploit his quality in the best way , bulding up a solid structure that help him to grew up . when this first step is done , you are able to try new thing , to go in field differents from the one of the basic knowledge : in other word , to risk ! for me , this is the characteristic that make you a real successful person , because when someone act in this way mean that his really proud and sure about his own possibility . i 'll write an example , to better explain this point . my father used to have a good job , not far away from home , that allows him to get enought money to live his life without any kind of problem . some year ago he 's got the opportunity to go to work abroad , chanching company working , far away from his family : he did n't even know much about the new job , but he decided to take this chance , and risk . i can not say that my father is the biggest successful man that i 've ever known , but of course he 's got much more success , than if he 'd chosen to continue his previous job . so , i think that to risk is difficult , but if you want to do `` something '' in your life , of course you have to do it ! and this is applicable for every kind of situation , that mean success for what concern your job , family , friend .
