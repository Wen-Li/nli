in my opinion , in the first part of our academic path , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . there are many reason which support my point of view . first of all , people need to have a good knowledge of the most of subject in order to understand which is the one they like most . how can we know what we like if we do n't know the distinct possibility ? otherwise , without a 360 degree view , he would n't be able to say which is his our favourite field of interest . the second point regard the importance of any single subject . each one of those transmits something unique and unsubstitutable . as mathematics developes our right part of the brain , literature and art work on the left one . and the same concept could be inferred to all other subject . the study of a given subject , doe n't only increase our knowledge of it , but improves also some of our personal skill and i think we need any kind of capacity in order to to be successful in life . another important point is about the social consequence of a high bandwidth knowledge . being informed on a lot of subject open u the chance to have conversation in distinct context and thus the chance of knowing distinct people . i think it is very important in a man 's life to have a large variety of knowledge because it could lead to an active social life . however , even if it ha to be most consistent part , i think a horizontal study of many academic subject ha to be necessarly followed by a more vertical phase . after we have understood what we prefer we need to get specialized in something in order to create our main interest , upon which we might build our future and our job .
