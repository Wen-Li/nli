through the year science a psychology and sociology have studied what it is more important for the human being to understand idea , concept , definition or to learn fact and many of them have got the conclusion that it is more important to understand because it ha many advantage for people and for the science than to learn fact . first of all , the brain work differently when human being to master comprehending idea than to master fact . the human being can store this information for more time what they are able to understand and can remember easily it , too . for sure when we learn only fact we can see that we forget in a few day or in a few minute that we learn . with this point we can show learn with fact is a waste of time . second , from the view of learning is better is that people can easily relate all that they learned when they are able to compare , differentiate and optimize between diferences and similarity between concept learning understanding than when they learn fact . with fact , people can not relate or well compare two event that they already happened in order to apply them directly in the present time . third , for the science this kind of learning brings more oportunities to create something new and be implemented in a competitive world . this last point is very important because we live in a changed world where everybody tryes to do something new and if we are able to decipher concept , of course we will be capable to create , invent idea in benefit of diferent field like in medicine , computer or in other field . at the end , i agree completely that it is better to learn understanding idea , concept that learn fact in order to improve not only our brain , mind but also be able to create new cure in medicine or an item that benefit in different field and going around againg , why not in health that it is one of field that need more solution than the rest of the science . understanding how work everything we will do a better world with solution and we will create a better quality of life for u and for the people oncomming .
