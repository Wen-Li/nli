in my point of view , the mentinoed statement must get a lot of support and i personally agree with the statement saying that product are made to seem much better by advertising than they really are . i belive this speaking from a personal experience . once i bought a set of roller pen . the specifacations were that those pen wrote in a 0.7 but when i used them , they were not even 0.3 . i think that the problem behind such an issue is the production company . those company try to make their product a attractive a they can in order to attract the most consumer . those company forget that once someone buy anything that doe much le than it say , it will be returned to the retail selling agent , and the retail selling agent will in return return it to the company where many other item have been returned . the result of this is that the name of the company will not be mush in the market , and will have no future product under the same name . it could be that what they were after is temporar profit . if this is the case , they succeeded . so , exaggerating the product 's description and the exaggeration in claiming that a certain product doe certain thing , while in reality doe not lead the consumer to think about and try the product before they buy it .
