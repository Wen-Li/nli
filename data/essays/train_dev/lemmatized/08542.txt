i agree with the idea that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year later than today . there are several cconditions to make this phenomenon possible . first , the fuel for car will be almost depleted in the future . this condition will render to decrease the amount of usage of the car . the usage of car will be distinct , when the energy source of the car are all used up . it will continue until the other energy are discovered . second , there will be other transportation which can replace the car . there will be a huge change in technology and science , thus other transportation can be developed . for example , the airplane can be produced in small size , small a car , with large amount , and by low cost . thus , it can be used a car we us in the present . last , the tranportations will not be needed at all . as i stated on the last paragraph , there will be a huge developement . a machine that can send people or material from one place to another place can be invented . if this kind of machine is invented , it will be worthless to use any transportation . in sum , there will be fewer usage of the car in twenty year later than that of the present . it will be fewer due to the lack of the source of energy , or the developement of other transportation , or the invention of the machine that can convey people and material .
