some people think that car are not very nesesary for our daily life but some people also think that car have very important role in our live . i think in twenty year there will be lot of car in use than there are today . in this essay i will give some reason and good example why i think like that . the first reason is that most of people would like to have a car . because car are the most comfortable and most exited preference for the people to go somewhere quickly . in fact this reason is really a considerable one that why people can not change their opinion . for example i have a car and when i want to go somewhere my first option is taking my car . instead of taking bus or walking . and i really sure most of driver think just like me. because it is the most comfortable one , even though it is not the cheapest one . the second reason is that people do not consider the traffic problem and this problem should be solved by goverment . they think that goverment should make big wide road and design perfect traffic regulation . people just use their car and do n't think the one of the reason of the traffic jam is their car . and also goverment can not take radical decision about traffic because everyone ha a right to use his or her own car everywhere he or she want . because of this there are not fewer car in use or we can say that there are lot of car in use now and it will be same in the future in conclusion because of most people would like to have a car and do not think to help about the solition of traffic jam there wont be fewer car
