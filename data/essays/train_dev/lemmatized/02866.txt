i disagree intwenty yeats there will be more car in use than there ae today . in moderen country such a japan they still use cara even they have new modren metroos and transption > aslo yung guyts like to putt it in accation mostly so they like to drive not driven or buy using some sort of new teghnalge that do n't have . in country such saudi arebia where i am from . we still do'nt have metrroes so ido n't think that car will be fewer use of it . becuse it take a long time to make road for metteroes and line btween city . so not in twenty year do n't think so . car have alot of use so if they goning to replce car with some new thing it not gioing to take twenty year it will take more that . so people will still use car i htink not just for the in twenty five or mybe more than that . also company that amkes car are going like a wind i nthe market of car peaople are wating for the newer in ever year so the butter car looked from how strong or the shaepd of it the size people will still have to buy it . so ithink big compny are aware if in twent year that if people stop using car somthin would came up . i iwoul say the will be more car use then ever in that past that for a fact becuse people will be more than naw . so do n't think about beening fewer car in use inthe feture . there no picter for the feture what we use to redose the use of car i mean think about going to skool with what using a bus or mettro no way not good at all .
