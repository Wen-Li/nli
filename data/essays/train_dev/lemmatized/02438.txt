i agree to the statement that most of the advertisement make their produts look more better than they really are . i agree this from my personnal experience , it ha happened with me all the time . when i see some advertise in television , news paper or a magazine , it look appealing to me but it give me nothing but disappointment . advertisers attract common peopel by using famous people , star and attractive model to sale their product . recently i saw one advertise in a magazine about one kitchen appliance which can cut and grind all the fruit and vegetable with ease and in all the shape and size you need . looking at the advertise and the way they had presented it felt like all my problem wil get solved by getting it at home . the very same day i got it and it proved to be a desaster , it could n't do a single thing that wa shown . marketers attract people by showing all the good thing which a person could imagine without judging it truth . many people do get fooled because of the advertisement . even produsers and distributer of movie try to sale their product by showing trailer in a manner that everybody feel that this movie is the biggest hit of the year and it is watchable . but many a time we come out without being entertained . advertisers are those who put a attractive gift wraper on the real product . they cover up fault and present it in a glamourous way which compels people to go for it .
