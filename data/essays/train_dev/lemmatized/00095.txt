i think how much he/she enjoy life doe not depend on how old he/she is . so i disagreeto the statement , because it show me that the difference of age cause some difference on enjoying life . the main reason of my opinion is whenever people can feel joyful on any situation only by his/her own feeling . and how peolple enjoy life doe deeply depend on how people think of happiness . it will change even in the same person in the different age . the case of sport , for example football , to run or move quickly , we need the good phisical ability and sensor . the younger people is , the quicker he/she move . but the quickness or speed are not only consisted of the joyful of football . to think the stragegy of goal or defence is one of the main portion of making the game . so the expariences of elder people will contribute to feel joyful on football game . so both young and old people have a chance to enjoy football . another case , in the season of rose , a person who know many rose ' name feel happy to get the new one only shown in the book , another person who have a good sensitive nose to feel the difference of the rose enjoy the smell of them . in this case , these two person skill or talent doe not matter with age . as i mentiond in above two example , the sensitiveness or musule ability might depend on how old he/she is . it is one of the difference between young and elder people , mainly coused by matuare and phsical condition . so there is a possibility for younger people enjoy much more . but we human ha a good matuared brain and how happy we are is jugged by his/her own brain . so if the person feel his life is happy , that is the evicence of spending his/her life with happyness and enjoying . anyone without him/herself can jugge how enjoy life anothers person .
