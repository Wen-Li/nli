many people have belief that young people today tend to spend le time to help their community . however , i disagree with the statement bacause there are a lot of way to help other people and we ca n't estimate how young adult help . to begin with , people can devote to their own society in different manner . without spending lot of time to work for others , they can dedicate themselves for the community . for example , one of my friend used to be blamed by others for not giving enough time to help the poor . however , she actually did her best to provide help through the internet . since she took a variety of class at her school , she could n't spend time just during the day . after knowing this fact , most people felt sorry to her and regreted to focus on just quantity of the feasible time . in addtion , helping others is not able to be observed , it also ca n't be estimated by an objective standard . of course , spending time would be a good basis , but it never show one 's all trying a i mentioned before . to give an idea , here is the example from kim-jun , who is one of the famous lawyer in korea . he are renowned for not only being successful in his career but also dedacation for the society . it is evident that he ha limited time to make multiple thing at the same time . in order to overcome this problem , he ha devoted for the community in various way which do n't need to long time . he provided a huge money for poor people and no one blame him although he dose n't spend enough time . in brief , i strongly support that young people have still do their best for the world . they have their own way to help others and we never evaluate their trying . for these reason , we should n't overlook how they contribute to our community just because they have n't spent a lot of time .
