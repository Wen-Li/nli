yes i agree with the following statement . doing what we already know will not give any knowledge . trying to do new thing will make the people to learn new thing though they are risky . with out attempt and risk we can not get sucess.a proverb specifies that `` something is better than nothing '' .by trying something will be obtain something . example , a scientist tried to discovered some thing . at first he felt very risky and he is not familiar . by trying he gather some information . and later he pass away and another will take off his work and continues . he may discovered the thing . but starting attempt he made by the person who had passed away . though he is not succeded but by attemption he had first seeded for discovering the new thing . all successfull people will face risk . after taking the risk only they will acheive fame . doing what we know will be safe but their will not be any growth and improve . with out any improvement we will be similar a common people . with out any acheivement in life we will fill bore . doing what we know will not gather any experience . and it will not be useful in lifetime . trying for new thing and leaning from the experience will make the life cheerful and succesful . trying for new thing will be hard at first but later we will get it fruit . conclusion , trying to do new thing will be useful at anytime . it may not be immediatlt but later .
