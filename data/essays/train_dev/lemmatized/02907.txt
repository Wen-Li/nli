it ha been commonly said that successful people do not do thing differently but they just think differently . successful people generally have the tendency of taking risk in situation . sucessful people generally have the knowledge and expertise apart from that they try and deal situation in a different manner . let u take the example of corporate leader like bill gate or warren buffet , who have been so successful in the corporate world . both of these men have dealed with situation in an unconventional manner and the result are with everyone to see . bill gates explored new territory of computer software which made the microsoft so famous . for a person to be successful in the world certain quality like leadership , business acumen , creativity and knowledge are very important . successful people along with these quality have risk taking ability . they generally take risk and try new thing which make them apart from the rest of the human herd . new innovation in science is another example of what human can achieve if they keep on trying with different thing . the idea of gravitation which wa given by newton wa because he thought differently from the rest of the people a every one in his time saw the apple falling from the tree . to try out new thing is very important and it is the quality which is inherent in most of the successful people . the successful people generally take failure in their stride . edison who invented the bulb had to face so many time failure yet he persisted with the idea of making the bulb and ultimately wa able to accomplish his goal . successful people generally along with their hard work and perseverance try and accomplish waht noone ha achieved till now . so i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing only what they know .
