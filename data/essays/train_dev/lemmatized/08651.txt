i do not completely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , simply because it depends on what the definiton of `` fun '' mean to these people . fun for young people , specially for an adolescent could mean a lot of thing like hanging out with his friend , throwing birthday party or even studying for an intellectual young individual that is . my point is fun could mean a lot of thing to a lot of different people . for the older people fun could mean just watching television or going for a long walk . for example , my grandfather who is about 75 year old ha a lot of fun having food of his kind . yes , this is true when a person ha reached a particular age he start pleasing himself or having fun with venial thing like these . this doe not mean that he is n't enjoying his life . he ha his own way to enjoy it . younger people might enjoy life a they are presently but this doe not mean older people have not done what the younger people have . moreover , the older people have done everything the younger people have . what this mean is , enjoying life and fun go hand in hand and also change a need of the people change when they grow older . it all depends upon what the individual plea himself with , to have fun at that particular age like in my grandfather 's case in wa the kind of food he liked to eat . in my cae it enjoying life sitting on my roof top with a guitar . hence , commenting on the statement i would like to assert that fun could mean different for different people . therefore , older people have a much fun a younger people do , the only difference is the mean of having fun or satisfying themselves .
