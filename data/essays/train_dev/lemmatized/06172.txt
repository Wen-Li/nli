the widely spread belief that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is for me not only totally wrong , but in complete opposition with what the concept `` to travel '' is intended to be . first of all , the transportation mean - a bus - is simply not adequate for the activity . i would assume that if a person travel , this person would like to smell and taste to country to be discovered , would aspire to new connection and interaction . how can you ever be able to accomplish those aim through the window of a big tourist bus ? the best way to discover a new city is to walk down it road , to loose yourself in it . secondly , traveling in a group mean that while you visit new place , while you cross unkown environment , mom and dad and maybe your best friend is comfortably seated on your right side . you feel at home , you engage conversation with the people you live with every other day . akward position when the true beauty of traveling around is to meet new people , to ask about their way of seeing thing or how they manage their rut . being surrounded by a well organised group doe not facilitate the aperture towards the other traveling should be all about . in third position come the tour guide issue . those guide are often paid by their government to bring the tourist to specific site , monument or landscape where the infrastructure have been built to receive them . economical benefit are therefore in the air , many tourist guide will not hesitate to equivocate supposedly rich people to fill their pocket . finally , the overbooked agenda the touring agency plan for you often end up being more exhausting than the actual work tourist are running away from on vacation . to travel should mean to live without a watch , to follow the wave , to let the unexpected surprise you . i would rather avoid any time planing , thus leaving space to improvisation and first impulse . two precious element that will never cross the path of a touring group . .. traveling in a group led by a tour guide completly disconnect you from reality . one should know the difference between being a tourist and being a traveller . i believe the second to be so much worth than the first . if only people could think that way , they would find a little treasure .
