it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . because if have knowledge in all the subject we have lot of sope in the future . we can go for any job . if we are good in only one subject we can not do thing in our life . it is better for the future to have the knoeledge in all the subject . for example if we have bussiness management we cant do chemistry . so it better for u to have knowlege in all the subject . if u go for the job also we have to be good in all the subject . only one specific subject can not help u in the future because in certain area we should have to think what is good and what is bad . one subject give lot of confusion in certain area . but if you have broad knowledge you can do better in your life . kowledge is like a god . because how much you study it will benifit you . so it is better for u to have knowledge in all the subject rather in one . so in my opion it better to have broad knoeledge in comparitively to one subject . if we want to do something in our life so we have to learn every subject . without doing it we are the falilures . so we have to give the importance to all the subject . without dont knowing the subject we can not do any thing . we cant progreess in any field . so it better u to study all the subject so it may help u in the future . therefore in all i have to say that it better to have knowledge of all the subject than to specialize in one specific subject . one knowlede cant do any thing . but broad knowledge of many subject may help you doning thing in your life . most of the richest man on the earth are educated in all the subject . so it better to eduacte in all the subject .
