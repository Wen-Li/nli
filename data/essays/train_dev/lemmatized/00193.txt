as people who lived long time ago said the best way to travel is hanging alone even though it is risky . i am really disagree about traveling in a group led by a guide for several reason that are getting a book that is about where you are traveling instead of tour guide and being so relax during the trip insted of depending on someone . in my opinion , is it really hard to get a book that explains everything what you need ? i dont think so it is really hard cause you can get a guidebook from aven simple gas station . for example , there is a movie that is named euro trip is really funny but also it is really educated cause in the movie there wa a guy whose name is alex who got all knowledge about historical place in italy . anyway they went to alot of diffrent place in italy and they were themself ovar there because of alex . the important thing is one of the guy who ha been working a a guide boy for 10 year wa so suprised cause alex knew averything even though he had not been there before . so people can get all knowledge from the book instead of the tour guide . the other important idea acoording to my side is traveling comfortable cause if there are are many people with you , they bother you all time , and also time is not going to be enough cause traveling with everbody is really slow . for example , when i wa in istanbul that ha alot of historical place , i wanted to visit place that is named topkapi . moreover , i wa so angry during the visiting cause everybody wa asking a lot of unimportant question to the tour guide , so i couldnt see all those beautiful place . moreover , i had to change all my trip , retiming my plane , cause of the other people . finally , a my father said if there are many people in the same place , there are gonna be alot of problem in that place . so even though there is no body with me during the trip i am sure i will be so happy alone cause i will do what i want .
