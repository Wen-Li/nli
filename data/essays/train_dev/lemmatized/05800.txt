some people think student should learn the result of fact . even though that is importnat for stdents , i myself believe comprehension of idea and concept are more neccessary for mordern life . people enable to manage their skill to their life easily . for example , when a person know how to figure math concept , the person can use the math idea to develop in the computer programing field . if the person want to be computer creater , the concept of math skill always help the person to improve the business . learning fact is risky to interfer student ' motivation . it is always fun to think and create the answer even though the answer is wrong . students always think about their problem so that they can discover theirselves to solve the problmes . for example , in math class student always spend much time to consider to figure out the answer . people can cooperate with their friend to overcome and find solusion . this process help sutdents to make motivation of study . finally , learning only result is not always true . again , math class could be good example . many people notice text book often have some mistake . when a student only learns the fact , a studnet might misunderstand everything . therefore , there are three reason that i do not agree to learn only fact . understanding idea and concept help people to use their paticular subject to their life easily . also , this ha posibily to improve student ' motivation fo study . finally , the fact sometimes mistake from the text .
