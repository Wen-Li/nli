i agree with it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learm fact . bucause today at every school , every student only learn fact . even they do not understand what teacher talking about . i think it is not good for young student . if teacher read and teach what is on the book , they would think about same thing . in addition , it would make child 's free imagination down . getting down student high score is one of the big problem in the world . especially in japan , i heard on the television that there is no student who read a book often , do not like learn new thing and they do not know why is so imprtant to do study . i think all teacher must teach childrens to get interested in to know new idea , not only the fact . child should think about their own idea . it will make them more intelligent and interested person . other big problem is most of japanese can not speak english . and i saw the graph on the news , they said japan wa worst . in the high school , student will learn english form teacher who is not native speaker . they study such a grammer and how to talk . i think it is not very useful for student . they have to learn listening , writing and need chance to talk to people who speak english . it will also make student to intersted and easy to undersatnd in class . i do not think only learn fact is bad but i guess if student learn that , they would lose their indivisual idea and sense of imagination . that 's why i think , to understand idea and concept is more important to learn real fact .
