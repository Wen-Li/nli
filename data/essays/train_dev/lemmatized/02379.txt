i totally agree with the opinion , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are several reason , they spend too much time on their job , they are not familiar with the people in their community and unwilling to try to know them , and they prefer to use their own time for other pleasure . in the technology generation , people spend more time on their job because they arecompetitive . they have to work very hard to keep their job . they have to spend a lot of time to make the achievement . they have to work a long a possible to show their loyalty to their bos . that cause the average time in office increased and no time is left for the community . besides , the modern society becomes more conservative than before because of the increasing crime . people do n't say hello to the stranger . they treat the stranger with a suspicious manner . that make people unwilling to get involved in the community service . i ever heard that someone had tried to raise a fund for the community service but the door wa shut heavily because he wa thought to be a cheater . also , in the city , there are many attractive pleasure , such karo-oki , pub , dancing club .. , people prefer to use their leisure time to go to those place in stead of helping their community . they think helping the community is government 's job and they ha paid the tax , someone else should do this job , but not themselves . eventhough there are still someone willing to spend their time to helping their community , from these point of view above , i think that is only of small percentage . most people are still selfish , they would rather to spend time on their own job , pleasure , and keep themselves from the community service .
