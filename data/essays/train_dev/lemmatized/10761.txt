i think older people can also enjoy like young people enjoy . so i am totally disagree with that young people enjoy their life more then that older people . it not mandatory for old people to live their life a young people do . they can live their life in their own way to make it beautiful . it totally depend on people to people . firstally i want to say that older people can do any thing like young people like if they want to go for a party they can go . if they want to do dance in party they can do . i had seen one old person in someone party . these old age person dance like young one . he wa so active . secondly , if young people thought that they are active than old person . so they are wrong . old person can do anything like marathon etc. it show that they can work like young people they can do anything which young people cant thirdly it impoosible to say that young people are more enjoy because young people always take decision instantly which will be not beneficial to them because by doing that can put themslves in danger but for the case of old people they take their their decision after thinking very deeply . take the example of our poltician they are totally old and take decision very politely which make them happy . so i believe that old peolpe can also enjoy like young people not in the same manner just like young one do but in different manner so it ridiculos to say that young can enjoy the life more than that old people .
