i agree with the statement that there might be le number of car in the future than they are in the present . firstly , i think global warming will play a major role in revising the transport modality of the people . climate change being reported by various environmental authority are forcing people to think about the future . already lot of fuel effiecient car are coming into the market and also car which are using alternative fuel other than petrol which have le harmful emission . if research go on in the same direction car may be replaced with some other alternative . secondly , growing population in the urban and rural area and the number of people driving vehicle ha become unregulated in many country like india . narrow road , traffic block especially during the rush hour is forcing people to use mass transport . people are looking for alternative mean of transport a they can not afford to be late to work . in twenty year time thing might become worse and car might not have anymore place on road . thirdly , the growing cost of fuel day by day is making people think each time they drive a car . in the future resouses might not be sufficient enough to meet the demand of growing vehicle . in the past , people used bicycle , horse , etc a mean of transport . now science and technology have led to the invention of car , bus , aeroplane etc according to the need and supply of the present generation . where there is a need or demand for a particular commodity in the market , there will always be a supply . as the demand come down , manufacture might stop supplying car but may shift to newer invention . people in the present are definitely relying more on car and newer model and also the number of car are increasing day by day . fuel efficient and environment friendly vehicle like hybrid car might still have a place on the road . but in the future thing might change . attitudes of people might change according to circumstance and changing time . growing stress level , unsafety , accident etc might be factor which might force car out of road . mass transport might play a pivotal role in the coming generation .
