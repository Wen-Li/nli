i must say i agree with the statement . there are some advantage i could point out for trying new thing and taking risk , which are : - people who try new thing differentiate themselves from the rest and get recognition for that from their peer and eventually from opinion leader or other people that might help them with their purpose . - taking risk is the same than doing thing not on the easy way . because of that , it should become both a rewarding and educational experience . it may help overcome fear , it can help to learn more about ourselves and our limit and it should leave the door open for not being afraid of trying new thing in the future . - it make you discover your strenghts and weakness and how far you can push yourself into different situation , a opposed to keep doing the activity that you know you perform well which will not let you discover hidden talent that you may have . everytime i watch the news or read the newspaper and see a business success story , i tend to think that that 's something i could have done . then i realize that it all ha to do with the gut people have to start doing something before the rest . taking risk is a key to success . altough i have summarized some possitive appreciation of taking risk there are consideration that should be taken into account before trying new thing : doing something new or different may cause a negative effect or even rejection from the rest of the people . therefore , if you are thinking of doing something nobody else ha ever done before , you need to think first of how society will react to that new thing and if it can affect or hurt anybody in anyway . taking risk may drive someone into frustration if what he/she had in mind wa not successful . not all your goal will be achieved by taking risk , there need to be more than goodwill put into a project such a study , research , commitment and effort . i think the combination of hard work , commitment and taking risk lead to succesfull people . knowing yourself , your strenghts and what you already know you can do well help , but you need to give a step further to succeed .
