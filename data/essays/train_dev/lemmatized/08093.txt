i agree this statement . although i admit it is important that product ha real quality , there are several reason that i think advertisement make product more valuable and it is quite important . first of all advertisement give people to know about the product easily and convienetly . everyday we can meet lot of product ad by newspaper , and tv even internet . that give people more belive it is good product . for example , one of american wine ad give people belive that wine made from amercia is very good compared with made in france or chile . they ad by producing process and taste with some celebrity and change the common belief that american wine is low quality second , the advertisement represent the product 's image . so sometimes people buy the product because of their image . for my personal experience , i like basketball so much in junior high school . i always play with my classmate but i am not tall it 's very hard to jump up to catch the balll . i am very deprssed . however i watch the ad unexpectdly and it change my life . it 's air jordan shoe produced by nike . he jump up so highly just like frog . after watch the ad i buy the jirdan shoe and i am very confident at jumping and i can play well and i represent my junior school basketball team . of course jordan shoe is just one of the shoe but ad give consumer it is more better than what it ha and believe it is best shoe , in conclusion i firmly belive that ad make product seem much better because it 's purpose is to sell the product . and nowadays people is very busy all day they are mostly dependant on ad to buy the product .
