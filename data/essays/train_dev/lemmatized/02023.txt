an advertisement is something that present people new product . these product can be car , lipstick , food and many other thing . they can be seen in newspaper , magazine or on television . people , who prepare them , give a certain shape to these new product so that they can be seen more attractive to people . actually , the problem begin here because this may lead to the fact that advertisement may make product seem much better than they really are . in order to testify the validity of this argument , it is better to analyze it with an example . a famous car producer designed a new car for people who are married and have child . in order to attract their target market , the car producer make a deal with an advertising agent . the agent prepares an advertisement that will be shown on tv . in this advertisement , the most beautiful and thin housewife who gave birth just two month ago and his very handsome husband go into their new car with their very cute child . the car , although it is designed for middle-class family look like a bmw in order to emphasize it excellence . at the end , this wonderful middle-class family who owns this car , which look like a bmw , life happily ever after . this example may sound a bit exaggerated but this is the case that is created by advertisement . in advertisement usually everything seems in their best shape . the woman , men , baby look always perfect , which can not be realistic . i am wondering how many woman , who gave birth just two month ago can be so thin a the woman in the advertisement appears . also , the product seem much more better than their real shape . most of the people who are attracted by this car advertisement go to the shop and think that they will have a car that is more luxurious than it seems . however , this is not the case because when they see the car by themselves , they are disappointed because the car is in reality much more modest . all in all , these do not mean that advertisement are not necessary . on the contrary , they are very useful for people to know new product but this should not be in the form of convincing them . advertisements should reflect the truth about the product so that people are not disappointed .
