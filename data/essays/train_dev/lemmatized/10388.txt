many people believe that old people enjoy their life more than young people ; however , i believe that young people also enjoy thier life more than old people becuase young people have a lot of curious of life , besids they are more energetic than old people . it is true that old people enjoy thier life more than young people becuase they already reitre from thier work ; in other world , they already support their childrean : a a result , they troubleing all the time with their money that they save when they were young . however , young people also enjoy themselves . young people do not know much about the reall life ; in other world , they have a lot of curious that make them happy . for example , when i wa teenager , i had alot of curious of love . i wanted know what love is . one day i met a one man whose named jack . jack also had a lot of curious of love . we did not know about the love ; therefore , we learnd together . we cried and laght together . we learend how love make people to live in this socities . we had a fun and enjoy . not only that we also learn how to get a baby . finally we married and having a three babied . which mean my curious made me my real life . having fun and enjoy is very difficult . in other world , if person who do not have a powere of enjoy their life , it would be very un happy to live . for example , once upon a time , i had a lot of friend . we always hit the pot . we had a lot fun at the moment . however if person who is not strong , it would be hard to enjoy that time . for example , my grand mother and grand father had a lot of beautifull life when they were young becuase they never retired from the party becuase of stranth ; however , they could not go to the party today becuase they are too old to dance . both are true that young people and old people can enjoy themselve ; however , it is easyto enjoy their life when they are young becuase they are strong than old people and everthing is interesting to them .
