i do not agree with the statement . i do n't think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i 'm not saying that it 's not important to have a rich knowledge about different subject , but to be succesfull in today 's world , is essential to be extremely prepared about a specific subject . an example can be a company that produce veichles . today in the market there are a lot of company that make veichles , so someone who studied how to produce veichles is not so different from many others . so that ' s why is very important for this person to came out with a new veichle that can make a difference . and to do so he need to focus on a specific subject . he need to study more about a particolar caratheristcs that other veicle do n't have to became more succesfull then the others on the market . for example it would be a good idea for this person to focus and specialize in only one kind of veichle , maybe he can focus only in suvs . he can probably dedicates his study in how to have a better gas/milage with these type of veichles . i drive an suv and i 'm sure that if he can do that he will be considered a god and the market of suv will increase drastically ! anyone who studied about making veichles can find a job in the veichle production , but only who dedicate in a specific subject can be more succesfull than the rest and be on the top of the market . this is only one on an infinity of example to explain why i think that it ' s better to be specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject .
