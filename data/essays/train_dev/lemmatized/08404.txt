according to what all government say , that all car must only be transported from an country to another with in a five year of date of due from the company . every country must make a roule about controlling the number of car that is coming year after year . every new car that is made , it brings with it more pollution and more traffic to the world . the government must have a limit or a regulation to prevent the addition of car year after a year . i think that in five or ten year they will be more fewer car then there is now , but i do n't think that after twenty year they will be more . because technology will prevent it and they will stop using car . they will use new technolgy rather then car that bring u problem like pollution , car accident , more traffic , death penalty etc . .. in the newer world they will find a solution for it , because if not it will be a catastrophe and a disaster . because logically world is not gonna get bigger in twenty year but car are gonna get much and much more fewer then it can contain . i think technology will take place in twenty year from now , it might use plane besides car or huge escalator through building , maybe even escalator underground . no one know what is in the future or what is waiting for u then . life is much harder then we think we ca n't just imagine it with in a few word it much more complicated . i hope for the best in our future life for all whom gonna participate in it. , and i hope that tecnology will prevent the catastrophy probelm of car and stop it from growing into the world and multiplying by billion . of countity . everyone look for his best and good . life is life .
