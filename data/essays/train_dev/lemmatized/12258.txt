i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people . when people are young they always want to challenge thing , and are very energetic . however older people have to work , to maintain their lifestyle and ha already become calm . therefore i believe young enjoy life more than older people . i will explain my reason in the following essay . young people are always trying to do new thing so they are very active which make them enjoy their life . generally young people dont have to think about others and just think about their own life . therefore they can do whatever they want to do . for instance , if they want to go on a trip just to disocover something , they can do it easily . however if they get older and have a family to support , it will become difficult for them to do so . when people are young they have many chance and opportunity to change their future life . thus they can just do what they want to do . and when people do what they want to do , they enjoy their life to the fullest . older people generally already have a job and some have family . therefore it make them hard for them to have the time to do their hobby , or to travel . and to support their family , they have to make a lot of money so it is not easy to quit their job just to challenge their dream . older people can not just do what they want to do because it would affect many other thing . as they in a stricted situation , it is difficult for them to enjoy their life . in my opinion , young people enjoy life more than older people do . it is very difficult for older people to do what they want to do because it effect other thing such a their family . however young people dont have to think about those thing and can challenge whatever they want to do . therefore i believe young people enjoy life more than older people .
