i neither agree or disagree with the previous statement ( or better i recognize it unavoidable reality ) , i will provide below my reason ; i do n't appreciate this practice , even if i understand the reason which lead the advertiser to adopt this technique to promote product . the first reason is simply practical , many product do not look a nice in reality a they appear in advertisement , for example a regard pasta , usually expert use plastic copy of pasta in the making of their video advertisement , because pasta is difficult to be managed and to look in an acceptable way for the long time needed to record the video . the second and main reason is cause of marketing , people working in this field believe and know that people do not use a product because they need it , but because it represents a dream , an illusion , under which something else is hidden : the individual need to be socially recognized , the need to look in a better way , the need to look someone else , etc . so usually advertisement depict an illusory image of product , full of colour and brightness , with dreamy contour , in a rich and pleasant environment , etc . for example if we consider a car 's advertisement , we could notice that we do not see only the car , perhaps moving on a street , usually we would hear a very rithmic music , after we would see the car , perhaps in front of a luxury restaurant , a man in an elegant suit would come down and open the other car door to allow a beautiful , sexy , girl to join him entering the restaurant , perhaps at the end we would see the couple , inside a villa , on the border of a pool , drinking two glass of , seemingly , champagne , naturally the car is always in front of the view . does this all reflect the real life of most of u ? i would say no , but it reflects our dream , our hidden desire of social power and recognition . they do n't sell a product , they sell a dream . concluding my discussion , i think that the topic the question is about , better looking of product in advertisement than reality , depends on the way our society is structured , a way in which appearences predominate on essence ; so i think it 's just inevitable , it is not a matter of agreement or disagreement .
