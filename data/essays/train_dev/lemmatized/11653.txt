we all have been in traffic jam and mostly it is due to the fact that the number of car increased a lot recently , rather than that it is because of road . due to the imporevements in manufacturing technology , it ha become possible to produce cheap car in shorter time . in return , the number of car increased . toyota now can produce a car in 2 minute with a cost of 2000 dollar , le or more , of course depending on the type of the car . this indicates that a technology developes more and more , people will buy more and more car . so in the following 20 year , in my opinion , there will be more car instead of the possibility that there will be fewer car been driven than we drive today . one reason for the possible increase in number of car within close future is , a aforementioned , the technological improvement enable manufacturer to produce cheaper car in shorter time . cheaper car mean that almost everybody can have it . attracted by extra promotion and suitable purchasing conditionos , even a family can have more than one car . and this attraction that the manufacturer present for their customer will be even more attractive a technology contunies to improve , a a result ; more automobile will be on the road . other than that car are getting cheaper , the people are getting richer a well . the economy of country grow with the impact of globalization , especially in develop and developing country , which in turn brings money to people , and i can say that the globalization is just starting . so what can be done with the money ? of course if you have a house , you will buy a car ; if you have a car why should not your wife or son have a car next . it can be seen that having automobile is not accepted a luxury property in some country , especially in develloped one . and considering the population of develoding country and they are going to be developed , there will be a significant incline in the number of car . also there can be disadvantage of driving a car in the next coming 20 year . the time consumed in traffic jam , and environmental problem related to pollution can disatract people , or even law can be decided by goverments that are limitating automobile usage or number of car in a family . but all these will not stop the increase in the number of car , at least 20 year . to conclude , it can be said that car are getting cheaper and people are gettin richer in the follawing 20 year due to technologicalso the world is going to be wealthier and car , of course , are the best canditates to show the wealth a person have . therefore , i believe that number of car will increase .
