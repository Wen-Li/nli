some people prefer to learn knowledge of one specific subject a they think to study lot of subject is time consuming . however , i think to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is more beneficial for the people . as the subject are little bit connected one another , it will be helpful to learn other subject . also , the more subject someone have , the more choice can get in choosing major . firstly , subject are conntected one another . it can make people to learn lot of subject . for example , if i have to solve math problem , i have to learn both english and mathematics . that is because i have to understand what the problem requires and to learn how to solve it . it mean that even if i have little knowledge of many subject , if i have chance to learn one specific subject , i can learn more effectively because i have basic of the subject . however , in case of studying one subject , one have to learn only the subject he/she choose and if one want to learn other subject , he/she have to learn it from the basic . secondly , people can get broad choice in majoring . as one have lot of knowledge , he/she ha to choose what subject specially interested in . for example , in case of studying one specific subject such a music , person only have choice to choose music major . however , in case of learn lot of subject , i can have many choice in major . also , if someone ha problem of majoring specific subject , he/she can transfer to the subject that he/she learned . in case of studying specific subject , it can not . for the reason i mentioned , i want to suggest people to have broad knowledge of academic subject . because it can give people to learn lot of subject and people can get lot of choice in choosing major .
