in my opinion there will be fewer car than today within twenty year of time . the reason for this shall either be with restriction of government or with people own choice . first of all the earth , which is the only proofed place that we can provide our living , have been and continuing to be polluted a lot starting from the industrial development day . cars , which look like a must for most people , are result of those developmets . increase of car usage shall increase pollution of gas and sound which i believe human being shall not stand any more . to solve that there shall be some restriction on usage of car , on kind of the gas they will use or sound remover etc . secondly the nature source of the earth are decreasing with the effect of population increse . which mean that more people shall need more natural resource to cook their food or to be heated instead of going to their work by their own car . i do n't think that there will be direct limitation depending on this topic but the gas price shall increase day by day on such level that people shall be forced to make such a decision . additionally again with some dependency to the above mentioned population increase reason space on earth for each people is also getting decreased day by day . people need home to leave and people need office to work . as long a they use their own car they will also need place to park their car . increase of all need with same degree shall again force people to make a decision which shall support my opinion . finally and most imporantly , i believe that people shall prefer not to have their own car for their mental health . spending most of their time sitting in a car and going no where in the traffic jam or again spending lot of time for trying to find a place for parking , are already making them unhappy and aggressive in today world i believe increase of these spended time in each day shall make them worser and force them to decide not to have their own car or even sell the one they have .
