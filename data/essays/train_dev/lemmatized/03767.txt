in today 's world , a successful individual is someone that ha achieved a goal in his life , who 's happy with what he ha accomplished , with what he owns and ha reached a high level of well-being . everything seam perfect , but this also raise a question : can a successful person desire more to what he already ha ? will he try to have new experience and take risk ? i believe there can be two answer to this question . first of all i must agree with the statement that a successful man is going to search for new accomplishment and experience because otherwise his existence becomes meaningless , and his journey through life would become repetitive and boring . a person eventually adapts to what he owns and to the situation that he life in and is suddenly going to expect new thing to occur , and wish for new event . i believe it 's in the nature of man to desire new thing , a man is always trying to satisfy his desire and when they are indeed satisfied , he 'll have new desire . it 's a cycle . however i can also disagree with the previous statement because trying new thing and taking risk depends also a lot on the individual 's character . i believe a man ha to be confident with himself and his ability if he want to try new adventure . he ha to be courageous and responsible to take risk . in conclusion i both agree and disagree with the idea that successful people try new thing and take risk .
