some people considered that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i disagree with the sataements . although it seems to be a sound satement , but i think it is a sweeping generalization by the following reason . first of all , we should focus the problem only on young people . by the accelerating of the modern city life , speed make u hard to know about people living in the samecommunity with u . young people may have responsibility to help their community , but we should not only asked them to do it . all the people in the same community should try to help it . secondly , how many time should we ask them to pay for these community ? more time spending mean more improvment of thse community ? today we can do some contribution to our communites service though internet . maybe we should try to set a system that can work on the area of community service in tweenty four hour . finally , the difinition of commmunities are much unclear . there are a lot of virtual community in the world of internet . do they help people ? yes , they did held peolple . we should not ristrict the range of helping the scieoty . may be it is better to let different group help each other . in conclution , i fully disagree the satement that young people nowaday do not give enough time to help their community , and th are the reason why .
