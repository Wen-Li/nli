i 'm disagree with the statement because all of people can enjoy their life , young people and old people . often young people are not near old people because they have a different outlook of life . young and old people can enjoy themselves but in a different way . if i can do an example , i want to mention a different kind of thing that can enjoy old people and young people . young people are actracted often by sport , cinema , crowd , noise think , they want always smile . young people looking for a new hard experience , they are dinamics and they want to do always something new . old people in the past like the same thing , but now after twenty year they are tired and now they like the relax thing , like fishing , sleeping , reading , playing card and they enjoy themselves also more than younger people . this can be an idea of the difference between the two different kind of people . in a particular case the rule of the people can be the opposite . some young people can have the same bahaviour a old people and old people can have the same behaviour of young people . if you are seventy year old end you are not unfit , you can do the samethings of a teenager , are n't you ? i saw an old person playing football very well for two hour and after going to swim . it is possible , in a few case but it is possible . instead recently i met a young person that prefers a sedentary life , i do n't know why but he stand for a lot of hour sitting on his harchair and he read two book or more in one day . it is possible ? this are a particular situation in wich people have a strange behaviour but normally if you are a young boy you must do the young boy and if you are an old `` boy '' you must do the hold boy .
