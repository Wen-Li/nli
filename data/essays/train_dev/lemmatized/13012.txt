in order to answer this question thouroughly , we first need to define what we mean under the word `` understanding '' and `` learning '' . a student ha understood an idea once he is able to explain it with his or her own word , to provide example and to link the idea to other idea . he should also be able to compare it or to constrast it with other idea . learning , on the other hand , refers to factual knowledge that can be acquired by mean of memory . given the definition above , one can easily imagine that understanding concept requires more skill than just knwing fact by heart . sutdents will need to think further , to analyze and to link oncepts together when they understand them . for example , in order to understand the literary movemement called `` naturalism '' , student will need to distinguish it from realism and to have an idea of what is determinism . learing fact about naturalism would not allow student to really grasp the main point about it . they would be able to name naturalist writer such a stephen crane or jack london , eventually to provide a definition learnt by heart , but not to place the movement in it literary context . another important advantage of understanding is that it creates a structure in the mind that can be reapplied in many different domain . once a student understands how a mechanical feature of the car , he will be able to understand the mechanical feature of many other car , even if they differ . it is basically the same principle . learning , on the other hand , always need to be done again and again because it is specific to one thing . i agree that it is more important to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . however , a good student who doe not have any factual knowledge is not a student . a student of swiss history ha to know that switzerland wa founded in 1291 . usually , a thourough , complete understanding can not be separated from learning .
