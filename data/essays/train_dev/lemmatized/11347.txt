although a good argument can be made that old people enjoy life more than young people do , i think that the contrary is true . there are two reason why i have this opinion . first , when you are young , you tend to have more money to spend than when you are older or even retired . with the age come the duty and the sorrow . when building a family , there are a lot of thing such a a house and the education for the child that cost a lot . altough it may be true that young people may dispose of relatively le money , they have more to spend . so they give it out for vacation , car , party and other thing that are fun . they sometimes even buy thing that they can not really afford . without saying this is better , young people think short-term and therefore enjoy every single day . when i used to work a a trainee when i wa 21 year old , i had money but no duty . so i just enjoyed going out with friend every night and spend the whole money . i do not think that i will show the same behavior by the time i get 30 . i will hopefully have saved some money to be able to plan a family . in addition to that , young people want to enjoy now and today . from my point of view , i think it is better to enjoy your life a long a you can . knowbody know what tomorrow will be . i heard about a lot of people who were postponing their trip they wanted to take or their car they wanted to buy , but due to several factor , suddenly it wa not possible anymore . not only is it more fun to do a trip with your friend when you are young , but it is something you have done and will always think back and smile . therefore , young people travel around more when they are young just because it ha more advantage than if you travel when you get older . in conclusion , despite the fact that older people have fun a well , i think that young people enjoy their life more because they do it with le reasoning and more joy .
