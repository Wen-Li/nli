in my opinion success in itself carry the element of `` desire , sacrifise and a strong will '' to drive one to the destination of choice . sum of such characteristic distinguishes how sucessful we will be . as a human being every individual try to be better than what he wa and for this he improvises in the skill which he ha and after a particular stage when he ha internalised that , the person may become saturated in his desire and be satisfied by what he ha achieved or he ha the choice of expansion , which for a buissnesman will mean buisness expansion but for a research student will mean to know other area to research upon and try to apply the acquired skill of one area to get fruitful result in the other . there is always a satisfaction coming from one achievments but to stop with a handful of achievments is not what people who succede and are respected do . take the example of einstein , he wa one of the most popular and successful theoretical physicscist , got a nobel prize in 1923 for photoelectric effect , after which he could have retired and spent rest of his life in comfort , but he chose to `` sacrifise '' it and worked to make a unified theory till he died . such characteristic make succes in true sense . people who stop after a milestone are one of those who have doubt on their ability and fear of faliure , which is counter quality of a motivated person . so given certain parameter which we can call element of success in a person ; their evolution with passage of life will lead u to the conclusion of sucessful people taking risk . but those are calculated risk and not random crazy thought which distinguishes them from an egomanic !!
