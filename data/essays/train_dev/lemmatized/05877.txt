i do n't think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a guide because : first , the route of the guided trip are general standarized . the visit and intineraries are already studied and planned by the tour guide so there is a chance you can miss an important site or place . i think the best way to make a trip is by buying guide published by a well know brand like lonely planet . this guide are full with tip , fact , history , hotel recommendation , restaurant , bar , etc . second , in most of the guided tour you will have limited free time since you need to follow a schedule . for example , after visiting a church or temple , a museum . .. you will only have 2 hour of free time . i believe that with this much of free time you can slightly see the city . in general , all the hotel that tour trip reserve includes breakfast and generally you will have to wake up early . what if i want to wake up late and have breakfast in a typical restaurant recommended by the local ? by travelling in a group you relly on other people taste . maybe one member asks the guide to visit a toy factory . what if i do n't want to go there ? other reason is that not all of the tour guide are well prepared . in my experienice with tour guide i had some good and some bad . ocassionally some tour guide even lie or just make up fact to make the tour more appealling . and finally , what if i do n't get along with somebody in the group ? or maybe he asks too many irrelevant question that may delay the an activity i had travelled in both way , in a tour group with a guide and with just my friend and a book a a guide . i find the second more enjoyable since you mark your own pace , intinerary , and the best of all , you choose the people to go with .
