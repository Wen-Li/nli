i agree with the statement , mainly because i think that it is imperative for student to understand idea and concept and knowing how to act upon them is more important than just knowing fact . from my experience in highschool , i think student in general find it much easier to just learn fact rather than understanding concept and idea . one simple example is when i used to love `` labelling the heart diagram '' in biology class but just despise explaning newton 's first principle law of motion in physic class . on the contrary when there is a written response question on a test it would be much easier for student to respond when they actually understand what they are talking about rather than just knowing the fact . another broader example is when we had to make a student commitee with the job of spreding out the word in school of aiding with recycling and cleaning up . many of u did it but i highly doubt that everyone understood why they where doing . so in the end i believe for a student to get through his life experience a being a student with a degree of some sort , he ha to understand idaes and concept and act upon them .
