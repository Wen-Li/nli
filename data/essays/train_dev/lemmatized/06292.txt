i do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . the term `` enjoying life '' can be viewed at from many different angle and each individual will have an own way to explain this phrase . but taking into account all possible aspect i can think of right now , the above mentioned statement seems agreeable to me . compared to the past , the youth in our society today ha the freedom to achieve almost everything - from enjoying a financially secured family background and a prestigious education in school to all personal favourite , such a sport , socializing with others , and the art . young people are energetic and can do whatever physical challenge there is to meet . they can travel the world during their study , they can choose from a variety of plan for their career , and are most of the time preferably hired by employee compared to the elderly . but most of all , they enjoy a wide-spread portfolio pf personal enjoyment . in a society focused mainly on the younger citizen , the way to enjoy yourself seem unlimited : dance club , bar , sport club , travel agency , internet chat room and platform all offer their service to their young customer . if you are young , you are in ! all door seem opened . older people often feel excluded from such activity due to bad health , lack of energy or acceptance by the young . they often fail to catch up with the fast and immensly important development in the telecommunication sector and do not find many possibility to share time with others . an example for this striking difference between the desired young people and the rejected older one can be found at any time of the day in an ordinary chat room . the chat user tend to ask for the age and the sex of the one they are corresponding with . not seldomly they close the chat window when the answer is `` 28 '' ! of course , there are quite a few offer for older people , too . but i witness a development in our society that mainly the young people are enjoying themselves . maybe the older should get more motivation to learn new skill in order to enjoy their life . but maybe the young should accept and respect the fact that one day they too will be old . if our society achieves that , then all will enjoy their life more .
