we are living where ha the plenty of advertisement . we see any kind of ad everyday , even if we would n't want to . and most of them make themselves look better . it heppens all the time . i sometimes believed the advertisement and i bought several items . whenever i trusted them , they brought me down . i saw advertising heater which wa advertising on tv . i thought that looked so good . and i bought it . but that wa not my expection . that wa not smae color . turely , the shape wa not same at all . the advertisement told me that wa not breaking at all but i used third time it wa borken . i wa really angry at that time . other product wre mostly alike . after that i saw an ad of hair dryer . the ad , it made my hair be like to silk and wa not hurt my hair at all . but that did n't make a sence . how did the hair dryer make your hair be silk ? i could n't believe the ad at all . i thought that people who made the ad did n't have any conscious . when i went shopping , i showed a sign on the window . it said the sale ` buy one get one free for all item . ' and i chosed two of hand rotions . when i tried to check out , the saler said . the product i chosed did n't include the slaes product . i wa bunch of advertisement attract people to buy them . but most of them that is not a true . so , people should check between ad and real product and make sure it is ok . and we must not buy a product which ha a difference between ad and product .
