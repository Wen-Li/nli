i disagree with the idea that understandig idea and concept is more important than learing fact . it is more important to learn , even if you do n't know exactly what something mean , because if you can learn how to apply what you 've learned in real life , then you wo n't forget about it . one of the main objective of a student is to learn , or at least it should . there are several factor that could change the goal of a student , or even the result of what they 've learned . in order to learn , you can use real-life example to understand a concept in a better way , and that 's an easy way to learn . when your teacher us easy example in the class , sometimes you do n't even realize thay you 're learning until you remember that particular example in the real world . and i think that 's the best way to learn , because you might not even try to learn and you do it anyway . in my personal experience , i love teacher who explain something to me in a simple way . one of them is by giving example you might know , or some experience you might had . and the best of all is that , one day without any effort , you remember what your teacher tought to you , and the example he/she gave you . it is very important that teacher try their best to make student consider that is more important to learn the fact instead of memorizing a concept . because if you do that , maybe you will know the definition during the class , during the week , or during the course . but if you never use that concept again , or if you do n't even care about knowing how to apply what you 're learning in your real life , then it would be like if you did n't learn a thing . it is really important to be aware of this important aspect in learning , and it 's a homework we all have to accomplish : - students in order to be better prepared , and - teachers in order to improve student ' learning .
