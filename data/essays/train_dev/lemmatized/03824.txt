the issue at hand is whether the young people enjoy life more than the older people . i think that young people can surely enjoy more than the older people do . this is mainly due to couple of reason . firstly , the age factor serf a a major consideration when it come to this topic . obviously , young people are far more energetic and healthier than the old people . this is purely due to the old age that the older people attain which in turn make their body and mind slower in all activity . this prof that the young people can enjoy more than the older people due to the high energy level and good health condition . secondly , young people have more interest in life to enjoy than the older people . young people tend to come up with new idea for enjoying life and like to have utmost fun . they are more open minded that the older people . for example , most young people would also like to adventure and involve them in lot of trecking activity . whereas the old people might not have the interest and energy to involve in adventure . thus , young people can enjoy more than the older people a they are open to new idea to discover life and have fun . finally , in most case , money play an important role for enjoyment , young people tend to enjoy the most with their money . moreover , these day even young people are paid high salary where they are able to lead a luxurious life at a very young age . eventhough , the older peope may have lot of money compared to the younger people , they might not be willing to spend a they already know the value of money . also , due to the reason that they know how hard it is to earn that money . on the otherhand , the younger people can spend more to enjoy a they might have just starting earning and have le responsibility . i ultimately feel that younger people enjoy life more than the older people . i believe this because young people have le responsibility , le hinderences , more energy and more interest to enjoy life .
