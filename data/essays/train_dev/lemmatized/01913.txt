though i think there are lot of successfull people who focus on their expertised area and are doing quite well , i agree that extremely successfull people try new thing and invent something new by taking risk rather than doing ordinary thing because completely new concept , business idea and theory are really rare and very admired through time and usually accompany economical reward if succeed , too . there are not so many scientist , including newton , darwin and einstein to name a few , who changed the way we see the world . the modern life are based on these fundamental new science and technology and they are remembered together with their accomplishment forever even by child who do n't know what exactly they accomplished . in business environment , the most potentially rewarding job role is entreprener who try to create a new entity which provides a new product or way of doing thing . the reason behind this is that it is very challenging to accomplish it but it could eventually change the life of the people around to a certain extent and be appreciated and remembered . by these reason , i think mot successfull poeple are the peson who try to do something new and succeeds in affecting the way people think and live in better way though it is quite difficult to succeed .
