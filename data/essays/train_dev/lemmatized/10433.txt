some people may think that people should specialize in one specific subject because they can write a good thesis . however , i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reason . first of all , having broad knowledge of many academic subject is useful for working . for example , in 2000 , when i wa a forth year student in university of tokyo , my major wa civil engineering . of course , i took the subject about the civil engineering , but i also tool the subject such a economics and politics . now , i work at japan central railway company a a engineer and my project is to plan to build the station building . i need to discus with many co-worker . i can solve the problem about this project effectively because i learn about wide knowledge about many subject . as a result , this project go on very well . this experience show that having wide knowledge of a lot of academic subject is very useful for working . in addition , people can communicate well by having wide knowledge about many academic subject . for instance , i join on the swimming club now . this team is consist of a lot of member such a professor in keio university , worker at bank and engineer at heavy industrial company . in this club , we often go to the bar after the practice of the swimming and exchange some information . i can communicate effectively with every member because i have wide knowledge of many academic subject and i can ask some question to them . as a result , i can make many friend . as the above example demonstrates , people can communicate well by having wide knowledge about a lot of academic subject . in conclusion , i strongly believe that it is better to have wide knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
