based on my experience , i do not agree with the statement , though i understand the importance of having broad knowledge of many academic subject for using academic skill properly . in particular , technology without ethic is dangerous such a genetic engineering and nuclear power without deep consideration of their effect on our society . once we specialize in one specific subject , we tend to be narrow minded and do not care about other thing happening in the world . in that sence , i agree with the idea that having broad academic knowledge is important . however , if academic skill are required for becoming professional in any area , to know deeply in one subject is much more important than to know broadly in many subject . if i make an advise for high school student who enter a university for academic skill , i would say `` it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject if you want to be a professional . '' to know something is totally different from to do with something , in general . for example , skill to do research a a professional in one specific subject is very much different the skill to know many subject a a hobby . when we are young , we tend to try to broaden our possibility and be interested in many area . based on my experience , however , our time is limited and too short to know many academic knowledge deeply . we have to choose either way of knowing deeply or knowing broadly . they are trade off . therefore , after getting enough knowledge of one specific subject a a professional , having a broad knowledge of other academic subject is the best way , i think . once we are used to one academic subject , it is much easier to know other academic subject , because the structure of academic subject are similar , in general . to summarize , if we would like to do with the academic skill a a professional , i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject for several year in a university .
