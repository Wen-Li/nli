i do agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . the reason i support my view are following . firstly , the successful people got success because they like to take challenge . to try new thing is a challenge to everybody , because people who did not know those thing before would not know how to do or what to do about it , but successful people can get pratice in the process of trying the new thing . they can pratice there ability from geting the new thing . secondly , successful people will never stop their step , they are always going forward , that mean they will not just do what they already know how to do well . to try new thing is the step that going forward . they can beyond their self by this way , they can improve theie sevles to solve the problem following in the future . a successful people shall have this quality , or he can not be a successful people . thirdly , the generation is changing always , new thing are occuring always , someone must go to try and get the new thing , or the generation can not change , human can not improve ourslves . why we call those people successful people ? because they do something common people can not do and contribute to human society . so these people are always walking in the front of the generation , they start the new generation . in conclusion , i do think successful people try new thing and take risk risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because this , our world is becoming better and better , .
