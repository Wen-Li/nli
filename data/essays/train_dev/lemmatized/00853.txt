nowadays the burden placed on the youth is indeed much heavier than that on the previous generation . however , i disagree with the statement . in my opinion , the young people , at least in singapore where i am currently studying , do contribute to their community with great passion and enthusiasm . first of all , the youth 's passion to serve the community can be evident in the large number of voluntary activity they are involved in . almost every secondary or high school student participates in community service on a regular basis . they either go to the community library to do clean-ups and shelving , or they go to the `` old folks home '' to interact with the old people there and ensure these people have fun and joy . the musical group in some school may also organise concert for the public , and donate the profit made to charity organisation . the regular involvement of the youth in voluntary community service undoubtedly demonstates their enthusiasm and effort in helping their coummunity . more importantly , the government also place a great emphasise in ensuring the young people to give sufficient time to helping their community . the ministry of education introduces the `` community involvement programme '' ( short-termed cip ) , where student must contribute to their community in some form , and the time of their contribution is reported by the related organisation . this time , known a `` cip hour '' , is an important element in the assessment of a student . if one doe not fulfill the minimun requirement of cip hour , he may not be admitted by a good high school or college . this education policy ensures that the young people contribute enough time to helping their community . furthermore , the effort of school and society is also crucial in making sure that the youth contribute enough to the community . in school , desirable social value such a care for those in need are taught to student so that they can become better citizen . teacher encourage and guide student to carry out service learning project , in which they either serve a particular group of people a mentioned earlier , or they can raise fund for charity organisation . some company facilitate these service learning project by providing initial funding and organising competition . for instance , one company , `` ie singapore '' , organises a competiton in which they provide 1000 dollar initial fund to each participating group . these group are supposed to use the fund and come out with a creative way to raise more money for charity organisation . the group raising the greatest sum win . personally i participated in this competition last year . we used the funding to buy raw material and made them into different shape of balloon . it selt well and after 4 month of hard work , we were able to raise over 90000 dollar fund . we donated the money to children 's cancer foundation . in conclusion , nowadays young people are having great academic burden and more demanding requirement , but their effort to helping the community is not sacrificed . they devote enough time in coummunity service in voluntary activity , under the education policy of the government , and a inspired by school and society .
