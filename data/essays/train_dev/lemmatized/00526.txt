humans tend to blame thing , they often look for thing that they can not see , but that doe not help that much sometimes . `` advertisements make product seem much better than really are. '' is a product of this action . it is also a popular but wrong opinion . first of all , if it is true why do not we act against it . if it is so then it is a lie or maybe a trap . well if they sell you a broken item what if the difference . there is no difference they sell you a different item than the one in the advertisement , therefore they can get sued . secondly , there is no point in fake advertising . if they sell a product that way they lose their credibility and that is way to bad . for example , a company sold 100000 unit of a product with some fake advertisement , but by the time their next product the public get clever and even if it is a great product they will not buy it and that is way more important than 100000 sale of the previous item . finally , if they can sell stuff that way why do they collect and replace their faulty product . it is like selling two item with half-price . for example , two year ago sony sold their new slim playstations with faulty adaptor but after they realized their mistake they changed every adaptor with the new one . they did that because credibility matter and fake advertisement kill credibility . as a result all of that we can say advertisement do not show the product better than they really are because company are afraid of losing credibility and getting sued .
