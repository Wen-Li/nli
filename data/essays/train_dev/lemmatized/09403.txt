`` king of every thing but jack of nothing '' may be point of view of few people who think broad knowledge doe n't help . but i do agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . this do help in shapng the future of a person . as technology progressed the similar happened with human being . there started a race between many but the winner wa one . in order to coup up with it , there is always a need of getting an upper hand among the other 's . thus if we look in the field of engineering which requires a person to have knowledge related to various field in order to be higher than odds . but if that person ha insufficient knowledge a he had studied only one particular subject may let him down . for example , a person who is working in an electronics company if he doesnt have any knowledge of operating and electronic transformer that will let him down in front of many . thus , if he had a sound knowledge about transformer he would have solved the problem within second . in school day there are number of subject studied such a history , geography , math etc . the real ainm behind it is to help grow knowledge of student so that they do n't encounter any problem in life . suppose if only one subject wa thought then it would have affected the future of that student . i my self being an instrumwentation engineer know the actual essence of studying broad range of subject during my student life . we were successful in studying instrumentation a it contained mixture of various subject from different branch . the main benefit i got is during my last year graduation project where i have to make and design robot . the robotics field being main part of mechanical engineering wa know to me a it wa in my cirriculum . thus , i completed the robotics project successfully a compair to other student . because of having studied various subject i wa able to achieve my goal of becoming a successful engineer .
