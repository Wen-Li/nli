this topic ha a two way answer . mankind ha alway 's been known to thrive above any specie . man ha always been the dominating factor in this life . when a man is successful , he could have anything he want . some people are afraid when it come to taking risk 's , because it might jeapordise their current financial position . some successful people like to try new thing 's because it would be an adventure , it would be fun and it might just ` work ' . a person should only take the risk if he feel that he is one hundred percent sure that it fool proof , by saying this word i am contradicting the word ` risk ' , which is why a person can never be too careful . although taking a risk may seem breath-taking , it sometimes is devestative , one small risk could send a person down in flame 's , sending him to the abyss if he is not too careful . if i were a successful person i would like to experiment , take my chance , live life while im still alive , embrace failure a i would success . although disagreeing with the statement would sound more reasonable , i 'd like to agree with it , a time will come when a person is going to have to take a risk , be it a big one or a small one .
