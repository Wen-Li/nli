success is really one of the most important issue for many people all over the world . some people tend to do what they already know to do well . others tend to try new thing and take risk to do well . personally , i believe that trying new thing and taking risk are really imortant in a person 's success . on the other hand , there are those who belive that doing what one know is better than doing what he doe n't know . they believe that it is saftey for a person to do what he know , because he dose n't know what will happen if he try something new . the arab news mentioned a survey last month about the people who tend to do what they know . they made an interview with some of them . they think that it is better to do what you know , because one doe n't know what result will hapeen if they try something new . in contrast , many people believe that changing is really important in people 's life . they have to take risk and try thing that they did n't try before . they cite research on achievement saying that most of the successful people tend to do thing that they did n't used to do . they can face the problem that they mau face in thier life . in addition , they can get what they want easilly . so , they can deal with the life ' s hardship greatly . in conclusion , success is really an important issue . the plenty of people believe that one should try what de doe n't try , because he may never taste the life if he dose n't face it difficulty . so , they think that the right decision to do what one did n't try before . personally , i believe taht without trying one can not taste the life .
