i agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , but there are a lot of people do not like to go with group because of they like to have their time alone . for me i agree to travel with alot of people , it will be fun . and the best thing i like when i travel with a group are if need any help the will help you , you will make friend and you will have fun . first , if you need any help you will get it because who are travel with you and you like a big family . if you lost your money , got sick and if you want to chating with someone , will find what you want and will get what you , they will not live you alone because you one of them . second , making friend is the best thing in travel withh a group . it verey easy to make friend in the tripe . if you a nice person and friendly . and you will learn a lot of thing from them such a their culture , some of the way they used , or something important in the life you do not any idea about it . third , having fun , of coures you will have a lot of fun with your group . you play with them and listen to their story , and something like that . finally , having a trip with a group is really fun and every one ha to try to travel with a group .
