according to the question i think that is most important for the student to understand idea and concept because when you undestand something you can apply it much better on the life . if you get the main idea of something you can convine it with your imagination and experience and that make something powerfull because yo can create . for example , if you are studying some engineering you need to find the shorttest way to solve a problem . sometimes you just can find the solution of your problem looking in a book but not always is like that and there is when you have to apply yor knowelege . you have to apply the concept that you already learnt and with that you have to find the answer . that example can be applied to the all major because when you want to be the best in whatever that you do , you must to apply concept and idea . in the other hand , when you just learn fact you just get information that could be important or not . is good to know fact because you can explain better something but when you know a fact you should be worried about the idea or the concept that make possible that fact . for example , one man who just memorize information can not think well because he have a lot of information but can not apply it . his brain is to saturated with junk information that may be never use and that do not let think him . if you need to solve problem you can not keep just whit the information you must try to understand the thing and that will help you more in your life that just know fact .
