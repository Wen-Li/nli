young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . the youth is preferring personal life style instead of common one . they thinking more of themselves than the community that they are the part of . one sign of this is coming in the representation of their nation or country . a few decade ago it wa easy to tell someone 's nation by observing his attitude , clothes , and behavior . but today it is impossible to do . especially young people care their own appearance despite their custom . they are not conveying the culture to the future now you can see a global wearing style . another sign is they are getting more rude . i will explain this with an example . when i wa 16 year old i wa taking city transportation bus to go to school . the bus were usually crowded that more than half of the pessengers had travel by standing up in the bus . for the young people like me , it wa impossible to take a seat in the bus while older people or lady were standing up . we were always giving our seat to the older people , no matter how old they were . but today young people never care about the others , even they do n't care sick or handicapped people . they keep their seat and enjoy it . so sharing the seat is a way of helping the community for me . if someone want to help his or her community he or she ha to think about the economical aspect also . the people of the community should prefer buying domestic or national stuff to help the economy . but i do n't see this in the youth of the day . they are just crazy about the brand and they usually buy foreigner good to make show . there are many other way to help the community that the young peaople can choose but today they really even do n't think about it . finally without venturing too much into the field of speculation we may conjecture that today 's youth is not giving enough time and energy to helping their community .
