`` it is the idea that creats one 's interest in learning thing conceptually and this eventually lead him know the fact related to the idea '' as far a my opinion is concerned i agree with the statement `` it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact '' because unless i get an idea i will not know how to start with . once i get an idea i will try learning , learning need the conceptual base for the skilled building . as soon a i start learning and i acquire concept i will try getiing back to the history of that particular idea will will get me across the fact related to it . on the contrary if i learn fact this will not help me to be more creative . for example , a a doctor if i have an idea of recearch in neuron and glial cell in brain i will first study the whole stuff related to the neuron , the glial cell and the thing related to these two thing . after understanding the concept of the research and having a clear idea i can get along with the research . during the research i will come across the fact regarding the neuron and the glial cell . on the other hand if i start with the fact my knowledge will be limited to an extent and i will not try learning more about it a i will be convinced by the the tag it ha got that is `` fact '' . once i know it is fact i will not try learning about it . thus i feel it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . this will make them more innovative and provides them with a wide scope of learning the subject . when one understands the idea and concept definetly he will come across the fact related to the subject . to conclude `` ideas and concept include fact , but not the vice versa ''
