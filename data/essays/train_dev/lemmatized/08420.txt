the argument constrats the taste for life of young and older people and state that young people like it the most . i do not agree with this . i think that seniority is not a limiting factor to enjoy life . older people are retired and thus have more time than young people . this is a great oportunity to enjoy life . old people have many hobby , take care of their grand child , get involved with charity and go traveling all over the world . old people can accomplish high feeling of satisfaction through generous involvment in their family and in society . moreover old people do not have a stressful or tiring job monopolising all their energy . old people are independant and can do what they want to do . old people can experience a highly priviledged feeling of freedom . yet not everything is good for old people . nice old time require a good health and a good financial situation . more and more society is youth oriented . entertainments are more and more designed for yound people . family tie are not a strong a they used to be . divorses make family structure weaker . life span increase and old people are more numerous . the overall change in society is not in favor of old people . whereas in the past their social status wa granted and supported by a higher percentage of young , old people now have to build their place in society on their own . in spite of the recent society evolution , i think that in principle there is no reason why an old people should like life le than a young people . i beleive that age is not a factor for this while the family and environment are .
