every body have a weak in learnig , it seems to be boring and annoying , we do prefer understanding concept , in all case teenager an student nowadays dont disapprouve me. we first have to know the advantage and inconvenients of learning fact then we ll pas to the carachteristics of undesating idea and concept . pupil are le an le patient in the academy and the try to escape the learning , but we should know that learning fact help u a lot for example if we have a test wich we are only required to give defintions like it wa written in a book , we have to learn the concept obligatory . i can add the it certainly help you for your after conversation with the others , the quality of your communication ll be better and you ll have more thing to tell . there is now a kind of people who learn without knowing thhe concept that is the big mistake , because in the reflexion question the will be blocked and can not response efficiently . understanding concept without learnig them can be a possible solution but not adapted in some case . understanding idea and concept show how the pupil is clever and his ability to print lesson in his mind . nevertherless some student overact and limit there comprehesnion without revising anymore . unstead of escape the learning part , we must be clever and combine understanding and learning to obtain better result . that s what i try to do this year , the french baccalaureat need learning fact by heart , but meanwhile i do my best to understand the difficult concept of economy , law and management . it is shown that the best way to improove result in general is the combinaison of this two fundemantal procedure in school . we all have to use it if we are ambitious and expecting succes .
