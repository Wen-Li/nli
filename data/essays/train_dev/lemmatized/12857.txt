the concept of gaining knowledge is an age old process dating back to century . in those time especially in ancient india , the teacher taught not only in a particular subject but wanted the student to have a broader knowledge in more than one subject . this a those people believed to be mainly because knowledge is derived only to make a better person altogether . this is attained by improving the wisdom that a person hold afteer gaining the over all broader knowledge . this wisdom help the person to be a good human being . this kind of concept is still the main thing that is followed through out the world . in my view i can say that gaining a broad knowledge on many subject is far more important than gaining the specialized knowledge on one particular subject . if any person ha a broader concept on many academic subject , then he is sure of applying . for instance if a person ha mastered in computer and doesnt know where to use it and what kind of program to be made , then all his specialization would be a mere waste of time . quoting another example when a person who is say engineer by occupation , see a person who is collapsing on the road with a breathing problem , all that he can do is to call an ambulance but if he ha any kind of knowledge on how to do a first aid to that kind of a person , then nay be he can really save the life of that dying person . this is the way the knowledge come in handy . you never know when youm need them . another illustration that can be given in this context is that when a person is jobless for quite a long time , then he can go and do a job if he ha a knowledge on other subject too . if a doctor is jobless say after he finished his internship , then if he ha a knowledge in computer he can find a job in that field . thus having greater knowledge on subject sometimes save life or some time earns you money and make your living . so it is always best to have it fir a better life and a good settlement .
