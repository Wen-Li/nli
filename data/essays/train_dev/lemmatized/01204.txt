there are some out there who think that the facts are more important than the idea or different concept . others think in completly opposite manner . as far a i concered the i have always been follower of the true fact that is practical stuff . i have some example to support my statement . firstly , the importance of fact should be understood in more broader manner , the idea and concept are derived by fact . so if one can not understand the fact , it would be diffcult to understand the idea and concept behind certain fact . i have one astonishing example of einstin . i have read in the magazine ( reader 's digest ) that he always understood the concept and idea by experiencing fact . the theory of gravity is perfect example of the , fact coming first and then the concept and idea . secondly , the fact represents the overall idea behind it . so why not learn fact first then the idea ? in fact , if you consider or hold very much importance of the fact , you are bound to understand the concept behind it . most of scientist derive their thoery by understanding the certain fact in most perfect manner . so i think it is really important to foucs of te learing different fact . thirdly , student should focus of the pratical knowledge , which hold tremeadous importance in really life . i , myself , is perfect example , being a civil engineer , the fact behind every condition hold a important . in some condition , we obivously require the understanding for concept . but most of the time the learning fact is key . in the end , the point i like to conclude is the student a far a possible should foucus learing and understanding the critical fact of any subject .
