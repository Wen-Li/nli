i do n't agree or disagree with the statement . i think that there are benefit a whell a problem related to traveling in a group led by a tour guide . some of the benefit of traveling in a group with a guide in my opinion are : if you have a profesional guide he might shown you place that are not so common for tourist and that otherwise you would n't know of ; he could also tell you some history behind a place ; and the most important for me , normally local know the best place for having a great lunch or dinner . some of the problem that one might have while traveling in a group with a guide are : you need to follow a schedule , so there is not to much freedom ; the guide will show you what he think is the most important site , but that doe mean that you will agree with that or that you will enjoy that ; there is also the economical aspen the guide might not be cheap enoght for you to pay and finally there is the group issue , the group may not the type of person that you would like to share your vacation with and this could make the trip le enjoyable . in conclusion i think that you need to evaluated before getting into a travel group if that is realy the type of experince that you what to get out of a specific vacation . if you are going to a place for the first time or for shorth time a guide could be good idea . on the other hand if you are visting a place for the second time you might already know what do you want to do for the trip and whell a when , so not being with a guide will probably be better then .
