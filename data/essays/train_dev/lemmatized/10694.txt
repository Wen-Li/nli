is the world a circle ? it sure is . when the first car appeared at the beginning of the 20th century , ( thanks to the great industrial revolution europe wa living ) it wa such a phenomenon that in twenty / thirty year almost eighty per cent of the population had one . nowadays , there are at least 2 car ( if not even more . .. ) per family : do we really need that many car ? definately not . in fact , in the past few year , the number of car sold ha largely reduced . and hopefully , from now on , it 'll reduce more and more . personally i think this is because people have finally got the point that they 'd better spend their money on something else , maybe more useful and long-lasting . someone might object that car are useful and that is true , but it 's a need that can easily be replaced in several way and for different reason , first of all because of the pollution . using public trasportation would have many benefit : the environment would take a breath and there would also be much le traffic . exactly like with kid when they have a new toy . .. they play all the time only with that specific thing just because it 's `` new '' . the same thing happens with adult . years ago car were new and not having one wa a shame . instead , now , not having a car is a sign of intelligence , a way of distinguishing ourselves in a selfish world of omologation where even dangerous or harmful thing are used . so , in conclusion , the world is a cirlce , a huge chain with high and low point . cars already had their moment of glory , but from now on , they have to leave the seat to something else . till human wo n't get tired of that , too . .. ready to start the cirlce again . ..
