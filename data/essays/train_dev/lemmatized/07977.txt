the question which is discussed in the following passage is wheter a broad knowledge of many acadmic subject is superior to knowledge specialiesed in on specific subject . the idea to specialize in one activity is supported by the economic theory . the idea behind this theory is that the efficiency increase a we specialize in doing something . for example if we start playing an instrument we are getting better and beter the more we practice . the more we do something the better we can do it and the better we know which way it is done best . this theory can also be applied to education . a student who studied a subject longer and more intense than another is likely to know more about it . on the other hand side , there are also many advantage in having a broad knowledge . everything that happens , no matter if it is a ecological , sociological or another issue is somehow linked to other academic field . a broad knowledge help to see an issue in the whole context which is in my opinon very important . if you are running a business for example , it is important to be aware of the ecological effect you cause . if you would just concentrate on the economic side of this business and neglect other factor this could drawback on you in the future . for example think of fisherman who want to increase their profit by fishing more in one year . this behaviour could cause that in the following year there are to few fish . another advantage i see , is that it is easier to communicate with other people if you have some idea of his main interest . a broad knowledge can also be an inspiration . you can adapt idea from other subject . i personally prefer a broad knowledge because i like to undestand many aspect of one problem . i see a lot of chance in it because of the interaction between the different subject . but i also undestand if someone prefers to focus on on subject .
