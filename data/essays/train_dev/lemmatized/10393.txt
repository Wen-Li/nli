i both agree and disagree to this statement . first of all , i believe that a person who life in an academic environment should have a broad knowledge on a number of subject . because the solution to today problem require a broad knowledge from various area of science . and those area are usually interrelated to each other . whilst trying to find a relevant solution to an issue , a person could face many problem from a different area of science . so , the person should at least be familiar with the most basic principle of the related area . i also believe , people with a broad knowledge on various subject can easily understand the problem , find out the relevant option to solve it , and refer to the right fellow academic to get the right answer . if one doe not have a broad knowledge , he/she can not find the way out of the difficulty he/she may face . on the other hand , the in depth specialization in a subject is a must in today academic study in order to be able to get to the right solution of the problem in a particular subject . todays scientific problem require so good and in depth knowledge that one should be a subject matter expert to conduct relevant procedure in order to get relevant solution . who would think , without the special knowledge in the subject one could be successful ?
