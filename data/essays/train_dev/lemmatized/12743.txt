in my opinion advertisement make a product seems better than it really is , so i agree with the statement . in the today 's world a great amount of advertisement is given to u , even if we do n't care of them we are often compelled to watch them . i think advertisement can change a person tought about a thing , and for this reason we found advertisement everywhere . it often happens that a person 's choice is changed because it had watched an advertisemts . some people buy only thing that are showed on television because they are influenced by advertisement . advertisements make them think that these product are better than the others . fortunately i am not really this type of person because i do n't care of advertisement , just because i know that they could change my decision . so when i have to buy something , i ponder my decision and i look for the best price and the best object without thinking to what wa showed on television or said in a radio program . i do n't follow advertisement for another reason : all object showed on them are more expensive than others of the same type . that is because of the cost of the advertisement , but these cost seems to be repaied by the influence that advertisement have in people 's opinion . when i look for buy something i always budget my money and i choose le expensive object rather than more expensive one , which are always the one showed all day long in advertisement . in conclusion , i think a great part of the people is influenced by advertisement , which make product seem to be much better than they really are , but i think that people have to choose with their own head and must not follow advertisement seen on television or heard from the radio .
