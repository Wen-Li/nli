since five year i am a student in biotechniologie . this is a very special subject - but i got during my study also an overview to many other subject . like i have made it i think it is good . having his own specific subject and being really competent at this subject but having an overview and a basic knowlegde of different subject . then people from different specific subject can work together on a bigger project in which are different specific subject are needed . in my opinion it is important because today every special subject is very large and you can not get enough knowledge in every subject to develop a bigger academic project alone . for example i am doing my diploma thesis at a topic in biotechnology . and about the task of biotechnology i know very much but sometimes i have a question about the chemistry . then , yes - i can read a book about it but i can also go to the chemical department . there i can ask a specialist , and he can explein it to me very easy . and there is also another argument . it save time and time is money . it ist quicker to put the knowledge of different person together . when i would read a book about my chemical problem , i would lose much time . probably the person from the chmeical department would have explained it to me in an fwe minute . in conclusion you can see that it is more effective to have one specific subject and then to make some teamwork with people from other specific subject . it will be easier and quicker .
