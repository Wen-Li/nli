i disagree to the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . because you can not be free if you are in a group , also there is le chance to interact with the people of the place you visit and you can not explore thing by yourself . first , people want to travel to be free from their ordinary life such a time limit and rule . however , if you are in a travel group , there will be more rule to follow and time limit than travelling by yourself . for example , you probably not be able to spend much time where you want to stay long and always have to be on time to get together with other people . i would be stressed if i have not much freedom during the travel . second , you will get to meet more native people where you visit if you travel on your own than travel with a group . one of the most important reason to travel is meeting other people from other world . however , if you are with a travel group , you only get to hang out with that group until you come back home not knowing how the people you visit are like . therefore , i would travel on my own to get to know the people from the place i visit . third , you will not be able to explore thing by yourself . you can make much memory if you deal with new thing from the new place by yourself . if you only follow the leader of the group you would not feel pleasure of achievement during the trip . in sum , i prefer travelling on my own to travelling in a group due to the le freedom when you are in a group , lack of chance to meet native people from other world and losing chance to explore thing in the new place . you will be filled with lot of story if you travel on your own .
