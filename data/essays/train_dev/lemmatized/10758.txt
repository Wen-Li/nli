i agree that sucessful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . because of sucessful people think much than other people , sucessful people do n't affread fail , and sucessful people believe that high risk would get higher return . first of all , sucessful people think much than other people . for example , people who have a lot of idea or think what will be happen when they are doing thing before thay take action to do thing will make them more easily to resolve the problem . these people are confident to face variable problem when they are action to do thing , because they already predict they these problem may happen and they already think how to resolve these problem . second , sucessful people do n't affraid fail . sucessful people feel that fails are good expirence to make them far away doing these wrong way again . they can learn fail experience from doing thing fail , and they will look for new way to recover formor wrong way to approach sucess . some people give up their action when they are fall in problem and dispoint or argue that no one could give then hand . thes people are afraid fail and could n't learn how to become sucess from fails . finally , sucessful people belive that high risk would get higher return . people who have above two ability will love high risk , because the two above ability would make them have higher properbility doing high risk thing to get higher return . they do n't do thing only what they already know , and they do thing in risk to get better return .
