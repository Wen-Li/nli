`` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' i disagree with this statement becasue this is a statistic based statement . this is just a general idea that somebody ha put forth which doe not necessarily need to be true . my opinion is that people can be sucessful only when they work hard and do what they are good at . people who know their work are better able to succeed that the people who do not know the material . people who have a university or college degree on a particular area of expertise have a better chance to succeed in life than the people who have not obtained that certain degree . of course , there will be few people who want to try the material , but becasue they are just trying new thing doe not mean that they will become better than the people who already know the material . taking risk and trying new thing doe not mean that they are going to turn out better than what you are already do . suppose there is an art major who want to `` try new thing '' in buisness . due to the fact that she is an art major , he or she would have to start from the bottom and work their way up . it would be harder for them to cope in the buisness career . they may be able to succeed , but they will not be able to give their maximum potential . they would give their maximum potential in art . therefore , the person would have a greater chance of having a career in art rather than buisness . you can try new thing and if you are able to cope up with the work load and if you are able to understand the material , you may become successful . the chance are , however , that you would be able to succeed in what you do best . trying new thing is not a bad idea , but it would not take place of what you originally do best .
