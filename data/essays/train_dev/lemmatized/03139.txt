if you ask me most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are ! contemporary commercial are perfectly influencing a product success by connecting emotion , wish and promise on the product . often the fame of celebrity or important event is used to enhance the product image . and a a third point many promoted feature you often don ' t need in daily use . to connect product with emotion and promise could be a old a the history advertisment itself . people are encouraged to buy a product because of these emotion and suggestion . a commercial suggestivly promise you . if you buy this kind of vodka you ' ll becpome invited for important party and will meet beatiful people . advertisment promise that you ' ll be happy when you purchase . celebrities often promote product and brand become `` prime '' sponsor of for instance sport event . people tend to connect these product to the famous property of the celebrity or the event . typically brand try to find their clientel by choosing the appropriate sportsman or event to sponsor . very often many promoted feature don ' t be needed in real life . the so called innovative shaver by new technology basically make the same job a an older one and the amazing highspeed or acceleration of a new sport car can ' t be driven because of the speed limit . altogether according to me successful advertisment ha to heighten a product image because of the hard competition among many similar product of the selling market . furthermore the company have to attract people to buy thing and to refuse the old one . first of all this is a rule of our economic society and of course there more and more thing around u to being purchased . if you become a critical user and buyer you will detect all these mostly unwarranted `` heightened meaning '' .
