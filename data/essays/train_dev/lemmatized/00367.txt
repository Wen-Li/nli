travelling should be fun and variable experience in my life . in order to satisfied with traveling , i disagree with the statement . first , if i have to travel with a tour guide , i have to be controlled by the itnerary that is made by the travel agency . for example , i have to keep moving on followed by a tour guide although i would rather to stay in a museum . it is better to make my own schedule to see everhing i want based on my own list . second , if i cam explore by myself , it is bigger chance to get some unexpected experience such a seeing famous people there , or getting paticular food in the area . exploring or challenging to do something in overseas or even outside of town is a part of fun . i like doing some special activity if i have a chance . basically , those activity are not provided by the tour agency . to excute this plan , i need to ask people who live there , and i need to try it . thinking about these plan make me excited , i will do that activity for sure if i have a chance , i like challenging third , traveling need money . in order to spend money efficieny , it is good to travel without a tour guide . if i am with a tour guide , i might need to pay for somthing which i am not willing to spend . insted of using money for that a tour gide suggests , i can use money for other thing such a making another trip from the area . to sum up , to travel without a tour guide is good for saving time and money , also , to enjoy some rare experience . in order to make the trip better , it is better to traval by my own plan without a tour guide .
