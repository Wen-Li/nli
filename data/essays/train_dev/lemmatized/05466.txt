i think that travel with few people and without a tour guide is the best way to enjoy your trip . i believe that a tour guide is necessary just if you plan to visit a country whose culture , habbits or language are really difficult to understand . i consider that the people you travel with are the most important issue when you plan a journey . together with my wife , we once went to mexico with two friend of u who had never travelled before . we invited them to come with u and we contracted a local tour guide even if we both speaks spanish . we realized , after few day , that it wa a bad idea . as our friend were not used to the mexican high temperature , they got sick after visiting the chichenitza archeological site . during the following day we visited the south part of the country and we realized that the tour guide wa explaining u the same thing that we would have found written in a tourist book . considering this bad experience we decided to organize our next travel by ourself . next summer we are going to japan were my wife spent a whole year learning japanes during an international exchange program . this time , instead of contractcting a tour guide , we are going to ask to the people she met there , to give u a tour around the country . we will visit the most famouse japanes place with local people and we will be able to schedule our journey without depending on the group ' s plan .
