nowadays young people have n't time to hep their community . i think that this statement is true . nowadays the interesting of young people are different to doing help for their community . there are a lot of reason because it happens : 1 ) young people do n't receve an aduguatly education by own parent : i think that the parent should do an adeguatly education about helping the community , because so they do n't only play with their friend , and because it is another way to stay with other young people . 2 ) they think only for theirself , to buy new dress , to play football , and other activity that give more importance to own personality . 3 ) they think that other person can help their community , and so they ca n't do nothing for their community . they do their help only if someone tell they what they do . when i wa young i helped my community when i had some time : so i went to a social place where live some small child who have n't their parent and i played with they ; or with other friend and parent we cleaned my city to some rifiutes that other bad people put on the street or in the park . this are only some example that all young peolpe can do to help the community : it doe n't take a lot of time . only person can do a little action to help the community , because the community is formed also by we and because the help that we do now , tomorrow someone will do it for we .
