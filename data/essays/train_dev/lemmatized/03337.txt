i partly agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of the many academic subjets than to specialize in one specific subject . because it may be acceptable in some aspect and it may not acceptable in some apects . it is better to have knowledge in many subject . because it is a very best method to know about the all the subject and to get awareness of all the subject which is very useful . bcause by having an idea about the all subject people can easily overcome the present competition . for example in many campus recruitements the softwarecompan are asking the question about the all the subject rather than a particular subject . they are trying to test the knowledge and idea of the person about the various subject . so it is better to study many subject rather than a particular subject . and all the time the knowledge of the more academic is not useful . because it is better to know to study clearly about the particular topic and improve the analysing capability of the subject in a keen way . because specalist in one subject will know about the detailed information of the subject . they can solve the problem which are araised in that field easily because of the vast knowledge of the subject . they can do the reaserch in the subject and can develop new technical method which are very useful to the humanbeings . the specialist are required in every field to manage the system . so it is good to have vast knowledge in a particular field . so it will be better in many situation to have knowledge about the academic to be aware of the all the subject in order to be a succesul person in the present competition . and it is also very good to have deep knowledge about the one subject to be perfect and to manage a particular field .
