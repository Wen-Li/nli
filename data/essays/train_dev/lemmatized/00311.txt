every person is having the different nature . some people think that it is their responsibility to spend some time to helping their community while others think it is not their responsibility to help community . i donot agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . ours is a developed city , it ha developed by forming group of people in to community . some community are develop by involment of all member of their community . in our community every person have to allocate some time on sunday for the development of community . they will be metting and discus the solution for the problem in colony . by active participation of our community member we developed park , road etc . our is the only beautiful community in our locality . in every where they will be forming a community and working betterment of their community . in educational institution we will form in a community and strive for the betterment of institution . in our school every year all student will partcipate in cleaning the school that day all teacher and student work together they will painting the wall and planting tree etc. we will be cleananing our school and understanding will be developed between u . in making some decision a group of member form a commitee and they try their best for making the good decision . some person may think that it is not their reponsibility to help their community . because the work they are doing in their job . technology ha advanced and some of them not find it tight schedule . when they get some leisure time they think to relax , going out to meet some one . thus , i conclude that most of young people nowadays give enough time to help thyeir community . most of the community are well developed , this show u they are spending some time for the growth of their community
