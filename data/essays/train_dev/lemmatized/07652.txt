what is going to happen twenty year later , can not be predicted accurately by anyone . the use of car will decline or increase depends a lot on the success of the contemporay researcher success , who are curently working diligently on finding an alternate renewable and cheap source of energy , which may help power the engine of the future automobile . if we do not find a replacement for gasoline a a fuel for driving the car engine , this exhaustable fuel source will some day deplete . in the situation of reducing supply of the fuel for the car , the price of the oil will increase , making it le afordable . the car company may initially decrease the price of their automobile to lure the customer harrowed by the increasing oil price . this price decrease may not last long , since the car company will realise later that it is more sensible to sell high priced car to a few people and gain a higher profit by working le , rather than making more car to gain the same or may be even lower profit . hence the number of car on road may decrease . furthermore a the world economy grow more , the government of the world would try to improve the public transport system , and recomend to their citizen to favour it over the use of private vehichles . the litreacy rate is also bound to increase with time . hence the literate and more sensible citizen would readily take the advise of the government and start favouring public transport . this would again decrease the number of car . if a new renewable and cheap fuel source is invented , initially the automobile industry may suffer due to the technological change that it may have to adopt but , eventually this may bring about a boom in the automobile industry . people would be interested in trying the new technology , and hence try to adopt it . cheap and non poluting fuel may make people want to own their own private vehicle . the government will try to subsidise this new fuel to wean off it citizen from the use of gasoline . such move will make people want more car and hence the number of the car on road may increase . the growing population of the world is producing more consumer , hence the number of car in the given circumstance are bound to increase . hence in conclusion i would like to say that the question of weather of not the number of car in the future is goin to decline can not be answered instantly . it depends on the development in science in the near future .
