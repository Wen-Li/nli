thinking about this statement i come to the conclusion that this statement is actually nonsense and impossible evaluate . the first problem of this staement is that it is much too broad . in order to be able to evaluate on the topic one first ha to narrow down the age group in question . what is meant by `` younger people '' ? what is meant by `` older people '' ? if `` younger people '' mean child of , for example , 3-5 year of age and `` older people '' mean their parent then i fully agree with the statement . if one ha ever observed child in kindergarten they seem to have no worry . they can play and meet their friend and ususally everthing is taken care of for them by the parent . the parent , on the other hand , a already implied , have to take care of everything : they have to work in order to be able to buy everything necessary for every-day life , such a food and clothing . the situation change when the child get to school . they have duty to fulfill such a attending the class and doing thier homework . this all virtually eats thier time they used to spend for so many other nice thing . any adult would say now : `` oh , if i could just go back to school again ! '' however , it is not about the adult here but about the child 's perception . in the eye of child school can be very anoying which lead to them not enjoying their life a much a they used to . to which degree they do not enjoy it can not be answered here . it can not be answered , either , whether they enjoy it more or le than adult . this is dependent on many more factor , probably most importantly personal perception . it is in everyone 's own view whether one enjoy 's life or not . measuring and comparing joy is rather impossible . thus , generalization should be avoided , also because each age group ha own worry a well a each society . children a well a their parent in europe have to worry about different thing than child in africa , for example . a proof for which age group in which society is the happiest one is probably impossible to produce - if it wa , the result would probably be rather astonishing .
