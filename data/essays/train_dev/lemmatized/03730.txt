i really have to say < i do n't know > . this is a question that i ' ve discussed in the past a lot of time , particullary at the school . i think that the student often think studying like a great possibility to improve their knowledge but also their personality . to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject can make a better man or woman in this society . an opened personal culture can give the possibility to have a lot of relationship . the problem related to this opinion is the false dream that it give to person like me . i do n't think that the current society can accept a man or a woman that love learning many thing , but noone like specific . to find a job today it 's more difficult than ever , and if you have not a specific competence you will only enlarge the big world of unemployed . now i 'm still studying so i ca n't speak about the job world thanks to my personal and direct experiencies , but i can see my friend and my brother 's life . they have studied for a long time to be good worker , but i see this is not sufficient . the job and the society require everyday a better work . so like i usually have to do when i speak about the difference between a broad knowledge of many subject and a specific one , i must write that today that 's impossible living in a dream , where everything in your opinion is interesting . today the only possibility to create a future is to leave at home the passion and all the rest , and thinking about a specific competence that you like and that can give you the possibility to realize a part of your dream .
