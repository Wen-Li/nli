our world is filled with advertisement , they are on the wall , on the radio , on tv , on the internet , and even in artistic item such a movie or painting . can we consider the add a being tricky ? to what extent are they giving false information on a product and doe it depend of the product or of the look that the consummer have on the product ? as far a i am comcerned i believe that addvertisements do n't lie a far a the consumer us the product in good condition . i am not working in the adventising world to have such a point of view , but for people who know a little about law , it is clear that advertisments can not lie . there is a legal phrase `` lying advertisement '' that would punish all advertiser who would give to their product false property . and that is the main point about a product that is in add a it is in real life . but how can we explain that product that are said to be wonderful do n't plainly work when you buy it and use it at home ? it is not because the product is ineficient but because it is n't used in the same condition a those in the test lab . let 's take shampoo for instance , they are said to make smoothy and shining hair in add . but when you do buy it , it doe not make the same . why ? because at the first use you do n't benefit of the active element yet , and because your hair are weakened by pollution , stress , etc . .. that make them suffer . the shampoo yet can make your hair a smooth and shining it is said in the advertisement . the le point would be that our consumer 's eye is not the same a the designer one . he will find his product perfect and he wo n't stop talking about the new thing it brings to u . this is the main difference that separate the inventor from the user . we wo n't have the same regard on a car a the one of the ingeener who made it or the designer who drawnd it . the advertiser share this regard with them .
