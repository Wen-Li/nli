broad knowledge or specialization in one subject , which of them are important and valunable in our contemprory world ? if i forced to held a position , i would stand behind the latter , being specialize in one specific subject . these are my following reason in the first place , i strongly believe that special knowladge in one crutial subject is the foundation of being valunable or scarce in our merceless compatative business world . knowledge is accumulating and nobody can reach all of them in one life . different position require different kind of worker . therefore having broad knowledge of many academic subject is not logical becase of demand of special member from campanies . for example i am studyin economics and my school is providing significant skill to me that will be helpfull on my business life . a a consequence a secrutiny of this education syllbus will make you understand the importance of my coise . secondly , besides requirence special individual there is one more significant aspect that make my choise sagacious . while you are for example trying to gaining many information about academic subject you may loose your time and energythus focusing different thing and seperating different subject may decrease your enercy and the most importantly your success . a a result having broad knowledge may bring bean than boon . to sum up , when we consider in detail it will be apparently seen that specializating in one specific subject outweigthing to trying to obtain different and wide knowladge of many academic subject .
