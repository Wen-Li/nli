advertisements exist to sell people product they do not need . this idea explains the ambition of modern advertising and marketing strategy . our modern society is based on capitalistic and often superficial value , and while making product seem better than they actually are , advertisement do notthing but reflect the social value . personally , i would say that modern product manager do not have the choice to sell their product a they really are . the economy in our so called developped country ha reached a level of saturation and offer more product than people actually need . therefore , those who want to sell their product will have to make high investment and develop good advertisement strategy . this guarantee them a good visibility of their product and good chance to sell them . i also believe that modern advertisement respond to a demand from society . today , we are all looking for the exeptional , the beautiful , the luxuary . in many case , we do not want to buy a prpoduct but we want to buy a dream . this mean , that we often prefere to buy an illusion rather than the reality . for instance , the latest shower liquid from ralph lauren seems much more attractive to u than a good soap , which would probably have the same effect on our body care . modern advertisement ha to make product seem better than they really are , because customer are asking for it . this is nether good or bad , it is a simple fact . netherless , we should be aware of this fact and not be disappointed when the dream we just bought remains a dream .
