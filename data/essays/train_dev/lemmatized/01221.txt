shaping of the human thinking style is possible . there is a fact that people from different country have different reaction to the fact surrounding them . this difference arises from the various education type in school and the family . there are two way to teach someting to somebody . the first one is teaching the reason , therefore the idea and concept . by this technique the student will be learning what is going on . there he will have the power for making judgement and forecast about the stuff learned . for example , he/she will will be able to fix someting he ha learned by mean of repairing it , or will be improving that thing . in two case what happens is natural . however , this method seems to be best fit for a fast evolution , ha a negative side . the other side of the madallion is that this process will be extremely time consuming , when we the number of thing to be teached increase . the other side of the madallion is learning by fact . in this case the the learning curve is steep . since the student learns little about the idea and concept , he/she will not be able to comment about it in the future . so this stuff will be prone to degregations . in addition , the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is genius . to sum up , the possible two technique stated above are like two very different thing . but it maybe the most important thing to be realised that all human being are different . as we all have different ability and unabilities . the real thing is to decide which process is best for the student being teached . a genius will learn faster , so load all the data with only fact to him k , he will just ask one thing to get the idea , and invent something . choose the right combination for the custom class that you teach . that 's why the teacher are being trained for .
