many succeful people hate to do the same thing and they like to take risk and to try new thing . and of course i support this idea and these people and i agree with this statement because after an experience in my life and facing alot of successful people and i can concider my self a a successful girl , maybe because i hate routine and i always like to try new thing . for example last year when i took the license car and i wa really scared to drive by my own self but one day and it wa this year i tried to drive alone with no body near to me and i did , i wa really glad and proud from my self . all successful people try every thing new in their life and for that they success in every thing they do , they hate routine because it 's really dull . in trying new thing they may success and may fail but they concidered it , a an experience and we always concidered them a succesful people even if they fail in one experience it 's not the end of the life . when they will fail they can redo the same thing and succed on it . it 's really important to try every thing new because in our life we only live once for that we have to take risk and to try every thing new even if there is a thing that it is not allowed to do it we have to try it only to say that we face an experience in your life .
