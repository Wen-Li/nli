i do agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk . firstly they try to reach new goal , but they also never refused to do something . first , successful people always try to reach new goal . thus this is not because they are used to do something well that they wo n't do anything else and wo n't try to find new achievement . for example , a man like antoine de saint-exupery , who wa a famous french pilot during the xxth century , always tried new thing . he contributed to the opening of the first french aircraft line , he risked his life by searching new road , by crossing the atlantic ocean with small aircraft , by flying on unknown area . .. he never thank that it wa profitable for him to stay in france teaching how to drive a plane to student . that kind of person , who is for me very successful , always tried to achieve new goal . moreover successful people never resigned to do somethimg when they have a precise aim , and that is one of the main reason of why they have success . let u take the example of the member of a mountain rescue patrol . maybe for those who live in town they are not the most successful person on earth , but it is not the same thing for those who live nearby mountain , or for those who have been saved by them ! they are taking risk every day to save people , they have a heavy training during many month , and if they do n't succeed to do one task , they will be asked to do it again and again , sometimes in some extreme condition . they never refused to go searching for a person , even if they have to risk their own life to achieve it . we all know that many rescuer in mountain died by saving people , which show u that they have n't resigned . to conclude we have seen that successful person are mainly the one who take some risk in their every day life but moeover who never resigned to achieve a task .
