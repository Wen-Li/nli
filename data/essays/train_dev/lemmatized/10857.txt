i totally agree with this statement , cause i think it really the best way to discribe a successful person . i will start by mentioning why i think thats true , let say some bussiness man think of starting a new business , and the man who is really considered a good example in my opinion is bill gates . he started the microsoft while it really wa a very risky and new investment to the world who really didnt know anything about operating system and so on , so intorducing this new operating system by bill gates in microsoft wa really risky and a new thing , but bill gates took this risk and now he is the richest man on earth . well ofcourse we cant just say that taking a risk and doing new thing is enough for a successful person , this person need to keep tracking his business and have this kind of enthusiazm of being better and better . lets say bill gates just started his bussiness with microsoft with the first window ( operating system ) and then he just took a rest and didnt think of what he could do next or what he could do more to make his work keep going , that would totally led the company to a break down a there is lot of other company who are working on the same firm . all i want to say is , if someone is just happy for what he got and know , and dont try to search for better result , that would end him a a unsuccessful person sooner or later . may be a person is so successful now and he is taking risk and doing new thing , and for some reason this person just stopped caring or thought that is enough for now , in my opinion in our new world this (( i think thats enough for now )) thinking would not work anymore , cause life is changing so fast and people keep asking for more new and better thing all the time so we have to keep runnig in the right track . my opinion may took the bussiness side of the statment but i really think our world now is really just living by business and managment and the more you are successful in this field the more you are successful in your life , a life is all about how to learn new thing and risk to accept the new challanges that encounter through your life everyday .
