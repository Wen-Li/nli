it is le important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for then to learn fact . learning fact are more important than comprehending idea or concept because idea and concept come from fact one ha learned . a typical example for this will be hitler and the jewish people . without the allies revealing the secret of what the nazi have done to the jew , the gory , unnecessary holacaust would have been buried and never revealed again . because the allies found out the axis movement , new idea and concept have been stated and listed . since fact came out , the idea came too . another perfect example will be student learning history . by gaining knowledge of horrible event that ha happened in the history , such a slavery , asssassination of the best president , world war ii , the cold war , or the vietnamese war , student will have more knowlegde and fact to form more opinion . new society with more idea can only be constructed through student attaining more and more fact . to construct , or at least attempt to construct an utopian community or a better world will only be possible if fact are learned , and brand new idea are formed . original concept , mixed with fact are the two most important factor to create the society . a house will be a typical example . if the house is a life , the frame and the base will be the fact , and all the other fancy material , such a window , flooring , et cetra , will be the idea . without the frame , it is impossible to have the fancy material to stand . therefore , is it much more important for student to learn fact rather than comprehending idea or concept . because without the fact , existence of idea and concept will be not allowed .
