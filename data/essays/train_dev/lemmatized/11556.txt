i totally agree with the above statement that say `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' because younger people can be much more active than older people . young people can enjoy all the entertainment in the world whereas the older people would have to think twice before doing anything . young people can play sport such a soccer , tennis , baseball and the list go on whereas the body of older people dont permit them to take part in these activity . young people can travel around the world and see ther different culture of different country whereas older people dont have the stamen and will to travel so much . young people can try and find way to increase their standard of living by working and doing job whereas older people have no choice but to live the rest of their life in the same way . the young people go to club and bar and make new friend whereas old people just sit at home and probably watch television . the social life for the young people is much more than that of the old people . young people can do all sort of adventure like rock climbing , sky diving or bungy jumping . these thing are totally restricted for the old people . the young people are much more excited and energetic than old people . the young one look forward to the upcoming day and event whereas old people just gaze around at their home lazily and have no future plan . the young people have future aim and goal in life but the older one have already lived thier goal and dont look forward to anything in the future . young people have all the time in the world to gain fame or earn money whereas the older one are almost through with thier life and dont bother about fame or money . finally , i would like to conclude by saying that the young people can dream big and then take step to achieve their dream but a for the old people go , they might have dreamt of something big and some of them might have even converted those dream into reality , but now they can only dream about thier past and recall thier beautiful moment of the early time .
