in accomplishing something that is risky come the reward of success . with success come satisfaction , envy , prosperity , and confidence . i believe that the human race would not be the same without the risk that some of our great inventor and leader took . it even take great courage and confidence to be a successful businessman . going where no man ha gone separate the great from the norm . the best example of a risk taker that became successful is bill gates . not only is he the richest man in the world , he created something that almost everyone in the modern world us , windows . had bill gates stayed with apple and graduated harvard , who know what the screen on our desktop would look like ? instead , he did exactly the opposite , he took a chance . bill took a huge risk by going out on his own to create a program that wa not well known at the time it wa introduced . a few year later , windows became the standard in the computer industry . unfortunately , apple , bill 's former employer , rejected his program when it wa asked to get bought and suffered a huge loss in potential profit by `` doing what they already know how to do well . '' even the land of america would not have been discovered and colonized if risk were not taken . the american pilgrim took a risk in leaving everything behind and starting a new life in an unknown territory . then came the declaration of independence . this wa a document that accused the forefather of america with treason . had they not taken the chance of complete failure and war against the biggest military power at that time , america may not be the supreme power that it is now . even if one fails a thousand time before reaching their goal , the feeling of success is something nobody can take away from them . sticking to something that one already know is not a bad thing , but it will never let a person shine or stick out from the rest - success .
