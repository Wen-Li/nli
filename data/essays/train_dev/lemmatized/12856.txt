learning and understanding are two cognitive ability that are closely related and are part of the every day experience of a human being . i would say that , since student are constantly interacting with their environment and with others , learning from these experience come a the main factor . this ability could be defined a the disposition of the student to process information he receives from his environment , through his sens ( what he see , listens and feel ) and is capable to categorize and keep this information for adaptional purpose . each information is contained in what we commonly call : experience . and by experience i mean fact . facts are part of reality , part of the outside world , and help a student understand a world that should be articulated with his internal experience ( such a thought , and emotion ) . moreover , become socially adaptive and in coherence with his own thought about how the world work and how will he explain to himself the action and reaction of his enviroment ; including natural scenario , people and the diversity of this interaction , which are all part of the process of learning . understanding becomes an ability where the student considers what of all that he ha learned is comprehensible enough for him . that is , if he distinguishes significantlly between event and part of reality . for example , a new subject ( chemistry , to mention one ) is being taught to a student , first he receives all the information about it , theory , author , investigation , etc ; but right after he ha , let say , accumulate all this information in his mind , after he ha learned about this new subject , he will begin to comprehend , understand it , by re-reading book , article , by talking and expressing his idea , by reproducing the author 's point of view , etc . therefore , i do n't agree with the statement . i consider that facing the oustide world is first and it is a process of learning ; understanding is that second part of the process on where the student ( or human being ) will form in his mind idea , concept , opinion , even hypothesis about what he ha already learned . so learning and understanding are in the same level of importance . it is a matter of what come first and how they influence the interaction between the student 's innerworld and reality placed outside .
