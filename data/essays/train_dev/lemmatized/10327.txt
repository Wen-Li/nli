there are certain area that differs from each other according to how a student studying in those area should respond to the need of the area he or she studying in . . although some of them such a mathematics require a student to learn fact , understanding idea and concept about an area or an issue is more important . one of the reason that can be given to the statement that understanding is more important than learning fact is ability to apply what a student learn practically . for example , i am studying pyscoholgy and it is not enough for me just to learn the fact about certain thing . as i want to be a pyscologist in the future i need to apply what i learn and i need to solve my patient 's problem . this certtainly requires to understand idea and concept of what i study . the other reason is that a person can be more creative and do well on their exam when she understand the idea and concept . rather than accepting the fact after learning it , student can discus the concept and even improve the idea that they understant . in my department i have a frind whose conception of studying is totaly different from me . while i always try to learn the main fact and concentrate on them , she focus on concept and just try to understantds idea . what i observed recently is she is doing better than me in exam and this lead me to become a conclusion that since i only focus on learning fact , it make me limited to them and i can not answer or respond to anything practically . what is more is she is more creative than me in producing solution to practical problem of some patient that we study a an exercise in a hospital . to conclude , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept instead of learning fact . that is the way i want to change myself towards also .
