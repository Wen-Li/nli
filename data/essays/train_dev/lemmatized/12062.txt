i disagree with the statement that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than specializing in one specific subject . i believe that specializing and concentrating in a single specific subject is far more important for two reason . first , our life is limited . we do n't have enough time to learn about every topic or subject during our lifetime . if we can live for five hundred year a turtle doe , we can study and learn almost every accessible subject that we need to know . however , the real is not . for example , if all student are educated in purpose of having broad knowledge without any indept specific knowledge about science , they might understand how machine operates but they can not fix in case the machine stop or are destroyed . we do not want our child to have only shallow knoweldge in many subject without their own specialty . second , i strongly believe that being equipped with specialized knowledge may result in inspiring people from using the specific knowledge and applying the knowledge to various other area . in my case , i have been very interested in collecting butter fly in every different kind since i wa five year . this hobby made me read the related book and article about insect a much a i could . as i know about the insect more , i wa more deeply inspired from their behaviosr . as a result , i expanded my hobby to my major in college : biology . in conclusion , i think focusing on a specific topic ha a lot more advantage than being a only generalist . since our life span is limited and society is well diversified , we need more specialist than shallow generalist . also our culture and technology will be beneficial from the people who have profound , indepth knowledge on specific subject a the society 's environment become more complicated .
