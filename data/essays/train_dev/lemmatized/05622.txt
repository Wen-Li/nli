i disagree with the concept of having a general knowledge of a broad variety of subject compared to specialization in one field . in my opinion it is better to focus on one academic subject because it achieves more and the achievement is more thorough . in today competitive world , i understand the importanceof having knowledge , regarding various subject , but i think , such knowledge should be pursued at lower level of education , such a college or high school , to develop the overall personality of the student . however , in higher education specialization is a must , since , it provides greater opportunity for the future and experience during the period of training . for example , if you look around , those doctor who do not pursue a specialty course ( general practioners ) tend to do well in their practice , but those who do specialize , run a spectacular practice . this is relevant to both the nature of case treated and the salary earned . the specialist see rare case , reffered to him by the general practioner , increasing his knowledge in his chosen field . he is better able to treat the condition and naturally earns more , a well . another example - on comparing the job allotted to postgraduate with those allotted to the graduate , one can see the preference is given to the former . a law student is more likely to be recruited with a prestigious firm than the average high school pass-out . experience play an important role here , because there is channelisation of force acting to achieve the higher goal . also , if one want a broad knowledge of subject , the number of goal naturally increase . this requires time , effort and money . consequently , efficiency is greatly reduced and complete knowledge of each subject can be easily compromised . in my experience a a student i realised i did well in the year when i had thre subject to cover in undergraduate school a compared to when i had four subject . in all fairness , subject in each year required intensive reading . similarly , i have noticed that the class valedictorian , usually , excels in one or two subject and not each subject , clearly showing how difficult it is to master each . `` the jack of all trade , the master of none . '' i would not llike to be associated with that phrase because i think it undermines the motivation to succeed . success , for me is the attainment of a goal , which requires focus . if there are numerous path to follow then success can not be gained beacuse of loss of focus . i believe in a firm foundation of knowledge of many topic upon which i can build my expertise ,, just like a plane wih a braod middle and a pointed tip , which is in conformity with the principle of aerodynamics .
