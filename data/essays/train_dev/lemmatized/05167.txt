i agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to help their community . first , with the pressure increasing , some student focus on their study most of the time . for example , in our country , we have to get up around 6 o'clock and go to school at 7 . and most of u will go to cram school after school . the time that we arrive home is around 10p.m.we also have a lot of work to do at home . so we do n't have enough time for sleeping , needle to say helping our community . besides , most of young people now are more care about themselves . they work part-time job very hard to earn money to make themselves prettier or buy more thing they like . they even do n't care about their parent . what their community become is not a big deal . it is common to see that someone calling help on the street but no one give a hand . also , most young people just know how to play computer game or watch tv . they do n't know how to clean their bedroom , pick up trash on the street or take care of others . if they have free time , they will plan to hang out with their friend instead of helping their community . however , they do n't know that by helpning community can make them learn more . communities are just like a small scociety . helping each others , especially in your neighborhood , can earn a lot of precious experience that may use in the future . there is no doubt that teenager do n't give enough time to help their community . this may become a serious problem that need more concern of our scociety .
