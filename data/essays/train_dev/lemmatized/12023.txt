the field of mechanical engineering ha improved in several way which is being reflected in the new generation car . it is cliche that once we get accustomed to a comfortable way of living then it is rather is very tough to get rid of it . ` comfort ' and ` luxury ' are like trap , once we get caught we could hardly make way out of it . so thus , i disagree with this argument that car would face a declivne in their usage . cars have been the major mode of transportation in the world since a long time . people utilize car for a variety of reason such a - it give an enjoyable , thrilling and comfrtable ride , some people are fanciful about it , it could be utilized at emergency time when public transport is unavailable , in order to avoid crowd in the public transportation , to expose their financial status too . cars too have their negative aspect such a increasing air pollution , accident etc . but these are avoidable and alterable aspect . pollution could be avoided by utilizing unleaded and well rectified petrol . and people need to be more prudent to avoid accident . so thus we could ward offf with the two major negative aspect . the past ten year ha seen immense enhancement in the field of car manufacturing . new car with more additional feature are beiong produced , which attract the people to it . so all of a sudden the usage of car can never cease and there will not be any declination in their number . i would say that there would be no felicitious reason for the car utilization to drop . atleast the manufacturer would never let this happen . this field might show more improvementr rather than declination . technology is showing tremendous improvement in all way . so definitely , car utilization will not decline . so i conclude by saying that a long a human race exists the existence of car too will continue because we human are after all materialistic and thus the craze for car will continue .
