it is age what make our life , and that is why it is so important to enjoy life . but it is not so easy a it sound because there are different stage in our life that come with different thing we have to face . and that 's why i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . when people are jung there are three main aspect that make them enjoy more than when people are old . the first one is the responsabilities they have in their life . when life is beginning people do n't really have to worry about many thing , they normally have their parent or someone that take care about important aspect of life . and if they have to take responsabilities they have the energy to do it . for example , paying the bill , being responsable for the hause and many others thing that need responsability and can cause stress . another and very important aspect that show that jung people enjoy more ist health . the jung people normally have no big problem with their health and body in general , they can move by themselves and are able to do thing without any physical help . this is very important for u a human being . the last point is the mentality , or also mental health . this psycologic aspect also make the jung people enjoy more life because they normally think positively , have dream , have thing to accomplish in their future . and that is also something important , the jung people have expectation and so they can do thing to get what they want of their life , or at least try . for old people thing are not just that easy . they have already been jung and made a lot of thing . they have had a lot of responsabilities and now they are tired and need to rest and this aspect make them have a negative attitude towards life and so they can not see other thing to enjoy . at this time of their life , they do not really have much more energy to continue with all this responsabilities . the second aspect and more important is the physical health . normally when people reach the old stage of life , they have some kind of limitation that doe not permit them enjoy a like when they were jung . thisngs take more time to be done and maybe thay can not even do them . finally the mental health , a said befor a positiv mentallity is very difficult to find . things have changed and being old is not easy . that is why i say that jung people enjoy more than old people , because everything is easier and physically , mentally and in term of responsabilities it is better being jung , you have more thing to enjoy life . energy end , and attitude is also a matter
