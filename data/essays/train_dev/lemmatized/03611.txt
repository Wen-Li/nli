from my point of view i do n't think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . even if the price of the oil is enormously increasing nowadays , twenty year is such a small period of time to foresee that car are going to decrease in use . as far a i am concerned the car is the transport that most people use to get to the work , the school , the university . .. i am disappointed with this choice because i think the car can tremendously damage the enviroment . every day the pollution in the city are growing and the citizen have the responsability of this . if we were concerned about the consequence that the car can cause in the nature i am sure we would change our point of view . most people take the car because they think is the easiest way : they ca n't stand the queus in the metro or at the bus stop , they do n't have to fight with the people to get in the train etc . instead of seeing the advantage of public transport they only see the disadvantage of it . however they are wrong because when they take the car there are a lot of people who take the car at the same time , therefore nobody will be able to avoid the traffic-jam in the peak hour . i ca n't understand why people keep on taking the car in the morning if they know they will find traffic-jam , they will get nervous and maybe they will be late . nevertheless at least there are some people concerned about the enviroment problem and they usually take the metro or the bus to move from one place to another . i would advise the citizen to avoid the car if they do n't really need it . it is a pity that we are damaging our planet due to our selfishness and carelessness . i wish the car in use would be fewer in twenty year but i think this is a marvellous uthopy . i will look forward to seeing the road without car .
