as far a i am concered , a people , need not to say , should specialize in certain subject for the sake of having living metold , however , i still take it for granted that people should have broad knowledge of many aspect . this will not only make a person more knowlegeable and wiser , but also make the person 's life happier and more colorful . first and foremost , people will lead a more confortable and convenient life on condition that they have the knowledge of lot of different area . for example , the people who ha a basic knowledge of music , under certain circumstance such a pressure or saddness , will more likely to smooth their bad emotion eaiser than those people who do not ] : the people who are capable of playing some music instrument will tend to release themselves in playing some music work , which are entertaining and delightful , and few people will deny the efficiency of this kind of therapy . to sum up , wide knowlege will give u more way to deal with some emotional problem . what is also worth noticing is that a person with lot of different knowledge tend to be much wiser than those who are constantly enclosed in a certain area . for instance , a people with a wider range of knowledge will have a strong ability to analyse the problem which bother them in everyday life if they have the concept of critical reasoning . this skill obviously will work wonder when people are contronted with a delimma , which force them to make a choice , especially when it turn out to be relevant to a major event in one 's life . consequently , a well-around person is seemingly more well-equiped for huge change which are always accompanied u in every walk of life . finally , though people ought to be brilliant at some specific subject in one 's life , which is also of great importance to succeed in life , to be a person ha the capacity of knowing lot of thing also help people a lot . if we are well-around person it is obvious that we will enjoy our life with ease and simutaneously stand more chance to succeed in future .
