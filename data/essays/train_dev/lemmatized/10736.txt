i disagree with the statement . for me , being successful ha very little to do with the amount of material thing one ha accumulated . to be successful , one ha to be happy . the two thing go together . one might say it is possible to achieve both thing , but i thing for that one would have to dedicate most of his or her time for that purpose . to try new thing and take risk rather than doing what one already know how to do well , time will pas one by . therewill be no time to enjoy the success . success is doing what one love , doing it well , make agood living out of it while enjoying the rest of the time with the person you love . what will being loaded with material thing if you do n't have time to supervise your child school progress / definitely , i would rather be very good in what i do , do it well , make a good living from it and enjoy life afterward with family , friend , loved one instead of trying new thing over and over again ,
