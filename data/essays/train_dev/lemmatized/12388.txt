i do not agree with the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' while having a knowledge of many discipline may increase a person 's know how a great deal , it doe not make him an expert in any of these field . one might spend so much time learning and yet be able to acquire limited information in each of the subject that he studied . for example , if i study zoology during my graduation , and then go for a double major in international business and geology . i would know a little about each subject but not enough for me to become an expert . i would be confused in selecting a subject for further study a i would wonder if i know more about international business or about geology . the proverb `` jack of all trade but master of none '' summarises this situation very aptly . on the other hand devoting all of one 's time to studying one subject will give a person enough knowledge to make him an expert . one will thus understand the subject better and be in a better position to apply his knowledge practically . giving a similar example , if i choose zoology during both my graduation and post graduation , i will have learnt more about the subject a well it various branch like fishery and ethology that may not be not covered in the graduate course . after knowing so much i can do a phd in the same field and that might give me a chance in the future to become a subject expert in the form of either a research scholar or lecturer whose opinion is held highly and who know a great deal about his subject . therefore , i prefer studying one discipline in order for me to have more knowledge and insight into my subect of choice , better opportunity for further study such a phd and eventually better career option . after all , an institution would prefer an expert to be a part of their team rather than someone who knew a little bit .
