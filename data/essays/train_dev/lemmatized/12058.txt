you can not know everything , that is a fact . but should we try to get a widely spread knowledge of many different topic rather than be a specialist in only one certain subject . in the end it depends on which solution is the best match with your personality . i am a medical student and i spend really a lot of time studiing but there are so much thing to know about medicine that i can only learn a small part with my limited brain capacity . hence , i try to be at least a specialist in a certain area with determined outline because a doktor who knews a little bit of evertything but nothing exactly is absolutely redundant . so in order to get a job i am inevitably forced to concentrate on a few certain topic . by contrast , i think that beyond the job , it is very important to have a widely spread knowledge of lot of different thing . an urbane person should know many different thing about other culture , history and literature , because in that time we are living in so much information and knowledge is offered to everyone . specializing would be insular in my opinion . as far a the knowledge beyond the job is concerned it doe not make sense to try to know everything about one topic , because if you have a broad knowledge you have many topic to talk about with other people . for instance , i will try to teach my child thing about world history a well a different language so that they know a little bit of everything and can deepen their knowledge of these subject they are most interested in single handed . in conclusion , i propose to specialize whenever it is neccessary , for the job for example a i already mentioned . beyond the job i prefer a broad knowledge of many different thing , but that is a matter of personality . ..
