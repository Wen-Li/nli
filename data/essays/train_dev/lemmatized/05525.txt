the question of take risk and try new thing rather than continue his habit , is a very important question to ask himself in order to know what kind of life we want to live . in my opinion , take risk and try new thing is the best choice for many reason . first , if you try to do new thing , you can discover new product or find new idea . and this is the best way to succeed if you want to succeed because if you do something that someone have ever done , the copy will be le good than the original . for example , the richest people in the world are often someomes who invent something and thus who took risk before . secondly , the life is more interesting and really amazing when you take risk . in fact , you never know what will happen . therefore you ca n't worry . furthermore , i think that people are more interested to speak with you if you can tell them about a new and original subject . thirdly , if you take risk , you can do something different of others activity . and that 's more exciting . furthermore , how to succeed if you try nothing and if you just follow the others . indeed someome who succeed is someome who work a lot and who do what he want to do . for that , it 's important to take risk . to conclude , i 'm sure that if you want to be a successfull people , you had to take risk and wa n't be affraid to do new thing . furthermore life is more interesting if you do n't what you will do next day , week or month .
