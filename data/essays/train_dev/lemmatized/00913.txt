i disaggree with this staement . in my opinion both , understanding idea and concept and studying fact , are important . understanding idea and concept are very important for student because if they just learn fact they would n't understand them when it come to more detailed topic . for example studying foreign language at school . students can practise their vocabulary and the grammar just by learning them in their mind ( the fact and rule ) but it doe n't help them when they need to read or actually speak in that language . there you need idea or concept which the teacher can give you to learn that language more easily . moreover student need to study praxis . with fact they can not learn them . at this point you need concept and idea . for example in a math class . the teacher can teach you some fact and rule about a specific topic but without his or her idea student are not able to understand that topic . they need to practice the topic by themselves to make sure that they actually understood the sheme of the topic . on the other hand it is also important to study some fact . the subject history could n't be taught without fact . students need to study special date , for example about the world war , to understand the timeframe and to get a feeling of the past . furthermore i think that you usually need to get some fact first before you can start to get some idea or concept . the best example at this point is again the mathslesson . you need to read some fact or proof first before you can get into the topic . in my mathlessons we usually had to read first a page with fact and example before our teacher explained everything a little bit more detailed . all in all i am of the opinion that student need to understand idea and concept on the one hand and on the other hand i believe that it is important a well that they study some fact .
