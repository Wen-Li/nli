there is no consensus among people a to the arguement that it is good for a group to travel led by a guide. with an increasing number of people claim that it ha lot of disadvantage , some people mor e sensible tend to consider the nature that traveling with a guide is amazing . and the latter point coincides with mine for my reason below : firstly , we never remain suspicious of the point that traving with a tour guide ha an extremely affect on the mood of the memebers of the group . for instance , statistic indicate that 70 percentage of people who ha the experence of traveling with a guide will have a good mood . another example , i often travel with my parent and we always travel with a guide . because of the professional knowleges the guide obtained , he can arrange our activity schedule , and we should not worry any thing , what we should do is just watching and engoy the chaming view passing by . so easy is the travel , we never feel tirde because we can focus our mood on the beatuty of view . so the trip become happy and easy without a thinking that where we should to go to , and where is the most famous place because we can obtain totally from the mouth of the guide . it is so cool . and the group member will have more time chating with each other . furthermore , it is no exaggerating to say that traveling with a guide ha huge influence not just on the mood we have , but on our money a well . for example , without a guide we are likely to buy some thing unuseful but attracting at that moment . however if a tour guide accompanies with your group , it will not be a matter . once our family went to qingdao which is a charming seashore town with chaming view that the seabirs are sing with sunshine . so we are attracted by it . when a men sell some sea food , we accept because at that moment we forget anything but the amazing view . at that time the guide stop u because he think the price of the seafood is too high . with his advice , we are awake . thus , thanks to his help . we save lot of many to buy something useful . therefore , traveling with guide ha lot of benefit that can infulence u fanancially . a we have discussed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that traveling with a guide not only can help u obtain a good mood but can save our money a well . therefore , it is highly time that we should raise the public awareness of the significance of the guide , . just in this way can we get a wonderful journey with other group member .
