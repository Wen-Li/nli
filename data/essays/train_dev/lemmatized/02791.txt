it is known that several product do n't fulfil all the requirement , which have been presented by saling of these product . therefore , i agree with the idea that the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . however , i can understand the reason because these product have been produced and saled on that way . the economical system of the most country in the world is the capitalism . in this system people have to earn their own money by buying product or by doing an activity or work . that mean there must be some people to sale product and other one to buy them . if nobody buy a particullary thing , the market will stop producing that object . the production of that thing would be wasting money . indeed , the best way to make money must be found . because of this , the trade of product became important and the market could be invented . its development help the politico-economical situation of each country . on the one hand , there must be the posibility to buy necesary product like food and clothes . offering the necesary product with acceptable price , the market give facility to get these product in accesible place ( e.g. food store ) . on the other hand , it is not possible that every store sale similar product . therefore , the market try to discover new product which have to get necesary in the new society . this open the posibility to create new article and activity . altrough the human society is changing and new product are being invented , people do n't buy all the product , because they are n't convinced of the quality . perhaps they do n't realize the advantage of having that new product . therefore , advertisement have to present the product on way that convice the person to buy them . i can understand this situation in the market and i think that this way is sometimes necesary to keep the economical situation of a country stable .
