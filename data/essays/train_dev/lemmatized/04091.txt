there are to much product in the world . so it is imporsible to count them . although some product are used in the same way , they made by different company than they will look different . i strongly agree with most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , i have some exprience of my own . for example , one day i wa shopping with my mother . then we see there is a mp3 player it look very cool . of course , i will ask my mother to buy it for me . than my mother said it just look cool , it not useful than you think my son . but i still not give up , i said we can ask the seller the mp3 is good or not . of course you will get the answer - the player is good to use . than i get the mp3 . after i used it 3 day , it does't work any more . i told my mother than she said am i right ? why do n't you believe me that time . so , if do n't want to buy some just look good ? we can get some information form your friend whose have a product you want to buy . because your firend ha used the product for many time than he/she konws it is good not not . and if you do n't ha some friend have some product you want to buy . you can buy the product by some famous company , like sony , microsoft and any others company . because they famous , that mean they make good product . so , buy thing do not just look they are face . ask help for the seller it is good or not is also not a good way . we can ask the seller some information from it . but do not ask good or nor
