in my point of view , young teenager and even young adult do not offer the potential they have in service of their community . a lot more could be done by these youngster to improve the living enviornment that they occupy . for example volunteering at nursery home and participating in group concerned with the protection of the enviornemtn from pollution and other harmful factor is some of that could be for the community . even the smplest of cotributions could make the biggest of difference . i f each individual take responsibleity for their part of the job , an amazing difference will immediately arouse . the change doe n't have to be made regarding a really important aspect in the community a someone shoould always take care of the simplest thing first and then move up the ladder . however , a nobody participates even in the simplest of activity , the change that need to be done will only accumulate over time resulting in harm for the community . to engage one 's self in a variety of useful activity will benefit the community in two way , both directly and indirectly . directly is to contribute the effort in service needed at the community . moreover , to be personally active most of the time , an individual learns to be productinve and useful with the time that they have . in return these activity actually teach these youngster time mamgement and productivity . this in istelf greatly benfits the community a these youngster will be the future adult with great skill that could be helpful and useful to their community . these activity teach important working skill that the community is need of in an indirect manner . in conclusion , once again i believe that young people these day do n't give enough time helping their cmmunities . however , if this is done great resuls will emerge .
