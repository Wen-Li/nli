conventional wisdom ha it that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they are healthier and they did n't have to many sad experience yet . i think that it is ironic since most of people want to live longer . but it is also true that everybody want to look younger . first of all i think that old disabled person who live with an amount of pill can not really enjoy their life . but older person like my parent who are between forty and fifty year old can enjoy life more than young people . it can be put down to the fact that they know they have le time than previously . teenagers often consider high school period a the worst period of their entire life . in fact their body and their mentality change and they often suffer from these change . they often contest the authority of their parent or their professor . this is the expression of an unease . on the contrary to teenager , adult have had the time to accept themselves and this is crucial to enjoy life . children do n't want to become adult because they are reluctant to have too many responsabilities . they are not aware of the violence and of the other problem that one could encounter , if they are to protected by their parent . parents think that their child are happier thanks their protection but on the contrary , child will be more disappointed when they will discover how harsh the life can be . when one look in the past , one often think '' i wa so dumb '' . i do n't regret this period of my life because i wa ignorant and i do n't want to balk now . i want to go on and make new experience . life is a surprise at almost any age and this is why one can always enjoy life .
