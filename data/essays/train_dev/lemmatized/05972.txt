how old do you have to be to be considerated a a young people . .. ? as an old people . .. ? i do thing that it is more a question of state of mind than a question of age . you could be older than me and live so much more deeply your own life than me , you could be so much more in the present time ! everybody is able to enjoy his life whatever his age . but i agree with the fact that most of the time it is easyer for young people to appreciat life for lot of reason . let see these reason in two point , or more specificaly by analysing both side : the '' young '' and then the '' old '' . it is true that the older you are the more your health get bad too . .. a a student with a good health i do n't really think about the sickness . everyboby know that the childhood is the best time in a life . you have no pressur , no soucies . it is the time of innocence . i have never met a child who speaks about death ! they think more at how to spend all the energy they have ! on the other side i have to say that older people have experience , the knowledge . they have learned about live , they know what they want , what they expect in live . usually they are able to do what they like because most of old people have worked for year and year and are retired now . and right now , in our society , old retired person have more money to spend and so much more time than people who are still working . that is true a long a they are in a good health . as a conclusion i would like to say that you need to feel good to enjoy your life , everything is in your head . so many people are young but already old in their head . enjoy your life !!
