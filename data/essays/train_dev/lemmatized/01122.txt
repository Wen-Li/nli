i believe that understanding the idea and concept is more significant than learning fact for student . there are two reason which make me think like that . first , when the student try to understand the main idea of a particular subject , it is easier for the student to examine what is really meant . by this way , the student gain the opportunity to think and critisize the concept of the subject . when the student ha the ability to critisize , the student may draw new conclusion for that subject , i mean the student may have a different point of view , and discus it advantage and drawback with his classmate and professor . this really help to improve the thinking skill of the student and very useful for further research such a attending a graduate program after the school , if he intends to . second , a we know the human brain is open for new idea , memorizing what is told in the class would not be helpful to the student for his upcoming class . because when you just memorize the fact without knowing it cause for a specific time period , for instance memorizing classnotes before the exam , it is inevitable to forget all of it after a meanwhile . to conclude , i think learning the reason for a certain subject is for the student 's own good to understand a specific subject clearly .
