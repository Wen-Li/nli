i disagree with the statement according to which there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today . as this statement is however supported by strong argument , i will firstly name them before indicating why i disagree . it is nowadays wellknown that car cause heavy pollution which damage the environment a well a the human health . in particular the co2 rejected by car destroy the ozon . in some city of the world the air is nearly not breathable any more and the citizen of such city face , for instance , heavy asthma problem . therefore city all around the world try to set up car free zone and to improve the quality of the public transportation . in addition , petrolium ressources are becoming rarer every day which lead to increasing petrolium price for consummers . all these reason may lead people not to buy car in the comming year and eventually lead to a decrease of the number of car in use . one should however consider that a technology develops every day , petrolium may soon not be needed anymore to move car . electricity is more and more commonly used to make car move . main car constructor like mercedes are nowadays building such electric car with a large autonomy . this new generation of car is quite cheap which will even permit people who did not own a car before to buy one . electricity also solves the pollution related problem and may therefore encourage people to buy car . another reason why the number of car will not decrease in the twenty next year is that car allow people to be much more flexible and autonomious than plane or train do . some place in the world can simply not be reached without car . in addition , driving is a passion for many people . this lead to the final argument against the statement : it is difficult to change people 's mind and habit and it will definetely take more then twenty year to stop people considering car a part of our culture .
