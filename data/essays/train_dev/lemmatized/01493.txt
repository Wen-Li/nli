i think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . this is so because of many reason . to start with , i think that fact origenate ( come originally ) from idea and concept . this can be clearly shown in the physic field , for example . when a person want to prove something for somebody , through an expirement , he ha to build his whole expirement on one or more idea or concept and then go on with the expirement to prove a specific fact . from this point we can understand that idea and concept are more important than fact . moreover , through focusing on idea and concept the , student will develop a self thinking method based on reasoning . this is basically done by school and university . when these institution are focusing on developing and improving the student 's ability to learn new fact and concept , it is growing and feeding the student 's imagination to think in a different angle of view and thus discovering nem thing . but on the other hand , when school and university are just ( spoon feeding ) the student with ready made fact they are killing the imagination part of his thinking . after that the student will grow up and continue in his education just depending on ready fact which are in his text book .
