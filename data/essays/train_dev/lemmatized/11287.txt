usually , long ago people do not use the car a people use it now . nowadays we can not live without using the car . lot of people use the car to work , to go shopping and so forth . .. there are several advantage and disadvanteges of using the car . day by day price of the petrol are going up and there is a luck of this energy source . many governaments and investor are trying to develop alternative energy in order to improve the quality of car using those energy and they are trying to promote the use of the public transport and other vehicle . on the one hand , we have those who think that in twenty year there will be more car than now , because it is the faster and the more individual way to travel . they believe that there will be alternative source in order to satisfy the luck of petrol , but they also argue that there will be a big demand of high technology car . on the other hand , we have those who believe that in twenty year there will be a great decrease of car due to people will be concerned about the enviorement and the pollution . governaments will make the public transport cheaper and there will be many new user of this kind of transport . maybe there will be a discover of a way of transport cheaper and faster than car and that can be used whenever and whenever one want . on the whole , although both opinion can be argued strongly , i really believe that in twenty year there will not be fewer car in use than now . in fact , i think that there may be more car than now , because the world is growing so fast and most people preffer car than any other way of transport .
