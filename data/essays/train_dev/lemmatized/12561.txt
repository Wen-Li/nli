many of the greatest discovery like america and everest were made by men who werent afraid to explore uncharted territory . who werent afraid to lose what they already got even their life in order to achive their goal . to create something new and something with a greater value you have to stop doing what others are doing and search for a better way of doing it . you have to invent your solution take the risk which scare away all the others . i imagine people thought edison wa not bright at all untill he find the light bulb . many successful people tend to pursue their goal no matter how risky they are and how irrational they seem to others . sticking on what is known to be right way of thing will not achive you to the better . you will do your job but you wont have the chance to know of a better way . walking on the path of others will only get you where others were . while this may be sufficient for some i think there is a reason for all of u and it up to u to find it . we have the chance to make our life better and we have to pursue it no matter what .
