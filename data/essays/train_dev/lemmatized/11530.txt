students have their own way of learning and understanding , but not all have the same way of doing it . some people think that it is more important to understand the fact . others may think that undestanding idea and concept is a better way of learning ; for me , it is better to undestand idea and concept . many student say that learning fact is muh better because of many reason . firstly because you are having more detail about a topic , by this they say that you are learning more . also they say that by having more detail , tey are going to have more information in their mind and probably better mark . finally , they think that they are better , but the question is : are you really learning all those detail ? people only learn it if they really like the topic , otherwise , they learn it for some more knoledge that in the end may be gone . by the other hand , there are student that think that understanding idea and concept is much better for undestanding a topic . commonly it is much easier for them to have the idea of what they have learn . another reason why they use to only undestand the idea and concept is because you probably learn for your hole life , for example thing that now may no exist more or history that it is essential important for pesonal knowledge . as a last reason , is that even though you do not have learn all the topic you are certain that you have learn something . for me , it is better to understand the idea and the concept because you really learn from it . i think that because of the reason given in the last paragraph . something i always said wa : why are we learning so much fact if in the end we are going to use probably only the 10 % of it ? you tell me .
