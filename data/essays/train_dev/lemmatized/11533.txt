while many adult agree this statement , i disagree with this statement . i am a teenager , so i can see both side of viiws . it seems enjoyable for older people since they have got knowledge in their life . there are two detail example which i think enjoyable . first of all , older people do not have to be care about anything what they do by anyone else , because it is his or her own responsibility . for example , i have to go home at certain time , otherwise my mother worry me , and get angry . that is stressful for me . i want to hang out late with my friend , but my mother doe not allow to do it . i can not wait to be an adult , and go to downtown at night . at the time , i will appliciate my mother 's kindness . second reason is that i suppose that older people can see life more seriously than young people . i can not think the time when i marry , have child , and die , because i feel that those event will happen in an ahead time . however , older people have enough idea toward those event , for their friend had already experienced and talked to them . it would be fun to see near future with such a big event . in conclusion , older people can enjoy life more than youngre people , unless they have enough responsibility , and knowledge . younger people can not have resposibilities for their acting . furthermore , it is difficult to enjoy life without obvious knowledge such a story from peer . therefore , i disagree with this statement .
