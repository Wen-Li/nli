in my opinion , the car and other vehicle used for transportation have a central position in our modern society . the use of car will therefore not decrease but even grow in the future . to ensure that development being sustainable we have to make great effort in science and technology . first of all , i am convinced that transport in general is the heart of our modern world economy . the globalisation of our world ha only been possible because of a broad and intensive use of car , truck , ship and other vehicle . within this process the structure of our modern economy got more and more focused on cheap transport and mobility . second , car a an important part of the people 's daily life in every modern society . we use car to travel , to work , to go shopping and even to compete against each other ( e.g. in motocar race ) . beside that , it is an important status symbol for many upper and middle class people . in my opinion , the importance and therefore the demand for car will increase substantially on a worldwide scale - especially in developing country a china or india where the new emerging middle class is heading for private car . but there are also problem with a possibly growing number of car around the world : first of all , the exhaust fume and production process will cause a lot of environmental damage . the second problem that arises is the question how all those car and vehicle can be fueled . the worldwide quest for petroleum and oil , from which gas for car is made of , is growing higher and higher . to challenge those two problem , scientist and car producer have to concentrate on doing research to find alternative to the current car concept . there are promising idea and experiment , but still no revolutionary new concept to assure a sustainable use of transportation vehicle in the future . finding those alternative is absolutely necessary to further enjoy the benefit the car brings to different society and economy around the world .
