i disagree the opinion `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . '' i think the best way to travel is alone and to plan myself . trip is not only during traveling anwhere but also during planning for trip . where is the best place i want to go ? where will i stay ? where will i eat for lunch and dinner ? i think we will be happy before trip by planning about it . i have joined tour once . but tour is n't fun for me . i have two reason . first , i had to care about time always . tour guide said , `` until this time ! until this time !! '' i could n't see the place i wanted to see the most . and i could n't go to see soon when i found something funny . this summer i traveled to kyoto alone . that trip wa very wondeful !! i could go where i wanted to go and eat what i wanted to eat . the most wondeful thing is i could change the plan soon . when i found some shop , temple and road , i could go there . this is god for me . so i think the best way to travel is alone and to plan myself .
