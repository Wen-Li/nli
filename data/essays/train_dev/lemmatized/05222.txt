in many situation , a human being , people are often caged or trapped in a knowledge-cage and only some exception will occour once in a while . not saying that knowing alot is a bad idea but , specializing in a perticular area is the step of leaving your name in a history book . the depth of which a perticular area of knowledge is explored is far more beneifitual than having a broad knowledge of every academic subject . therefore , i strongly disagree with the statement , since that only guide you more into a --- normal person . from not only historical evidence but also personal experience , specialized in a certain area of knowledge would surely make you speical from all the rest , not only so , it is the best way of leading to sucess in future life . to begin with , a famous biologist english plant scientist ha made the most remarkable achievement to the area of biology . but , when you ask what he differs from the rest of the biologist scientist ? is becuase of his consistancy and specialized work in the observation of pea plant ; he studied the same plant for over 20 year and thus , finally he got a nobel prize for he achieverments . not only , he will be remembered but his work of investment and achievement to the ground of genetic coding will also do great benefit to the rest of the society . further more , a famous french wirter called `` silva plyth '' is famous for the poem that she wrote , the sadness and emotion through her poem ; by reading her poem , emotion and a sense of sadness would soon arise . she is not any different from any other poet but , only one aspect which is different would make her so famous , is the fact that her us of metaphor and the description of surroundings is known to be so percise and carry a sense of shady cloud through reading her work . this , made her work still popular and is now what many modern poet are looking to achieve and trying to copy her style . lastly , not only people that are in the academic area are famous but also , one of the most famous person which most people would know is , `` the great michael jordan '' he is known for his basketball skill . howeevr , many do not know that even though he may seem to be the best basketball player in that time , it wa once said by his college professor and his college coach that , `` it seem like basketball and michael ha a strong bond , he seem to only know how to play good basketball '' and sure , the world ha prove him right , he had won himself billion and billion of dollors and fame , just simply by doing playing good basketball . in conclusion , from these example , we can clearly see that be spcializing in a specic area would not only make one famous but also , it would sure leave one name in the history book . by this , i strongly disagree with the p
