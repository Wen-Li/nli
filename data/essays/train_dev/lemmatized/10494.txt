the statement is about successful people ane their attitude in taking risk . i agree whit this statement , i think is true that people who have already reached a succesful place in society doe n't take risk if they 're not sure of their success . why they act like this ? maybe they do n't want to look silly at the eye of people that are looking at them . if a man is kown a a genius in math for example , why should he try to write a sentimental poetry or sing in a broadway musical ? he 's quite sure that this is going to be a disaster . i think that that 's the principal reason why successful people do n't even try do something that is far away from their speciality or that is not really something that they already know . people usually do n't want to try anything new if they 're happy with i thik that i 'll do the same thing if i were in them . i actually think that everbody would do that . it 's natural . i think that only people that have nothing to lose would take the risk in doing something new . if you 're a well-known person and you fail in do something you may gonna lose your face , and nobody want to lose his face . but i have to say something else . i believe that the world really need people , even few person , who are ready to take risk , also big risk , because if nobody take risk nothing can change and every big discover that accurred in the last century ha been generated by someone who took a really big risk . and at the end , if you take a risk and you success in that , you surely will become a successful person with all the merit , and maybe also the award , you merit . all the success are paied back .
