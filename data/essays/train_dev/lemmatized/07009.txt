the various educational system all over the world permit student to specialize more or le late . that lead to a tricky issue : is it better to specialize early in the study or later ? i disagree with people who think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize . it is true that it is necessary to have knowledge in several topic before specializing . for instance , child have to learn about geography , history , biology , math . .. this permit tu realize what we like to study and what we would like to do to work . but , i am convinced that in order to be efficient in the work , we have to know specific thing in one specific area . for instance , i made an internship in a hospital last year in the area of finance . so a to understand the reason why some medicine have been bought more that year , i had to ask to nursery . the latter knew the use of these medicine . but on the contrary i knew about budget and accountancy . so , a it is impossible to learn about everything , we have tu specialize in one field . and , in the company , working with the cooperation of the other member of the staff is necessary to work with efficiency . nevertheless , specializing in one subject do nor prevent u from being interested in other subject . but it is uneccessary to have a high level of knowledge in these field , it can be just for leisure . besides , having broad knowledge of many academic subject contains a risk . as a matter of fact , i tend to think that it prevents u from having a high level of knowledge in all these area . consequently , we would be le good at our work . so , i bare in mind that it is better to specialize in one subject rather than in many subject .
