although older people can enjoy life , i definitely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people can enjoy eating , travering , and be health . first , young people can eat and drink a lot because they are young . for example , when young people want to eat some great dish , they can eat all of them . they can satisfy with the experience that they eat a lot . however , usually , older people can not eat a lot of food because they become full soon or they do not want to eat a lot . not only can young people enjoy eating , but also they can enjoy travering . if the person who is young wanted to go to somewhere , the person could go there soon . the person doe not need a lot of preparation for the trip . however , if the person who is old wanted to go to trip , the person would need a lot of time to prepare the trip . so , young people are very flexible and agressive . these aspect are very important with young people , however , healty is the most important part of young people . older people are suffered from a lot of illness . they catch a cold easily , become tired soon , and need a lot of time for their rest . also , they can not play hard sport . however , young people are healty and very agressive . they can play hard sport like baseball , soccur , swimming and so on . young people recover from illness soon . in conclusion , young people enjoy life more than older people do . they can enjoy eating , travering , and be health . young people can do anything that they want to .
