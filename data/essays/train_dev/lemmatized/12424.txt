in this would , a lot of thing we can be successful people and try anything we want . i think people who successful by popular for example those are artist and musician , governer and comedian need to do new thing to succes in that way . because people thinking are always moving and they do not trast same thing a long . people need to get new thing to be good way at now . so i agree to the idea `` successful people try new thing and take risk . '' in japan , there were comedian whose name is `` dandy sakano '' be famous in tv by his new thing . he ha fun thing it called `` get ! '' that he did new thing . that is thing just take pose and say `` get '' but it is flash for japanese comedian would . so most of japanese have seen him least one time at day when he wa famous . but few month later he desapper from tv . most of people forget him because he did not creat new thing and just do same thing . people get fun for more new comedian whose name is `` oriental radio '' . then they keeping new thing for people so they are famouse at now too . this is one of reason successful people try new thing . second example that show successful people try new thing and take risk are japanese famous buisnessman `` horiemon '' who are made `` livedore '' company . he create new buisness in internet that is servis for all of the people can talk and chat and get news from internet page . he became success by this work . so people need new thing .
