i agree with the statement that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . it is in the interest of advertiser to show their product in a better way . i believe that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are because they are trying to sell u a product that we do not really need . therefore , advertiser use beautiful people in their commercial to convince u that by buying their product we can look just like them . for example , it is common to see on tv an anti-wrinkle cream commercial with a beautiful model that did not have wrinkle to start of . most advertisement try to make u feel better for buying their product . therefore , advertiser present the producs they are trying to sell in a better presentation than the one their product originally have . for example , we ussualy see food comercials were the product look much better and tastier than it really is . we actually get disapointed once we try that product . advertisement agency are private business that have to generate profit for their shareholder . as a result , advertiser will use every possible scheme to trick u into buying their product . i believe that commercial and other advertisement should be viewed with a critical eye . it is in the best interest of advertiser to make u beleive that their product are much better than they really are . as a result , advertiser use model and paid actor to convince u into buing their product . advertisments make their product seem much better than they really are in order for u to buy them . advertisment agency are business that look out for their own interest , and that will use almost every mean to achieve these interest .
