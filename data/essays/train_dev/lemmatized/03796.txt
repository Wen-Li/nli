do youing people enjoy more than older epole , that is a very diffivult question , taking in accoubt that most peole would think that young people might have more fun than older peole , just because they think that they are healthier , faster , stronger , a my mom used to tell me , teenager think they are suoperman , they take risk that older peole normally wouldnt takem , thety stay up all nioght , go to party , drive fast carsm , and maybe even do illegal drug , but that doe not mean that young people ha more fun , i once read a very good book `` tuesdays with morrie '' . it a book about life , it show the experience of a young man , interacting with an elder , the elder ha gone through various experience , and the youngster want to learn from thoe sxperiences , and eventually , the teacher tell him one thing , `` you first need to learn how to die , thenm you can learn how to live ... '' that tell the student that he ha to absorb all that he canm from his experience , and then let go of some of his emotion and then , he can know how it feel to taste succes , or love , and even pride . morrie , who is the teacher on the book tell the main caharcter that once you know how if feel how to die , yopu know how to live because you learn how to enjoy life even more . the point i am trying to make is that older people know how to take more and more from each new experience , and they probably enjoy life even more , although there are a few exception , some young people are evry mature and find a way to have fun even in the worst cituatuions , like people that dont have a many economic resource , they learn how to take advantage from the few oportunities they have to go out , or party a we say nowadays . i honestly think that older people have mopre fun , because they have learned how to enjoy life , and young people are just living at a hundred mile an hour , trying to do too many thing to have fun , and not getting a lot out of the experinces that they6 go through in their daily life .
