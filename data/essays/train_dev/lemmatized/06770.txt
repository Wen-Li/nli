at the moment their are just enouth car on the street . the street are overfilled and it is more and more difficult to find a parking place , esspacially then you are in trouble . the city are poluted by the car and the air becomes more and more dirty with every day . furthermore it becomes more difficult to pay the car and petrol . the `` hobby car '' , is like a very expensive hobby and in future only rich people will have the comfort to use them . as a conclusion , the costumer will look around for new product which are more atractive and the provider ( the car-producer ) have to react quickly , if they want to servive on the world market . the big car producer like bmw , mercedes , porsche , chrisler , ford or peugeot must change their production and their product . when their are no costumer for the car , they have to change the product and built new vehicle with other engins . the car provider have to creat a new , clear , modern and cheap vehicle which is run by gas , electricity or oil . so the image of the `` powerfull '' and fast vehicle with many p will change . ( additonally , metal get more and more expensive on the world market . this is why car-producer have to look around for new and cheper way to bild a car . ) another fact is , that their is no more place for street , petrol station or highway . the population is growing rapidly , and their are other vehicle , which do not need so much place and can transport much more people in a shorter time from a to b like a car . ( the new transrapid for example is over 450 kh/h fast , de n't need petrol and is also quieter than a highway with it car . ) so , in my opinion many thing will change over the next few year . their will be a big number of new , quieter and clear vehicle . petrol will be still very important in industie , but car will have other typs of motor / engine .
