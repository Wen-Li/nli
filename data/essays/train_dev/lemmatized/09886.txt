advertising in modern century is widely using in all medium , such a television , radio , newspaper , internet . in some case is the only way to make money for the owner of medium . the most time in a tv show in dedicated to advertise product than should help you in choosing among product . but not all product we see in tv or listent to the radio seems to be what they really are . for example , to product something you had to research the problem you want to satisfy , the way you want to proceed , make it physically and then let the people know what are you selling . but in some case i think that advertising show to the public what they want , not what the product do effetively . in most of case there are better product than this but , because le budget of advertising , they could n't be advertised . this kind of product generally cost le than the first one , because it do n't pay advertising . for an example , mp3 player most advertised costly effectively more than the anonymous one at even quality . the cost is a great part in a product 's choose . i think people ar't stupid . if the product is n't of enougth quality , people can see at the first time , and they can do bad advertising to friend and other people . the better way to advertise-at first time-is the opinion that people have about it .
