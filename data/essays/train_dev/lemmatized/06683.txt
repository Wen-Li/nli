some people think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject while others think it is better to focus on one specific subject . i do think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject for two different reason . first , student who study more than one academic subject are able to understand better the world around them . they will have a more open minded view . they will be able to talk with different type of people . however , it is important to notice that it is sometimes very hard to study two very different subject at the same time . in addition , you are sometimes prevented by your college to pick up two subject . it is why i do think that the idea of broad curriculum introduced in some university is a very good one . last year , i studied law and wa granted the right to pick up one subject of business . it wa definitely a good thing because my business class helped me to underdand my commercial law class . second , in a lot of job nowadays , you need more than one qualification . for instance , one of my friend studied enginering and business at school . he is now the head of the selling division of an electric company thanks to his double diploma . as far a my concerned , i work part time in a property developer company . this type of company is a perfect example of a job where you need the knowlege of many academic subject such a enginering , business and law . you are faced with the writting of contract ( law ) , the financing of operation ( business ) and sometimes a lot of problem related to the plan or the construction of the building . to conclude , it is very important to have a broad knowledge of many acaedmic subject because of the different type of problem we will have to face .
