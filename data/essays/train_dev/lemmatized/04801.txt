in our world in the school they give some topic to studennts and they tell them to learn these . the student do npot care about idea and concept in it and they just learn what they gave . i think it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . firstly , at a school there are two kind of student . the teacher give them a topic to learn . one of them look at the topic a a fact which he should quicly learn ' the other look at the topic more detailed . he think about the idea and concept and this make him to learn easier . secondly , if a student make some guess on the topic or search for it it make him to learn easier . after doing this student learns every detail about the topic and after that it is very hard to forget it . thirdly , the education system is very important . for example in our country the system is very bad . we have a oss system after the highschool we attend this exam and if we win we should go to university . this system make u to think not detailed . so we do not care about the idea and concept because we should learn everything immediately a a fact . the reason are not important for u because we shoul win the race . lastly learning thins a a fact not understanding it make u to think more small . because we do not know anything else except the topic . we can not think bigger because we do not know how to think we just read and learn like a robocope . the other thing are not important for u . to sum up , i think it should be more important for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact if they really want to be a high person .
