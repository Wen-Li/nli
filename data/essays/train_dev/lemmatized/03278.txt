i disagree with the steatement because , in my opinion , it is better have a lot of knowledge about one specific subject , that to know only a little of many academic topic . on the one hand , even though a lot of person can think that having information about a variety of subject could make a professor or a student to have a better backwround in his or her professional formation , on the other hand , i consider it is negative not to have a deep knowledge of one main area . is always better to understand perfectly one thing than to have a small idea of many thing . thereby , to have a large knowledge in one single academic subject have practical application because , it will be easier for that person to trasmit well consolidated information to others . moreover , some specific point of the academic life , according to my opinion , can only be achieved with a huge knowledge of one topic . for instance , to make a research in one area , it will be necesary to count with a lot of information in that subject . however , to have an idea of several topic will be useless to develope deepely enough the investigation accuratelly . furthermore , to understand perfectly one single subgect could have potentially a large economic benefit , for in some circunstances , diferent company and industry need person with specific knowledge about one area to solve a punctual problem . in conclusion , i believe that to focus oneself in studing deeply a single subject instead of studing a large number of academic area will bring always more possitive result .
