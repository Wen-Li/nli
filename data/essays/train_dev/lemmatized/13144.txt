nowadays , there are numerous debate about the issue whether or not people success by trying new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . some people hold the opinion that it is true that people can only sucess by doing new thing . however , in my opinion , i disagree with the statement because successful people can success by doing the same thing they already know how to do well . first of all , the crucial reason in holding my opnion is that when people do thing that they already know they do not have to worry about the risk that follow after they do it . for instance , my father is an owner of a supermarket . he ha run the business for ten year , and when we moved to canada he is still thinking of opening a new supermarket here . by doing this , he doe not have to worry about how to manage the business or how to improve the business because he already ha the experience of how to run it . another example could be when a person want to switch to another job such a being a doctor , chance are that she will not be successful being a doctor . thus , you do not have to worry about what will happen next if you continue to do thing that you already know . furthermore , another reason in holding my opinion is that by doing thing that you already know will help you not to make mistake . for example , my mother is working a an accountant and when she met her friend veronica , who work in the stock , she encourage her to invest her money in the stock because she say that it will double or even triple her money . as my mother doe not know anything about investment , she trusted veronica because she think that she will never betray her , and invest all her money in the stock market . as a result , the stock market went down and she loss all her money . this is a clear example on how people can make mistake when they do not know about the subject , and thus be unsuccessful . all in all , i think that people will be more successful by doing what they already know instead of trying new thing and take risk , because they do not have to worry about what will happen to them and also it will help them not to make mistake . therefore , for these reason i would say that risk taker are not a successful a people who do thing that they already know how to do .
