i think that this sentence is true that is why i totaly agree with it . i think that successful people are successful because they do n't wait for the succes to come to them , they go forward to it . life is not easy that is why you have to be audacious . to be successful you need to be different form the other people , if you have the thing that make the difference then you will be different . soemone succesful like to take risk so they can be the first and before successful , when you are successful you need to be at the state of the art wich mean that you have to be at the top if if want to saty there . if you keep on doing sometghing that you are goood at it , it 's great you can keep doing but in long term , so ; eone zill take your place. ; king effort because the zorld is not nice out there i think that people can be jalous and that they zill try to take your place . i also think that someone successful is someone who belive in what is doe . it 's one of the most importante thing in the worl . you need to be confident and belive in you . because if u do n't believe in what you say nobady will . so to conclued , i think that succesfukl take risk and try new thing because they zant to shoz the ; self to pepole and i think that they like zhen people copy them , that is why they have to be innovante because zhen you do something you already know well it 's not exciting anymore . so if your are successful and you zant to stay there keep on beiing the best and then people will follow you , and you will shine .
