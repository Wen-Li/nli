look around and you will see that we live in a very luxurious time . there are more than one car for each appartment , the parking lot are full and the tracfic is crowded with car which ha no one inside but driver . enjoy these time because there will be fewer car in use than there are today with in twenty year . first of all there will be governmental law which will limit the number of car allowed in the city . because awereness of environmental hazard that is caused by car are increasing . altough there are product like bio-oil and exhaust filter , which decrease the demage , increasing number of car usage outlaw this decrease . actually there is already an application for this . for instance my father , having a car with stronger engine pay much more money tha i do . because a stronger engine will cause more demage to environment . secondly , petrolium price will go up to a point where only upper class people can effort it . the reaon is simple : petrolium reserve will be diminished . there are report indicating that today reserve will last only about fifteen to twenty year . also , last year price increase clearly illusturate this phenomenon . now i have to pay twice a much many a i did in the begining of the year to fill the car . there are atempts to make car work on different source of energy such a hydrogen , electricity , sun light , etc but they are unlikely to enter the market any time soon . in conclusion unless we can not find way to make car non-hazrdous to environment and work on other source of energy , the number of car will likely to decrease with in twenty year due to envorinmental and aconomical issue .
