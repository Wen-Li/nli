i am in according with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . the reason way i am in accord it is that i suppose that successful people are vocated to make better in any way they operate , and they want everytime a new target , much difficult from the past , to obtain . for this reason they try new thing and sometimes they take risk but this give them the sensation of the power and the potential they have . the normal people see them and consider that in the same situation or position they did n't take risk fairly like the successful people do . infact normal people many time , consider successful people too much out of world for the reason that i mention at last . contrary to the normal people thinking i consider ordinary that successful people go in another way from normal people because , if it is not true , they can be successful people . the success of a person it is give first of all by nature because a successful people , before he had success , he wa born with particular ability in specking , playing in general and to made better wath he had to do , respect the other people . with the growth up of the person the success coming to the people that had this particular ability sice they wa young and for this reason they became `` effective '' successful people . the society in general consider that take risk is the better way to falliment or the die . i support a different position , and this is that if a man did n't take many risk in his life continue to be the little ordinary man that he is . but if a man take many risk ( not everytime , but sometimes ) it is a sign of that he could be a successful people . the successful people have to his part the luky , infact sometimes he made an activity with much more success than a normal people could obtaining . this is a particularity but it is n't want by people : it is a supernatural want .
