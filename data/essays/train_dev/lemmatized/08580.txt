i agree to the idea that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are three reason to support my opinion . first of all , especially where i live in japan the population is getting smaller every year . some people estimate that the population would be half in the future . of course , when the population get smaller , people who use car will be decreased . second of all , the focus on the environment is getting bigger every year . without doubt , the fossil fuel that car give to the air are very bad to the environment . so i think that the use of car would be restricted internationally in twenty year . lastly , it is more dangerous to use car than to use train . the number of the traffic accident increase , so people might get to think that they should use train to move because it is much le dangerous than to use car . for those reason , i definitely agree to the idea that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
