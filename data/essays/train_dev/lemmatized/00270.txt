generalism versus specialism is a widely discussed topic nowadays . in older day most academic field required rather broad general knowledge with pointed specific knowledge in certain subject . with the advancement of society and science the demand for generalist decrease and the demand for specialist increased . why is that ? let me explain this using the field of medicine a an example . in the past medical doctor were able to overlook broad field of medicine , giving them the chance to help patient with many different disease at a good level of care . with the advancement of medicine and medical research the complexity of each medical field increased and it became harder and harder for an individual to keep up with the advanced knowledge in each field . to be able to treat a patient according to the state-of-the-art standard of medicine nowadays one ha to be a specialist in his field . for generalist the field of practice becomes smaller and smaller while more and more subject are taken and space been filled with specialist . knowledge in medicine is said to double every five year . this prof that a medical doctor today can not accumulate the same level of knowledge in many medical subject and reach a comparable level of perfection a one could thirty year ago . now , is this a change to the good ? do i agree that specialization is good ? it might be usefull and the pace of scientific advancement might not give u a choice , but i personally believe that at the same time something is lost . what ? well , first at all the general picture is lost . a specialist often ha not the same broad idea of the big picture , let 's say - to stick with the example of the general doctor - of the patient 's background , other medical problem , medical problem in different social and geographic group of society and the influence amongst medical problem . second at all the more specialized a person - in this example a doctor - becomes the more likely it will be that he is only neeeded for a small number of duty , investigation or treatment , wich in my oppinion lead to more perfectionism at first , but very easily lead to a lack of compassion and boredom soon afterwards , leaving behind a specialist with no enthusiasm and compassion any more for his job and profession . in that way i personally do agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many topic or subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
