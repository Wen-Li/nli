some people prefer to arrange a travel by themselves , while others like to join a group led by a tour guide . i am incline to the later way , becuase a tour guide provides many advantage to me . first of all , i like to visit a place that i have never been there before . it will cost a lot of time and energy to arrange a travel . people have to fingure out how to get to the place they want to , the transportation tool and fair . although , the e-business system provides many way to book air ticket , hotel , and other necessary facters to modern traveler , it still cost time . after experience stressful time in workplace , many people do not want to spend a lot of time on exploring ticket on the internet . a tour guide arranges every thing of the travel for the member of group . people just pick up a travel agency , select a travel package , and then pay money . they will reveive a document which describes the detailed arrangement about this tour . second , a tour guide know more about the place than anyone else in his group , because he is professional agency . he ha led a travel group from many time before take you to the place . he is trained to know everything for that place . he can intruduce the history of an ancient building in a vivid way , and tell travelors many intestresing story that can not be found in a tour guide book . he learn where is the most valuable place that people can not miss , hence a tour guide can make a proper schedule and spare enough time for that stop . he also watch the time and take care of transportation ; therefore , people do not need to look at the train schedule time and time again to make sure that they could catch an right train . finally , joining a group led by a tour guide is a way to make friend in travel . a travel group consiste of people with vary background . to talk to unknown people in one 's group allows people to learn many intestresing thing that they can not know if they travel alone . in conclusion , i believe that join a travel group led by a tour guide is a better way than travel alone because it easy , cost saving , and more fun .
