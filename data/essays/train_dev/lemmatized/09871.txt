yes , i would agree with the statement , because it is more important that the student should understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . because student could notnot have sufficient knowledge and exprience to go with their veiws , so they dont know what they are doing and is this is correct or wrong . one student get in to the that part they can know what they did is wrong , so that they can clarify this is the wrong method , they can not get in to that method again . many student think about what they are doing is always correct , because they are in dilema which they can not get out , once they know about that thn they will choose another one . if one concept can get in to a student mind by telling the idea of that can be dipped in to his mind practically no one can erase from his mind . so that the fact and idea can not get the student mind by orally they can reach them practically very effectively . if student learn about fact ten he can visualize what they are and what they are meant for . so we may teach them fact they do not take very effectively so that if explain real situation we can correct fact through their mind . so the idea and concept are meant for learn by them only ii dont say strictl ; y because the personal learning can not get the all the fact and concept , so we may co opearate to them to learn about the reality and fact . so that they can have bouth side co operation so that can think about their idea . so by practically are orally they can get their concept and idea . so that the above are the my opinion on the given statement and the main idea of mamine is they should understand idea and concept their own with our co operation
