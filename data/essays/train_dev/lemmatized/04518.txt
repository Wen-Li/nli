i agree about the saying that there will be fewer car in twenty year than there are today , because there is more and more pollution in the air and because , in twenty year , new transportation vehicules will be invented . nowadays , there is more and more pollution in the air . in fact , government and ecologist do their best to eliminate that problem . because car are one of the biggest problem about pollution 's creation that damage our environment , it will be forbidden in the next future to drive car . pollution destroys our earth and kill about 100 specie of animal everyday . moreover , the climate on the earth change dramatically , a a result , our flora and fauna are destroyed . here are some reason that show that in twenty year , car wo n't exist anymore , because of this problem of pollution creation . another reason is that before twenty year , new method of transportation will be invented . as stated in the first paragraph , car produce too much pollution . in fact , some people will create an revolutionary method of transportation with an engine consumming water or sunlight , instead of gaz . creating that new accommodation of transportation , it inventor will become rich . as a result , it will encourages people to develop and create something new and special , that will keep the air clean and that wo n't destroy our planet . in conclusion , because of the fact that car are a major problem of pollution , it will be replaced by a revolutionary method of transportation that will purify the air , a we know it before . we ca n't continue to live a we live today , we have to make a change for letting our child see what a beauty is the earth . we have to stop the killing .
