the statement can be seen from two side . first , it is very important for student to understand idea and concept within lecture because without this understanding the context of a lecture would not be kept in mind of the student . in my opinion the lecture ha the task to help the student understanding idea and concept of the topic they are taught in . on the other hand the lecture at university can not be compared with a lecture in school . in school the teacher ha the task to work so long on one topic until the whole class understood everything . in university the professor or lecturer have to help the student getting the idea and concept but the student have to keep in mind that they have to work at home additive for the lecture and maybe the lecture only help them to understand idea and concept . second , it is also very important for student to learn fact because in business they need these fact daily and to have a profound knowledge hard fact have to be included . herefore the problem is that the fact can only be used a a tool when the student know what the meaning of these fact are and which topic belongs to which learned fact . it make no sense to learn fact without having any idea for what topic they are useful . i think that this statement is controversial because understanding idea and concept and learning of hard fact belongs together . it is necessary to understand idea and concept but the fact needed to underline the argumentation in a special case must be learned a well . on the other side the hard fact can be learned but without the background of idea and concept the fact are useless . it only make sense to learn fact when concept and idea are already understood because than the argumentation can be underlined with them .
