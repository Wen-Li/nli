i completly agree with the sentence . i 'm a student and i think that is more important to understand all the concept and all idea . basing on my experience i think that is more important understand all the idea and all the concept of a topic or of a lecture . in my opinion if something is over your head it is important ask a question , to understand anything . a mounth ago , i wa in an antropology class and my professor wa discus a topic . this topic wa over my head and i did n't understand nothing . at home i studied my note and at the next lesson i asked to my professor to explain me the point that i wa n't understand . i think that , in the university world , there are a different way to ask something to a professor . in my university all student can contact their professor by e-mail , by phone or apply for an appointment . another thing that is very important for my experince is understand the reason of wich i study something . in all the lecture of the university professor these professor must explain all the reason of wich the student study the topic of the lecture . in a human factor design course my professor say that we wil study antrophometry , human behaviour , human computer interaction and human machine interaction . so we will be able to use the information of these science to design a good object , good space and good building . i think that is more important study anithigs . i think that is more important ask if we do n't understand something . we can use e-mail , phone and all the tecnology that we know . also i think that is more important understand why we are going to study something .
