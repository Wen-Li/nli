traveling is one of the best way to have fun and get more knowledge about other coultures or whatever new thing . therefore , planning for any travel or small trip is very important element . and there is differents way to plan for any trip . there is people who like to travel with group with tour guide that he or she can lead them very well in the traveling . and there is anothers who like to travel by them self and get the information by them self , which it make more difficalte . actually i disagree that is the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide . also i think it is work in some case . but the reason that made me disagree are , in any travel i think that is the best thing is to descover every thing by my self which i wo n't get that benefit with a guide . and also travelling with group give me le porsnality which i do n't like . first , i uauslly travel to descover and get more information from other culturs and place . and i like to know know every thing by self , because it give feeling that i did good job . also to know every thing by my self need to communicate with other people , and that communication it also consedered a a descovering . therefore , there is good thing that i will get from my travel by my self that i wo n't get it with guide . whatever traveling my self give chalinges and that chalinges is the best thing that i will remebar it from the trip . second , in of the important thing that every body want it in any time is personalty . and this quallty is very important for me in any trip . it give the aplety to descover more and make me think only about what i should do , not think about what others need or what i should obey of rule with any group . therefore , that give more chance to be by my own and only think about ny self on this trip . finally , there are some place that every body need tour guide such a visting specfice place and to know about many thing there . this kind of tour are usually temprorly and do n't take long time , so , i can that advantage beside that i can the eals by my own .
