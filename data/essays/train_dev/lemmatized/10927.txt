although it is good to specialize in one subject , i agree with the opinion that people have to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . first , even if you are interested in that one subject you study , you had better to see other subject . seeing other range will be helpful to enlarge your knowledge . if you see many thing and read many kind of book , your brain and feeling will be soft and you can learn more thing than before . secondly , it will also help you to make it sure what you have learned . in one way , you can not know what is correct or not because your sight is narrow and small . if you learned something about the one specific subject , you can not say that in other subject the same . you have to see it from many way or you can not judge it . and also , all academic subject connect to each subject . we exist in this world and many material exist together in a complex way a well . although each subject might look different at all , in fact , they are telling u about this world . unexpectedly , all subject are same thing . in sum , i support the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject with those three reason after all .
