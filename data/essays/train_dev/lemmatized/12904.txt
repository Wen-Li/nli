in our actual society , we can not avoid advertisement ; we totally live in a advertising space . we find them every where around u : on the television screen with so many commercial every ten minute , in the news paper , in magazine , in the street ! however most of those advertisments are just good publicity , and nothing more . advertisement agency spend hour and hour every day to find a new product which will attract more client . and lmost of the time , they privilege quantity to quality . in such case , they make product seem much better than they really are . they used very various way to attract u , and most of the time pertinent or attractive visual image in oder to catch our attention . let just think about the huge number of advertisement to loose wait . they choose thinny model , who are slim by nature , make u believe that thanks to their new performant diet product , they lost calorie in a very short time and got this amazing result . but when buyer use the product they are often disappointed by it . sometimes they get in part the result they expected and sometimes no result at all . morever , some brand try to fool people , spending huge amount of many to get a star to represent their brand and appear on their advertisement campaign . but even those brand are not even better , they just have take a bet on the visual aspect in order to better attract u to buy something not eventually more efficient or usefull . often we buy stuff that actually we dont need or are not useful at all , just because we have been influenced by the product advertisement . besides , if you make a survey on the efficiency of product bought from , a given population , probably much more than the half will assume that those product were not a good a they looked on the advertisement . publicity are elaborated to get into our mind , and make u think that we need a given product whereas it probably not the case . for example , teenager often buy their favorite star , specially girl , in order to ressemble to their icon . that why , i hereby think that most of advertisement seem much better t
