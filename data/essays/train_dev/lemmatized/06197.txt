i disagree with this statement . in my opinion young people do enough for there community . there are many job in the community , which are not really paid , an dwhich are done from young people , for example streetworkers or some people who work in youthclubs , they do a lot of work for kid , which do not know how to spend the time they have . i do n't know much older people with an age higher that twenty-five . they also help the community with young criminal , which think they have no future and their life is to steal or to beat some one , to get some money . this is important work also for the community and of course the police , who ha to follow community opinion by having it a save area , the streetworker also help a a big part of the system . there are also many other thing were young people help , for exsample orchestra 's , they play music without getting money , but the whole communitie ha it part of it , happy people and street festival . what about emergency , there are a lot of young people helping every weekend and although the whole week , without getting the same money like emergency employed by the community get - this would be much to expensive . take an sportevent , it not able to make it a good one if you do n't have people outside the community , who help you , the most of helping hand are younger people , many are sportsman or woman themselfs , so they like to help wherever they can . may be there are reason that people say young people do n't do enough , it right there are some part where young people not give there time to help , but often this are area where older people say that younger people are n't able to , so the younger people are a little bit pissed off and think that the older one can make this project or something like this alone .
