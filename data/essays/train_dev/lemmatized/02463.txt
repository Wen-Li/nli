i agree with the statement that , `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' in this essay i will present a variety of reason and example that support my conviction . the very purpose of an advertisement is to maximize sale of a particular product . to maximize sale it is imperative to convince people to buy the product and make the product appear much better than it is . advertisements highlight the good point of a particular product while neglecting to mention it ' bad point . advertisements for new drug , for instance , often highlight how a particular drug can cure a certain disease while neglecting to mention any side effect that may occur a a result of using that drug . some advertisement advertise quality of the product that are unlikely to be of much use . however , people may be encouraged to buy the product . for example , many car advertisement advertise the top speed of car - but who is going to drive a car at 300 km/per hour ? other advertisement portray product a they would function under ideal condition , without describing how they would function under condition of common use . for instance , advertisement for mobile phone and other technological item suggest that they can function perfectly for an indefinite time period . this doe not , of course consider the effect of normal wear and tear and entices people to buy them . the cleverest and often the most successful advertisement make use of subtle psychological trick to encourage people to buy product . they do this by ascribing attribute to the product that it may , in fact , lack . advertisements for cigarette are a classic example . cigarette user are depicted a fashionable and popular a opposed to those who do not use cigarette . no company mentioned the harm of cigarette until government regulation forced them to do so . deodorant advertisement are another example , often suggesting that the male user of a particular deodorant would have woman following him left , right and centre ! to conclude then , advertisement aim to maximize sale of product by making them seem much better than they really are . they do this in a variety of way - example of which i have given in the above essay .
