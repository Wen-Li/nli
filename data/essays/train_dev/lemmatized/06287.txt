in nowadays , it is widely known that the car bring the convenient of traffic . we can travel some place easier and quickly . but do those car reduce in twenty year ? in my opinion , car will increase in the future . there are several reason i will show a following . first of all , i think that the population is increains in the world . in the future there are more people in the world , especially in some undeveloping and developing country . in fact , in those country there are few car . even some people have not saw the car since they were born . maybe it will have new kind of traffic tool in the future . but i think that the most important traffic tool in those country which are not developed will buy the car in the future . because the prise of the car in the future must be cheapter than today . and those country could buy the car in the future . secondly , i find that the car is more and more cheaper . futhermore , the function of the car will improve quickly and powerfully . like tv , the car will be a basic commercial in the future . and a family may have more than one car in the futher . so there will be more and more car in use in the futher . actually , in taiwan , many famailies have more than one car , even two . thirdly , the car is convenient than other transportation . for example , the people go to work every day . but the mass transportation doe not pas the place where the people want to go . by driving car you can go any place you want to go . obiviously , it is more convenient than other transportation . and in the country , it usually doe not have the mass transportation . to sum up , i believe that the car will increase in the futher . from the point above , you could get why the car are so popular and why the car in use will grow up . in the end , i will emphasize that the car will be more popular in any place in the world in the future .
