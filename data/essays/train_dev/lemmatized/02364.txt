many people have different way to travel , some people travel individually , some prefere to travel a a couple , others like to travel in a group led by a tour guide. in my opinioin i prefere to travel in a group led by a tour guide for the following reason : first , travelling in a group is better , more secure and more organised . when you travel in a group you do not have to worry about an thing , you pay the trip cost , you will have the trip schudle in advance , so you can organise your time . also lling in a group wil give you a chance to travell with your friend and you can make a lot of new friend . second , the organization and security of your trip , suppose your trip is going to egypt , from the begging your tour guide will be with you , stating from booking the hotel , and will organizes your trip to see e most attractive place in egypt , such a the pyramides , the nile river , sephenx the egyptian museum and many differnent place in the country you will visit . third , travelling in a group led by a tour guide ha many avantages . . if we come to security , the tour guide will be responsible for your safety . if you got sick he wll help you to get treatment if you lost your mony or your luggage he wll help ou to get them back . lastly , travelling in a group will help you to be in touch with different people from different country and fom different background . where you can make a lot of new frienships which can be benificial to you in the future . in cinclusio , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is better than traveiling a an individual for the reason i menthoined above , which include organization security ami
