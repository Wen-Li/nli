i agree with the statement that is `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . beacause people are the person who are not bother about the future . future is the only thing make a man in to struggle when we memorize it . and also the yong people are more active than the older people . yonger people are enjoyed by facing the day by day challenge in the school and college . young people will feel more happy when they achieve the target and they fell very sad when they fail . young people do not know how to earn money , because they dont bother about the money . older people have some limitation to do any activity in the society , because they all are experienced and thay all are already enjoyed the younger stage . but young people can do any thing what thay want . one famous scholer say that `` student can make the world and break the world '' . i am very much intrested about this phrase because i am also a student . iam also very much enjoying my younger stage . iam studied up to tenth standard in my own village , i am toally enjoying with my friend at that time by going to school through the greenary plant on cycle . and in the twelth standard i came to the city , here also i felt very happy by spending with friend . in my engineering due to the age , i knowing the what happy and what sad . young people like me are so enjyoed theire lovely youngerness . the older people have some responsibility in the family . they also enjoy the older stage by spending with the grand son and grand daughter by sharing the affection and love . in this way younger people are more enjoy life more than the older people .
