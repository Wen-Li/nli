i agree to the statement . there are many step on developing student ' cognitive capacity . students are learning from imitating their parent and teacher . and they are learning the fact by taking lesson from them . leaning fact is very important . students learn from historical fact and scientific fact . those fact that they have learned may stimulate the student ' cognitive capacity and interest . but when they learn only fact without understanding idea and concept they just memorize and simply accumuklate them to their knowledge . `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' when student understand idea and cncepts it is harder for them to forget the fact than they just learn fact . when student understand idea and concept , they can learn why the fact come to exist and how to develop from the fact to the further level of knowledge . there are basic idea and concept underlying the fact . students should know them to connect the fact that are related to . knowledge is accumulation of fact . but student need to apply the fact that they have learned into thier real life . to apply the fact that they have learned into their life they must understand idea and concept underlying the fact . when they understand idea and concept they can develop more from what they have learned . further inquiry based on the fact that they have learned with idea and concept will stimulate their academic interest and help them advance their learning and achievement . understanding idea and concept also help student to organize what they have leraned and how to relate to one another in their cognitive organization . later on they can deliver and teach what they have learned to anohte student or their student who want to know more about the fact . teaching idea and concept to their friend and student will help them learn more easily from them . therefore understanding idea and concept are more important than just learing fact .
