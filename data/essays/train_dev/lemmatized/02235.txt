in these modern time , youth are always bothered about achieving thieir individual goal and fullfiling their need . they are le bothered about their community . every youth ha to play a certain role in the community . he ha to serve for the benefit of the community and future generation . often , youth benefit from a communtiy and when they achieve their goal or reached a better situation with the aid of the community , they forget the help rendered to them . for example in developing countires many student are provided reservation because they belong to a certain downtrodded community . the student after achieving success are not indebted to the community and dont try to help it . but there are some instance where this is not always true . consider the case of an indian student going to the united states to pursue higher education . he check out the memeber 's of the indian community in that college and contact them before hand . the member of the community then arrange for his transport from the airport to the university campus and then take care of him for two to three day . since the basic idea of this community is to help other student and in this aspect young people are suceeding . there are also several youth who try to help their community . when a person leaf his country and achieves success , they do not forget their mother land , they try to help their native community . take the case of many non resident indians . these young people try to help and fund various charity organisation in india . so , though i agree that young peole now a day are not giving enough time to help their community , i feel that this is not always true because there are some instance where young people spend their time and money for the benefit of the community .
