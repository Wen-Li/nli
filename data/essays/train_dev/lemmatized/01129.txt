i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are many reason for this point . first a in group we would be safe a example in a strange country between strange people it would be good if remain in group a there would be le chance of robbery . other benefit is of tour guide . a tour guide will show u the every important place and by this way we would not miss any tourist place . other benefit of tour guide is that he know all the way to reach that place so the chance of lossed in any place will be very le . in a group we can also share each others feeling and experiances , and that would be entertaining . the good aspect of travelling in group is that it could reduce our expences in some content . so over all in my opinion travelling in group with tour guide is best way .
