the situation and responsabilites of young people ha been always a major topic in social issue . the limit of the latter ha been changed according socio-political condition of each country or society . nowadays , debate abount young people help attitude towards their community is growing . advocates of this argument claim that although a deep understanding about social collaboration and establishment of non-profit social organization dedicated to help others is growing , young people do not choose to be a part of this life style . they argue that they waste their time by some other kind of activity . however , this approach can be critised by claiming that our life is not strictly determined by our free choice . as i mentioned before , the environmental condition in which a young person is located is extemely determining in his \ her attitude . to exemplify this , we can consider a country where you have no social right such a free education or health insurance and where you have to work hard to afford life expanse . a young member of a poor or even a middle-class family will not have sufficient time to study , to work and to be part of organization which are devoted to help people . considering education and earning money a two main obligation of survival in capitalist system , there is no time for involving in social organization . one further exemple of the importance of social condition in young people choice is the situation observed in extrene condition like war . in time of war , there is an immense need for helping other people and whole life get a new direction according to demand of other . after taking account all this argument , i can tell without hesitation that i strictly disagree witk the statement claiming the lack of charity behaviour of young population towards their community .
