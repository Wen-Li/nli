my best travel wa the travel without a tour guide . the travel is still good memory even it wa long time ago and i will never forget it . i believe that the best way to travel is a travel planed and made by myself from three reason . one reason is before the travel . before the travel , i need to decide where to go , where to stay , and what to do . from that moment , the travel ha already started . it is enjoynable to find the best travel which fit to myself . i also can find the cheapest travel by looking at the internet . i like to spend more money in eating than staying the good hotel , so i can choose cheeper place to stay . i can plan everything what i want . the second reason is during the travel . the destination is usually the place where i have never been , so i want to see many new thing during the travel . if i go abroad , one of my purpose to travel is to experience other culture . if i have an opportunity , i `` m willing to talk to the people living there even if i ca n't speak the language they use . if the communication is successful , i feel happy . sometimes travelling without a tour guide is adventurous . i may lose my way , however , i can go to the restaurant which i found accidentally . i do n't know what my travel will be . it is better to travel by myself sp that i can communicate with local people and enjoy the accident . furthermore , time is limited during the travel . within the limited time , i have to go and see all i want . if the travel is led by a tour guide , i can not stay the one place . even i do n't finish looking around , i have to leave there . it 's better to travel without a tour guide because i can spend time where i want to . in conclusion , travelling is fun because i can make plan which is best for me , experience the culture there , and spend my time . traveling by myself is more possible to have a wonderful trip .
