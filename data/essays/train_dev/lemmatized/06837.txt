i completely agree with the statement that `` it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . '' having a broad knowlege of many subject will give a lot of exposure , new subject will create interest and also provide better career prospect for student . students will gain a lot of exposure by studying many different subject . this will also prepare them to take class in different department . i personaly feel that this is a very good option a this will make them interact with other student coming from different background a well gain valuable knowledge . moreover , studying a wide variety of subject will help student develop new interest that they might eventually take up and make a career of it . let me support this with an example . while i wa studying `` architecture '' we were asked to take a wide variety of subject like interior design , lanscaping , theory of structures , humanities and history of architecture . while studying these subject i developed a lot of interest in the subject of `` history of architecture '' which eventually i went on to make a career in it . today i am working with the `` national heritage conservation committee '' a a architect guiding the govenment about the various teachniques and mean to protect the heritage and historical monument . lastly this also creates better career prospect for student a a lot of prospective employer and firm want to recruit people who have a broad knowledge about a lot of subject in their respective field . as their knowledge tremendeously help them in a lot of project where such input are required and turn it into success ! for example a student with a broad knowledge of `` sustainable design '' and project management will definately have an edge over a student with knowlege only in `` interior design '' . thus it is important for student to have a broad knowledge of amny academic subject instead of specializing in one specific one and i completely agree with it .
