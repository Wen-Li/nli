to try to give an answer to this important question i would say that i do n't really agree . in my mind we have to keep fact in mind to improve and to understand concept . for instance , when we made some mistake we always could and should learn about it . that 's why i think that some fact are really importants . concerning nasism , we ca n't ignore that it ha existed and this because people made some great mistake . they choose to put confidence in a leader which wa a dictator and it ended in a war that we could have avoided . now that we know how that kind of ideology can be , we are aware that we better have to choose quietlier . but learning about some other fact is not always a important a it is in this case . some fact are useless if we consider course a philosophy . some act influence our life and our behaviour but some other are nothing interesting to developp conscience and awareness . but when we study this other point it raise another issue which is directly linked to my first opinion : we have to learn fact to learn in general . how ? because everthing that seems to mean nothing to you is meaning more than you believe . nevertherless we can understand lot of thing without have learn everything about the subject . we can know world war two without being born and having lived during this war . you learn that there were million people who died for your freedom but even if you did n't felt what is wa to be affraid of bomb you can understand what it is like . so to conclude i would like to underline that it doe n't matter with the way we improve thing . the most important is to be interesting when you try to learn something to someone and to be curious when it is you that is learning . we learn from everything but not only from fact .
