generally speaking , young people are the most important role-players in any community ; a they are able to give more . in my opinion , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . for example , what a young man care about these day is where to find the newest and coolest video game , where he can download the latest mp3s and album , or where to get a party held for fun . .. and the list never end ! young people in the middle age , unlike nowadays , had more pasion to work . for instance , they used to work in farm so they earn their living which enables them to get what they want and live their life . while young depend on their parent in everything nowadays , young people had been responsible before . for example , young used to get married when they were at the beginning of their teen age . but on the other hand , by looking in the record of what young provided to their community nowadays , we just find few good example . some young people participated in humanitarian organization , which were very important mean to help poor people around the world survive and live . other example might be young scientist . have n't you heard about the 13 year old scientist who came up with a new method of calculation ? yes it true ! the method is now being taught in cambridge university and many professor admited that it is very effecient . all what wa mentioned above lead u to a point , which clearly show that young people are a treasure , and they are a double-edged weapon . communities ( parent in the first place ) should guide their kid and teach them to be giving , not only taking , a no one can deny the fact that say `` the more you give , the more you get !
