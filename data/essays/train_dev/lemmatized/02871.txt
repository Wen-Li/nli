i personnaly agree with this statement . having broad knowledge of many academic subject is not that easy , it is true . but let me tell you this ; albert einstein ha a quote : `` knowledge is power. '' which is completely true . think of biology without chemistry ; chemistry without physics ; physics without geometry : geometry without math and so on . .. a chemist can not explain why the electron make an orbital shape around the nucleus without physics , can he ? or a physics master can not measure the shadow that a candle make when he lit it , can he ? another important point can be thought of easily when we think about the important people who majored in their field and that we still know of even if they lived century and even thousand of year ago . take pascal a an example . he ha a lot of proven theory in math , physics . . is n't it odd for him to have more than one field which he majored and made himself known of ? the answer to these question i pointed out are simple and true : the law of nature , the language spoken , people and all the others that we know of are on only one place : here on earth . no one can prove that the fact about it are n't linked to one another . the link between the fact are so tight that if you start learning at one end , you will end up in finding yourself at the other . so , learning physics , learning chemistry , learning literature or any other topic is not that important to worry about . you will find yourself at the other hand if you study hard and learn a lot . the only question is where to start the adventure . but do not stick to the beggining because you will have a lot missing if you do n't finish it until the end . do n't be stuck in a subject of life , try to get to know the whole piece .
