advertising is often considered by post-modernists a a new vicious mean of propaganda . it ha penetrated almost every sphere of one 's life ; it is to be found everywhere in the public sphere , and ha also entered the private sphere through television or free flyer . its purpose is to present a product but also increase the sale of this product . thus an advertisement must appeal to the consumer 's sens . it must furthermore convince the consumer that he absolutely need this good . therefore , strategy have been developed to increase one product 's sale , and making the product attractive and necessary in one of them . but , a the statement argues , many advertisement enhance the product 's appearence and efficiency so that a gap is created between the real product and it 's image . in the year following the end of the second world war , occidental society have experienced economic bonanza coupled with increase in living-standards . people therefore consumed more and more . the mean by which advertiser make people consume is sometimes questionable . for instance , advertisement often manipulate unconsciously the consumer , by using subliminal message . this is one of the way to make a product seem much better . although diffusing erroneous information about a product is forbidden , some advertisement selectively describe the product and emphasize important feature of a product , which are in reality irrelevant . as an example , an advertisement for a car might put forward it comfort while it security is not mentioned . although we can argue that many advertisement make product seem better than the reality is , one might aknowledge that the very purpose of an advertisement is to highlight the good feature of the product and silence the mediocre one . advertisement have the right to emphasize the pleasant feature of a product in order to sell the product to a greater extend . but it should n't in any case lie to the consumer , at the risk of being discredited .
