broad knowledge and specifi knowledge are both interesting to have , and i could not say that one is definitely better than the other , actually i rather think that it is good to posse these both form of knowledge . a broad academic knowledge is useful at school , and for your study , since it allows you to start studying any specific subject without having to learn the base . this type of general knowledge is also useful in everyday life , when you talk to people : you can cover a wide range of topic , have an interesting conversation with many different people , and make many friend . another thing which go with talking to many people and knowing the base of a wide range of topic is that it open your mind , and help you understand how thing work , which in turn help you reasonning more efficiently . all of that is very useful in everyday life a well a if you wish to become sharper in a particuliar topic you study . but once you have become very good in a specific topic , only then can you achieve a successful professional career . some believe that we all have a talent to develop ( like in the bible : `` what have you done of your talent ? '' ) , and most people try to fulfil their ambition by getting very good in one particular thing . although a lack of general knowledge might not help you evolve a lot in your social life , a specific knowledge can assure you a job , and if you like what you do it will not be hard to improve yourself until you are very good at it . in conclusion , i think that an alliance fo both knowledge is the best choice , even though it may be hard to achieve because it take time and money a well a manual and intellectual skill . still if i really had to choose i would go for the general knowledge , because nowadays you can easily find extension of this knowledge for free , on the internet for instance , and if you have an open mind and a social life it should not be too hard to get some more specialised friend of yours to help you with particular issue .
