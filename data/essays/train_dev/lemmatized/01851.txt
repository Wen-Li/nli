learining is a very disputable word . few person generally misjudge it with introduction , understanding or craming etc . but it is very necessary that what we learned should be same a that of what we understand . it 's very common among the student to learn the fact rather than to understand the idea behind it . they always looking for short term goal usually their examination . but it creates a great problem when they get a applied question in the examination . few question are based on uderstaning of concept . these type of question are usually not mention in the text book . if you donot uderstand the motto or theme of subject , it 's very difficult to apply it in the current field , other field or after a short time span . one will foreget the thing just after few day or month . but if we evaluvate the subject fully , it a life long achivement . we can use the same concept in different stream or at any time . for instance , if an agriculturist beleive in learning fact ; may be he will able to acheive a good grade , but practically he will not able to apply his knowledge in his field a agriculture is an applied science . the understanding lead to development of creativity and if an agriculturist is not creative , he will not able to investigate the new technique . similarly , if an engineering student learn the fact of the principle of working of a maching rather than to understand it , he can only handle that particular type of machine and never think about a new discovery . on the other hand if got basic idea , he can renovate the maching according to the requirement of time . every field of study require application of your skill rather than to copy it , which can be only possible when the student will understand the idea rather than learning the fact . today 's time is for idea holding person which is entirely based on creativity ; ultimately understanding .
