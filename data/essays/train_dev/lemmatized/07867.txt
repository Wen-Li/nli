travelling in a group led by a tour guide present many advantage . first , you can share and exchange your opinion and feeling on site you visit with the groupmates . it is often very enjoyable and refreshing to listen to other people ' feedback . second , the tour guide take you only to location that matter the most or that are the most representative of the country visited . therefore you avoid waste of time deciding where to go and whether the designated location worthes the visit . the guide is often a great source of important information about the visited site . he can turn the visit in a very interactive way , something you could n't get from a book . finally , the tour and the guide make the travel much more enjoyable a everything is already planned . there is no need then to bother with organization detail and unexpected event . everything is handled by the guide and the tour company . however , travelling in a group and a tour guide may also have some disadvantage . in my eye , being in a group mean that you no longer master your time . unless being selfish and imposing your idea to others , you can not do what you want . you got to stay within the bound and respect other people ' wish . and listening to someone whining the whole day because the schedule doe not please him is indeed extremely annoying . besides this , a tour mean everything is already planned . there is therefore no room for sudden change of schedule or unexpected location to visit . the exitement might be undermined . if the tour company provides poor service or the guide lack knowledge about the location , then your experience may turn out to be very disappointing and frustrating . another very bad habbit of touring company and guide is the fact that they often take you to location , restaurant , museum with which they have a partnership , a deal , so you are invited to purchase item in those location and not others . personally i dislike very much those practice a i have the feeling to be a kind of toy in their hand . my best advice is to choose carefully the tour company . to rely on other people 's feedback , friend in order to determine which tour company suit the best our wish and need . about the group , my suggestion is to welcome thing a they come and all the time to focus on what plea you the most and to sweep away any little annoying detail .
