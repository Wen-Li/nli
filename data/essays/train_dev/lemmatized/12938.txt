the young people of today are a much more informed and aware group of people than young people in the past ever were . they are the future of society and community and ofcourse have a big role to play in giving back to and helping their community . it is unfair to say that they do not give enough time to helping their community . i am of the opinion that young people nowadays give a much if not more time than the youth of year gone by ever did to helping their community . the youth of today having had more oppurtunities than youth of yester year ever did have benefited greatly from the same . there are several example from recent year that go on to prove how young people have devoted a lot of their time and energy towards forwarding a cause that is related to their community . as a particular example , one may look at the anti firecracker drive undertaken by young people across several region during festive season . such campaign are aimed at issue ranging from reducing the pollution level experienced due to bursting of firecracker to more grave topic such a tackling child labour ( often being emplyed in fire cracker factory ) . however , some may argue that a a movement such anti-firecracker drive may be instigated not by young people themeselves ; but the fact remains that such drive are successfull only due to the active participation and support of young people . and we have sufficient evidence to belive that these movement are more successful today than they ever were in the past . another example is that of community service program initiated in several private school over the past few year . it is now compulsory in several school to complete a certain number of community service hour . what is most heartening is that i myself have experienced first hand how many student are interested in devoting more time than is compulsarily required of them . a myriad of social service club have formed in school . in my own school , such a club wa in the nascent stage when i graduated . once again , cynic may argue it is not the youth themselves who are jumping in on community service ; but the bottomline is that the average school going student today probably spends a lot more time in community service than a student did ten or twenty year ago . one arguement that must be put forth to make the case for the young people today even stronger is the current state of growth and development of community in different region . barring a few exception , the standard of living of people ha gone up over time and therefore so ha the standard of the community that house these people . in my opinion , it is not possible to explain such an improvement in community life without giving some credit to the young people of the community . even if the younger people may not be at the helm of organising community get-togethers and event , they are most often the one that participate heartily in the same . such active participation definately go to help their community develop .
