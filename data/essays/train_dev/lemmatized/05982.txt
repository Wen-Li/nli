i totally disagree with the statement that say `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . i have always liked , since i wa a little child , all the type of car and now i have a car all for myself i can unerstand the importance to have it . in my life i have noticed that the number of car in use always increase year by year , and i believe this trend will continue till the end of the world ( ! ) . in today-world a great importance is given to the safety of the enviroment and , a lot of time , car are indicated like the first reason for pollution . someone could think that the number of car will decrease due to this fact but he doe not consider that there is a great development in car that do not produce pollution . another reason is that , nowadays , the car symbolize the status symbol of his or her owner . so all the people try to purchase new model of car for feeling better with themselves . in italy the business related to car-world is increasing even if the whole economic situation is not good at all . in addition , people , obviously , like technological and beautiful stuff and i think that car can belong perfectly to this kind . you have only to see new model of car for understanding that it is very hard to try to resist to the desire of buying a new car . it is also clear that people have to move for their date , for job and often the public sistem of transporting , at least in italy , doe not make u feel sure to arrive in time or to arrive at all . for example today there is the strike of the tube and i have been obliged to take the car for being sure of attending toefl test .
