i don ' t think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . if that wa the case , consumer would always be disappointed after purchasing the product . that would erode the confidence that the consumer have in that product maker and therefore would not allow the establishment of a longterm relaltionship between the consumer and the product . advertisers would have to constantly be appealling to new consumer . whereas , what is important is the brand . adverstisers are looking into promoting the product brand a much a the product itself . once the consumer have adopted a brand , they will be more incline to buy all the product from that brand . and this is what the product maker need : more faithful consumer who are going to buy over and over product from that brand . therefore , advertiser are working on a larger scope than just trying to make look the product a good a possible . they work at creating a market , creating a need in the consumer , creating a fashion . they have much more complex message than just : `` that product is good '' . of course having attractive product is important , it contributes to the overall marketing message . if the consumer ha the perception that the advertised product seem better than it is , it mean that the advertisement ha been poorly made and is not effective .
