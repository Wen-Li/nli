i disagree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping thier community '' . i personally give alot of time to take care of my community and ensure the well being of everyone in it . i live in a community that ha around one hundred family that live together in a society . in my community all the child get together every friday and make sure that the society is kept clean and ensure that all the facility are operational and the elder child also teach the younger child various sport and help them with thier school work . every alternate sunday the elder child of the community meet and spend time with the old people of the community , they involve them self in activity such a chess and take the old people for walk and talk to them and ask them how their week wa , the old people enjoy this attention very much and in the bargain the elder child learn alot . i myself am involed in many social activity in the community and an active member in the board of the society , while growing up i have always been told to be a part of the place you live in since this increase your social skill and you get to make friend . apart from my own community i have also noticed in the other area where my friend live that the younger generation is very involved in activity in the community and are very close to all the people that reside in it . at school child are taught to be a part of thier community and it is also compulsary in some country to have completed a certain number of hour of community service to graduate , because of this many student are involving them self in thier community . from what i have experienced and seen i personly think that young people are making a great effort to help their community and are also benefitting from it .
