over the last century , advertising ha become one of the most developped and i ; portant activity in humankind . it suurounds u everywhere today : on television of course , in the street , in the subway , on our car . .. we can not avoid it . some may say that : `` most advertiser make product seem much better than they really are '' . do they ? is advertising that simple ? do they not take into account the risk it creates when the customer will be disappointed ? first of all , the question seems simple , of course they do , they sure will not make their product seem worse . they are paid to sell something to people who did not even want to buy it in the first place , who did not even needed it sometimes . they must create a need in customer ' mind and a will to buy precisely that product . how could they do that without making their product look good , even better than they are , to kind of sell dream to people . it is not what they do it for but in the end they kind of give hope to people , like when one see an advertisment who would make one believe that the product it defends is exactly what one ha hoped to find during all these year , or tht it is so much better that all it competition . that is why in all soap spot , the laundry is whiter and smoother than ever or in all shampoo spot , the actress ' hair shine more than ever . however , is it always like that ? do not advertiser fear people to stop buying a product because they were deceived by the difference with the ad ? actually , even if it is not to be more honest with people , some advertiser use other technique to sell their product . they can choose to criticize their competition in order to make their product look better by comparison . it is what is importat in the end that the buyer choosse your product over the others . it wa used by coca cola in a spot in which a little girl show her deceivement with thw voice of a godfather when she is given a pepsi cola and not the coca cola she ordered . advertising could also use reversed psychology , maybe to play with people curiosity , like the campaign using do not go and see that movie , it is bad for instance . to conclude , i would say that whereas other technique exist , most advertiser make product seem better than they really are . nowadays , eventhough people know all they see in advertising is not true , they fall for it anyway and that is how tha consumption society got this far .
