i agree with the statement that successful people should try the new thing even it will take risk . as the discus below : first of all , it is true that successful people have already had their own bussiness , and if they still engage the same bussiness , they can do them very well . but we can not ignore the extra income of the other opportunity . it like why some famous company will renew their good again and again . because they know if they can creat the new good which are better and can be accept by the client , it will feedback much more profites than before . so consider about these , those worry on risk are not very important . further more , every new taste for those successful people is mean a new task in their life . for instance , bill gates , the ceo of microsoft , is very famous for his adventuresome behavior . at first he creat the system of personal computer-dos and windows . after that , he turn his sight to the interenet surfing tool-ie . maybe someone will hold their view for bill gates , but no one can ignore his way of thinking . at last , the value of one person also depend on the result of his career . many successful people have many different kind of career . those different kind of career wa not build by one day or one time . these people also do them one by one . and in the end , they catch their goal one by one , just like some famous scientist , newton , aistance and aidicent . to sum up , successful people should try new thing , that is why human being can develope very quickly . because under every risk , it will give back more valuable thing in the furture .
