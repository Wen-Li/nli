nowdays people use advertisement to show their product ; or to commercialize it ; but usualy they push much more on these advertisement . i mean they show their item pretier or say something that 's not true about it . i think that 's abuzing on costumer trust . example : when you are usig a phone card the time remaining is generaly le than they said . another example is car ; the preformance they said about it is false . so a costumer i agee with the statement , and i think people should take time to make a right choice before buying their item . and campanies should show the right side of their production .
