i strongly agree with the statement saying that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i have two reason for this . first of all , travelling in group is far more exciting than travelling alone which may be quite boring . moreover , experients showed that people are more excited to go see new place when they travel in group than when they travel alone just a the experiment that show that peolple eat more when they eat in group . one member of the group can motivate the curiosity of others and vice versa . the second reason why i have this opinion is that when you travel , of course , you want to know and see new place , but where are you going to see those new place if you do not have someone to guide you . of course , you can use a map but how useful will be the map to you when you want to see a many place a you can see ? instead of spending time reading a map you would be on your way to see a very exciting geyser , for exanple . furthermore , there may be a language barrier . if you travel alone , even though you could hire a guide , but where are you going to find him or her and how good will that person be in guiding your through the city and place you want to know ? in my opinion travelling in group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel because it brings you all what you need during a trip in just one place . in other word you have everything at your armreach .
