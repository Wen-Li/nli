enjoy life at every age all people in a society can not be happy with the condition or lifestyle that they are living in . this may be based on the socio-economic condition or spiritual reason . there is common belief in public that , young people are enjoying their life rather that the older peole . this is totally incorrect , since these kind of generation can not be applied to every society . the level of enjoying life is determined by the level fulfillment of wish , not with the level of age . to start with , we should look at the age group and their lifestyle in the society . for instance country like germany ha a high rate of old people . in contrast , country like turkey ha a high level of young peole . but , it can not be said that that wish fulfllment of young people in turkey is greater than germany . the social and economic condition may bring joy for the older people in an industrialized country . it is not surprising that older people from those country are travelling around the world and having fun . it is obvious that , they are having the greatest time in their life , since they do not have any reason to worry about . they living peacefully and with lack of stress . in other word , they are enjoying life more than younger people . to go one stage further , working young people should be considered . in deveolping country and even in industrial country people are forced to work at early age . this is because of the financial requirement . they have to prove themselve in the society and start earning money . otherwise , they can not stand in the against the hard rule ofthe capitalist economy . ailtougt there are case that young people are enjoying their life by going to club , bar , or spend most of their time on entertainment but somehow they have to start working and face with the truth of the wild world . in addition to this , most ofthe young people , who ha been seen like having fun infact performing aroleplay . the latent tru inside is toatally different . to sum up , when all the thing above are taken into consideration , the generalization in a society that express the level of satisfaction . it is obvious that people are enjoying life at any age that is most suitable for them .
