some people may be called successful when they do new thing and get success . whatever they do for success such a taking risk , putting a great effort , working continously without rest can be listed a a reason for their success . i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and i stongly believe this . when people try new thing they might face some problem . to solve those problem they should take risk for one or other reason . for example take a student who is doing his basic in math . suppose he is well known with the addition and subraction and to go further that is to know about multiplication he ha to take risk . this may include spending more time in studying or caluclating because it is a new topic and he need more practice in that . and coming to a project leader he guide his student about the same project for year . he may find it easy and also perfect to in doing that . when he go for other project that is new to him he should take risk in doing that . it includes studying the project , finding a solution for that , and to teach his student in an efficient manner . this make him successful . i can give another example of a successful person . he wa dhirubhai ambani one of the famous industriliasts in india . he cam from a village to city and started cloth bussiness . he got success in that because he know how to do well in that bussinees . but he wa not consiered successful untill he tried some other business other than his cloth business . he shifted to petroleum industry and he offered a low price of petrol that others didnt give . and also he started a telecom industry and he gave the lowest price of mobile and aslo the calling rate when compared to others . this signifies the risk taken by him and then he became a successful person and also an inspiration to others . so doing the same thing make u perfect in that perticular task but not a successful person . to be a successful person u should try new thing and take risk in acheiving them .
