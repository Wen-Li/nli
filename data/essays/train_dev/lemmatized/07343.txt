although the argument ha been made that travel with tour guide is best way to go to somewhere , in my point of view , i would like to travel without tour guid and some people . when i go to a travel a a group , i always have some problem about where will we go to next and why they to begin with , without some people and tour guid , i may not go to some place where i would like to go and take some picture . if i travel with some people and tour guid , i can go to that place and i have to follow the rout that the tour guid lead . in addtion , the tour may not provide the place where i want to go so that the tour may be waste of money . if i have a chance to travel famous place , i want to chose place myself . second reason i should mention is that i have to take care of a lot of people . this is great stress to take care of all opinion and use a lot of energy , so that i can not enjoy my travel . and also , there must be some trouble among people . for instance , people dislike the tour that we will travel tomorrow , that people criticize the tour guid . and also , when people do not arrive on the time , we may miss some event which is very famous at place where we visit . therefore , when we travel and visit a lot of people , we have to have some risk a travel the tour . considering all of above factor , i disagree this statement that travel with group of people and guid tour is best way to visit somewhere because of some risk for people and following guid 's direction .
