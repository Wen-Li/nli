now a day young people are noy give enough time to helping thir community . i agree with this statement . becoze people are now living in high compitation world . thats why there is no time to give any help to thir communicates . in this compitation world every young people try to get a possition in a society . and is trying to reach teir goal . for exampe in the case of education many people tried to provee what he is . in this way they are trying maximam of 18-20 hour they have concentrated on their educaton . in this time they do not think about their community . and in another way is they are increced thir selfishness along with growing compition world . i meean that it is not good behaviour but we must do this and continue due to we are live in compitation world . souppose he interested on community he will loose one step towards his goal . i mean that every people is do not trying to proove them self due to their own problem . for example the person who roming on the road side are having no work but they do not try to do help the their community . becoze of their life are omited towards the acheeverside . i agree that the young people only are busy that they view on their side . but it is very wrong thing that we are neglecting increcing of our soceity towards growth . it is very wrong thing that what the youth doing their own work . but it is the only way to give up that person in the soceity . finally i agree that the above mention example are show that my oppenian on our comment .
