comparing to previous generation , many of today 's young people have forgotten the importance of their community . instead , they are now focusing on their own leisure time , such a playing video game and watching television . it is a fact that many young people do not give enough time to helping their communitires . since today 's development of technology , many thing seem fascinating to people . especially to the young people , who are curious about the society . there are too many thing that young people want to experience and try , and it also includes many negative thing , such a smoking and drinkging . unlike today 's people , our previous generation learn to treasure their community because they felt responsible to their own environment ; it is something they were told when they were young . unfortunately , today 's value are different from before ; people concentrate on physical enjoyment . but , while they are experiencing the sensation of enjoyment , they are also ignoring their obligation to their community and society . in school , we all have learned to be responsible to our surroundings ; however , many of u have forgotten the real concept of this responsibility . further , there are many example of helping community . for an example , maintaing the cleaness and order of community is everyone 's obligation because everyone is a part of the community . but , the many young people do not realize the importance of this obligation . when the elder ask them for some working , they are usually respond with bad or unpleased attitude ; they think it is a waste of time to help the community . by looking closely , i see many negative thing that will happen a those young people become adult . our society will be decadent if the government is ruled by lazy people ; more scarily , it is not only a joke but a truth of today 's young men . however , our society have already realized the importance of correcting the young people 's attitude . they first begin the work at school by requiring community service for each student before they graduate from school . this is an important step to start with , because school is the place where everyone go to . besides the effect of community service , many school now also spreading the idea of protecting our environment . personally , i see these two thing are start to work in many young mind . finally , before we act anything , we should first notice that earth is our home ; we are all the owner of this planet ; therefore , while we are enjoying our physical happiness , we should also do something for our community . the community is not only our home but also belong to our offspring . even a bit of work we contribute to the community can make a change in society . lastly , we should provide a clean and healthy environment for our child .
