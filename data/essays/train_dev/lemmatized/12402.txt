the future and prosperity of any nation lie in the hand of the youth . young people are more dynamic and actlve than the old people . the are srrong physically which give them scope to enjoy life more than the older people . if we take teenager into account they are very keen and enthusiastic about their life , a they have just stared with it . the posse the zeal and interest to to do adventure where a the older people can not . for example my brother wa 18 year old when he decided that he would become apilot i future . he wa very excited to take up the training class . my grandfather opposed his decision a he wa scared to imagine that his decision may risk his life in future . eventhough he could appreciate his decision he could not dare to send him for training . after several heated discussion my brother finally won over and got trained to be a pilot . it invovled lot of hardwork and darring . he could not have taken this job if he really liked to do it when he turn old . young people tend to make their life adventurous and try out new thing . they dont bother about the consequence . they enjoy thing like dating girl , which the old people hesitate to do a they think about their responsibility . when we are young our health permit u to taste a wide variety of tasty dish which the older people can not relish due to their health limitation . when we are young we can take the chance to experiment new thing like bussiness or career and even if we fail we can still start up from the initial piont a we have the time and patience in our life . where a the old people can not dare to venture a life doe not permit them with sufficient time . one can not always state that the old people dont enjoy they enjoy thing but in a different way . expierience had taught them lesson and they do thing cautiously . they can not always do what they want to do . as per my view it is at the young age we live up to our own choice .
