unfortunately i have to agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not invest enough time to help their community . in my opinion a possible reason for this development might be the lack of a strong incentive for the young people to spend their precious free time on helping the community instead of maybe hanging out with their friend , playing video game etc . as especially city grow to become more and more anonymous , young people do not see the reward of their work in the community a they would in a smaller one where everyone know each other and the youth would get more appreciation for their voluntary work . this is , of course , a misconception , because volunteering for a good cause is appreciated in both environment , it just may be not a obviously to the young people . so the question is : what do the youth do with the time that they once spend on helping their community ? they spend it on activity that they simply find more pleasurable . in fact , this is a trend that we can detect in all layer of society and in all age , we do not need to search for this phenomenon among young people only . of course , it is more fun going to the cinema than helping elderly member of the community . so what we need is incentive . we could get incentive from the parent , helping their kid realize at a young age that it is important to take responsibility and help out in the community at least every once in a while , depending on the child . small activity done for the community may be more important and more valued than one might think and every kind of work is strongly welcomed and appreciated . the community itself must have a strong core in order to create network and to attract the young people through for example specific institution and activity only for the young . i say this , because i believe that only if the zoung people can identify themselves with their community , at least to a certain extent , will they be willing to become an active member and help by investing a bit of the work a well .
