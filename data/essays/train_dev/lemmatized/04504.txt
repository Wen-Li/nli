yes , i agree with this statement . i think when student understand the idea , of course they will learn the fact . firstly , student should n't concentrate on the fact , when they just starting to learn it . i am a student , i know it is more important for me to understand how doe the teacher think about the question and the way she think , what are the important point , and how can i catch it . therefore , i can translate it into my own way , and then i can find the fact . secondly , student suppose to know that we studying not only for the test or the deploma , we want to make u more knowledgable , so they should consentrate on the idea but not the fact . athought the fact is also important , it is more important to understand the idea . thirdly , a my opinion , i really prove that understand idea is more important . when i in the primary school in china , i learned all the basic algebra . but at that time , i am too young to understand the idea , so i just remebered the fact . after i graduated , i went to amiddle school , i found that i completely confused about all i learned in primairy school . so after that , i know to understand idea and concept than it is for me to learn fact . i remebered that a famous author said : first , you should learn the fact , but after that it is more important for you to uderstand the idea , the way that people using to think . on the other hand , if you just learn the fact , you just copy the answer into your mind . it is same like you eat the food which other people have already eaten . nobody want to be a memory machine , student should be the people who invented the idea . in a word , understanding idea and concept are more important than just learn the fact . in that way , you are a wise person .
