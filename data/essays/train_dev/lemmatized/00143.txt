personally i completly agree with this statement . not only i think this statement is true , but also that this statement express just how successful people should think and act . i 'm sure that one of the most important guideline to follow in life is that if you want to make money and be successful , first of all you have to spent a lot of it ! all the successful people such a factory owner , broadcast owner or for example fashion label owner have always clearly in their mind the sense of keeping evoluting their company and buying or creating new one . i also think that one of the most important thing for successful people is to enlarge and extend a much a they can do their business in order to get more money , of course , we all know that `` money make the world go around '' , but also for a feeling of desiring power ! it really doe n't have any sense for me to stop at what you reached . .. keep going on and further should be the right way to live our working life . i can pick up a very well known example of a person which ha been really successful : silvio berlusconi . the intention is not to discus about he 's politic idea , but to analyse goal a person ha reached . a man which ha always lived following this principle . at the beginning he started creating a new broadcast and later kept creating and developping new company . some of these always in the field of medium , but some not , like the italian football team ac milan which he bought 20 year ago . another example can be seen in the american bill gates . can you imagine if he would have stopped creating and inventing computer software after the really first version which made him gain a lot of money anyway . probably we would be now le evoluted . bill gates is that kind of example that make me think that this risking , sometime innovative and brave people are , in some occasion , also very important for the evolution of mankind itself .
