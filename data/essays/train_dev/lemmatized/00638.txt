some people say that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing whar they already know how to do well while other people disagree . in my opinion , however , i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk because new thing can stronly appeal to people , they are different from other thing , and it is hard to be on the top with the same thing . firstly , it is generally agreed that new thing can strongly appeal to people . when a computer wa firstly invented , people extremly got excited about the new convenient machine . now most of people have at least one computer in their house . actually , the invention of computer wa a sensation for the last century and also a good example of a new stuff that brought the success to the inventor . secondly , they are different from other thing . when a thing is different from all others , it get it own speciality . this might get extremly possitive effect or extremly negative effect . however , it is worth to challenge for the great success . normally , successful people try to make or do new thing while taking amount of rick . lastly , it is very hard to be on top with same thing because there are already a bunch of same thing in the world . it is very hard to win in the market with same stuff with others . as time go , people start to look for something new and fresh . to sum up , it seems clear that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already how to do well with three reason stated above . in order to be a successful person , they always try to make or do new thing firstly rather than other people .
