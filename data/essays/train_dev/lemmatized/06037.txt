i do n't agree that the best way to tavel is in a group , specially a group led by a tour guide . there are some reason why . firstly , tour guide prepare the schedule about travel . they do this regardless personal preference . so we can not satisfied about their schedule about travel , because the travel is our travel , not their . as a result , a costomer may complain about their schedule . so i preper travelling alone scheduled by myself . secondly , travel in group led by a tour doe not provide personal time for u . a tour prepared schedule whole travel time in advance , so they shoud punctuate the time . as do that , they complish their responsibility . as a result , we are very busy to obey that time , and we can not have enogh time to enjoy in one place that we are very interested specially . so we can not appreciate a place or landscape . i 'm sure that person each other must be having the thought of preference . they 'll be unsatisfied about this schedule . thirdly , there are many people in a group , so i can not have my time . in my case , i like to picture the sight , enjoy and think about the place , and meditate alone and silently . but , in a group , there are noise about conversation and voice of tour guide , so i can not concentrate to my notion .
