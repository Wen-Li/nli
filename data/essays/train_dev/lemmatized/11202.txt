i think is true that advertisement make product seem better than they really are , in fact the researched effect of advertisment is that people will buy the product . to get this result there could be two differents way . the fist is based on spot : if you want to sale something it is natural that you will show it quality even exagerating ; in commercial world there is alway a fight to get more and more buyer and it doe n't have importance if the product ha really the stated quality , the only important thing is that someone buy . on the other hand showing a product better than it really is ha a negative conseguence , a person who had bought this product expecting some caracteristics will not be satisfated about that product , so it is possible that in future he or she would not buy it another time . an other policy should be to spent le money in spot and more to make the product better , so a owner will found all the requested quality in the product and will buy it another time . the negative aspect is that people will probally buy often the product they have already seen even if it cost more than others . in conclusion i think that for company will be easier to spend money on spot because it give immidate result while the other way semm to be more difficult . it is on the owner to understand if the product is actually a good a the advertisement make or if it is only a way to make people convinced to buy it .
