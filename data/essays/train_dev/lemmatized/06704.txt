i do agree with this statement . people who want to be successful are usually tired of the life they are living , and this implies that they want to achieve something more , something new . they know that in life you must work hard if you want to get something , you must be ready to challenge yourself and risk everything to reach your goal . of course there are also many people who get all the thing they want without making any effort and without deserving those thing , but a person who worked hard in order to make his or her dream or hope come true , is in the end the real winner , the real successful person . being successful is not only a matter of being able to get what you want , that is only the material result . what make someone really successful is the growth a a human being that took place in this person s mind and soul during the way to reach his or her goal . facing change and difficoulties , a well a being able to take the risk of an insuccess , this person ha not only got the thing he or she worked for , but ha also learnt the real value of thing , the value of work and dedication . putting your heart , your mind , you soul , your everything in something . . that is what make someone really successful .
