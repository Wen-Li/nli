i would say that young people give or may not give enough time to help their community . it depend upon individual mentality . if one wish he can help but it depends on many factor like time , interest , responsibality and many more . if one want to help he wil help without considering these factor co he may love helping them . if one doe not want to help even if he ha all those factor he wil not help . for example if one see his parent suffering from some pain he may not help . there may be many reason for this also like not freindly atmosphere with his parent etc . helping one need courage because without it one is nothing in his life . so one need this factor also . one might not help because he might hav been had busy shedule like work and many more . if one is busy even if he wish he will not be abel to help one . helping communuties not requires young people but all the age . nowadays some youngster are become so busy spending their time in pub , caffe day , eatouts they waste their tome spending in these place so where will they get the time for communuties . but some are not indluged in such activity so that they get enough time to spend . so such people are very effectioned towards such communuties . but one is more interested to get wealth so they far away place in such situation they might have enough time ot give their communuties . even they may indulge in some friendship which avoids them to stay far away and not give enough time . hence i conclude saying that it depend upon individual mentallity to give enough time ot give their communuties .
