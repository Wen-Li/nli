i disagree with this statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' nowadays many of social and political problem are appearing in front of u . many people are talking about their idea and what is the conceps of this problem . but actually there is nothing resolution because they did not think about fact . we should know the truth of the problem and everythings . many problem are happened in real life . but they are apt to be in side of their own idea and concept . usually people do not want to know what is the fact . this i the reason why people can not exit from the problem . this is the reason why student should learn fact . if people do not know about fact they can entered misconception easily . in my country their are many of education system but usually those system are only looking for idea and concept . when i wa young i went to elementary school in mu home country i lessoned moral class and science and many other subject . they taugth only their idea and what is the best way and concept of that topic . but when i came out from the school i thought it wa not true . in the real life we can not find teacher 's idea and concept easily . we can see the fact and the truth . some studants can get in trouble easily by these reason they do not about thess behave they know only thing which teacher said to them . this is my another reason why i prefer student to learn the fact and truth . people have their own idea . it would be really much idea . also these idea are used to purchase only right way . it is not only hard to get that much idea and but also we can use these idea in the real life . we should keep adjusting to our neighbor and other people . from these reason i think to learn fact are more important to student than idea and concept . it would make much easier to them in the future
