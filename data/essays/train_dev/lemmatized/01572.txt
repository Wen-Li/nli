the use of the car ha an hisorical process that involve f , economical interest and habit that make u now to have , in the developed country , almost one car each . if we have a look on the recent statistic about the use of the car and we look at the trend it `` s very difficult to prospect a diiferent situation in the next twenty year . i am almost sure that the number of the car in use in the 2006 will be more than the one we have today . as i wa sayng above there are too many thing related with the use of the car such a economical interest and human habit . the huge amount of money connected with the car field is in the main part related at the petroil world and at the petroil company that have too many interest in increase the production and the sell of the car that are one of the main petroil user because of fuel used by theyr engine . an other important reason that , for me , will rise the number of the car in the next twenty year is linked to our habit . it is shown in many sociology study how is difficult to change our feeling , our thinking connected with our background , our habit . well , the car is one of the thing we use more often during our lifetime even if we do not drive it and we are just passanger . since we are child we consider the car a a part of our life and i think will be very diffult for people to reduce the use of the car . finally , to evaluate i think that both economical interest and our habit according with the statistical trend of the use of the car wiil take u in the future to face more car and , thus , likely an even more polluted world , at least for the next twenty year . i hope that later people will start to change theyr habit and money will be not the main target of our life in order to use mor pubblic transportation or different kind of energy .
