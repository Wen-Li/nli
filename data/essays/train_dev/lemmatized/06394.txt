i agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . i think that life is about risk taking and when you do not take risk you let opportunity pas you by . if you were bold enought to take the risk and you managed to accomplish it in a succesful way you will have gained a lot , yet if you did not accomplish it in an accurate way you still gained a lesson . doing what you already know how to do well is a convenient way of spending your life , yet by the time you are older you will realized that you could have made much more . by not taking risk you are sure that you will not have negative consequence but , you are also sure that you will not gain more that you have in that moment . it is well known that most of the discovers and invention that build the theory we use today , were discovered by research that took many risk . for example , say you are making a research project and you know from theory that by letting the variable unchanged you have big chance to get a certain result . if you continue with the experiment in this way , you will prove the result you expected , and will have a research project that proved something that wa know before . this doe not mean it is not valuable , on the contrary this type of research is also valuable since theory were made year ago and there may be some condition today that can change the result . but what if you decide to change a variable and see what it happens , you might be discovering the cure for aid , for example . in case like this , taking risk can lead you to succesful event . there is a mexican saying that state `` if you do not take risk you have le opportunity to win '' . and it is quite true since by not taking risk you diminish your poll of opportunity . it is also true that taking risk do not guarantee , every time , a positive outcome it may in fact turn out to be a negative one ; yet you will not know what would happen until you try it .
