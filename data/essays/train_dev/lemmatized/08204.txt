intro-advertizements-role-media-halo-role models-glamorize - the role of medium ha reached it zenith in this age . right from a common daily-need item like a toothpaste , to a something more in vogue like a new designer brand apparel , or of technical importance like a new tv , a automobile , or a computer-all need the medium to make them appealing , or to lure people to buy them-irrespective of whether or not people need them . infact , these advertisement `` create a need '' rather than catering to the need of those who are in the process of making a decision on something they already need to buy . advertisements , more than often , project a product in a way that the actual effect of the product advertised fall short of the description ! for example , the advertisement on body cream project such flawless , smooth , enticing body , although when used , they do not caste the same glow and charisma to the body of those who use them ! another example is of a stain remover . most of them are ineffective , and if they are effective , they ruin the very color of the garment itself along with the stain . what is annoying is the way they are romanticisedlet aside the idea presented in which using it would mean adding romance to a moment , or finding the right guy ! such deception of adding extra charm to a product entices buyer . advertisements cast a halo around an item , adding glamor to it by choosing attractive model to sell for them . people , especially younger generation to be more precise , get very affected by looks-outer appearance . they tend to copy model and movie star etc . they are in an age that is very influential . when these individual watch their favorite model seeling for something , their first impulse is to buy that item . in the process , they seldom realize whether the product is worth it or not . at time it is of no use what-so-ever . for instance , recently there wa an advertisement that flashed on the tv screen , which wa unnecessarily glamorized , although the product wa anything but glamorous or flashy . it wa an advertisement for a pain relieving pill ! is it necessary to romanticise something like a pain reliever ? and who is being targetted ? unfortunately , the more vulnerable part of the society-the younger generation becomes a victim . in my view , such deception are harmful . they do nothing to bulid a society , rather making it dependant on item people would never have needed otherwise . this doe n't mean that advertisement do n't have their place at all . but if they are more discriminative in their depiction , it would be more fair .
