according to my point of view , sucessful people try new thing and are likely to take more risk . the main reason would be the fact that when a person manages to achieve a goal , he want to have something new and more difficult to do . human being are hardly satisfied and i ca n't help thinking that when somebody ha succed in something , he will always want more . alpinists , for exemple , do n't usally stop climbing after they managed to reach their first summit . they always want to climb an other montain , harder and higher . napoleon 's bonaparte , the french emperor and conquerant did n't stop going on war and facing battle until he wa finaly defeated . and i think because he wa sucessful in a first time , he could n't get rid of his will of power . an other reason would be the fact that sucessful people can start being bored by what they do , even if their activity match success . so to avoid this phenomenon , they just start a new thing . we can find this kind of behaviour in sport . we can take the exemple of a great champion such a valentino rossi , who had won dozen of world championship . well , he is now looking forward to become a forula one driver . because he want something new . something that give him the opportunity to achive a other great goal . a last important factor is , according to me , the fact that when somebody managed to win something , or to earn something , he would probably want to get more of it . no matter if it is money , glory or power . the joy of winning might even be more important than the profit whitch came with this success . a good exemple would be a poker player or a gambler . after winning some money , they would probably bet more of it . and it is actualy dificult to get rid of this circle .
