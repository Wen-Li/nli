i agree the statement that '' it important for student to understand idea and concept it is formed than it is for them to learn fact '' ... at the university ? used to be a stajyer teacher and ? had time to observe student easily . when student starting to learn a new subject the most important thing that the teacher have to learn how much information that the student have about that subject . bas ? cally the way or technique of teaching to a student start with testing . ? t the important way for the way which you are going to teach with . to learn what they know , to grab their attention with chiming them in , to show them most of them in the class do n't know so many thing about that subject , to get their idea from the name of the subject although they dont know anything on it etc . . when the introduction part finished the other step for teaching is to try the main idea for the subject . this is the most important part . because it the first part that the student start to learn something about that subject and pay the most attention to the teacher with the happ ? ness to learn new thing . probably this is the most effective part on the student also if they interested the subject they would love to learn other part of it , if not the attention will fall down . the fact about the subject is le interesting or on the other hand most useful but easily forgetable part . for example think about you when you were at primary school you started to learn how to write and read . are you remember any fact of them or ? can ask you like this ; are they any fact of reading or writing ? i think no ! as a result we can say that understanding idea and concept of a subject is more important than it is fact . when you a student learn the main idea he/she can use his/her mind easily and get the subject correctly with a help of a teacher or a person .
