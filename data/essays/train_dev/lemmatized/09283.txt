why are student go to school to study ? do you think that they can acquire knowledge by only learn the fact ? i really think that student can acquire knowledge because they can understand the idea and concept . if we only learn about the fact , we can not get a full picture of the knowledge . we can only understand part of the material that we learn . therefore , i think that to understand idea and concept are more important than to learn the fact . the first reason is that if we can understand the concept , this can reinforce our knowledge . for instant , we know that we need to wash our hand before we have our meal . but , why we need to wash hand . i f we understand that our hand are full of germ , we need to wash hand before eating so a to reduce the chance of getting sick . the second reason is that fact only teach u thing in one incident only . however , we can learn many other fact providing that we understand a concept or a idea . let u refer back to the example of washing hand before meal , we know that hand are full of germ is a fact . we can infer form this fact that we can reduce the chance to get sick . if we understand the concept then wemay know that we need to wash hand before we touch a wound . they share the same concept . these are only some example of the advantage of understand idea and concept . i think we can really get more improve in our kn
