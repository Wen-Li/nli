is it generally accepted that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community ? in my opinion , i totally agree about the statement . i believe that young people really do n't give enough time to helping their community . i will argue the statement for some follwing reason . first of all , parent nowadays expect their child can get high education , so child 's activity always studying not community . because the society becomes more and more wealthy , parent have much time to take care of their child for their performing in class . for example , in order to achieve their expectation of education , parent usually take their child to cram school , that really occupy much time for young people . secondly , because of the developing game producing , young people nowadays usually stay home for playing game not go out to communicate with others . for instance , it is fashion to play ps2 nowadays , young people in order to get high grade in the game , they have no interest to go out or make more friend , and they even do n't have any time to commuciate with other people . to sum up , because of the high educated expectation and the fascinating game , young people nowadays focus on book or game instead of community . therefore , it is my preference that young people do n't give enough time to helping thire comunities nowadays . and i think that is not a good phenonmenon for the future , so we should find some resolution to improve this .
