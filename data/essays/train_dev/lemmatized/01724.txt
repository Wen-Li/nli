being successful and happy is the main aim of many people . there is an ongoing debate about whether sucess is achieved by trying new thing and taking risk rather than only doing what ha been known well . in my point of view , people who are doing what they are know how to do well have more possibilty to become successful . the main reason for my point is that there is le uncertainity when people do thing they know well . because , when there is uncertainty we may not be sure whether we are on the accurate way or not . it is an inevitable factor that in order to be successful , we need to work regularly . under uncertain situation , planning is a very hard task . thanks to the certainty , we can plan our task and follow our progress clearly . also , people learn to be more efficient by doing thing they know . another reason for my point is we may only waste our time and money by trying new thing . according to research , most of the research and development project are resulting with failure . instead of trying new thing , if we concentrate on what we are doing best , we can oproduce more favorable outcome . another reason for my point is dependency of trying new thing mostly on luck factor . may be some people are lucky to be successful by trying new thing . but these people are very limited in number . we only heard story about people who took risk and become success in publication . what about other people took risk and failed ? they confront with the hard face of life . whereas , most of the people who became successful ha progressed step by step . i think it is not worth to risk my career and living standard in order to be successful . i prefer to be successful step by step with countinious working . to sum up , people become successful by doing what they are doing best . by doing so , they reduce uncertainy , they can do more clear plan and they achieve step by step . whereas , the other alternative way of being successful is quite dependent on luck and may result in only waste of resource .
