personally , i outgh to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because i am a person of open mind , for exemple in my personel case , i am student in chemical engineering but i am interesting in chemestry too , in fact in france people who study chemical engineering do not understand anything in chemistry subject , maybe it will be crazy but is true . i had made differents intership in peru and france and i saw this problem . i . these subject were in chemestry and chemical engineering , i did not afraid because i think i have broad knowledge in both . during my study at university i learned to work in specific and general subject . i got the capacity for working in both of them . in fact i have a few knowledge in differents domaines like management work group , computer system , in my opinion it is very interesting to know a little of differents subject . the maners of company are interested to recrute people who can work in differents subject because it could be more easy to give them differents responsabilitys because they are more adapted to changed . in this globalization world people have to have an open mind for getting more oportunites in the life work . if people is specialize in one specific subject they wont understand the differents way to resolving a general problem . finally , i think is a personel decisition to have the knowledge in particular or many general subject
