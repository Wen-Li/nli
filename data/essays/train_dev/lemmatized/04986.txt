everybody can notice that nowadays the mass medium is the most powerful thing that can leave a massive influence on u special on taneegers & child . actually i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are & that is because of tow reason . the first reason is they do all the advertising about something in a wonderfull way that show you it is the best thing for you & you cant live without it . then , you discover all these advertising for nothing really worth it . for example : once i watched on t.v an advertising about a straightner for the hair to make it straigh so they made that in a way that all the people will thought it really cool & you will have healthy hair , next i bought it & guess what ?? it wa really bad , it destroyed & burned my hair . another example : my boyfriend wa walking in the street & he saw poster about a rain-party , you can see from the poster that everything will be included the ticket but when he reached there everything in the poster wa a lie . the second reason , there is no sencor for the advertisement special on the internet , which that make alot of company & shop do whatever they want & laughed at people . once i met a friend she wa really angry so i asked her whats going on ?? she told me that she pooked adress throught the internet & she paid for it but when she went there to take it they told her that she have to pay more because she didnt come at the same day . in short , we must take-care of these kind of advertisement , also you have to be sure with who you are dealing . in my opinion the goverment should put sencor on the all advertisement in the mass medium . at the end dont forget to watch out & to think in a critical way when you communicate with these stuff .
