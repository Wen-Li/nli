cars are one of the device or tool that we use to commute from one place to another . if we want to find out `` what will be the fate of car in the next coming twenty year '' we have to cosider the technological , natural change that can take place in this time period . i agree with the prediction that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today by considering the technological revolution or natural change that have a great probablity to happen . technology is progressing day by day and we are getting a great invention of science in the period of two or three year . taking this fact into the account , we can think of the time when most of u will use aeroplane or some other vehicle to travel from one place to other and fewer car . our natural resource such a food and water , are becoming scarce because of their exploitation by human being and his intervention in the ecological system in a bad manner . and the resource may reach upto the level when only few people will have access to these and people will not be able to afford expensive vehicle such a car at that time due to limited money . and this will result in decrement of people using car . also in predicting the future of car , we can not neglect the calamity and disaster that may happen in the time period specified . for example , an earthquake that destroys the whole human civilization on earth come and some of the people survive this disaster . they have to restart the whole work from the scratch . and , they may not be able to reproduce device like car to travel from one place to other or at that time it may not become cost effective to have more number of car than there are today . in summary , taking into account the great technological progress that is going on and the exploitation of natural resource by the human being at a fast pace , we can predict the future of the car a being used in lesser number in the coming twenty year .
