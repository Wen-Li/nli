nowadays , there is a strong believe in that young people enjoy life more than older people do . this may be so due to the fact that young people lead more active daily life , working , going out , having greater physical ability , among other thing . however , i do not agree with that idea because of the elder 's free time to do a they please and their great wisdom in dealing with life 's problem gained by their life experience . even though we usually think young people 's life are very active and thus , they are happier and enjoy life better , when you come to a certain age above 65 , you can certainly concentrate on the activity you like doing better . young people are always in such a rush , especially in today ' world in which time is always related to money , that they fail to seize each moment 's priceless value . instead , when you become old , your ` working ' time is finished and you usually retire . it is then when you have the possibility of taking advantage of your free time a well a you please . for example , if you have always liked reading , now you have plenty of time to spend getting into the great magic world of word . another importnant point is that old people have more experience and that help them worship life better . when you are young , you always like experimenting new thing , no matter the cost . with every course of action you take , you take risk and then , when watching the consequence of your act you understand better what life consists of and what really matter to you . that is what happens to old people . as they have generally lived and experienced so many thing during the course of their life , at a certain age they seem to know the basic of life and , therefore , do not worry about so many thing a you may worry when you are a young adult . for instance , i have seen my grandmother smiling sympathetically at my very sad experience - like a break up with a boyfriend - while saying to me ... ` that ha happened to me more than once ' and then explaining how life go on and how there are more important thing to worry about . even though it is true each one of u ha to lead separate life and the fullfilment of our goal and the reaching of happiness depends on our personal experience , i strongly believe old people enjoy life more than young people do due to their having more time for doing their favourite activity and their enlightening past experience that show them better path to succeed in life . young adult , therefore , should always take advantage of elder people experience to learn , from very early age , how life can be always more enjoyable than it already is , always keeping our heart open to what the voice of experience can share with u .
