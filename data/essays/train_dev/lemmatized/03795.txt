in my opinion , people who are trying try new thing and taking risk are more successful than people who are keeping on doing what they know well . first , i will use my own experience to illustrate my opinion , i like to make birthday party for friend . that mean called people , book the restaurant , etc . a month ago , i made a birthday party for a friend of mine , since i 'm not a risky person with my friend , i did n't choose to make something completely new like strip club or something like that . i made a regular party like i do every year , restaurant and then clubbing . it wa supposed to be a suprise but i noticed that my friend guessed my plan before . on the birthday , he wa n't suprised at all . i guess if i would have done something different by changing my initial plan , my friend would be more enthousiast . i did n't take the risk of disappointing him . he would be more suprised by something new instead of that i kept on doing the same thing . in the worklife , i 'm quite different than i 'm in my private life since i like to take risk , discover new thing and improve myself in order to evolve in the company . by taking risk , i avoid being boring and unproductive at work . for example , my bos asked me to do a new software with some specification . i made all of that with the team , but i wanted to add some improvement that make the software more easier to use for a new user . some of the team member did n't agree with my thought because they wanted to focused on the specification and nothing else . i took the risk by myself , i did n't tell anyone of my will of adding new feature for the software . i added something that wa n't asked , i could be fired for that but in the other hand i could get consideration thanks to that . to conclude if you want to evolve in your worklife or even in your social life , i think you have to take risk in order to first , evolve in your company , prevent your life from being boring and discover new possibility of life . people who are always doing the same thing , do that thing well but they stay at the same level of accomplishment , they can upgrade their skill but not that much if you take risk .
