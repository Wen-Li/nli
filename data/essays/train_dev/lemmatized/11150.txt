i agree with the statement that young peole do not give enough time to helping their community . but first of in my opinion this is not a problem of the youth , it is a problem of the society in general . communitys and groubs seem to disappear or be le steady . often there is no deep connection anymore , somehow more artificial . so how should the youth help more in community when they doe not seem to be realy involved ? for example the family system ha changed masively during the year . some year ago the grandparent used to live in the household together with their child and the childrens ' offspring . so the contact between child and their grandparent wa mutch closer . as a result the teen more often helped to take care of the ill grandparent lying in their bad . on top of that not all young people went to school espacially the girl often only should work in the house so they had more time to hely in the community ` family ' than for example the girl today . so in these day the young people lived in different conditios so in my opinion it is difficult to compare the young people action in a comunity in the past and in the present . so all in all the whole society became more anonymious . on the one hand the people have more freedom and on the other hand they are le bound to social group or community and these logically ha an efect on their behaviour . so to my mind this feeling of beeing not responsible for the comunity is not a caracteruistic of the youth instead it 's a caracteristic of the whole society . on top of that the best help that a young person could do for his community and country is to be well educoated and get a good job to be able to pay tax for the community and to create new jobopertunuties for others . but finallzy i want to add that it can not be wrong if there would be more volunteer social work
