i do strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than older people can do . first of all i think that young people have something that frequently is not possesed by elderly ; that is good health . good health mean basically the possibility to travel all around the world and visit exciting new country . it mean also the possibility to practice new sport in the countryside or outside in the fresh air . for example but it is also necessary to live with dignity . secondly , young people do not generally have great and impellent responsabilities but they can have a lot of freedom to go out with friend , go dancing , practice known sport , stay up late without any problem . moreover the fact that elderly people can have some problem in concentrating and remembering the thing they learn . this problem can seriously affect their chance to learn new thing reading book , which i believe it is one of the greatest thing to do to enjoy . another really important fact is that young people have a great social life which often lack in older people . to end up i would like to touch a very important issue that sadly affect our developed country . in several important and crowded city in the world it would be easy to find the majority of old people left alone in desolated apartment or even wostly in retirement house . the frenetic rythm of our society seem to emarginate the people regarded a unuseful so it is impossible for them to live in a life in wich every day is seen a a possible to enjoy life .
