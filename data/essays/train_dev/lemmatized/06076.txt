i think it is important for student to understand idea and concept to help them to learn fact . without the understanding of the concept and idea required , it will be difficult to catch the core of the passage or the thorey . of course , the fact will be useless when the main idea is not transported to the student . all of u have heard about the `` funny story '' . these information we heard from other people are meaningless in most of moment , but why we will lough to tear and catch the meaning of the word instead of just understanding the fact which mean nothing to you ? this is because the fact is like the lower-divison course which just lean the listener or the student to understand the surface of the word , yet more important information the `` funny story '' would like to send to the listener is the idea and concept , that is upper-division course , including under the surface of the story . i believe this is the key and most of u should be concerning about . while the fact sometimes really improve our cupboard of the knowledge of the news we are not familiar with . but the fact is thst it useness is such a little part of the mean benefit we transport the information . we should deduce sometime , to croop the inside idea and concept to learn the fact much more clearly . without the understanding the core of the delivered information we even will mis-understand the meaning of the fact and never will get rid of the darkness of the mis-understanding . bewildering amount of student just read about the time news to catch up the world and the camper . they hardly have the enthusiasm to dig a pool to summerise the mean idea of the situation they are facing . it is indeed the polution of the information surrounding them . as the result of this , with the incompllicated understanding , they make comment to others , and they always indulge in this mistake . this is just like a `` hoax '' or deception . they think they will never plead ignorence to anything without knowing that they are making the countless mistake . and these mistake will overtake and ruin them some day . only because these student could not see what is behind the fact , idea and concept .
