in my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic subject . first of all today 's research - and with it - education ha come so far in so much different academic subject that it is even difficult to be a specialist in one topic . and because of this , with broad knowledge you do n't have any clue from under the surface regarding any topic . you would be a generalist in many subject , but in no one a specialist . but in nowadays job situation you compete mostly with specialits - especially in research . and so i think for most of the job in economy you have to be a specialist . a controller in finance for instance . or an expert for girafs in a safary zoo . you would be right to doubt this for job in general . for example a head of a company should also have broad knowledge of many subject , because he ha his specialist working for and reporting to him . however , for many job it is better to be a specialist rather than being a generalist . that is also one reason , why education changed in the last decade . another reason for specializing in knowledge is that you do one subject right and get ` deep ' insider information and skill in it . you ca n't do that for a wide variety of subject . so you are an expert in one topic , because you learned and trained yourself to a large extend . that make you quite useful a an advisor for other people and an interesting speaking partner . and this also ha an positive effect to your psyche . because you know you are needed by your friend and customer not just for your personality or personal relationship to those people , but also for your special knowledge and experience .
