many book may have been written about the subject : `` 3 keys to success '' , `` 10 easy step to to reach the top '' . there might probably be even a `` comple idiot 's guide to success '' . but there is a thought that always come to my mind regarding to life story that achieved success . those people certainly tried new thing and took risk rather than sticking to routine . i can not but agree with the premise : innovator and risk-takers are the stuff for success . some people argue that once you find out what you are good at , you should stick to it . these strategy suggests that this conservative , risk avoiding behaviour , assures some kind of success while avoiding any chance to fail . but even people who enter this routine of doing always the same suffer failure sometimes . i must agree that i ca n't imagine einstein suddenly trying to succeed in football . yes , he should remain in the science field . but , on the other hand , his unquenchable desire for knowledge moved him forward in his research . his quest for the new , made him one of the famoust scientist there will ever be . on the other side , holding a totally different position , are restless people who are constantly trying new thing and risking everything to be singled out off mediocrity . people who take high risk , are focused on big gain . for example columbus undertook a risky trip , but his name remains written in every history book . the wrights brother went after a dream which wa deemed impossible in their time . these are the people from which we can say they are outstanding . while i do n't think we should go around doing crazy stuff , we should always try to escape routine . repeating ourselves too much , is like slow death . it never end in success .
