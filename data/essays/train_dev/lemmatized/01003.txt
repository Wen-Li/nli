the three main reason i will talk about to explain why sucessfull people like taking risk are the fact that they trust themselves , that they like creting something from scratch and that they want to learn more and reach more money . i would like to analyse successfull people who are people who already had a good experience and who managed to face their challenge successfully . this is very important because those people know that they are able to handle complex issue . and this will give you trust and insurance that will help you not to doubt in unknown situation . see the example of car manufacturer , you will easily attact a new market if you had been successfull on another one . for instance , bmw ha few doubt about it success by developping it suv . then , there is the fact that people who had been successfull like , according to me , starting from scratch . this is something very exciting not to see the route you will follow and discovering stape by stape your environment . you can analyse people who create their own company . they can choose the kind of product they sell , the way they pay their employee , the way you deal with the customer and so on . and the most important point : you have no bos and you do not receive any order thanks to the human size of your project . last but not least , people who succeed often know very well their domain ( this is why they succeed ) and this can explain their will to learn more about another field of technology . for example , a company like dassault which ha made plane launched it own computer aided design software because it wa able to afford it . and when you have been successfull in a field , you often earn lot of money which enable you to invest in new challenge . so this is , in my opinion , the three main reason why successfull people like taking risk . because they trust themselves , because they know how to do and because they can do it .
