after 20th century , car became one of the most familiar thing to people . now it is hard to find household which have no car . however , it affect environment seriously and also brings more and more traffic congestion . certainly it need some change and it will change to a positive way but we can not say there will be fewer car in twenty year . car is an essential one in our life and i would say even the society will not be properly going without car . in this situation , we can not imagine the life without car . not only personal car but also bus and taxi should be included . governments try to reduce the number of car in their country but it is not an easy process . firstly , they need get agreents from their people and who would give up their car ? without a brilliant solution , it will not work . however , there will be different kind of change , change on sort of car . many famous car company are traying to make more environment-friendly car for the future . hybrid car or electricity car can be good example . also , there are some people who make a car only using solar energy . once car company start to make those car , there will be even more people who want to drive a car because it that case , no need to spend lot of money for fuel . car ha got important status in our life already so nothing can replace it role like a mobile . it is into our life deeply and even more and more child get their own mobile . i think there will be a same situation in car market . more and more young people will buy car and it will be pretty easy to get a car in cheap price . to conclude , since those reason that i mentioned above , road will still be full of car after twenty year . it must be a different kind of car , however . environment-friendly , driver-fiendly car will appear in ten year and also we might welcome flying car like in a movie . flying car will be too further from but the important thing is car will not disappear ever .
