throughtout my life i have always try to do the most to have great mark on all the course i have ever took and all my experience have showed me how important is to understant idea and concept while i am studing . that is why i agree with the statement . obviously , in an exam you are required to have some specific knowlegde about the topic , but to have good score and to really understand the material it is more important to know how to connect the concept and the idea . the most important is to understand the main point , the main idea . since i began my political science university life i realised that it wa not enough to memorize all the political conceps the teacher explained to me . it wa not enough to memorize all the international regims or all the international agreement the country had signed . i wa required to say what the country gain or lose in signing them and this agrrements affect them . furthermore , normaly those thing that you are just memorized after you forget it so memorize concept is just a lose of time . once upon a time , nearly four or five year ago a took an exam on the history course . the exam wa about the second war . i always have been problem with the second war , the border change appears me so confusing so i wa the whole week studing for this exam . in consequence i took great mark on that course . but two year after , i took a international european relations course and in the final exam i wa required to explain the second war . what happened then ? i felt the exam because i had no dea about that conclict . that happened because four year ago i just had memorized the concept and the fact without understanding them . in conclusion , through my experience i have realised that it is more important for student and specially for me to understand idea and concept .
