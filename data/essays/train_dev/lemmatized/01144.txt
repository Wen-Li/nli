in my opinion there 's something true in this statement but it 's not quite accurate . succesful people are regared to be very rich , famous and wealthy . so if an famous actor decided to take the risk of quitting the movie buisness and to start a whole new career ( for example a professional football player ) he would n't be taking any risk at all . if he failed he would have enough money to survive this episode of `` new life finding '' and the whole world would report about his attempt to change his job . so everybody would know about his `` risky '' plan which is n't risky at all in fact because he 's got nothing to lose . inspite of this unsuccessful people would have huge problem if they tried to change their job because they would n't have any saving to life from if they did n't succeed . furthermore nobody would know about this risky attempt because no newspaper or tv station would be interested in this particular change . i think the medium give u the impression that successful people are trying new thing more often than the common people because we are directly confronted with their new idea . let 's give an example : david beckham ( a famous soccer player from great britain ) changed his haircut every few month and the whole world wa impressed by his new style and courage to do so . at the same time i dyed my hairy every week to another beautiful color but nobody execept my worried mum wa interested in this . fame and success make it possible to inform ( even without the intention to do so ) the huge mass about the new thing certain people are trying . another exemple : when arnold schwarzenegger decieded to start a political career every newspaper reported about this sensational event but when i won the election to the new head of the sport club not even the local newspaper wa interested in this . to summarize : successful people are n't taking more risk or trying new thing than the normal human being is , the only difference is that the medium report about them .
