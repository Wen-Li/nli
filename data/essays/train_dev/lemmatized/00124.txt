if you can explain from each topic a few thing it is good ; you have knowledge . however with your unfinished explanation you could confuse people even more . also in today world there is a request in people who have specialization on one topic . in today society it is better to have specialized your knowledge on on specific subject . having a little bit of knowledge in many topi is not so effecient in today society a if people are specialist on specific topic . for example most people know something about computer . when the computer is broken they may try to fix it with their limited knowledge . this however may produce even more harm . it would be better to bring it to a specialist on computer who know what he or she is doing and fix it properly . another reason for beeing a specialist is when you try to find a job . most buisnesses looking for people with special ability which are useful for their company . so if you have a lot of knowledge in a specific subject which they need you are more likely to get that job . when you are a specialist you can use your knowledge to research on your specific topic and might find out something useful . for example the wright brother knew a lot about flying . with help pf their knowledge they managed to built a plane which actually flew . and now look how far humanity got with the invention of the plane ; communitcation became so much easier . imagine what would happen if teacher would not specialize in a few subject . students would properly never be able to learn in depth about the idea represented in the `` scarlet letter '' . nor will they be able to learn how electricty work . teachers specilize on they subject so they can answer all the question one might have . it is very important to specialize you knowledge in one specific subject . with your knowledge you will be able to help people with problem including your specified topic . it is also easier to find a job since company are looking out for peole with specialization . the power of knowledge can also be used to improve the living standarts by researching on plane or deseases . however you should never forget to know something about the other topic . if you do n't you will isolate yourself from the rest of world because you do n't understand what is happening . so be sure to kow a bit of everything and at the same time specialize in one specific subject .
