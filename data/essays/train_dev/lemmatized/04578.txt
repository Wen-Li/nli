base on my own experience i totally agree the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . now i will give you my conspicious reason . first idea come in to my mind is the definition of successful , that is outstanding which ha the same meaning of standing out . it is to say those successful people should be different from ordinary people . how to be different ? the answer definitly not only doing what others already know how to do well . it is reasonable that the award usually go to those who try new think and take risk because they are outstanding . second try new thing and take risk can make people more open minded and gain more knowledge and finally make them successful . when try new thing you can get another point of view of the problem . i can remember that my senior design project wa to design a control system for hot blast stove . pervious people solve this kind of problem by classical control method , however my teammember and i decided to try intellengence method although our advisor warned u that we might fail . guess the result , we not only acheived our project successfully , but also got undergraduate research prize . reading the history book you may find that each huge development of the world ha some relationship with the new invention . and more and more school teach student the invent ability is the most important quality to become successful nowadays . look at another side of the statement and suppose that if people only repeated doing what they already know how to do well . no new theory , no new technoledge , no new application , how could the world get increasing development . from all the point i mentioned above we can drive a conclusion that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
