`` education is what remains with you after you finish schooling '' the statement explains that it is the knowledge you learn that remains with you than the fact . while at school student learn a number of fact and idea . the huge academic syllabus is a combination of both fact and idea . however the point that need to be focussed on here is , `` how much do student remember afterall ? '' they remember only what they learn and not what they mug up . therefore we can sum up a it is important to grasp concept while at school than merely registering fact and forgetting them later on . the endless chapter on history often fail to teach u what we are supposed to ` learn ' . for example , alexander the great wa a great conquerer . he conqured emdlessly . however being murdered and left wa what reached him to the almighty . here we need to appreciate his dynamism and heroism , not failing to see the other side of the coin that is , he wa over confident and wa consumated by his own avarice to conquer . we need to formulate our education system where student can develop there mental capacity . a developed individual would be self confident , reliable and a good human being . in this context , the ealier system of education in india is worth having a look at . the then school , called `` gurukuls '' , meaning house of the teacher , were considered sacred and holy . students would focus more on learning and understanding . ofcourse they were taught fact , but they knew how to use them and gain knowledge a well , which is the ultimate aim of education . a confident student , with understanding of basic concept would be more successful than one who ha simply mugged up fact which he will ultimately forget .
