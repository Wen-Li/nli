i disagree with that article . it is imagine that there is some subject what i have to solve , i have to explain with several reason of supporting detail . and those reason are help the explaining . for instance , i would like to deal with microwave . first , i should judge about the subject . i should have gradually motion if iwant to use the microwave . so i can think about motion how can i use the microwave . also , i have to deal with specific step . when i make the solution , i have to explain hte way more easily . for example , first step is what to do , second step is what to do . .. ect inconclusion , all these reason are appear that the one specialize specific subject are good . so it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject
