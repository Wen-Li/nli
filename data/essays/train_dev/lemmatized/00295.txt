in the near future there would be an increase in the usage of car because the price of the car are going down rapidly . advanced technology ha resulted in lesser production cost and efficient manufacturing technique . this will make car more affordable in the future . in the modern society time is considered more valuable than anything and there a growing emphasis on better time management . hence the general public might prefer private transport to the public transport because they can save more time travelling by car to their work place , college and so on , rather than waiting for bus or commuter train . this can contribute to a considerable growth in the usage of car . since there is a lot of research being done to develop alternative for petroleum , there is a possibility that some day a fuel might be developed which is more efficient and environmental friendly than the conventional fuel being used today . this might bring about a change in the pollution norm which have restricted the usage of car to a limit and might enable the usage of car extensively . a car ha always been a symbol of luxury and status in developing country . in the recent year many developing nation have registered a rise in the purchasing parity of the individual living in that country . this factor led to the increase in the purchase of car in such country . moreover new marketsing strategy and government policy will lead to a decline in the car price in such country which will make them more affordable than it wa in the past . because of all these possible reason i disagree with the statement that in twenty year from now , there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
