young people do enjoy life more than older people do . in my opinion , young people take more chance and risk , a well a they try to experience numerous thing when they get a chance . this because they have been presented more option in life , they are not a careful with their health a older people are , and they like to try new thing in every occasion they can find . life ha evolutionized and changed in many aspect in this last century . young people like to take chance and go for what them want . they tend to look beyond what is presented to them , and go beyond what is traditionally expected . sometimes the choice of something new and different may not be there , but young people will look for it , they will expand their horizon and go further out their boundary . old people have more tradition to follow . family value are strongly present in their daily life , so they have to follow certain life style that young people are not very interested in . when taking a risk , their is always a fifty percent chance it might work or it might not . that is what taking a risk involves . older people are most conservative and might be more afraid to take a risk . a young person is starting his or her life , and might see thing differently . they could see their future a an uncertainty for the present time , and might be le skeptical to go for it and take the risk of losing something . different than older people , they might not have a family to provide to or worry about . they might only need to worry about themselves . the value of thing is le important , because it might only have a monetary value , and not a sentimental value . this because they are young and have not been around for a long time . older people might appreciate thing more , since they have been here for longer . they apply more value to thing like a bracelet or ring , than just a financial price . a young person might think that if they lose it , they can replace it from any jewelry store . some experience come from practice . it can be practice that take a long time to achieve or simply practice that can be learned quickly by doing it a lot in a short period of time . older people are supposed to have more experience than young people . but it might be in fewer area . young people like to experience new thing and try differrent thing . they are more open and know that the world ha many different thing to offer , so they try most of them or a many a possible . they are young and healthy , which allows them to travel easier , and eat more ethnic food . in the other hand , older people have to take better care of their body , since their health is more at risk . they ca n't travel long distance and might need medication that are not always available everywhere . so they are not able to enjoy life a much a young people can .
