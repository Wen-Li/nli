young people are energetic and driven , so they have a responsibility to use their talent meaningfully . it is expected that they be enthusiastic about giving back to the community that raised them . but what action constitute `` helping '' our community ? voluntary work at non-profit organization seems to be the easiest answer . small act of kindness - like helping a senior citizen cross the road - are often cited a way for young people to serve the community . i believe that any work - paid or unpaid - done for the right intention should count a helping our community . having said that , i think that the amount of time young people nowadays devote to their community is regrettably lacking . i personally know a few young people who have never done an hour of voluntary work in their life . not only are they uninterested in the welfare of their fellow citizen , neither do they see any point in serving their own family member or friend . since they fail to see beyond themselves , there is no hope that they will give any time to help the community at large . most educated young people have a vague sense of responsibility involving their community , but there are so many distraction that prevent them from devoting time to it . peer pressure , new technology , the mass medium and pop culture simply teach them all to concentrate on themselves and try to live a happy , materialistic life . it is a pity , since so many young people are lead away from exercising their civic responsibility . no matter how much they are told by parent to help their community , it is impractical if there are so many distraction in their life . many young people do a small part in helping the community by doing community service . however , performance is n't satisfactory either . even if they are doing voluntary work for no monetary pay , many young people are inevitably waiting for payment in some other form - point for an academic scheme , an impressive mention in their resume , or an award for `` outstanding service '' . if they are intent on these superficial reward , what follows is that the extent of their help will not be proportionate . moreover , what little heart they have for service will diminish quickly , and of course this is definitely not `` enough '' . in some situation , it is certainly understandable that young people choose other activity over service . students should put their study on high priority , and young people in general seek excitement and new experience , so they are entitled to some level of self-centeredness . in fact , pursuing wild , creative way of doing thing will probably be a help to community , if these young people choose to lend their talent and innovation accordingly . this requires a much deeper understanding than exists in the young people of today , but it also go to show that the measure of contribution is hardly a simple a time - it involves an awareness and some heart in all of u .
