i partially agree to the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . this is very much true and applicable to the present day situation a knowledge of only one subject is going to reduce the number of option a person ha in his career . having a broad knowledge of many academic subject will help a person view a particular situation or issue in different angle and can be more careful in taking a decision after taking into consideration all the in and out of that situation or issue . for example , if we consider a marketing executive trying to sell a washing machine , he should have knowledge though not in detail on the different small electrical system that make up the total machine , also he need to have knowledge on different kind of textile fabric and how the washing machine should be used in case of each fabric . he can be successful only if he convinces the customer and to convince he need to have broad based knowledge on all the those discussed . people with broad based knowledge can easily shift career according to what the industry demand and have a great flexibility to work in any area of specialization . on the contrary , the world would not have developed so much if there were no people with specialization in one subject . only if one understands each and every concept , can he implement them and bring out a new product . there would not have been new discovery if there are no specialist in this world . referring to the washing machine example , only a specialist and not generalist can build such a machine and can improve the feature of it . specialists are very important when it come to the technology development and advancement . concluding this , having specialization is also important but what i feel is there should be a good mixture of complementing each other .
