although old people are more mature than young person and they have more money than them to make lot of interesting plan in life like traveling going to fancy restaurant and so on , responsabilities increase with age and i think the more you have responsabilies the le you will get to enjoy life . the life of a student is full of surprising experiment that someone get to discover day after day . there is nothing more interesting that being a simple student who ha no responsabilty except just studying a little and spending all his free time getting to meet new friend , partying more often . i remember when i wa a young person , it wa the best time of my life i had meet alot a friend , it true am still in contact with them till now but it is just not the same thing when we were young , we dont see each other more often like we use to do , every time we want to meet we have to schedule our meeting in advance , and even when we meet we dont have fun like we use to do . is it the age or what ? is it because where are old this is happening ? we can not stay up late anymore , we are thinking about collecting momey and the difficulty and responsabilities of life . another point to be mentioned is the health , i am an athlete , i enjoy doing sport , gathering with my friend around a soccer game , but unfornately i can not do this anymore . every time i do a small effort i stop right away because i can not continue . it is all rekated to growing older and older and having alot of responsabilities . another thing to talk about it the house duty , shoping cleaning kisd demand , we have to do all of this over the weekend when we have a little of free time all these thing make u more and more busy not enjoying life and day after day with someone becoming older responsabilities increase i think young people enjoy life more yhan old people .
