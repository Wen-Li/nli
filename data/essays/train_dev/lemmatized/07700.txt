i think for student to understand idea and concept is more important than for them to learn fact . i have very strong opinion about that . my favorite subject is math and i like math but i can tell i 'm not suprer good at math but it 's alright not really bad . on my way to do it math is i do not think about that the answer is . i need to know how should i solve it . if i just know the answer then what am i learning ? to finding answer skill ? not really . for history and math or other thing to learn , first thing that you have to understand . you need to know what your doing . my math teacher not only count the answer . i need to show how i got this answer . if i only write the answer then i will lose my point . that is the idea that im telling . it would continue that if you have a same situation that you did before but you do n't know what to do , then what are you going to do ? nothing . i could tell the fact is just cover , and understand or concept is inside . i hope that people look at the inside . of cource the fact is important we have to know what is correct or not . i know many people just want the fact expect the how did you understand . you have to make your own thing , that call understand . if you understand then you can solve easily that you expect . sometimes just look at the bright side that do not just focusing on the fact . you need to know the way you did . it is more important for student to understan idea and concept than just fact . it should be good experience for your life .
