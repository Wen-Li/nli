the statment shown us a perspective which show that most product display the beasr feature an item should have , so when the item display a lesser capacity , the client that purchesed the item ha complaint about it and complains with both the company he bought it from along with the advertizement which influenced the purchess . this is not the way it should be , since the only objective of an advertisement ha is to make the connection between the client and the seller . what happens in an advertisement process is : a seller come to the advertisement agency and hire the agensy to communicate a new product on the market . the agency then take a look at the product and make an analisis on which demografic is most sutible to benefit fron this pruduct , the agency then make an advertisment campaign that best suit the product and releasesit to the apropiate medium . this is what people see when discussing advertizement and categorize it a a form of manipulation , but bare in mind , no advertizment force a customet to purches a product . no one force a customer out of ther home and thretens to kill their child if they dont buy the pruduct . they just display the item and tel people what it dose in a way the client might understand . if an item doe not live up to the expectation the client had of it , it simply because the client expected too much out of the item . the ad agency is not responsible for a client expectation . theyr only obligation is to simply take the information the seller give them and use that information to represent the product . to sumarize this , ad agencies only reflect the informat a seller provides about an product , and the client is the one responsible of deciding if the product suts their need . defects and other such problem should go directly to either the theller or manufactorer of said product .
