will there be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today ? what an important topic ! indeed , the reduction or increase of car , and their effect on the environment , are mainly discussed in our every-day conversation and political program . as far a i am concerned , i agree that there will be fewer car in use in the near future than there are today . let me explain why . on the first hand , the actual trend is that everybody ( the government , household and corporation ) ha to take care of his or her environment , and it is going to be a real obligation in the next few year . indeed , we all know that lot of thing go wrong around u such like the global warming for example . did you know that with this frightening global warming glacier disappear and that can lead to the disappearance of the maldives in le than twenty year for instance ? so the point is that if we do nothing , we are certainly going to lose our planet and we will have to find somewhere else to live ! it is terrible , is n't it ? the pollution contributes to the global warming and what is the primary source of pollution ? these are obviously car and their co2 . this gaz contributes too to many disease . .. therefore , car have to be reduced . moreover , the other transportation mode are developing in an impressiove manner . let 's take the example of paris . we can notice that having a car is totally wrong with all this traffic in the street ! why do n't we take the bus instead ? at least we definitely know what time exactly we are going to arrive . driving in paris can take four or five time more time than taking the bus , for exemple . finally , question of security became so important in our society . we should reduce the number of car because of the too many accident it occurs . it is unacceptable . to conclude , i will just say that there is another solution : changing our actual polluting car to ecological car , which deeply consider and respect our environment . they can work with sun or non-polluting oil for example . i really think that this is the best solution since you can not order people to stop using their car .
