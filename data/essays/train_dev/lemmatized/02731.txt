as a student majoring in bussiness management , i definitely know how important advertisement is in selling a product . however , this doe not mean that advertisement increase the purchase in a right way . for example , it is not allways possible to find a product in the way that you saw in the advertisement , many time we find it worse than we thought . thus is because the manufacturer tend to show product ' property better than they actually are . first of all , it is common that most firm deceive people about the function of the product . they try to show that their product serve extreme performance . a very good example of this is slimming product , such a diet product . i want to express something that happened to me recently . in the television i saw the advertisement of a new product called `` diet patch '' . it wa stated in the advertising that after a person us diet patch she would not feel hungry . consequently , she would lose 5 kilo in two week . as soon a i saw this advertisement , i bought this product and started using it immediately . after two week , while dreaming of loosing five kilo , i could lose only one an half kilo although i did all the thing that were said in the instruction including the diet . secondly , in order to make customer buy their product , most of the firm demonstrate the appearence of the product extremely better than they actually are . the most common example of this is the advertisement that are related to summer holiday such a tour organization or hotel . last year we wanted to go to a hotel for our summer holiday . thus , we searched the newspaper and among various hotel we decided to go to a hotel which ha 2 swimming pool . the picture in the newspaper wa so lovely that we could not think of any other hotel . but , after we went to the hotel it wa a muddy pool . finally , in order to pursue the customer the firm make advertisement that show their product better in way such a changing it fuctions and it appearance .
