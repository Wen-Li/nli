as people ' age change , they begin to enjoy different pleasure in life . young people have fun and feel very pysched at time when they believe they are being praised by others . i remember , for a while in my life , anytime i would walk into someplace with a slick and snazzy new haircut , i would believe people looked up to me , and it would be for the rest of the night that i 'd enjoy myself , due to my newly installed confidence . however , no matter how illogical it is , that would be my almost only way of having fun . today , i have fun when i am with close people such a my good friend or family . i also enjoy locking myself up in my room and programming website . three year ago , i would mock someone who would tell me such a thing . i would n't consider fun , and on the contrary i would consider it ridiculously boring . for my parent , they have fun playing the slowest card game ever ( which i think is called bezik ) . at this age , i do n't understand how they consider that to be fun . they also enjoy going on boat trip . to me , nothing could be more monotonous than the empty sound of the lonely sea . however you never know , maybe in around 30 year , those may be my pleasure in life . maybe , i will begin jogging every morning by six a.m. at the age of sixty . what my pleasure will be , is certainly not certain . the same applies to everyone . therefore , i do n't believe that the question posed can be answered . i believe all age group have their own way of having fun . you can not compare one 's action to another one 's action , if the action have their own definition for each individual .
