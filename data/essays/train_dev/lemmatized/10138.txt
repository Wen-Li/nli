some people like to travel in a group led by a tour guide . others like to travel alone without a tour guide . as far a i am concerned , i think that travelling in a group led by a a tour guide is too much better than travelling alone without a guide . this is due to various reason . a reason why it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide is that it is safer . when you travel to a new place , you probably do not know too much about it . thus , if you travel without having a tour guide , you can get lost . also , you might not know the language of the foreign country , so you will not be able to ask about direction . moreover , if you are in trouble , you can not ask for help because you do not know who to ask and you do not know the language . another reason is that it is more relaxing to travel in a group led by a tour guide . you do not have to worry about what to do next or how to spend your time . the tour guide will plan everything for you . all you have to do is to enjoy your time and take photo . it is certainly easier and help you make better use of your time . beside being relaxing , the tour guide will help you and explain thing for you . for instance , if you go to a museum , he will tell you everything about it . further , if you have any problem , the tour guide will support you and help you find a solution for it . also , if you have a question about anything , you can ask your tour guide . most importantly , travelling in group and with a guide is really enjoyable . you will never feel alone . you can also do alot of activity with the people you travel with . moreover , you can be friend and keep in touch after that . you will never feel loonely or bored . it is really interesting . in short , travelling in a group led by a tour guide ha many benefit and advantage . it is safe , enjoyable , easier and relaxing . i completely agree that it is the best way of travelling .
