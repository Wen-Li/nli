my grandfather wa always said to me ; ? f you wanna swimm , then go to the occean rather than the pole . at that time i didnt understand what doe it mean . but after many year , when i came in a big city and saw many succesfull people , i understood that ; curoisity , hardworking , good planning , and risk taking are common factor of succesfull people . at first sight , doing same thing seem maybe easy , compfortable and safe . but after a while it ll be boring . and you fell yourself probably lonely and unuseful . on the otherhand ; if you are curio people , you ll decline to always try to find new thing . that make you happy and ensure you selfconfidence which is very important of success . but trying to find new thing and curiostiy are not enough for success . you should also make a good plan and hardworking on it . finally risktaking . i think ? t the most important thing for suceess . everybody can work hard and make a good plan . but too few people can take risk to implement in real life .
