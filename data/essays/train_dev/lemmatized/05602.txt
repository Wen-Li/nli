i agree with the statement but i think it will depend on different reason . it will be difficult to live without car , especially here in italy where most of the trade and travelling is made by car . i believe that we will all benefit from the lack of car but we need to get used to other mean of transport . first of all , people should start using public transport . in this way , company will improve their mean and they will be ready to sustain the changed habit in twenty year . secondly , we should invest more in research and development for alternative mean of transport and to lower the price of transportation , such a those of airplane , train and ferry . government should also improve infrastructure for there mean of transport a often airport , railway station and harbour are not enough efficient . as nowadays car are the biggest source of pollution , it will be positive for the environment and for all of u . scientists are already working to find alternative source to make our car running , a in twenty year time , we might run out of petroleum , and this will probably be the main cause for fewer car . despite this , we will need to discover alternative source to make our car running . new car are already on the market which work with hydrogen , electricity or solar pannels . however , they are just prototype and we are not sure about their benefit to private transport . finally , it will cause le accident on the road a most of the dead in the western emisphere are cause by road crash
