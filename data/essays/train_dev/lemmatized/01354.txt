i totally agree with this statement . we are in an incredible period of time that technology is growing too fast . this brings some consequence and influence in all thing . the vehicle , especially car are one of those thing . firstly , i think the use of the public tansportation will get higher . the high technology provides u to improve the qualification of the vehicle that we are already used . for example , because of the speed of the train , subway and plain , people prefer to use this kind of vehicle . they will not want to take the risk of being late for anything . secondly , the high rate of the accident of car will lead people to invent some solution about that . using the high technology , they will create some other vehicle other than those we use recently . for example ; the vehicle which will be used for the transportation through the air or under see and which are more safe than using a car . these situation cause people to reach anywhere more fast and more safely . lastly , dispite of the high technology , people may prefer basic vehicle for transportation like bycels . the arrangement of the road and bridge will be better completed
