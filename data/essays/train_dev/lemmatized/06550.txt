young people seems to be more activ and to spend more time to enjoy life than older people . indeed it seems that young people want to enjoy the present before getting old . but we can wonder if young people really enjoy life more than older people do . in a first part we will examine qrguments in favour of this statement . then we will interest in the older people in order to conclude on that statement . why is it thought that young people enjoy life more than older people do . the first reason is that young people are more activ . they are more dynamic . they have no fear because they are young . they feel invicible . they are in a period of their life where they have dream and are ready to do anything to realise those dream . it can be travelling around the world or doing a special carrer . .. an other caracteristic of young people is that they have more free time that they can spend with their friend or doing their hobby . because they are young they have le restriction . .. it is the reason why they can do what they like . they always find time to do it because they are dynamic . an other reason why they enjoy life is that they discover life since they are young . a lot of thing are totally new for them . finally , people meet their best friend a they are young . now , why is it thought that older people enjoy life le than younger people ? the first reason is that older people have a lot of obligation such a a job , a family , child . .. all those thing take a lot of time and became sometimes fastidious . but the matter is to define what doe ` enjoy life ' mean . in my opinion , young people enjoy the present instead older people enjoy on a long time
