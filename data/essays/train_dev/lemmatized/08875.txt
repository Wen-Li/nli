i do not agree `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a toure guide . the reason is follows . first , the day schedule is already decided . that is , we do not have enough time to see freely , when we go to very large sightseeing place . this is just my experience . when i wa 8years old , i went to kyoto . there very famous classicla japanese cityand there are so many temple . that time , i took a tour guide . the schedule wa so dense . so tour guide allowed u just 30 minute for one place . while the turip , time wa too fast . i could not recall where i went and see . it wa just like taking picture about object without the emotion . i want to say that to see what i need feely is best memorial thing in my heart , because this is in my intention in my travel . second , group tour is difficult to have directive communication with people who live in the place . to enjoy the travel , we need strong impression about city and people . if we talk with the people who life there , we aware about the place what we do not aware of seeing surface of the place-buildings or construction . for example , when i went to hawaii , i had a chance to talk with people who life in hawaii in park . that day is the special festival for tem . they told me why they were celebrating . moreover where is the best place to see the sunset . this information is just know about people who live in there . this is a good chance to see real life in there . i am always enjoying communicate with the people llike above . moreover good accident became good memory after travel . treavel is freely is best for me because of above reason .
