personally , i agree with the statement saying that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . however , i do not think that this statement is completely correct . i have to admit that there are several company advertising their product in an honest way , stating only fact about the product without any misleading slogan or jingle . on the other hand , the majority of today \ s industry is clever enough to trick their customer into buying their product . they do so by either creating highly convincing advertisemetns with slogan or jingle people tend to associate with the product , or they claim characteristic and fact about the product that are simply untrue . the most effective advertising strategy next to an easy to remember jingle you can not get out of your head is advertising with the support of celebrity presenting the product . even though i do not like the idea of being lied to by a company , i can certainly understand this marketing mentality that is so widely spread today . in a world of globalization , open border and free market , every market of every country is flooded with an increadibly high number of foreign product . not only do foreign product mostly seem more attractive to customer , they are often cheap copy of orginals invented and produced in the home country . monoplies hardly ever exist anymore and competing not only with other company in the country but especially with foreign company certainly is rough . however , i think company should only try to manipulate customer to a certain extent . there should be a clear difference between lying completely and persuading and influecing a little . being a customer myself , of course , i rely on the government to control marketing strategy on the one hand but i definitely rely on own experience i make on the other hand . if i know about a product that it doe not fulfill all the expectation the company made me believe in , i will try my best to convince others not to buy it and i hope others will do so a well . and even if company tend at time to overestimate a little and seem to be too euphemistic about their product , we still live in a world where people have gotten used to this kind of advertising behavior by now . i think , there is only a small percentage of society left that truly belief all the statement made in advertisement . i therefore have the hope that company of the future will rely on attractive advertisement instead of on false statement .
