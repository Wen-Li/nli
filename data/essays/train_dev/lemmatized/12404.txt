i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . if one were to analyse the trait of successful people in the area of business , entertainment , sport or even politics , the one common trait to emerge will be their ability to take intelligent and thoughtful risk and keep pushing the boundary of their area of expertise . human being are loath to change and do not like to get out of their `` comfort zone '' . the average person would rather continue to do what they know very well because of the overall disruptive nature of `` change '' . trying new thing is generally viewed a too risky to compromise a steady state of existence and established livelihood . but over time it becomes necessary to change , adapt and try new thing because there are always others who would be willing to do the same thing in a better , efficient way or for a lower price . the only way to combat becoming redundant and remain successful is to embrace change , experiement with new thing and take calculated risk . as an example , if you look at the traditional telephone company or the medium business , they have not changed in their behaviour or in their business process in the past century . the business owner believed in their own perpetual existence and were continuing to do what they had been doing all along . but , with the advent of new technology and the internet , their world ha been rudely shaken . the number of adult who read a newspaper ha been steadily falling . most new telephone connection are now of the `` wireless '' variety . unless these traditional company shake up their business and take a few risk on their own , they are doomed . infact , the cycle of change and innovation ha significantly crashed over the past few year . even the internet company and wireless telephone company have to constantly reinvent their business and continually try out new thing to stay relevant in today world . the concept of trying new thing and taking risk is also important from an overall `` evolution '' standpoint . imagine if bill gates or michael dell had not continued to experiment in their garage , or had given up on their dream and idea , we would still have been using the abacus for adding number . all successful business and idea are based on the bedrock of `` new idea '' and `` new concept '' and it take brave , committed and passionate individual to keep taking such risk and expanding the boundary of knowledge . while the reward for taking risk are typically huge , the reward are not quite obvious till such time a risk is taken . in conclusion , the appetite for risk and trying new thing are the defining trait for successful individual in this world .
