in the present day society , young people have become busy , wanting to achieve good grade in their university , advance in their career , having good entertainment etc . i agree with the statement that young citizen nowadays are not spending enough time in helping their community . even the tough competition the young people are facing doesnt allow them to spend their free time in community work . the amount of stress they have at their college and workplace leave them with no interest in caring about others . to site an example , a young professional working at a software company work pretty hard the whole week which can extend till late night and would always want to chill out during the weekend not wanting to know whats happening around him . the amount of stress he face at the workplace doesnt allow him to . time ha always been an important factor . since the amount of free time an individual get these day is le , the chance for him to think about the society is also becoming lesser . the young people always tend to incline to any activity very easily , and specially when it come to entertainment , many of them love to spend their free time in partying , playing and travelling . even the people around them also have lot of influence on their mind . for instance , there wa a program which wa conducted by my college , which wa to volunteer in helping the orphan by teaching them some basic thing . this required u to spend two weekend at an orphanage . when the student were asked to volunteer , hardly no one wa willing to sacrifice their weekend for helping someone else . but fortunately when one student wa ready , few other followed him . that particular student influenced some people around him . but still it wa not the response expected . young people do have the sensibility to think about their community , but they need to be encouraged by the parent , government , educational intstitutions , social organization etc . with a good inspiration and support , they can make the world a better place to live in .
