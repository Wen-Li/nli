actually i 'm agree with the statment beaucause when everybody travel with nothing so much people gonna say do this or do that , it 's gonna make you a litltle confuse , they can even make you go to the wrong way . when you travel along with nobody i ca n't even tell how bored it 's gonna be . if the travel is five hour it 's gonna be worst then everything . that 's why when you go in group led i'ts much better by your self and it 's more secure too . you could also find a lot a fun by chatting each other , you gonna have a lot of occupation to do and that 's for sure it't a lot of fun , no need to think where you goind , which way to go . if you and your group travel at the same time you making some joke , you not even see when you arrive in the destination place . me i love traveling specially with my family far away . one day my decide to make a trip all away to canada and the whole family wa included in this trip , i think it wa like five seven hour driving , that 's wa very fun . every two hour my dad stop the car , so we could get something to eat and it 's wa a very nice journey . every body in the car wa happy about this trip . one day i whish i coold do that again and i hope i gonna be the same fun . tha't why i agree with the following statement .
