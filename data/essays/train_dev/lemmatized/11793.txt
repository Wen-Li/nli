from my perspective , i agreed with the following statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the reason that people need to advertise their product it 's because they want to sell more product and try to increase people 's desire of their product . moreover , there are lot of differents complemental product are competing against to each others . however , those product are always look better when they are advertising . there are few example that happend to lot of people . have you ever buy a hamburger after you see the advertise of the hamburger form medium ? the producer of the hamburger make the hamburger look so big and so delicious while they are advertising . however , when people actually go to a shop and buy the same hamberger that they have seen form the medium , people would find out that the hamburger look so smaller than the one they saw form the medium . producers are actually using advertisement to attract people to buy their product . in addition , lot of compaines are competing against each others and some company earnd profit because of they abused the advertisement 's power and earn lot of money by those unreal advertisement . for example , car company always said their car are the best and provide a video tape to show how incradible is the car and how amazing is the car , such a a car can drive really fast on icey floor . however , when people who actually buy the car , they always find out that the video are not realistic and they will find out that the adverties video wa lying . in conclusion , the reason that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are it because those company want to earn more money and they also want to show that their product are the best and win the competition between each others in oder to earn lot of profit .
