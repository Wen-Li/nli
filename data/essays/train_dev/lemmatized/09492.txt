i agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i have couple of experience and reason to support my opinion . first , it is always more fun for me to travel with a group of people . since i consider myself a social person , it give me a great opportunity to make new friend . for example , i had such a great time in my last trip to italy . we visited the historical place during the day time and enjoyed the delicious italian pasta with a glass of wine and laughter at night . it wa incredible . furthermore , a tour guide is very very important for a travel . i believe that it help a lot to visit the new place with a person who already know about their history . it is harder for me to read it from a book . also , i have a short term memory on those kind of thing . the first time when i went to barcelona by myself , i had already forgot the story of the famous sculpture , so it did n't make any sense to see them without the particular information . finally , i think it is much better to walk around with a group of people . it attracts the local store owner . they tend to be more kind because they realize that it is a group of tourist who know nothing about this place . also , a tour guide help u to get discount for the souveniers from the store he know . in conclusion , . although i preferred to travel alone at the begginnig , i realized that it is more fun when i travel with friend or my future friend to be . that 's why , i believe that it is much better to travel with a group of people and a tour guide
