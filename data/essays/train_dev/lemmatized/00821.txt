i agree that student should undestand the idea and concept than spending time in learning fact . i believe that the human civilization ha come to the zenith of technology not because of learing the fact , but by understanding the idea and concept . there have been advancement in many area . if the human spend all their time on fact , our life could have been ended in undestanding the history of our earlier generation . and we could not have seen the progress . there could have been no progress of science . so , applying the concept of the fact will move the world to the next level . i always liked science which make me a scientist not because i know the fact , but the way i undestand idea and concept . i am taking a mathamatics call i will use the concept and idea to get to generate a solution to the problem . if we use fact there will be time , they will not help get the solution . in our daily life , we live with idea and concept . a very besic example , if my parent want me to go buy vegetable form the vegetable market i will decide which way will be easier road . i will analze by asking myself using my concept and not go with the fact . our human mind can take only some fact and then we have to use the concept to work towards succus . there are many fact in this world and it will not be in our human abiliites to know all the fact . so it is more important that to know how to apply the concept and idea . to deal with the problem . on a whole , i think that fact can only help to certain level but most importantly it is the idea and concept that will hlep u in dealing with daily life , in our career and also in work .
