i agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the first reason why i think the number of car are decreasing is that oil price are increasing sharply . researchers are saying that the fossile resource such a coal , oil , natural gas are being depleted every year . moreover , the economy of china is booming up since late of 90 's , and oil demand are sharply increased because china buy considerable amount of oil all over the world . if oil becomes expensive , people do n't drive a car and instead they try to use public transportation . therefore , high oil price result in fall of demanding car , and these kind of trend becomes general , the number of car are decreasing . the second reason is that more country are concerned about enviromental problem and believe that car produce some harard meterials . environment problem ha been issued by internation society such a un and international enviroment organiztion such a wto . therefore some government would lead to make the number of car decrease and it would affect to the number of car . the research of substitue resource would lead to the same result . as far a i know , subsitite resource that appied to modern transportation is only electricity . nuclear is too dangerous to use for transportation and the other resource is still on going research . by the way , if electicity resource for individual tranportation is used in daily life , that mean people can not afford to pay oil price and car battery would be used . but it is very uncomfortable to charge and dangerous to use when someone is lost his way and battery 's out . people would not use battery car and they would rather use public transportation . if there is no innovative invent of substitute resource , the number of car will be decreasing . there are some other reason of fewer car using such a decreasing of population , government restiction to use oil , lack of social infrastructure and so on . however , the most imporatant reason is the fact that our fossile reasources are depleting , and we should prepare for that next a few decade .
