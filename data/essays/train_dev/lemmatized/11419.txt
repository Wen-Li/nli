today we are living in a time that the people always want to be succesful in their job . but here the discussion is that : what do i have to do for being succesful ? can i be succesful by getting experience by doing the same work for many year or would i have to try something new and change my style ? some people prefers doing their job in the same style that they have been always doing before . they are not changing their style so with every passing month and year , they are becoming more and more professional . they are so sure for their work and they are feeling so comfortable . but on the other hand their capacity is becoming too limited , so it is becoming harder for them to be creative in their job . so with the repetation of their job , if he ha not been succesful before , it is becoming le possible for him to be succesful . so what other type of people we have here ? well there is a type who can take risk and try new thing in their life . for some people it is not enough to be capable of doing one job . yes you are doing your job ok , getting your salary and everything is going quite well . but there is always ( or at least there have to be ) new thought in your mind . you have to bring them to life or at least give them a chance . after this period you have to risk your life , because miracle only come into life by taking risk . in today 's world mostly people who is taking risk becomes succesful . you have to try something that nobody ha seen and tried , unless you would be an ordinary working man like most of the others . yes it is possible to lose lot of thing and fail by taking risk , but people mostly learn from their failure , not from their succession . so with every failure you give it another chance and after a while you get so many experience by this behaviour . and yes in life every experience lead to the world of succession . at the end i could say that yes it too risky to change your style and start something new , and yes you can even fail and lose lot of thing , but what else can give you the feeling of being proud of yourself when you do something new that only a few people can do . be proud of yourself . ..
