i do n't completely agree with this statement : in my opinion both the understanding of idea and concept and the learing of fact are important to the cultural growth of a student . as a matter of fact , many time , idea and concept are consequence of fact happened in that period . consequently , student can understand idea better if they know in what environment these concept were born : the fact can describe the context in which those idea grew up . following this view , we have to know the importance of the history study : only throught the knowledge of our past we can completely understand idea and concept that grew up in those period . for example , only if we undestand what were the economic problem during the 17th-18th century we can fully comprehend the industrial revolution and it new idea of mass production . but the opposite can also be true : some new idea can change the behaviour of people , so resulting in new event in the human history . for example , some new idea in the world of the physic were followed by the atomic bomb and by it use during the world war ii . in the same way we could mentione the new research in the genetic field : surely these new idea will change the world of tomorrow and will give the true prospective throught which read the future fact . in these term , it is not more important for student to understand idea and concept that it it for them to learn fact . what is really important is to undestand that you can not fully comprehend a concept without knowing the context in which this new idea wa born .
