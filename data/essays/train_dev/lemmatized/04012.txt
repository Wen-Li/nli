the statement expressed is one thing people and particularly all researcher of mobility would like to know . from the first car appeared in our life , their quantity ha not stopped of increase . so , which will be the future for the car ? nowadays car is an important part of our life . we use it for everything because everything is easier with it . on average a normal citizen could move around 20 km per day with his car to go to work , shopping or whatever . that 's seems is going to be the most predictable future thanks to be the most comfortable way of living . however there is something that grows at the same pattern a car : traffic . a lot of researcher say that traffic is the disease of the actual city . when it appears is nearly impossible to control it . this is something that go against car because when people last double time to do the same route , one question start to appear : do i have other method of transport ? in fact our society have a variety of transport we had never imagined , but they are not so easy-going a car are . although it is proved that they are faster and cheaper than our car , people do not like them . statements like bus is crowded , i have to walk a lot to the train station . .. are very common and set public transport behind car , except when they do not depend on traffic jam and allow people sleep some minute more before going to work . environment is another thing we have to take care . kyoto protocol is clear in that aspect : the most production of greenhouse effect gas is caused by private transport . so it is not so difficult than in a 20 year time car would be banned from downtown , like in london happends at this moment . as a conclusion prediction about car are difficult to state . everything depends on human behaviour , environmental consciense and political response . who could imagine a world without car ? me !
