when people imagine about young people 's life , they think active and joyful life , so i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people usually tend to try something new . in other word , they feel excited about an event that they have never experienced before no matter how hard it is . however , majority of older people do not want to try something fresh because they already feel comfortable with their ordinary life . even though they are bored with their circumstance , they normally do not have desire for more interesting life . last christmas , i met my grandmother . when i suggested going on a trip to wherever she want to go , she seemed she wa not enthusiastic about the plan , obviously contrary to me , so i asked her the reason for her feeling . then , she said that she felt exhausted enough and all she wanted to stay at home rather than travel . at that moment , i could realize all the senior like my grandmother desire more comfort and rest . the other reason is that young people are provided much more experience from the society . for example , when teenager graduate from their high school , they eventually enter the university . and , in the university , there are plenty of club that they can get involved . thus , through variety of club they experience , they can find their intersts and feel pleased . older people , on the other hand , do not receive many opportunity from their circumstance because they usually stay at home or go only several place where they use to go daily . although these place can provide them convenience , they can not give them a chance to try various kind of activity . therefore , the older people undergo much le experience than young people . as a result , the young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people try to find something new and they experience variety of opportunity more than older people do .
