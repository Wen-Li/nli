i agree with the statement . one reason is that in commercial , people may be fooled by sound effect or color that have nothing to do with the product . for example , when advertising action figure or doll , the commercial may include voice so that it seems a though the doll is talking to you , even though the doll doe not talk . another reason i agree with the statement is the ad may just completely lie to you . such a in tobacco ad , although the company know that smoking make you le attractive , they use beautiful people in their advertisement . if these people in the ad actually did smoke , they would not be so beautiful . example number two is when people say that the price of something is cheaper than a similar product , but truly , it is more expensive because it say tiny at the bottom , `` two payment '' . the third reason i believe most advertisement make product seem better than they actually are is they use people that have not even tried the product just saying that they have . a very realistic example is dieting product commercial . extremely thin people that have never heard of the product sit in front of the camera lying to the public that they got thin just by using the product and nothing else . last but not least , ad say that `` this is a limited time offer '' and a year later , you find out that it is still on the market , cheaper . actually , this is a real experience . one day i wa watching tv and i saw a commercial selling a product and saying , `` this product will only be sold for this week only ! '' . so , i bought it at a price of $ 29.99 . the next year , i wa out shopping with my friend , and i saw the exact same thing at wal-mart for $ 19.99 . so , i strongly agree that many product are advertised much better than they really are . companies need to make product that actually work well just the way they are advertised . that way all customer will be happy with their product , and possibly buy more from that company , so both the business and the buyer will be satisfied .
