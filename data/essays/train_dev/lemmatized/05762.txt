travelling is only fun when i have the freedom to do whatever i want . so i disagree with a statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . travelling in a group with a tour guide pose problem like following a schedule and following suit . first and foremost , i travel to visit and experience place first hand to visualize beauty in my own way . a tour guide will not only force me to view the site through his eye but also hinder my experience and impose other unnecessary constaints like time and schedule requirement . the tour guide will be barking order and giving all sort of information that i will hear from one ear and forget it from the other . i would like to take my own time when watching the breathtaking niagara falls or the mind-blowing egyptian spinx . group travelling will force me to do the same activity others are doing and so , will not allow me some time on my own . i would be very disturbed with my loss of command over myself . i would like to be my own bos and do thing my own way . just because 10 people want to visit the eiffel tower for the second time doe n't mean that i would waste my oppurtunity to appreciate the romantic art at the louvre . i am just one of those people who love working and doing stuff outside a group . in conclusion , a travelling group with a tour guide is a bad choice according to me . i would lose my independence of thought and my control of choice . i would rather voyage in peace and serenity without all the fuss of a group .
