in my opinion , i totally agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . there are main three reason : basic , creation , knowledge . first reason is that when i do something in school , job an so on , understanding idea and concept always can be based for doing it . for example , when i am working in my job , i got complicate problem , so i am trying to solve by using many way . however it is not working , what do i do ? i need to look over again very carefully and i should understand that problem clearly . and then i would think about it basically idea and concept . i must try to understand that . after that i might solve that problem by understanding it idea and concept . therefore , when i do whatever , understanding idea and concept is really important . second reason is that understanding idea and concept can improve my creation ability and thinking . if i just do something without thinking or understanding , it can be mixed up and i can not get good achivements . maybe i just would work , such a machine . therefore , if i allways try to understand idea and concept , it can improve my creation ablities and thinking , so i would do greatly . final reason is that i can get many background knowledge by understanding idea and concept . to live in society , all people need variety background knowledge a well a many experience . to understand idea and concept of something what i want to get , i should try to study it basically idea and concept , also i need to look for many thing , such a book , article to understand . as i study like this , i can get many knowledge more and more . therefore , understanding idea and concept is really good to get background knowledge . in conclusion , according to these reason , i totally agree with that understanding idea and concept is very important to improve myself by these reason above list .
