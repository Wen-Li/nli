i think that learning is an everyday process that is determined by people 's attitude , interest and experience . for this reason i think that a student can increase his knowledge throught different studying method . i think that it is very important for student to have a general knowledge of a many topic and possible . analyzing general topic presented under the form of concept and idea , it could be a good way to learn new thing without having to study every detail of that particular topic . this is the case of subject related to the humanity . it is not necessary to learn to exact year in which a particular theory ha been developed . simply knowing the period and the concept of a particular theory , it can be useful in every field . when studying it is necessary to consider the topic analyzed . in fact there are many subject that can be explained by professors using main idea and concept . there is no need to go deeper exploring all the cause and effect . in some course the professors only requires a general knowledge of a particular topic . on the other hand there are subject where learning fact is essential . some example can be historic event . learning the fact is determining in order to increase the knowledge on the topic . scientific discipline are another example that underlining the importance of learning fact , more that general concept . think that when a scientist doe an experiment he really need to know about fact . to conclude , i think that every subject need to be treated differently , because i do not think that there is a gerenal rule that determines if it is more important for student to learn from general idea , than from fact .
