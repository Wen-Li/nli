i agree with the statement , i think that young people enjoy more the life that older people do . young people have a full live in front of their eye and thay can do a lot of activity . they have le bad experience than older people , therefore , they have le suffering . many of them do n't have to work , they do n't have to gain every day bread . even if they work , it 's more like an adventure because it 's their first job . most of them are single , therefore , they can make all their dream come true . in the youth , time look long . in that period , people have a lot of time in their life . they usually do n't think in death and they can enjoy life . they have time to study or to spend time with their friend . they can make project of many year and realize them . young people have le bad experience than older people , this fact make the life of young people sweeter than older one . usually young people have le motif to suffering . if they have a bad experience , they can forget about it because they do n't have a lot of bad memory . when people grow up , they start to have more problem . they have to work and pay tax , later they have to maintain a family . in the youth , people do n't have to work , they have a lot of free time . they have the time to entertain with people of their age . when a person start a job , it 's exciting in the beginning because it 's a new activity . the first job is always a great experience because it 's the first step to adulthood . this is before the experience become repetitive , before a regular job of many year . in this period of their life , young people are usually single . they do n't have big responsabilities and they can make their future a they want . in summary , i think life is better in the youth . real problem begin after this . youth is the time to preparing for life , also it 's the time to enjoy life .
