i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than tere are today . today the employes , management men or more generally the worker go to the office by the car . the road , day after day , are full of the car . less person take , the bus or the train to go at office or stabliment . besides in these year family go on holiday in week/end , and so every week they prefer to take the car for to reach the holiday city that they take bus , train . .. besides the modern people is le active that the past people . in the past the people go to the office or stabliment walking for three or four mile , instaend today the boy take the car for to accross the street !! another reason because it is impossible that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today is the price that the car sell to public . in the past the price of the car is more expensive than today , and so le person can to buy the car . today the boy of 19/20 year old buy the car , because the price of the car must share in several part distribuited on plus year and so the young boy can buy the car .
