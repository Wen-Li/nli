i personally do n't agree that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .l have several reason a follows . first , the older also can enjoy their life . because , they have a lot of experience , knowledge and wisdom to whole their life individually , ithey can have much time second , most older people have more free time and money than younger people . they can access everwhere and every time they like if they are fine . in japan , many elderly enjoy to travel , walk mountain , pray koto , write haiku , you know , our traditional culture and so on . for example , my grandparent love trevelling very much together . from when they finish to grow up their child , my mother . they enjoy to travel in japan , china , korea and so on . this summer , they visited new york and saw around town and enjoy to see musical in broadway . they said to me so wonderful trip ! i think their freetime and many by working long time , and mental maturity can come ture that . third , now , more and more old people become to keep good health , and have long life expectancy . so they can move active a like the younger . actually . we can see that some elderly are active than some young people . i therefore , a i mentioned above , i definitely think that old people enjoy life a much a young people .
