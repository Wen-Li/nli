it is more important for student to understand idea and concept , because , they can apply this concept and idea to resolve fact that may be present in the future . also , this way would prevent dissapoinmemt and frustration in the student at the time that prepare them to resolve problem without experience , just knowledge . if a student understand idea and concept , he would be able to resolve the fact succesfully ; thus , he ha the tool to resolve problem and circustances without experience , just by using the knowlegde that he ha learned before , in order to learn fact . if the student learn fact before understand idea and concept , he would learn more painfull and they proprably would learn more by mistake . i really think is better learn by adviced that by expirience . to know the idea and concept first would prevent the student to make a lot of mistake that can cost him pain and dissapoinments feeling , because he would propably choose the correct and convinient solution for the fact that present taking his knowledg . even though , this is not a warranty that the student would choose the correct solution . he may choose the wrong one , but there is more propability that he choose the correct solution . i really belive is more important for student to undertand idea and concept , that learn fact . i would be more usefull , painless , motivateness and rewardeness to think in a solution taking the concept thar he ha , that learn fact without experience and knowledge about it .
