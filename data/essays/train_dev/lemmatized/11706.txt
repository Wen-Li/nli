i agree with the statement that , it is more important to understand idea and concept than it is them to learn fact . for example , in science lab it is more important to understand idea and concept so that there after we can learn that fact to do the experiment with the concept that we understand . in any field , the above sentence match . suppose in game like cricket we must first undersdtand the idea and concept in the game including foot work , line and length , only after understanding thoroughly the concept of cricket we can learn fact i.e. we can practice . and also in the field of engineering , it is more important that the student understand the concept first and than to apply the concept he learned to learn fact about the experiment . in the field of design also we have to first understand the concept behind that design and idea behind that design and there after we can design a particular object . for example , take the design of a car . first the designer will understand the specification and concept behind the design af the car and there after he put on the idea how to design a new car . so , for most of the area it is important that we have to understand the idea and then to learn fact . without learning idea and detail we can not know the fact about the product or a system . so , it is important for u to understand idea and concept to learn fact . for example , if a new theory is proposed by a scientist , it is more important for u to understand the idea behind that principle and concept of the principle and thereafter we canable to learn fact about that principle . all above example will give information that it is more important to understand idea and concept , so by using the idea and concept we have learnt will help to understand to learn fact about a particular thing or an experiment .
