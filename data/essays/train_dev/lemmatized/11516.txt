some educational expert claim that the role of school and college is to teach pupil fact . others believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept . i believe that making student understand idea and concept is the most important role of education . yet it can not be done without the student learning the fact . understanding idea and concept is vital in the world we live in today . technology and science are evoluting so fast nowadays that the knowlege of concept is extremely important . without understanding the idea and concept behind these technological advaces , a student will not be able to resilve problem facing him in that area . in fact understanding idea and concept offer student the possibility to face any problem in each and every realm of their life . it give them a certain logic and methodology that widens critical thinking . on the other hand , concept and idea are impossible to understand without the learning of fact . the good knowlege of fact made the great inventor and thinker of history ( leonardo davinci , galileo , albert einstein , louis pasteur . .. ) discover and develop new concept and idea . facts are to concept what wheel are to car . a car can not drive without wheel ; a concept can not be accurate or even invented without the knowlege of the scientific fact . this is why student should be taught the fact . yet their education should not be limited to fact . an education limited to the teaching of fact will produce student with rigid and limited thinking . the fact ought to be the academic package that will allow student to understand the concept and maybe come up with idea of their own .
