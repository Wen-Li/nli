in most case academic education provides the possibility of a profound and distinct understanding of a certain subject in germany . as a basis you have to take several subject in the beginning and this lead after approximately a year to specialization into one subject . a broader knowledge of more academic subject could have some advantage regarding more flexible and way different approach to solve a problem . however , this lead to a lack of specific detail on evaluating complex problem . one might argue that with a greater diversity of subject there will be more solution and the person can go into detail if it is required . but this often requires a lot of time and usually company are not willing to invest more money and additional time on educating their employee . hence , specilization if choosen in a smart way can give the applicant for example a significant advantage . on the other hand it ha to be ensured that cultural understanding and logical thinking trained by mathematical education ha been provided . therefore the school host student in germany for 12 to 13 year are responsible . education need a lot of time implying that a further unspecialized subject are being tought at the university it even take longer for a student to be prepared of working autonomously . according to the benefit of the society and a person which accomplishes it study in a shorter amount of time the conclusion i 'm drawing is to ensure broad knowledge in school and in the first year of university but then quickly turn into specific subject . this doe n't mean to limit everyone to only one subject . especially in science there are lot of example where field overlap and knowledge of both subject is the key to interact but it just take too much time and resource to educate e.g. a scientist in literature and music art and vice versa . eventually everyone should be able to choose whatever he or she want to study and know where their strenghts lie .
