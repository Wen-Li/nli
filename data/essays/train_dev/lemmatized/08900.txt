there is no doubt in saying that advertisement show product in much impressive than the actual product . there is a saying in english , `` first impression leaf better impression '' . manufactres want to persuade people with perpetuating impression in the first instance itself . first , manufactures of soft drink spend million of dollar for promoting their drink . famous actrors or actress serve a brand ambassdor to their product to lure the customer . they claiam that this is the best possible , energetic drink one can imagine . infact it is not true . just plane water could be more refreshing , rejuvineating than soft drink . it is one of the leading cause of diabetes mellitus , becuase it contains lot of sugar product . some study have shown that there are trace of pesticide in soft drink . inspite of all this disadvanates they are promting thier product by attractive packaging and advertising . second , now let u consider fast food advertisiments . thier advertisement suggests that they are healthiest food on can imagine . howeer that is not the case . each sandwitch in a restarant may contain more than 1000 kcal . there is some recent strong evidence suggest that schooll child in usa are becoming obese by eating restaurent food . we can see the picture of the food on poster . it look very appeeling . however we can not be sure hat are ingriednts , whwre it came from . how many time did they used same oil . i beacme ill several time after eating cafteria food . single can of tuna and could be much nutrious than high fat food avialable fast food hotel . third , toy manufacture advertises attract lot of child by making wide range of toy . but mant case toy would not be up to the eexpecation of child . single piece of paper could have been more imaginatve than electronic toy . because it might improve child drawing performance or writing ability . this sort of advanatge , however denied to the toy . in conclusion , i am of the view that people should consdier adevrtisement a a source of information before before buying product . they should be carefull .
