in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . this is an interesting view of the future life . nowadays there are lot of car . in every family with four people there are at least two car . this is a big problem about pollution and environment . cars are everywere , we do n't move without them and we do n't use very much pubblic transport like bus or train . generally people work in city where there are lot of pubblic trasports but they prefere to parking near the office or near the factory . it should be an idea to start to go by bus or by train but there are other problem . if they want that more people catch train , train will must be always on time and cleaner . on the other hand i do n't think that people will leave their car at home . car is a status symbol . with a big car you can show to the other that you have a lot of money and a good job . in addiction technology involves and this will permit to eliminate petroil and to use other material . so pollution will be eliminate . in conclusion i hope that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today because i 'd prefer go by bicycle or by pubblic transport but i do n't think that this will be possible and maybe the ca use will be more than nowadays .
