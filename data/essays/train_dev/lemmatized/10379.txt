i agree with the idea that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . advertisement itself is the way the company tell the people what they are making for them , the main propuse of making a advertisement is to convey people to buy their product . it is the same a you are applying for college . you do want the admission officer to see the advantage you have , and avoid the disadvantage a possible a you can . by doing so , you are tring to perswade the admission officer to let you enter the college . these is just a same a what company doing to their coustmers by making advertisement . think about it , if there are two apple on the table , one is big and red while another is small and green , which one would you prefer by just looking at them ? of course the one that look better ! when we are watching an advertisement , the product are often look really good , or even better than they really are . however , that not because the advertisement maker is cheating u , they just want u to feel better by the first looking at the product since we had never seen it before . for example , when a professional photographor is taking picture of a new product , say , wine , for a company , he may use the mixture of red ink and water instead of using the real wine . becasuse when he put the mixture under the light , it look more clear than wine and people would like these kind of thing . when people have a good first visual impress of the product , they would possiblely going to buy it , and before they really hold the product in their hand , it have nothing to do wheater the product is good or not . since then , advertisement have finished their job .
