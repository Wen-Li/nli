the life is practical not theoritical . to live in this practical world the every student should know the fact about the life . but there are some place for those the person ha to understand the idea and concept of the thing . i think that the student should understand the idea and concept a it is an important part of their education but it is more important for them to understand and know the fact about the thing and life . the following passage will explain the reason for my opinion . firstly , a person can not live in the world just by having the idea and concept , they have to become the practical in their life . so if student start learning the fact from their primary education then they will be able to work in their field more successfully . i can explain my view with an example , there are so many book that student read while doing the mba or other management course but when it come to practical while doing the job most of them are not useful , so at that time the student are required to learn the fact . like many book say that a manager should not tell any thing worng to his employee and should not hide and fact or any information from his employee but there are several condition when the management is required to hide the thing and some information fromt he employee . for example if the team is working on the some secret project then in these comdition the the manager is required to hide the important information from the team . so if the student will learn these fact from their child hood they will become a better manager or better person in their field . secondly , if the student will learn these fact from the primary school then it will also save their time . as most of their time go in learing only the idea and concept . finally there are also some benefit of learing the idea and fact in the student life . a student will get more knowlede and will be having better ability to understand the thing . for example , an engineering student ha to learn practical thing in his life at the last . but if he will be having the better concept and idea that how is work done and how are the requirement of a good job then he will be able to perform well . in sum , i think that the student should be given the knowledge about both the thing that is about the fact and about the idea and concept . as both play their important role in the life of a student both are important for a successful person . but more importance should be given in teaching about the fact rather than the idea and concept .
