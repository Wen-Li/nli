twenty year is not a really long time for changing thing in the history . i think that in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today . cars changed people life , i can not imagine how ours life will be without having car , car help a lot for the human . the reason why i think car will not be fewers is that people need it . we need car to get to work , school , and other place . well , some people will think about other transportation . that is ture , for a short distance we can walk or ride a bike , and for long distance we have airplane and train . however i think car is much faster than walking or riding a bike , and also car are really flexable , we can go anywhere any time without a airplane or train ticket . we will have so much trouble without car , they made our life easier . cars are really convince . the other reason is a population grows . the number of the people need car will also increase . for example . in beijing every day there will be thousand of new car going to the street . this also happening to any other big city in china . in shanghai , the number of car increased to fast , and the goverment raise the price for the liscenes plate . from these example show that car will not stop growing in a short time such a twenty year . there will be a problem for the gas , because the earth is lack of oil now . i belive at that time there will be other kind of car for u to drive . the car will use battery , we do have some car use battery now , in twenty year these kind of car will be absalutaly advanced . we also can use sun energy for the car . these are my point that car will not be fewer in twenty year , cars are our friend !
