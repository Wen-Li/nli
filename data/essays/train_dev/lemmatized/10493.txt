at first thought , this seems a good suggestion , but carefully weighing on the mind , we found that this statment ha oversimplified the way we deal with travelling in a group led by a tour guide . it is true that there are benefit to travel in a group lead by a tour buide , but backpacking or travelling without tour guide is much with merit . even these day , when people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , my belief remains that backpacking is a better way of travel . therefore , i disgree with the statement . i would substantiate it in three reason . first reaons for my statement is that to travel alone we could schedule our time more flexibly . travelling without a tour guide , we could visit the place that we most want to go . we will not encumber by others and can arrange our time during the travel . second , to travel alone without a tour guide , we could enjoy the process of doing our survey . we could gain more knowledge broadly and deeply though the internet or from our friend . the joyness not only come from paying a visit , but also from the process of studying the place that we intend to go . the final reason for my disagreement is that the tour guide might view or explain the place from his or her point of view , which might mislead u from the genuine concept or idea of one place . people often have experience that a tour guide guide u to the most famous spot of one place but miss the most historical , meaningful spot . it is only because that the guide considers where to visit in his own thinking , or his own benefit . that is not to say , of course , that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is completely without merit . nevertheless , with the reason i presented above , i disagree with the title statement . i believe that backpacking or travelling without tour guide could bring the most elating experience though the travel .
