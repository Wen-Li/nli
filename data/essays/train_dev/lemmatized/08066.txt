i agree the statement that a people who want to be success shoud try new thing and take risk rahter than only doing the regular thing . the first reason , we can not get more success from the regular thing . if the thing already know how to do well , then there is nothing need u to do . it 's hard to do them better . then why not to try a new thing or take a risk ? normal people always use the regular way to deal with the common thing . so they can not get success . let 's see the successful people , almost of them are begin with trying new thing or take risk . the first step of be successful is to try it , to take a risk . the second reason is that people always be successful from trying new thing and taking risk . it 's not easy to try a new thing or take a risk , because you always will be laughed by the others . the first step is very difficult to do . but when you did it , you will fell much more difficult , because you must pay more time and work harder . the way to success is not a normal way , so just a few guy can get it . trying new thing and take risk are not equal to be successful , but it 's the first step to success . if you want to be a successful people , you must to do it . if inventor do n't want to try the new thing , they ca n't invent anything . if they did n't try , maybe we have n't light , car or computer , maybe we still live in the stone age . so we can get that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
