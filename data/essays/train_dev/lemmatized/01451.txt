young people are often said to mostly have themselves in mind . this thesis might arise from decreasing number of young people that are actively participating some sort of community . but is this true ? in my opinion this theory is too simple and the topic need to be viewed from several aspect . what kind of community are we talking about ? churches , sect , club or online community ? in case of the first two i believe it may be alright . young people would like to be free in mind and not spend their life being afraid of an evil lord who will smack them down unless they serve certain people . turning their back to religion for me is the right choice . but on the contrary i believe that private and online community are not lacking motivated and caring young people . a lot of community have been formed - or should i say boomed ? - during the past few year . the word itsself is probably one of the most frequently used one among young people . their active participation help these community and , a it is the idea behind it , it also help themselves gathering social contact exchanging information and opinion . but yes , some child certainly spend too much time playing video game or watching tv instead of making something that is more productive or creative . they waste their time they sit in front of their monitor seeking short-term satisfaction . of course they are wrong but their are not the one that tell themselves what is right and what is wrong . they also will not find a way to community themselves . it is their parent that are responsible for them so it is them that need to be harmed if young kid some day lack social skill . they determine where their child go , what medium they are confronted with and what social activity their child are part of . but the parent are not solely responsible . teachers play a role and have to provide a kind of ethical education , too . to conclude i would like to say that this sentence is full of prejudice but maybe totally nonsense . it is true that society force most people to take care of their own a there are le and le reward given for sacial action .
