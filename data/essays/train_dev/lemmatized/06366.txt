is there anyone who is successful through a entire history without challenging to a new thing ? i absolutely agree with the idea that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know for some reason . at first , trying new thing mean getting new chance . secondly , if they fail , they can learn something that other people never know by their experience . the first reason why i believe successful people try new thing and take risk is about chance and possibility of being successful . if people just do what they know how to do , that mean they will have no chance to learn new thing and achieve new goal . speaking of business , nowadays if someone want to start his/her own business , she/he will contemplate about the field that other people doe n't try yet or is not varified enogh about the success . trying new thing somewhat mean seizing an opportunity . it 's clear to take high risk in a new field but once that business get a right way , it also can get much more success . the higher risk are , the bigger success will be . if there is a someone who just follows the familliay way , it would be safer and esier but success , the result , would be limited in return . the other reason why i think being successful requires to try new thing and take risk is learning new thing . in a challenge , there is a lot of possibility to fail . however , people can learn lesson or new knowledge from that failure . this experience is never exchangable with anything . it also can be a sturdy foundation of their next step . most successful people got through the severe failure but they never kneeled down to that bitter experience . if people could get over it and learn something , they would be successful with it .
