this statement is , in my opinion , incorrect , since i do not belive that someone with a broad knowledge of many academic subject could compete on a specific subject with someone specialised on this subject . in today 's society a great field of expert , specialized into certain academic subject , exists . so it will be hard for somebody with a broad knowledge of many academic subject to be more effective in fulfilling his profession , than someone who specialized on this subject and is perfectly trained in his profession . of course some basic knowledge of many academic subject is neccessary in order to make connection between different field of study and to spur developement and improvement of subject . this occurs especially in science where for example calculus and physic are very closely related and could have never been developed a far a they have been without scientist having a good knowledge of both . but without specialization into one of these subject , or even into subfields of these subject , no more improvement could have been made at some point since it is not possible for the human brain to take and work with all the information that exists on the two field of study today . so it is also not possible for anyone to gather broad knowledge of even more subject . so i believe that nowadays it is even better to focus on one subject only , but therefore to study it a perfectly a possible and then form research group with other expert in other specific subject in order to develope new invention , then to try and cope with all the existing information and to accquire a broad knowledge of many accademic subject .
