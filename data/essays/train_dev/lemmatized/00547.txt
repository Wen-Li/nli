the statement propose could be considerate correct in some case but incorrect in others . the two possibility rappresent two kind of idea , and the use of the first one , in opposite of using of the second one is different case by case . i prefear to have a specialize knowledge in one specific subject . the motivation of my personal choose is the strong possibility rappresented by this opportunity . if you are the best in an argument you will be called everytime someone need help on it . an example is the use of computer in general . in my university group i am the best in using of computer and when some friend of mine have problem with computer , he ask me how he can to resolve his problem and if he need to repair it , he ask my help too . they call me because they know i am able in using computer and they call me only in this case . i am able also to resolve math problem , but my friend never call me to resolve this type of problem , because i have some friend of mine more able than me to resolve this kind of problem . i use this example to demonstrate that if a person want to decide of use the second sentence he must be shure of to be very strong in the argument he choose else is better choose the first sentence . the first sentence get opportunity for whom is able to organize himself . the knowledge of many academic subject permit of use everykind of knowledge in all type of academic subject . is not easy do that and i think this kind of possibility is for few person . in the end i can say that i use specialize myself in one specific subject , but i am not agree with second sentence , but i think everyone have to choose the best opportunity for himself .
