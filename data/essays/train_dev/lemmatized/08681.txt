i agree that successfull people will try new thing and take risk than doing the thing they already did well because of the following reason first , the people who are successfull are well experienced and have diiferent way to approach thing to solve their problem since they already know what is good and what is bad from their experience and knowledge they lgained . for example scientist who come up with new innovation in this present world are very imaginative in inventing new thing rather than working on the same thing again and again for example thomas edison ha undergone great strugglle in inventing the bulb if other scientist worked on the same research then we would n't be enjoying other pleasurable thing that made our life easier and quicker in this world lke invention of aeroplane , car , computer etc . , . they risk their life doing it in all possible way by working day and night in their laboratory . second , it may increase one survival rate to live a little longer and enjoy one life in this beautiful world for example : if a pateint ha a cancer and he is taking appropriate medication but the symptom of cancer are n't working with the use of medicine then it is better for a doctor to try chemotheraphy ie use uv ray which are very hard to tolerate but ha high chance of subsiding the growth of cancer cell rather than trying the same medication again and again for better and longer living of person . so , trying new thing by taking risk would create our life easier , faster and live longer .
