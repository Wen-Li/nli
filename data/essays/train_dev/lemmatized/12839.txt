there are several reason for people to take a trip . depends on each person 's personality , some people prefer to take a trip alone while the others prefer to travel in a group that is led by a tour guide . this is controversial subject to dicuss about , however ; in my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . the first reason is that , people do not need to worry about thier safety a they do when they travel alone . tour guide know well about the area that they are travelling . as a result , they offer tourist who are in the group , a safe hotel to stay in and clean restaurant to eat . in addition , guide give several practical advice to help people stay out of problem . for exmaple , in some area , it is extremely dangerous to travel alone without any knowledge , such a new york where all kind of crime are happening . therefore , within a group led by a guide , tourist aviod some potential danger . the second , people get explanation of historical place that they visit . if people are traveling alone , they need to purchase a guide book and struggle through it to find exact information that they want . or sometimes , if they can not find , they may ask to other people who live in that area . however , this is not likely going to happen because the tourist would feel embarrased from lack of knowledege . as a result , travelling with guide is convenient . the last , people save moeny and time . as travelling with in a group , there is limited time to visit some place . this mean that they are going to visit important plaecs . plus , place that are worth to visit . this help them to save time and preventing them from wondering which place to visit first . moreover , when people travel alone , they lose direction often , because they are new to that place . they need to spend additional money for staying in hotel if they get lost and it is dark outside . consequently , travelling in group led by a tour guide is more efficient choice for people , since they are le exposed to any sort of crime . additionally , people get abudant explanation from guide and save thier money and time .
