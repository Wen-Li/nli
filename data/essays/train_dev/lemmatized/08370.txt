today company need diversity in order to stay competitive in a very rude market whereas student are more and more specialized in a knowledge for example they chose a special course to study marketing or human management . this two fact are contradictory . that 's why i am totally agree with this statememt for many reason . have a large knowledge concerning very different subject give u many benefit . first if student are performant in differents sector they obtain a good mobility in work . it allows to change lot of time of work for example if you study mangement and maerketing it allows you to first work in advertisment and the in the human ressources . i think it is very important . your work is more exciting . whith general capacity concerning differents activity you will complete your knowledge and you will become more competitiv against other worker with only specialized capacity . you will obtain easily a work qnd will better earn . then in a complex market you have to consider all side of the environment and so you have to improve your general knowledge in order to understand and act well on the market . general information can help you to resolv a problem . a complete foration allows you to best consider a problem . moreover a lack of general knowledge is an important drawback because it reduces the subject of discussion in your allday life . all thing you know will be used one time into a speak and so the more knowledge you can learn the more you must learn . the people considered a open-mainded present lot of knowledge . actually they are specialized in a course but they have great knowledgs concerning others subject . to conclude i cqn say that it is a bad strategie which is used by education . when student are specialized they have a huge lack in general knowledge
