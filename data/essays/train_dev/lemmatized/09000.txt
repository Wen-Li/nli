when asked about whether there would be le car in twenty year than now , different people , however , have different viewpoint , depending on their personal experience , insight of the development of nowadays society and some other factor . the prediction , nevertheless , is difficult to make . as far a i am concerned , the number of car in twenty year will increase in developing country . on the other hand decreace in developed country . among those countless factor that affect my opinion , i would only explore a few primary one a follows . the essential reason why car in developing country will become more and more in 20 year is that developing country are more likely to develope their industry a their first goal in the follwing year . as a result , car , an important criterion to show the level of the development of a developing country , will be more and more under the leading of government . a good case in point is the faster and faster growing number of car in china . the goverment of the country ha recently imported the core technology of car-manufactory from some japaness company . this would lead to the decline of the price of car in domestic market to encourage people to buy car . so , there is no doubt that there would be more and more car in china . therefore , i believe that in developing country , there will be more and more car . and an important reason of the decrease of number of car in developed country is that the developed coutries are paying more attention on the protection of enviroment in these year . and their public transportation system is good enough to support the growing number of people who use bus or underground . countries such a england , fance and the usa are now undergoing the situation i have illustrateed above . as , what ha been discussed above , you will be sure to know why i ha the opinion stated in the first paragraph .
