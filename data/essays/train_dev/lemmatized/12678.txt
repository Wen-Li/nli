in these day , people should consider a tour guide a a mark that guide lost people . i prefer to travel in a group that is led by a tour guide because i might find thing easier and more comfortable . while traveling to other country , the main thing that our family think about it is that how we will get to our appartment and who will take u to visit the place in the country . the tour guide is the one that will take u to our appartment or hotel , and he will gonna explain thing about the city ot the coutry because he is the son of his country . going with a tour guide made u learn many thing , for example when we visited england we found many statue , park , tree , train and river . each one of thesis wa explained clearly and accurately about it time and place and when did they found it and how long that it will exist , all that wa known by the tour guide . we learned many thing and we had more experience about this country . without going with a tour guide we may get lost . a tour guide is like a north star that guide lost people . before few year , when we went to visit australia we thought that we might not need to use a tour guide and because of that we had alot of problem and trouble . we were trying to find a park from evening until night and when we reached there everyone wa lost . in the conclusion , a tour guide is better to use because he guide lost pe
