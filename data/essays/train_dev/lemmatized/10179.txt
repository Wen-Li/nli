i think it is very difficult to say which one is more important . however i agree that is more important for student to understand idea and concept because those are very useful to develop a critical approch to the world . but i have to say that understand only the concept have both advantage and disadvantage . on the plus side , like it is written before , understanding deeply the concept help you to see what is happening in the world with your own mind and to be critic too , so you can say what do you thing is running great and what is not . you can also say your opinion and support the solution for a specific problem that you like more . on the minus side it is also very important to learn fact , because history is based on fact , and only the knowledge of fact can help you to understand what happened and how can you act in order to avoind the bad thing . in addition many work are based on the fact , for example an administrator or a manager of a company must decide what is better to do based on what really happened . on the contrary there are other job where i think it is more important to understand the concept . let 's consider an engeneer : he ha to develop new product and he ha to solve very difficult problem and also he is always looking for the best solution , so he must elaborate new solution based on what he already had learnt . we can say the same thing if we consider an artist . an artist is always looking for new way of expression , he want to shock every time his fan presenting them something that is totally new so his job is based on concept ! however we can say that the best solution for this problem is to give the right weight to both of idea and fact , probably idea is more important than fact , but without fact i think it is impossible to use the concept you have learnt .
