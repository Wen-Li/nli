i do not agree to the idea that the car will be decreasing in twenty year . the reason is that the people keep seeking convenience . the car is one of the most marble invention in the human history . it make fast the transportation and wide the working range of the people . it is impossible to make slow the people 's commuttance and to make narrow the influence of individule in the future than today . then , we need alternative to replace the car . however it is hard to expect that in twenty year . instead , i think the car might be developed in many way . for example , it can have convinent wing to solve the traffice jam or it can be driven by non-polluting fuel . however , the car will be more in use , even though the population is decreasing . i live in korea which ha a small land but ha three major supplier of the car which called hyundai , deawoo , samsung . that mean that the car is very useful and used widespread even in a small land . i also have my personal car and my family ha 4 car with 6 menbers . i would say it is common and getting more common in the world . another reason is that the car industry ha much share of the whole industry . it provides many job and is supported by much side industry and research . as i know the industry which ha the most big percentage of invention in the world is the car industry . if the number of car is decresing , the much of the economy of the world will be affected . therefore , i think it is hard to imagine the decrease of car in twenty year .
