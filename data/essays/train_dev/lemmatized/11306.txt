nowadays , young people could get much more information than before . sometimes , they got too much information and too much thing have to do or read , cause them have to spend their time staying at home or working . young people have no time to help their community because of their busy and irresponsibility . first , young people will force to study and learn other skill such a playing piano or guitar . they have to spend their time in class over eight hour in a day . that mean , they lost their leisure time to be together with their community . they do n't have any chance to know what happened to their community and also do n't know how to help them . young people lacked of time to care about their community because they even do n't have to time to prepare their work . second , young people are not so responsible a the old people . for the traditonal custom , old people will consider community a an important role for them . in spite of they are busy , they will spend their time in community and try to help or slove any problem . however , young people were spoiled by their parent for a long time that made them locked of responsibility . young people did n't take this duty a regarded . they do n't care about others except themselves . they are rather staying at home than going out even thought the community are outside . young people for nowadays have different thought . they are too self-esteemed and selfish which cause them not to care about their community . they might have some time can help or do something for their community . howere , they hate to do these because they do n't want to get any trouble in case . they also do n't want to argue with their neighbor while they have their own opinion . as time changed , young people dislike to help their community .
