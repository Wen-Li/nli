in my opinion it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact where it could bring out the natural talent in side the student and make him understand the thing more clearly than it happens in the class room . understanding the idea and concept make the childern think more scientifically and discover more new thing about a partiucular concept it inculcicate a habit in childern to analyse the thing in more broad way and arrive at the result on their own . understanding the thing rather than learning the thing from fact from class room help the child to remember the thing for longer and in inculcicate new idea in arrive at new idea which help them in a long way to go . also learning concept and idea rather than learning fact which were written or told by some one help to develop a sought of inviduality in the childern and to evalvuate the issue in rather broad way standing different form others . for an example one of my friend with a concept of aerospace in his mind later developed a idea which he implemented in one of his project an his project wa selected to demonstrated in nasa in untied state of america . and he also wa rewarded by the president my country a the best out standing research student in his age group . learning concept and idea would also childern in their education where he could he could he could be intrested in field like research and thing do really do matter a lot and even have lot influence on on his/her professional carrer . concept and idea and are not only confined to four wall of a room where these could obtained form many place in nature in book in people and even in him self . finally i would conclude knowledge of idea and concept is large ocean where it ha no age ba revery one is a intelluctutal in him self only thing differs is to understand the concept and implement his idea in to practice .
