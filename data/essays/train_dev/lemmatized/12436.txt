i am in total agreement with the statement , `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . although many might object to this opinion of mine by simply giving the example of the huge increase in the production of the car the world ha witnessed in the last few decade , i would like to draw their attention to the reason behind my backing the statement . first and foremost , the industrial revolution that ha first introduced the concept of faster and comfortable travel by mean of car ha also led to an increased rate of depletion of the planet 's non renewable energy source and not to mention an increased state of anxiety among the environmentalist regarding the way the pollution - air , water , land ha been slowly eating up the planet . this ha resulted in an increasing number of venture every day by various nation and their respective government to tackle these issue . for example , japan ha asked it citizen to use the older mean of transport like bicycle to commute to their office if they are nearby and now it ha made a significant break through in designing cycle that are run by solar power and are a comfortable a driving a car to the work place . it is these invention that offer an alternative to stall the present energy crisis and it can only be concluded that such desings are going to increase in number in the coming year owing to the fact that all graduate and professional college are encouraging their student to continue research in such field . secondly , the population boom which many country are witnessing would hardly leave any more space to build new road . the fact that skyscraper were first built to conserve space make me believe that even in developing countires like india , which incidentally ha the secong highest population in the world , a day would come where commuter would have to travel from their residential place by mean of fast moving , solar powered train that run in between the residential quarter but at an elevated level . and my belief is further supplemented by the huge technological leap the world ha made in the last five year alone . to exemplify this point , i would say the communcations sector . who would have thought that within ten year of their introduction the cell phone have come a long way from their humble beginning to their moders state-of-the-art sophistication . finally , my last but point that hugely weighs in making me stick to the statement is the underlying change in the attitude of the people . the last five to six decade have made people see the downfall of living a fast life and people have been showing a marked tendency to slow down the pace of their life . people are turning to yoga and family support more than they previously did which make me believe that inspite of more and rapid technological advencements in the year to come people have started showing more care for the mother nature and this will lead to a reduction in the number of car that will be put on the road in the future .
