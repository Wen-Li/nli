in my opinion people do n't have success because they had tried new thing and taken more risk , but because they had done what they knew they do well . to become successful people it 's better to focus only on what they already know and are strong in . if you have a very good preparation either for your experience or for your academic knowledge , you will be successful without taking risk or trying to do something you are not good in . this , because you can sell yourself in a better way , for example , if you have to find a job , specially when you are just graduated and begin to apply for a work for the first time in your life , it 's important to demonstrate what you are able to do thanks to your skill and know-how previously acquired . in addition , if you are very strong to do something because it 's not new for you , without accepting risk you 'll show a great capacity to do it , although you 're doing that just for personal satisfaction . in both case the more you are sure in what you 're doing because you know how to do well , the more people can trust you and obviously they also will ask you some advice . on the whole , being successful people because you are very expert in what you are doing , will be easier than when you are taking risk even to do something you are very weak . in this way you can reach a personal satisfaction just doing what you are strong in and i think it will be surely a big personal satisfaction because what we know how to do well is what we like to do .
