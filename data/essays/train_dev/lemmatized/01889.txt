i do agree with the statement that young people do not spare enough time helping community . todays young generation is the `` busy generation '' , the generation which doe not think 24 hour in a day is sufficient . but the truth is not that there is a shortage of time but that there is absolutely lack of time management . people just dont plan their time which lead to a disorganised schedule and the end result is that they dont get their priority right . as a result they tend to focus more on meeting `` their '' need and are not bothered about giving something back to the community we come from . the phrase `` community service '' is rarely heard these day . well , who then is to blame for such a sorry state ? all of u . community service start at home . helping the elderly at home or planting tree in the neighbourhood also constitutes community service . the school , the child study in , the college teen go to , the office people work in are all equally responsible . it is in these place that the seed of community service should first be planted . the consiousness to help the society we come from should gradually dawn in . commuity service can take many form . for example , the school child could be made to collect old clothes and food item and donate it to an orphange . a company could take the initiative in mantaining a park or a colony clean . students in college should start group or join an existing group and teach the underprivileged child in the adjacent locality . funds could be raised by way of organising cultural programme or entertainment show and the money collected be distributed to charity . and if there is any time when community service matter most , it is in time of severe strife , esp natural disaster such a flood , hurricane , earthquake , etc . after all what happens to a person today may happen to u tomorrow . we should , therefore give what we expect to recieve . and a very important step in this direction would be to start managing the time at our disposal judiciously and devote some time
