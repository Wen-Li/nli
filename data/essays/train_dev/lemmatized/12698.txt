this problem is wider than it appears . in fact , it ha to do with a very complex reality , in which several aspect convey . surely , and i strongly believe in this : in future there will be fewer car than there are today , and i am sure of this for several reason . during these year , energetic problem are growing more and more . fuel is becoming , every day , a treasure . surely , this problem ha to do with other part of our reality , but it 's evident that energetic problem are on the base of using a car . another aspect , for which i am sure car will disappear , can be sumed with one only word : `` pollution '' . cars produce very dangerous solution of gas and vapour , that can strongly damage the health of men and animal . it is demonstrated the the pollution in a town is produced in great part by car , and it is the first reason for cancer and other type of illness . the last reason , that i use to demonstrate my thesis , have to do with the spirit of the people , and with what i see every day . people have understood that , sometimes , if we take a car to go to do something . .. well we are very stupid , because we can do it going by bicycle or on foot , and using a car is not the best because , in any case , you have to park it . when i told `` what i see every day '' i wa intending this : i go to milano every single day of my life , i take a train , a metro , and a bus ; i live far from my university . i see lot of people who do not use the car because they can not for money , or simply because they 've understood that it 's not the best to drive in a city . ending my work , i sume everything , simply , saying that not only car will be fewer and fewer , but they will disappear , because polluition , economic condition and social reason are doing it .
