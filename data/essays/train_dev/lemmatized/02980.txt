i agree with the statement that successful people take risk rather than doing only what they know . successful people do take risk a they want to escape from the ordinary life . i do not call myself a very successful person , but i once have taken a risk and my life had been better . first , some milionaires famous in one area , once wa a expert in other thing , and i think that happens because that those people know how to master on one kind of subject . henry ford , the father of car , once wa a expert on a watch repair . he worked a one to earn his room rent and to study mechanic . then he thought about transportation and invented car . next , the successness is equal to the riskyness . which mean that when you have a high probability of failure , then you have a high reward when you success . i am in middle school grade three , since grade two , i liked a girl . she is in same school and i still like her . i wanted to say that i like her , but i got to shy when i stand in front of her . when i said that , i felt like falling down a endless cliff that i could never come up again , but when she laughed , said nothing and looked at me , i felt like a mattress holding me from the cliff , so i like her , and she know that i like her . lastly , risk are sometimes making something new or re-designing some product . edison , the king of invention , once tried to hatch an egg , and did not to go to school when in elementary school . his mother taught him . when he were grown up , he made a telephone which wa already made by alexander graham bell . however , the edison 's phone wa better to hear , so people bought edison 's phone . in conclusion , successful people try new thing and take risk rater than just doing what they know and what they can do well .
