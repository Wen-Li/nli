i completely agree on the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing the thing they are already proficient at . there are many great scientist , politician , poet who are considered very sucessful by our society . if they have not tried new idea they would not have been so popular . for ex : if professor einstein would not have thought of new theory in physic , we would'nt be studying the einsteins law 's of energy today . great discovery only happen when the people take chance and risk . for ex : columbus discovered america just by exploring new route across the ocean . many invention like the newton 's law 's of motion were discovered very accidentally , when newton threw a apple into the sky and observed the outcome . also for ex : many live saving anti-cancer drug would not have been in the market , if the pharmaceutical company have not taken a chance and invested in them . trying new thing and taking calculated risk brings in technology . for ex : i-pod is one good innovation of apple . every person who love music carry an i-pod . had the apple industry been so apprehensive about the market of their new product without actually placing it in the market they would not have been so successful . taking chance and trying innovative thing improves the life and brings in enthusiasm in every person 's life . for ex : one of my friend ha never tried hiking , i have encouraged her to come with me for hiking . she started to like hiking once she started doing it . to summarize , people should think creatively out of their shell and take risk which will improve their personality a a whole and which benefit the nation .
