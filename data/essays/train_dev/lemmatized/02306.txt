we all are familiar with the phrase ` knowledge is power ' . which is indeed a truth in itself a knowlege af any kind nerver let you down when you are in a crunch situation . therefore i agree that it is better to have knowledge of many subject a it make an individual intellectually sound and imparts in him the quality of decision making . it can be a good option to specialize in one specific subject if one is really interested in any reasearch activity but otherwise it should be diversed and should consists many interesting topic within his selected course and also have some general subject like art , ecology , biology etc . it help individual to be more powerful in this competetive world . in order to survive in this world one should have a quality to adapt to any situation and that is only possible if he ha a chance to navigate through the vast ocean of knowledge . i can give my own example . i had a subject in highschool name scoteer-motor cycle repairing . it wa an optional subject which taught me some basic of how to service our bike , how to maintain them . the advantage now i am having that i can service my own bike free of cost . it also help me in keeoping by bike in good condition . so we can see that the subject which seemed to have no weightage in my acedemaics rather helped me in my future to save money , which is indeed a requirement of the time for me now . so we can conclude that no knowledge go waste . somewhere sometime in our life we may require to use the knowledge which wa learnt just a a formality in the classroom . so it better to be prepared for our life with vast knowledge from broad knowledge rather than having a approach of getting limited common-sense knowledge by learning specific subject .
