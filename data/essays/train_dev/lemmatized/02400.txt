helping a community is a noble act . and i also agree that youngster today do not give enough time to help their own community . but it can not be completely attributed a lack of concern from the young people . there are several reason for this . the primary reason is that with so many activites going on parallelly in young people 's life - study , project , assignment and other more important commitment that they are left with very little time for themselevs . and so they prefer to concentrate that little time left in their hobby or some other personal activity rather than helping their community . with the advent of television and other medium 's which ha revultionised our life , we are concerned so much more with what is happening around the world that we actually forget the problem immediately surrounding u . one of my neighbour 's is addicted to this one sitcom , which is played everyday night that he actually leaf all his pending work and religiously watch the show . such is the impact of television on today 's generation . also there is a growing trend among youngster especially among the college goer 's that such activity are uncool and out of vogue . so some student deliberately avoid helping a community even if it is against their conscience , just to show that they are cool . to be frank , i myself have witnessed this during my junior college year . this kind of thinking which is actually much more prevalent among the youngster in the urban area 's need radical change . it is really a shame that youngster today consider such noble act a cheap and uncool . but there are some people in each community who after all this thing , dedicate some time to such work .
