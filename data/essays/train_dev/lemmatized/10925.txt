i disagree on having a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i feel that we should narrow down our choice of subject rather than increasing the knowledge on all subject widely . we all study for a better career and when we get out of the university people ask for specific skill and we should be the best among our skill to get the job . if we start having a broad knowledge on many academic subject instead of concentrating on what your career exactly need we will loose the race in the job hunt . we all know the famous quote `` jack of all , king of none '' now thats what would happen if we start gaining knowledge on many subject rather than one . we would no doubt increase our knowledge but unless we specialize on all of them it of no use . i would cite an example of myself , i always wanted to be a software engineer and there is heavy competition out in the market for software job . if i had not taken up software a my major in my university i would not have made a job . no software industry want a person who know 10 subject but is not specialized in software . but at the same time i insists we should know a bit of other subject too for the sake of our general knowledge and to live in this world . in our school we read about everything like math , science , geography , history , etc , . , and thats enough for u to know on many academic subject . once we come out of school and join a university we should start focussing on one particular area of intrest which would ultimately give u satisfaction and better career prospect . i would like to conclude by saying that specializing on one subject is always more fruitful than learning about a lot of subject .
