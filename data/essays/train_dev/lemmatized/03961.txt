to express my opinion about this subject , i must say that , this statement is very unclear . i will agress with this statement , when the young people are living in an individual society . on the other hand , i will not agree with it , when the same segment of poeple are living in a collective society . our culture are very different also our imagination of the moral . each culture ha another family system funcionality . and a a result ; the attitude to the family will be the same like for the community . for the explanition : the individual socity ; is this one who prefer that each member of the socity should have a near degree of the absoult freedom doing the thing in that way , which he think it is the right one . the young people in this kind of society do n't give enough time helping their coummunities , especially the old people , for example i live here in germany and it normal to hear that somebody is found dead in his flat , - but firts six month after his death - . it mean that nobody from his neighbourwood had noticed it at all ; that this man could n't be seen such long time . more and more , the young people are very busy with therselves . thy must achieve everything alone and for that , nobody else should participate with them even in their time . on the other side : there is another type of society , which called the collective one . in this one `` for example in arabic or asian country '' the young people stand beside to help their community . it depend on the value of doing the thing together . the acceptance that the member in such society could do what they want to do , is not there . each member should do the same thing in the same situation , because they are acting and living together . at the end , i can say generally that the culture difference nowadys are going smaller in direction of an individual society . so that , i do agree that the young people more and more are tendencelly not giving enough time to help their community .
