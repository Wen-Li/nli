some people agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact or others disagree that . when i read this question , i vicillated between agree or disgaree because both are important to student . however , i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it if for them to lern fact . there are few specific reason and example to support my statement . first , idea and concept could be basic information of all theory or others . for example , fact are from the idea and concept . if there are not idea and concept , ther also are not the fact , all investigation have pattern or method such a scientific method . first of all we think idea and concept first . that is why i assert that all fact made by lot of idea and concept . second , people can nat critical thinking when they learn fact . for example , 1 + 1 = 2 is a absolutely fact but they would not know why 1 + 2 = 2 because they do not know the comcept of the fomular . students to understand is idea and concept that will be helpful to them . in conclusion , i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and cocepts than it is for them to learn fact .
