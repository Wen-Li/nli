how the student can undestand the idea which are giving to him ? a reserch ha aproved the phenomnen when they have done this in some school they found that the student can understand the idea from the concept than learning idea . in my opinion i think learning from concept is better for many reason such a , the student can explaint in his way , it will be in his momery vey long time , and he can add more detail on it . the student when he undestands something he can explain it by his way . for example , if the student understood a theory or something complecated , he will simply can tell his classmate about it . also , he could answer any qustion about it . in brief , when you undestand something it 's better than learning fact . undestanding an idea is agood method to memorise it in the future . otherwise , he will get it when it necssery for the sutation which he is in . furthermore , the student when he ha the idea of the issue , he can add more detail on it . he can inspire a new informatoin about the iossue and then he will have agood knowledg in his life because of his undertanding of the idea . in conclusion , i agree that the student is better for him to understand the idea than learning it because it happend for me alot and i recomandleu disagree to learn the fact .
