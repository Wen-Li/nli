it is often difficlut for people to decide whether for student to understand the idea and concept or to learn fact to be important . for u student , the importance of learning fact always outweigh this of understanding the idea and concept . tere are numerous fact why i agree with thi spoints , and i would in here like to explain a few of the most important oes . first of all , learning fact can let the student master the event or knoweledge firmly . knowing the fact , student the meanig how the idea or concept are created . for example , the concept of nutrient , what of the food is of nutrutional , when student know the milk can provide protein for people health , then they know `` protein '' is the nutrutional element . that would be better to illustrate the fact than to tell the concept in this case . secondly , understanding fact is helpful for student to make difference between different idea and concept . since diferent idea and concept are originated different fact and the fact are always easily distinguished . for a instance , the `` frezen point '' and `` the dew point '' , these describe different in conclusion , but if all factor are contemplanted , it is no difficlut to inconclude that learning fact carry out more weight than those of knowing idea or concept . so , in conclusion , i think that learning fact is superior to inderestanding idea and concept .
