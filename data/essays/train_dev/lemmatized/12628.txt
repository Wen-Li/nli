when thinking about the next two decade one could imagine a lot of new invention and innovation that faciliate our life or even change it drastically . the prospect in technological development are promising and therefore i believe that there will be fewer car in use than they are today . in my opinion , the main mean of private transportation twenty year from now is still going to be the car . i do not believe that there will be an invention which is able to replace the car . in the last couple of decade the car ha assumed an important role in every-day life . it is too much included in our life routine a to lose significance in a little time a twenty year . however , the machine that will be called `` car '' at that time will be very different from the car we know today . technological development will have to face the problem of rapidly declining natural ressources very soon . as car use up the fuel given to u by nature , the developer need to find alternative energy source that are able to replace gas . methods like using electricity or solar energy which have already been invented have to be made more practical in order to convince people of the advantage of changing to new technology . the lack of indefinite natural ressources combined with a slow development of new technology will decrease the number of car in use . people will have to find other mean of transportation in order to get around . bus transportation will be increased and people might stick to this kind of transportation in order to save money and time a they do not have to wait in traffic jam when going to the office in the morning .
