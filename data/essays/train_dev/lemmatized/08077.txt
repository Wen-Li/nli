yes most and many advertisement make product much better than they really are . i believe making advertisement it is what a company do to make money , to have success . there is many sport shoe company out in the market right now , but do you really think a pair nike shoe coast $ 110 . but if you look into it , why a pair shoe coast so much , because is a advertisment so nike make their shoe look better than everyone else 's . at the end of each day , what the company really want , they want to have success , they want to be on the top , that want to make money and they would do what ever they can to get to the top . yes , i agree that most advertisement make product seen much better than they really are . a pair nike shoe do n't really coast $ 110 , they coast something like $ 5 to $ 10 . on top of all the tax , import , export . it come out somewhere around $ 80 . and then , the bussiness want to make money so , they add another $ 30 on there , it come out $ 110 . what kind of advertisement nike use there . they make the shoe very expensive , it make the shoe look longlasting , better , or can make you go faster or jump further . the price convience you is a pair good shoe . if a pair shoe come in $ 10 , you would first think , wow it is cheap , but then you would question how long the shoe will last , and why they made it so cheap . you see what advertisement did there , because is so expensive that it convience you that is a pair of good shoe . there is lot competition out there between company and company . they all want one thing , and that is make money . their product could be the same , but the difference is judge what kind or type of advertisement did the company made . a good advertisement can put you ahead of the game and a bad one might just screw you over . so that is why when you watach on tv , there is famous people advertis for the company , hope you would want to but them . they are all doing one thing , to beat their competition . you do n't start a company and hope the company will faile . you want to have success . you want to be on the top . and i believe that is why company focus on advertisement so much , because once you get to certain level , everyone 's product are the same , they only difference will be who done the extra work . advertisements is an extra work , and this extra work and bring your company to the top . i agree with advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . but company have to do advertisment , that is the only way they can beat their competition and have success .
