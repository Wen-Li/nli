there is no denying that many politician and scientist have raised awareness concerning the problem of car pollution since it is now usual to hear about this issue in all the medium . however successful a solution to the car problem will be , it is a thorny issue in so far a everyone agrees that something must be done for the general interest but in the same time doe not want to give up driving his or her own car . it can be inferred from the opposition between general and personal interest that these latter will win at least for the next few year . thus , i am strongly convinced that more car will be used in twenty year . i believe this because of three main reason , which deal with wealth , the problem of fuel and the problem of space . first , it seems obvious that some country will use far more car than they use today because they become wealthier every day . these developing country , such a india and china , are peopled by more than one billion inhabitant who can not afford a car for the moment but will be able to do it more often , by dint of having a huge economic growth . thus , people who are going to give up their car in already developed country will not have any effect on the amount of car in use since other people will drive more car than before . moreover , it seems impossible for developed country to prevent developing one from driving more car because developed country have already done the same . some people would say that the problem concerning petrol will lead to a fall in using car . i do not agree with this statement . there is no problem a far a fuel is concerned because two solution exist . either company find more petroleum or another type of fuel will be used . some country , such a brazil , have already changed fuel by using oil that come from agricultural product . so , it seems to be true that car manufacturer will not have to be worried about this problem . cars will keep being the unavoidable motor of our economy . the third reason why i believe that more car will be in use in twenty year is that i do not agree with the people who argue that fewer car will be used because of the traffic in city . it is true that more and more car in city cause unbearable traffic jam , but it is not true that people will stop driving for this reason . i state this because car manufacturer have already shown that they were able to solve this problem too . their answer consists in designing smaller car , which take le space and are more easy to park . the most famous example in europe is the success of the car named smart . if more people drive smaller car , then there will be no problem at all . in my view , more car will be used in the future because nothing
