joy of life ha diffrent meaning for every and each one of u . many of u think that young people enjoy life more than old people do . i totaly agree with this point for the following reason : younger people are healthy , they have tasted le pain than older people , and they have le constrains and responsibility in their life . first of all , young people enjoy a healthy body , in most case disease free , which allowes them to participate in many diffrent event . we rarely ever see an old man surfing . also sport world wide is more concerned about young people rather than old . people who are fourty year old and above never have the fitness to compete over sport title . one the other hand , young people enjoy body fitness . how many time did we see a fifty year old win a race with a twinty year old man ? . secondly , young people have been through le problem than old people , daily life problem doe not effect them both the same way . young people do n't usually have problem at work . in addition to that , problem are easy to be forgeten when we are young . young men can easily get over a fight for example . on the other hand older people are more exposed to domistict husbend and wife fight , a man or a woman who life in such a situation can never be a happy a a single young person . lastly , young people are more free , they have le responsibilties . for example , young poeple wo n't have to worry about paying rent . indepdency is another factor . in early age people wo n't have to worry about other family member . on the other hand , old people have many responsibility that they can not neglect , they have to provide food and shelter to their family , which is another thing young people wo n't have to worry about . at the end , it is easy to notice that life is way easier when we are young . based on my experience , when i wa a teenager i enjoyed unlimited amout of fun and happeness , the reason behind that wa the free , healthy life and absence of responsibility . that is why youngsters are happier than old people .
