the issue at hand is whether one should try new thing and therefore put something at risk , or just stick to area one already ha experience in . in time of globalization , economy develop at an enormous pace - people do have even le time to , for example , invent new theory or machinery . otherwise they will not be able to compete successfully in a globalized economy . thus , it is important to always explore new area , in order to remain competitive . i am strongly convinced that research is one of the essential key to success for many industry - research can open new , fascinating oportunities that will help your company to be successful . however , research relies on moving into field that have not yet been explored . in order to invent something remarkably new , people always have to think one step further . if one company try to keep to it root and therefore avoids beeing progressive , failure will not wait long . moreover , getting an insight into new , unexplored area is not only useful but also highly interesting - not only for researcher themselves but also for customer who steadily are longing for new technology in all field of industry . people are used to , to always have something newer and better than their neighbour - if this competition ended , people would loose one of their main goal in live . therefore , company do have the task to satisfy their customer 's need , by exploring new technology , if they want to remain successful . i am of the opinion that taking a certain risk , to some extend , is n't even evitable . a risk-free life is not imaginable to me , due to the fact that you have to take decisisons repeteadly , without knwoing what come out . people who are not able to make any decision at all will definetly not have a good job , a satisfying life and and therefore will definetly not feel happy . to sum up , not only company but also individual - so to speak , everybody - need to take a certain risk , if they want to be successful .
