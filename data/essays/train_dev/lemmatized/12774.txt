it is quite an important question . i think it depends on the level of the study . actually , if the student is a graduate student , it is quite different than if he is an undergraduate student . in one hand , a broad knowledge of various subject is important to aquire a good culture . it allows the student to have interest in a lot of thing . besides , if he doe not know what he would like to do , it is a way for him , to hit various subject upon , and why not , for what he will be passionate , or unless what he would do later . in the other hand , to specialize in one more specific subject would be better for a student who know for what he is interested , and who want complete his knowledge , i mean , who want aquire a deep knowledge . this student could get bored by the others subject . even though , i own up , it would be a way to allow him to find interest in other thing . actually , a far i am concerned , i would rather praise for a progressive solution . and i think that it is what it happens in the university . i mean , i suppose it is better to have a broad knowledge at first , in order to specialize in one specific subject after that . this is why i told about the undergraduate and the graduate student . an undergraduate student ha a knowledge about various subject , unless a general knoledge , and when he become a graduate student , he can specialize . it seems logical . a graduate student need the whole time to concentrate and stress his subject a better than he can . eventually we can also ask if the better wa let the student choose . would it be possible imagine a personnal program which would match with the student plan ?
