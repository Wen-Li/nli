in ancient greece , a philosopher who founded his own school expected applicant to know geometrics a well . is that still the case today ? we shall hereby prove that due to the advance of science , this ha become almost impossible , though a broad culture is a paramount asset to modern life . many philosopher and genius throughout history showed that having an extremely broad knowledge wa possible : voltaire french philosopher of the end of the seventeenth century , wa an famous writer a well a a good ingeneer in agriculture . at these time , there had been a major intellectual movement whose goal wa to gather every scientifical and technical knowledge in encyclopedia . since there wa not many of them , contributor to those book had to acquire this knowledge themselves ! moreover , it wa seen a a way to set oneself appart from old religious scheme which were seen a a tool of obscurantism . yet , now that science triumphed from religious doctrine which were judged somehow simplistic a explanation of natural process , the scientifical methodology itself ha made universal knowledge virtually impossible to gather for one individual alone . being the key to the improvement of production and the welfare of human being , science wa rationalized to such an extent that no one can publish any decent academic article or research work without having been granted the diploma to do so , which implies studying the subject for duration that can reach decade . one usually ha to attend class for more than ten year to become a doctor ! nevertheless , one must not forget that science binded with elitistic norm of education can become a threat to democracy , a soon a knowledge becomes the private property of a small group of overspecialized office holder . ignorance a a way to keep people under control wa most commonly used in authoritarian regime such a south africa , in which the coulour-skinned could not be taught in english , which wa the language of the administration . this aim to prove that though specialization is required nowadays , a broad culture is vital to everyone in order to prevent any abuse .
