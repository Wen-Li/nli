the university usually teach the student to work hard . to read the appropriate book , to listen carefully , to make note and finally to recollect the learned information in an exam or paper . but are the needed information only learned by conscious or are they understood and still available in our mind after the test ? if a course consists only of learning fact and figure , then for sure the student will forget pretty soon what it wa about . but if they need to understand idea and concept they will be kept in mind once they 've been learned . despite the importance of understanding the information and concept , in many course it is still necessary to learn figure and fact to get a background knowledge about the topic . as long a the balance between learning and understanding is kept , there is no problem with it . but if the learning overwhelmes , the student might get bored of the stuff and demotivated . the risk of giving up is high then . moreover it is very important that a student can realize how to use the learned concept in praxis . that point also stand for understanding idea . but if the idea or concept is very complex and the student did n't get it right , he might stay behind and ca n't follow the course any longer . especially if the following build on the known concept . in my opinion it is indeed more important to understand idea and concept than to learn fact , because thing i 've once understood i would n't forget again . moreover it give me the feeling of success if i understand the way it work . for sure i also have to learn theoretical fact for my study but i think it 's more important if i can use the fact i 've learned a a base for going further in understanding a concept . to sum up i would say that a combination of both , the understanding and the learning process is optimal for a successful study .
