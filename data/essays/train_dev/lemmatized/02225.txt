we have right to know and educate the truth occuring in the world . advertisements make product a lot of information through television , radio , newspaper and internet . i do not agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than really are . some person who work in the advertisement company give information to u . they have a focus on the some event , and in detail they give their thought and insight . if they all have caught a mistake sensation of the actual event , there is huge problem . however since actually advertisement present to u after cheking many editor , i believe that overmistaken advertisement will disappear from the advertisement . for getting really advertisement and information , it is necessary to be free in our sociality , education and economy . if we do not have the freedom right of knowledge , education , speaking and religion , i agree that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . under the condistion such a no freedom right , we have possibility which prodcuts seem much better than advertisement really are . for example , the people in north korea are blocked from a lot of information of the others ' country . they hear only information which central social committee decides that may advertise for the people . however they believe true information because they do not know the information of the others country . in conclusion , when we could have freedom right , most advertisement make product which they really are . if we could not , most advertisement make product seem much better than they reall are . in united states , since i have freedom right , i do not agree it sentence .
