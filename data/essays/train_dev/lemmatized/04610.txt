in turkey , almost 45 % of total population is composed of young people . if there is a problem about young people , that cause big problem to be solved . nowadays , it is believed by most of the population that , young people do not give enough attention on their community . first of all , it must be accepted that there is a problem about young people and tried to be solved . especially in turkey , we can not see any young people when some problem about social life or country are discussed . youngs think that `` these are unnecessary subject and can not be solved by u '' which is completely wrong . people are effected by various source of communication device such a tv , radio , mobile phone , etc . in the program , it is always mentioned that being a rich person in an unfair and quick way is the best way . youngs do not want to study any more because of these program . second , student population is very high in turkey . they are highly concentrate on their primary job which is finishing the school in an acceptable time . problems about social life and country do not bother them any more . education system make student only `` living memorizer '' instead of a researcher or a confident person . how can we expect a young boy/girl to be confident if he/she is grown up under pressure of his/her parent or teacher ? finally , reading habit is very low in young generation . it can be seen not to be related to this subject in the first sight but the more you read the more you know and if you do not know , you can not discus or help . as a result , young generation is effected by some external factor and forced to believe and live in such a lazy and slave life style . the situation is valid for today but should be worked on it . turkish culture and tradition must be told young generation instead of the west world 's .
