in my university experience i always appreciated what i learnt when i wa at the high school . during my high school time in italy i used to study latin and ancient greek . our professor wa always explaining u how to study these two classical language wa giving u the capacity to use in a really better way our mind , learning something that wa improving our way `` to think '' . ancient greek and overall latin can help you to understand better a specific topic because they are based on a logic structure . latin is really similar to math and it can permit you to elaborate more sophisticated concept when you know how to use word or sentence in a logic way . my high school wa called `` classic high school '' in opposition with scentific high school . i didnt learn specific and practic argument a math , phisic or geometry but i learnt to think . during my university time , at the architectural school in milan , i found out how much wa true my professor 's statement because i didnt get any problem to study really difficult argument a math , structure , calculation , etc. because my mind wa able to process every kind of data , even if they were different from what i studied at the high school . for this reason i think it 's really important for every student , with every kind of personal background and goal , to understand and to learn how to understand idea and concept instead of just merely learning fact . when you are able to understand an idea or a concept you can approach these thing with a critic view , elaborate them and creating a personal view about them , and not just learning fact without understanding why they happend , wich reason generated them . for student ' future is the most important thing and understanding idea and concept will give them specific skill to approach every kind of problem in life .
