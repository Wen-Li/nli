travilling is sometimes for holiday and seeing new place but sometimes it is for job . for the first , you can travel yourself or travel with a group led by a tour guide . sometimes you need the first one , sometimes the second one . i disagree the statement ; the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . it change according to the your physchology or your destination , that can be abroad or inside of your conutry . i prefer travel my own becuse of several reason . firstly , when you travel with a group led by tour guide you must fallow them all your travel . it sound do not come me good . it seems very resricted and boring . before you travel to some place sometimes you make some search about this place anda you imagine something also you plan something . when you travel with a group if a tour guide will plan to see place , where you plan to see , it is a problem . addtion to this , you can be bored the place but because of the group you must be in there . so it is not a good situtaion . secondly , tour guide generally take you historical place . sometimes it is a good but for person who is not interested with history or art it is also bad situtaion . in conclusion there are many reason like these to prefer travel my own . tour may not be good a you espected . the hotel may not be clear or comfortable . altough there are some advantage of travalling with a group led by a tour guide ,
