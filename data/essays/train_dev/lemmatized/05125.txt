i agree with the statement that is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . while there are many reason for my belief , two of the most important one are that they can explain to every one the idea that they learned and they can use those idea in their personal life . these belief deserve further examination in order to understand my belief that the student can learn easier any idea when they understand completly it . the first reason of my belief that the student will have the capacity of explain not only to the techer , but also to anybody what he understand with many detail . for example , when any student have completly understanding what he is doing can have easier knowledge of the idea that he is working . one of the best experience that i had ever had wa when i wa student and i learned to to mix the quemicals in the chemistry lab , i really coud have my mind on it and i knew the reason why , so i could help some of my friend . therefore understand what we see and read is the basic part to learn . next , if the student understood in a clear way some idea he will be able to use it in his personal life . he can find the reason why learn and understand have a bonding that help to memorise easier . for instance , understand concept help to develop the concentration . concequently , the student shoul have more concentratrion about more issue . in conclusion , have a good understanding of concept and idea is a basic issue for learn . if a student understand clarly can have much more opportunity in his future life because will be able to demonstrate his capacity
