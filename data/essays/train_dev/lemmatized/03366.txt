there are many impressive advertisement in every country to make their product look nice . however , i sometimes dissapoint it value when i buy , because it is really different from they are . that 's the method of atracting people to buy their good and that 's the only way that people know about the product . in my oppinion , it is important to make good look nice for seller because they have to sell product a much a possible because they spend a lot of money for the advertisement . for example , one company which sell good cheaper than othere company in japan . they do n't use big advertisement . their good are worth of the price but it 's not atractive at all . for getting customer and improving their quality , it is important to have a advertisement . competition is good for customer , too . it is difficult to know about product without any advertisement because that 's the only way to let people get across . it ha to be catchy and impressive . if there are same kind of product at the same time , it 's difficult to decide which one to buy . i think it is also an important ability to show the product nice for the company . in conclusion , for these reason that i mentioned , i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . it 's neccesary for the modern society 's competition .
