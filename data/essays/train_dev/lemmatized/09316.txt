some people believe young people enjoy life more than older people do and others are not . i think i 'm person who belief young people enjoy life more than older people do for many reason . first , young people can work harder than old people . young people can work any time and any place . young people have more chance to work in differet place because most of the job need young peole because they can do well but old people most of the time can not . as an example , i know two person , one of them young and the other old . when they try to find a job the young man find a job easilly but the old man did not find a job . second , the young people can play many sport . young people can play foot ball , basket ball and and different thing . young people have more vigor than old people , they can run and walk easier than old people . when you see the most sport game , you will see player which are young people . finally , young people can travle any place . young people can travel to cold place or hot place because their health help them but old people are not . i know some young people travle many place and they enjoy and i know others old people can not travel to many place . young people really enjoy life more than older people do . young people can work hard , play many thing and travle any place . i think most of old people want their young back .
