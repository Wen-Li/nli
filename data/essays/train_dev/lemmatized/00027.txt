i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i think profit is the most important for almost every company , so when they advertise their product to the customer , the product have to be look nice so that their customer would buy them . in addition , the company should advertise the product nicer and i think this is a part of their job . for example , when vegetable are advertised on the paper , they usually look fresh and clean but not with dirt . brcause the company think they would better to advertise the clean one so that many customer might want to go to the shop and buy them . however , a most people have already experienced like this situation . when you see the advertisment of product that you want to buy , it seems nice to you . but when you actually see the product at the shop , it is not that nice a you were expected and start to complaining . i think this is natural and what you need to do is see before you buy it . if company advertise their product a exactly a it look , not many people would buy them compare to the situation in the statement . because of these reason , i agree to the opinion that the most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are .
