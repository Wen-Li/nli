the statement about advertisement is , in my opinion , complitey correct . i perfectly agree with it . the reason are various : the possibility to presence of famous peolpe , the use of particular word or even the use of a combination of different colour . these can influence the quality of how to present a product . first of all , the presence of a famous and known person can determine a better reaction than not having one . for example an advertisement for shoe can be of better impact if a known actress is seen wearing it . or differently if you want a child to buy a specific school diary , a possibility is to show next to the object , the presence of a known disney character . second , the use of selected word can provide a good result for the aim . the combination of particular word can create double meaning that influence the people that watch the advertisement ! this mean that if you talk about choccolate and you write a sentence where you state that this food help when you are sad and give you energy , people might forget that it can also make you gain weight ! it is therefore possible to convince just by a particular phrase that one thing is good rather than bad . third , colour can be an important component for a good result in the creation of an advertisement . this is because specific doctor have studied the influence of colour in human mental thought . an example could be advertisement for medicine . usually doctor say that light blue is more propper for this purpose . differently , red and orange have other more complex capacity . this is why some colour are used and some others are le commenly chosen . in conclusion , it is possible to confirm that some product seem much better that what they actually are thanks to the possibility that advertisement provides . i agree with this statement . nevertheless , human taste may vary and therefore find some advertisement le effective than others .
