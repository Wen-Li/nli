there are much more thing that student must know than the student used to must know . especially after industrial revolution , in the area of engineering science there have been lot of development . some are not used anymore , some are still being used . if it is used , student have to have knowlegde about that . however there are so many thing which student have to know that it can not be given into a single person . so learning idea and concept is more important than to learn idea for two reason . first , it is the idea that create fact . all the fact come from a inventor or from a group of inventor . they have got first the idea , then try it and see whether it work or not . if student know the concept , they can know where inventor made thing wrong . actually , this is the way of development . for example , for all people know that if apple fall from a tree , it hit the earth , but newton asked why . from this point of view , he got another idea from a fact and created another fact . as in this example it is beneficial student to learn idea in order to increase their creativity . secondly , a mentioned above , there are lot of thing to learn . in a limited time period student learn either some fact and it application very well or idea and concept of many thing . second one sound better . the reason why second one sound better is because of globolization . if a person ha some idea about a issue , he or she can many available information about that issue on the library or on the internet . so the only thing is to know basic concept of an argument .
