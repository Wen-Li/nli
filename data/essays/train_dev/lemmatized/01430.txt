ok i believe that in the first way is important to know many kind of subject because a much a you know is the way that you will have the opportunity to choise the best academic area for you and your skill , after that i believe that the best thing that you should have to do is specialize in a specific subject because when you need to get a job is important to have experence in one topic like computer , chemical thing etc otherwise you will be like a `` semilla de todos los mole '' that is a mexican expression that mean that you know many thing but at the same time is le or not deep that covertsin a knowless person . for example im chemical engeneer and i want to study my master here in amsterdam , and in the begining of my carrer i wanted to study petroleum process but after a wild my mind start to change because in my study i had a ecology class and i did not know which of them i really want to studie , [ if you dont know about it let me tell your that both are in the same area ( chemical engeneering ) but they have differents profile , even they have a core programm in the ending is not the same ] so , i had had to choice one of them , because in a future when i will start to work again my work will be in one direction and now i do it , i will choice ecology !! although the reason that i write before i have a contrast opinion because for example the people that study arqueology they have to now many thing not just the arquitecture of one place i believe that a good arqueology should have to know about the past of the country that he or she is study , ha to know about the culture , custom , idiom etc , otherwise they will not do a very good discover in conclution i agree with both statement because depends of the topic and the personal taste of the person that want to study something .
