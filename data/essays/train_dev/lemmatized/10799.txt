it is quite difficult for me to agree or disagree with the statement . first of all , it is quite obscure that what the word `` enough '' mean . there are many young japanese who help their community , but whether they give `` enough '' time to doing it depends on the subjective view of how much time young japanese should spend their time on helping their community . older generation may disagree with the statement because they may have spent lot of their time in their community . the generation of the parent of the young japanese of today may think that it is simply impossible for young japanese to spend their time on helping their community taken into consideration the ever-intensified competition among the young generation . many young japanese spend huge amount of their time in both compulsory and private education such a `` juku , '' a cram school young japanese go to after school . thus , many parent may think that young people do spend `` enough '' time to helping their community , although they have many other thing to do . i can say niether that i agree nor that i disagree with the statement , therefore , due to the ambiguous definition of the word `` enough . '' it all depends on the reader of the statement . however , i may agree with the statement . young people may not spend much of their time to helping their community , probably because there are only few `` community '' in japan particularly in large city . now people move from one place to other place much more often than it used to be , and , a a result , they have fewer opportunity to establish their community itself . when there are no community a such , people can have no time to spend on their community . thus , the statement implies that young people do not spend their time on helping community even though there are community which young people are supposed to help , but they do not give their time possibly because the `` community '' are disappearing from the japanese society now .
