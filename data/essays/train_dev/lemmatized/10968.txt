i completely agree with the statamenet that say that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . most of the advertisement describes their product a they are the best in the market , without any consideration to any side or bad effect in it use for any human or any specific group such a child or eldest . at the same hand , most of the advertisement consider the financial margin a the most proirity rather than other important factor that might affect the whole human health , such a ingridents used for specific product that might cause cancer , allirgey , and diabetes . in my own expereince , i used to have redbull ( an energy drink ) a my daily drink to empower and keep my self awake for a long a possible due to my long working hour shift . two year later i read an article by chance followed with an internet research showed that all this type of drink are a slower killer more than an energetic drink ! it ha a ( stroptroin ) more than any thing else , and the research showed that more than one cup a day might cause to a heart attack and to a few case of addiction to it . but what make this red bull is the most famous energy drink , is the advertisement and campaign all over the world showing it one side effect ( enegry ) hiding all other negative side effect that might cause our life especially our youth ! it is not a problem to have these product in hour hand , but the disaster is that we need the proper awareness that tell u what exactly it is about . we need to read and keep educating ourselves with these kind of product , and to try a much a posible to select what is more suitable to our use and health .
