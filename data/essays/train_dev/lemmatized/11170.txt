do you remember everything you studied ? probably not ! however , if you once studied a subject in depth you will probably have experienced that the lesson drawn from that studying have had long-lasting effect . specializing in a specific study subject is a great choice , since this will allow the student to trully enjoy the subject , to acquire a profound knowledge of it and , ultimately , to apply this knowledge to further subject of study . when someone study something in depth , he usually enjoys the subject more than when his or her study is superficial . how can someone for instance enjoy history , when it is taught only a fact and date ? conversely , a deep knowledge of the context and cause of historic event , may make the study of history an amazing and exiting experience . furthermore , a thorough study of a specific subject allows the student to retain the subject more easily , because the knowledge so acquired ha deeper root . we have surely all experienced the contrary : trying to embrace many subject for our school exam and ultimately forgetting everything once the exam had passed . by studying someting in depth , the chance of this frustrating experience will significantly decrease ! moreover , the best about studying a subject in-depth is that , once we have a sound knowledge of a certain topic , we can draw link and establish relationship with other topic . this make the studying of further topic more simple . my best friend majored in art . .. you will probably not be surprised that he is also terrific in history , since any art expression is closely related to the historical context in which it took place . for all these reason , i strongly recommend everyone specialize in a specific subject , rather than try to gain a broad knowledge of many subject . the only question is , in which subject should someone specialize ?
