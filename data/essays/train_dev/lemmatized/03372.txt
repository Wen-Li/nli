to choose between a broad knowledge of many academic subject or a good specialization in only one specific subject is not easy , a both possibility have advantage and disadvantage . anyway i agree with the idea that it-s better to have a broad knowledge of several different subject , and that for several reason . first of all , a person with a variety of interest and knowledge in different field is probably a person with an open mind who show a strong intellectual curiosity . famous intellectual of the past , like leonardo da vinci , just to name one of the most known , had an incredible variety of knowledge and curiosity . then , having a broad knowledge of the world in general might help people in their carreer and professional life . also , having a good knowledge in a variety of subjcts doesn-t necessarily mean that a person can-t have a special field of interest in which he or she is more competent . an open mind and a broad culture can be a great advantage in a fast changing world a the one we live in today . in fact we must be ready and able to adapt to different situation and condition . on the contrary , if we are too rigid , if we are overspecialized in a very particular field , we might be unable to get the whole picture , so to speak , and we might be le flexible , le able to cope with any change we can have to deal with in our life . of course there-s nothing wrong with being very good in a particular subject we like more . i think that only overspecialization is wrong . if someone is competent and interested only in a very special field , he or she might be very good in his or her job , but might not be able to adapt or to react to situation that require a more general approach . sometimes you read on paper of terrible mistake doctor do in their work , a not understanding exactly a patient-s desease or simply confusing symptom described by patient . that can be due to the fact that some doctor are extremely well prepared in their field , but are sometimes unable to analize the whole situation , and they might miss the fact that they are dealing with people and not just with sick kidney or liver , to give an exemple . for all said reason , i do believe that having a broad knowledge of many subject and keeping the curiosity and passion for learning all our life is definitely better that limit our knowledge only to a specific field of study .
