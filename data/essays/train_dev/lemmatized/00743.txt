to have a good travel it is better to travel in agroup led by a tour guide because of many thing . first of all , whene you travel with a group of people you will have mor fun than when you travel alone . you will not be boured and there is no way to be sad if you travel with a group . there will be entertainment and fun activity all the way . second thing is when got sick there will be somone take care of you and help you . whene you have any problem in your travel there will be somone to share with and aske for help . the third is traveling with a groub led by a tour gude will make the travel more orgnized and will make le problem . for example , if you traveled with agroup and there is no tour guide and a probleme happened each person will give his own opinion with out listining to the other member and they may not agree with each other , but when there is a tour guide it will be easy to fix the problem . he will control and give the final answer . on the other hand , when you travel alone , there wont be fun or entertainment in your way becaus you are alon . you will get boured very easly becaus there is no one to take with . if you traveled alon and got sick there is nobody around you to help you . also , if you had a problem you wont recive any help because you are alon . finally , i would say that tarveleing alon is not good thing . we shold try to have our friend or family with u .
