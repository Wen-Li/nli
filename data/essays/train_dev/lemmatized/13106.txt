it is generally said that when traveling somewhere we need a group led by a tour guide . although a group or a tour guide would give some benefit , however , i definitly belive that the best way to travel is to do alone , because traveling with a group led by a guide is too costly and time consuming . above all , the cost of travel in a group and a tour guide supplied by tour company is extremely expensive . i experienced that before traveling the osaka in japan , the tour company that i chose suggested different option , if i added the tour guide to my travel , the tour company required almost twice cost a another which did not include guide . eventually i chose traveling alone and could buy present for my family and friend with extra money while abroad . moreover , nowdays we have a lot of resource about the tour informatation such a book in the library and internet that do not require any cost . with those method , we do not need to expensive guide anymore . second , within the schduled course suggested by tour guide , people can not enjoy the travel entirly . as each person ha different taste during the travel , naturally there are difference that member want to look at . for example , when i traveled over the europe with my family using package program desined by tour company , i felt uncomfortable because i wanted to stay in paris longer while others did not want . unfortunately i could not make schecule changed , i should leave paris in short time with unsatisfactory . in conclusion , i disagree with the statement that a group led by a tour guide give tourist most beneficial method , for the reason that i mentioned above . traveling with a group or a guide contributes a lot of stressful cost and it is wasteful in time-wides .
