i think that it 's better to have a preparation in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic , because the work 's of world research student specialized . for example in my experience of student at the politecnico of milan , the are two main street for to follow . you can to do three year or five year ; the main difference is that at the third year of engineering you must to decide your address of study . for example veicles , turbomachines , industrials field , material . .. at the end you must to do an work 's experience in a factory . this permit to know the new work 's world early and more fastely , while if you choose five year have more broad knowledge of more subject but le specialized .
