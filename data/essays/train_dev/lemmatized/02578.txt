i disagree with the following statement because i think that nowadays the car is most important for life and the people do n't make a step back . moreover i think the design of a car is improve of the 100 % and the innovation in this sector is in a great improve . so the innovation is most imporant in the world and the case-s car improve your gain to make a new car , and for this reason i think that for the nex twenty year there will a lot of car in the world . i think that twenty year are few to change the situation , if only there will some problem who can will danger for umanity life this statement will be real . for sure i think that a uman life of nowadays are depending of a car in fact if one people must go at work and if must few km for example one km , take a car and , for this reason the car in the world improve . if we look around w can wacth all day many car in the city or in a village and a the statistic test demonstrated the number of a car grown in the world . certanelly i think that the problem of the environmental is many too , but do n't all the people understand this problem . to solve this problem the people must use too bus or train to move but this is impossible now . in another word i think that a number of a car improve because the people do n't undertanding a problem who can cause at the environmental , and i think that the progress will be continue . in fact there is many other reason because being improve a production of a car , one of this is a globalization who make a world generalized when the market tends to produce a lot of product so in this case are the car . to sum up i think that in only twnty year the car will not decreasing , and only the big problem of the environmental will can change this situation .
