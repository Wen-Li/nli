i believe espeacially collage student should have broad knowledge of many academic subject . for example in my university called sabanci university , we have two year to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . no matter which faculty the student will continue with , all student should learn a bit from everything such a chemistry , biology , mathematics , politics , history \ design ect . for example i made a good useage of this system , by learning what i really want to study . as for me , i would never choose visual communication and design department if there wa no such a system . i have choosen this department by knowing what it includes , what the requirement are and for sure what plea me more . by looking from this perspective , i think that to have broad knowledge help to open people mind and create more well cultural backgrounded people . the more well cultural backgrounded people mean the more civilized people . perhaps this would lead to a better , pieceful enviroment for living . by the help of this system , people take more confidential step to their future job . as we see today , most people do not work at the same field that they were graduaded from , moreover they do not enjoy their job . as a conclusion , this system can be the solution of this problem . however i believe that after having broad knowledge of many academic subject , people should specialize in one subject , because it is also important to have specialized people on specific subject . if knowledge of everyone is on the same level , the scientific approach or artistic innovation would not be possible . as a result of all , my oppinion is , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
