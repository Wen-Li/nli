whether it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject , it 's a complicated issue . therefore , i 'm going to explore reason that support each kind of knowledge . on a hand , i think that having a broad knowledge is very important today , because the job is very flexible . one day you work in a field , and the day after you work in another one . for example , this happened to my father . he studied electric engineering at college , and after the graduation he started working for ibm . it wa quite predictable . but after a small period he accepted an offer from an alimentary company , and he became they international marketing director . i agree that it could sound strange , but it really happened . fortunatly my father had a basical knowledge of marketing , otherwise he would have missed this opportunity . on the other hand , i must agree that if you want to work in some company , a , for example , general electric , or microsoft , or again ibm , you need a specific preparation . otherwise , they wo n't choose you between all the other people . moreover , you have also to be the best in doing your job , if you want to be sure to find a good one . for example , one friend of mine ha graduated in biology , and he won a lot fo award for his experiment . obviously , he found a good job immediatly , while many of his schoolmate are still looking for one . after showing the advantage of each choice , my opinion is that even if you have to be specialized in one specific subject , is also important not to be focused only on it , but you must have a wide mind , becuase you ca n't even know what will happen to you in the future . therefore , you need to be prepared to everything .
