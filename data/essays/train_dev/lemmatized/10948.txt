people have different opinion on whether it is better to specialize in one apecific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . i agree this opinion for two reason . first , elite in only one apecific subject can sucess more easier that peaple who know everything little . second , to specialize in all apecific subject is very difficult . i will explain in detail . to begin with , peaple who know onething deeply can sucess more easier that peaple who know everything little . the genious in one subject have their road th go . in example , i want to talk about my friend . in high school , her total grade is lower than me , but she is always the first in math . in the end , she entered the better university than me because of math . next , to have deep knowledge of many academic subject is very difficult work . so , many people failed all thing because they invest thier talent to too many subject . let me see my experience a a example . when i wa a middle school student , i wanted to do well in various subject . so i went to learn many thing in academy like piano , taegwondo , witch is the korean fighting skill , math and english . however , studing after exercising is more tired that ordinary , . so , i failed the exam in math and english . to mentioned i above , i disagree that to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one apecific subject
