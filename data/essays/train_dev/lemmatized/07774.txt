if you only do what you already know how to do well , you would definitely be good at what you are doing . but to achieve success or victory , you need more than that . it is quite impossible to say that success come without any pain . in order to be successful at one thing , you should accept to take risk . that 's why in my opinion successful people are those who dare to take risk . we can see a lot of example in the history showing that successful people always take risk . for example during second world war , churchill made a very risky plan and ordered to all allied force for a surprise attack . if his plan wa unsuccessful , it would have led to the victory of hitler over the world . but churchill made it and became victorious , that victory also made him one of the most successful stateman of the history . the essential point in his victory wa the courage to take a risk . we can also state that in business , rich and successfull people are always the one who took a lot of risk in their life . the famous deed collector donald trump is a recent example of success . after his bankrupt several year ago , he did not stop working , in contrast he took more risk to build up his empire again . and finally he became very rich again , that wa his success by taking risk . furthermore , taking risk and trying new thing are not only a way to success but also a crucial step for self improvement . people can gain more life experience by taking risk and trying new thing . on the other hand those who choose to do only what they know to do and nothing more , can not go further and be successful . finally , i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk because a they say `` no pain , no gain '' .
