there are a lot of reasens for and against this statement . i am young and i enjoy my live . but i do not think , that i can say this generaly only because i am young . every year i pas through , i enyoj my live more and more . in this very moment , i think that my live will get better and better . i will have child and my own job . but than , i have my own job for a lot of year and perhaps i do not like this job ? the question is , if i will be strong enough to change my life if i am older . now i am young and can change easely my boyfriend , my majer and my city where i live . later i can not do this . of this reason i can come in a conflict with my live and than i can not enjoy my live . perhaps an older one said this sentence . someone who life this conflict and can not do what he or she want to ? my mother told me year ago that her life became better year to year . her greatest experience wa to get child . well , i hope that i do not feel to say this sentence later in my live . and i think , that everyone can enjoy their live if they recognice the wrong thing in their life and than they can change it . perhaps this is a statement of someone who live in war . my grandparent were in the second worl war and they do not tell great thing about the war . than i understand why someone say somthing like that . they had to work hart and help there mother or they are directly in the war . i do not want to think of this hart time . but what will come to u , young people ?
