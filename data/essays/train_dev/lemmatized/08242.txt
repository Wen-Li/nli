i do n't really agree with the statement which say that learning idea and concept is more important than learning fact , because i believe both of them are important skill student need to learn to posse during their learning period , and they both are crucial for those who wish to become a person who can think critically and creatively . first , i believe that learning idea and concept from previous scholar and great thinker is important for student who have n't posse a fixed thinking style yet . since they are still young and changeable , they can learn thing from others ' idea and belief and find out what kind of idea they would prefer more in and try to adopt those idea in their own daily experince . for example , a student can try to examine whether the idea that cooperating with others is always better than working on one 's own is true or not , while he or she us different technique working on a preject . if this student find out that working together is more efficient , he or she might want to try this method again in the future . secondly , i think that there are a lot of different angle we can look at one thing or even an object , which mean that there are a lot of aspect for u to examine a fact when using different idea and concept . when student learn a fact , they can try to use their previosly-learned different idea and concept to look at it . after examining thing from numorous aspect , through different idea and concept , student will start to understand the diversity of every single fact , and eventually , learn to think critically and flexibly . for eample , s tudent might find out that working with others is sometimes more efficient , but there are also a lot of risk he or she might encounter . finally , it is always important for everyone of u to have our own set of idea and concept towards this great universe ; we need to try to come up with our own thinking system and develop our unique way to examine different fact . we learn from others ' idea and concept ; we examine these through our daily experience ; we match them with fact to see if they are correct ; and finally , we will develop our own way of thinking . there are the reason which make me believe that both learning idea and fact
