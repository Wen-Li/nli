i agree with the statment that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . today , mass medium ha a great power on human being . boys want to wear nike shoe because michael jordan wear it on tv and girl want to buy some specific type of dress , for example , levi 's low rise jean because jenifer lopez or brittany spears wear it on tv . if those product , such a nike shoe or levi 's low rise jean , were not on tv or magazine , i do not think they would sell like that much even though they had still same quality . we watch tv almost everyday and the commecial say that we can be a good at basketball a machael jordan if we wear nike . tv tell u that we can be a pretty a brittany spears or jennifer lopez only if we wear levi 's low rise jean . there is korean saying that `` if the food look good , it make taste great . '' it doe not necessarily mean that the look of food make any difference on taste . but people are easily influenced by what we see , and it effect on what we think about the food . i read an article about a cleaning machine when i wa in korea . one small company invented the cleaning machine . it wa a small machine with wheel and it could go around the floor and clean up by itself . after it came out , other big company started to make same kind of cleaning machine . they advertised it on tv and in newspaper . which one would you buy , the small company 's cheap but nice one , or the big company 's more expensive , but ween on tv one ? after the advertisement , the small company could not continue that business because people only bought the big company 's cleaning machine . this is a true story . advertisements can make product seem much better than they really are because we are very easily influenced by what we see .
