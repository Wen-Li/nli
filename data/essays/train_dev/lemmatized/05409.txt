i completely disagree with this statement . i think that the whole world is mainly dependent on the life fact . mr. gandhi had said that if their is fact and truth in your life then you are on the verge to win the world . in a class room when many student are listening a perticular lecture . they mainly concentrate on the lecturer . they listen to the only part which the lecturer is saying . as a part of the study , lecturer provides them only the idea behind the topic . and accordingly the student follow the instruction of the lecturer . at this time student can not understand the topic because they have not any real example to support the topic . they just mug the topic and leave it a a part of assignment and some may think that it is only a part of our syllabus . on the other hand some student go in deep . they analyze the topic . they dont mug the topic . they approach each other or go through the book to understand the concept behind the topic . but in book , it is not compulsary that every book ha mentioned the reality of the topic and from where it come . but some book conceptually explain this very well . various concept are provided for a single thing . now student ha multiple option for a single thing . fourtunately their topic becomes more clear by using this much amount of the concept provided by the book . but when they come in real life these concept are worthless because there can not be a ' idea ' to handle the situation . they do not know the fact about the life and by that they can not survive in this confused world . most of the time , the fact of the life are useful than idea and concept . for doing science and mathematics study idea and concept work but in real life the student should be aware of fact of life . life work on fact and truth not on illusive idea and concept though they are useful in study and in doing business .
