i agree with the statement but in my opinion it also depends on your study and your individual way of learning . for an example if you are studying history it is very important to learn the fact , too . even if you can explain how e.g. kennedy became president of the united states , you should be able to present fact to this topic , too . if you are a math student you would have to learn very hard to pas through exam just by learning fact . you would have to proove theorem in test and learning all of the proof would take a long time . if you are able to understand a proove 's context it is easy to complete the full proove correctly . but in math you have to learn the definition and theorem , too . in a test there is not enough time to reproduce every little `` fact '' fastly . it is indivdual if you like more learning fact or the main concept and idea . there are student which are able to learn fact and remember them very fast and others would have problem and must repeat them again and again . when you just concentrate on the learned fact it will often be hard to get the main concept . a student should learn the fact and think about how the connection are between them . if he understands why he is learning all of them he will be able to remember the fact better . a student will improve more and in his class if he repeat everything he ha learned . to summarize all the ponits , i think that it depents on every student to find the right method to learn . to be good you have to understand the concept and idea but without recalling any fact that is not enough .
