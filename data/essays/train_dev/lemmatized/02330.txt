i support that there will not be fewer car in the future twenty year comparing to these day . the reason that day to day life is changing depending on the cost of living and the easy way to move from one place to another with more safety . since the technology is being advanced in all the feilds , people prefer the different technology car in the up coming day . as we know that there are lot of accident on two wheeler . these car provide the safest way to reach the long distance in shorter time and safe . some country like india , japan , china etc still people prefer the easiest way to reach by walk is using a bike or motor cycle but fastiest way other than bike is car and it safe too . i too say that the day to day life the resource of petrol and diesel have been hiked since the quantity is low , nut in the future the technology brings the different way to use the car without fuel and exiting resource . for example comparing to the company like mercedes , general motor , ford , honda etc. , the researcher are doing they research on different field to develop they company in different way like safe driving , with low feul consumption , sleek design in interior and exterior , the technology used from one car to another in there own product . some research oriented company do there project on automobile that use le fuel , some on without fuel and some on driving without a driver with the help of gps ( global positioning system ) , and in engine too . these research help the company to move it to built new product in market . these technology make the consumer attract in buying a new car and hence increase the rate of use the safest car to move from one place to another , this way the usage of car may lead to increase more car in the future twenty year so i think so in future definitely the usage of car will increase with different technology than compared to these day depending on the way there use them .
