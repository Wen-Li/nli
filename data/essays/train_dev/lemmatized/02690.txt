i agree with the statement . it is more important to understand the idea and concept . learning the fact without understanding the bottom line of it doe n't make sense . it doe n't help people to improve themselves and derive the point from the fact . for example learnin about science , if we do n't know the basic idea behind the fact we never get the connection between the releated fact . besides if we dont teach our student the concept behind the fact we would just developed a banch of encylopedias for future not an efficient and smart generation . they have to know reason , factor , consequence and development about the fact . only knowing the fact doe n't stand for much . there is some before the fact and there is some after the fact . if they know both part , it make sense and draw a picture in their mind . it will fly and never stable in mind without it . also it is really necessary for student to know concept behind the fact to make it easier them to understand easily . think about it . when they are learning gravity , if you dont explain the factor , reason and just tell them the ground pulling u through what they would understand . probably nothing . in conclusion , human always look for reason , result and factor . they want to know why ? so for student it s important to know idea and concept .
