i think having knowledge of many academic subejects is better than specializing in one specific subject . there are two reason and example why i agree with this statement . if you have knowlege of general information , it would be useful in your life . for example , if you work at the office and your bos asks you to write report , your knowledge would help you . because you have different kind of knowledge , you can think from different view . if you only have specific knowledge , you can only focus from one view which would make your report pretty poor . knowing about many different thing would help you at the school a well . for example , because you have broad knowledge of many academic subejects , it would be useful at many situation , such a the examination and the interview . at the examination , surely you would get good grade because you have a lot of different knowledge , even though it doe not specialize in one specific subject . also at the interview , because you have different type of knowledge , you can answer the question widly and you can appeal how you understand general today 's event and your cleverness a well . if you have knowledge which focus on only one subject , it would be useless at many situation . for example , at the school , even if you would get full mark at the math test , perhaps you would fail with other subject because you only have specific knowledge on mathmatics . in my opinion , because having different type and kind of knowledge , it would help you to live much better . because of those reason that i said before , i agree with the statement which is it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject .
