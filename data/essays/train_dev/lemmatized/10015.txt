it is always a controvertial issue over whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to speciallize in one specific subject . in my opinion , i prefer to be a specialist in one academic field during my university life . one main factor is the limited time . in my country , our college eduction last 4 year . during that time , you should not only do your studying but take part in some extra-curriculum activity a well in order to get a good job in the future . therefore , it is impossible for a student with an average intellect to learn all the knowledge of every subject in such a short time . another factor is that the energy of every people is limited . you could n't expect the people to sleep le than 4 hour in order to be a generalist . also , it is a truth the some people only are suitable to some certain subject . if you force them to learn what they are not good at , it 's just a way of wasting their energy . last but not least , the purpose of school to educate the people is to serve the society . that is to say our education should meet the demand of the current society . what is the rightnow situation ? thanks to the developed economy and stable world enviroment , the quantity of the labour force is not the problem . what we want now is the improvement of the quality of the labour force . that mean our society need the people with a strong background of one certain area instead of those who know only a little about everything . admittedly , broad education is very important in today 's education so a to help develope a student properly . but that doe n't to say we should put all our limited time and energy into learning everything . with the structure of the labor force becoming more and more reasonable , i believe those who is a master of a certain area will have a promising future .
