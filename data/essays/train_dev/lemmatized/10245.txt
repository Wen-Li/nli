advertisments have been knowen for a long time . some historian say it began during the roman empaier time . it have been used since then in different regons and culture . however , it is used today for different porposes in different place . the advertisments could be on tv , radio , or prented form . mostly it is posted by company or businuss people to sell thair item or serf . as a result , all advertisments will make the product or serf appear in the best form or stuation . in my openion , almost all advertisments make product much better then they are in reality . these day , company and busnesses compest with each other to sell thair product to more costomers . they use the advertisments a an essentual way to reveal the product for the costomer and try to convence him about thair product . they try so hard to show the best feeatures of the product or the serf that thay have . alternatively , thay know the nagative part of thair product or serf , but they never say these part unless the low ask clearly to do so . for instence , there are advertisments about fitness equepments on tv that apears all day almost on every channel . these ad talk about the product a if it will help you with all your fitness need . in the ad they mention the easyness of using the equepment and how light it is . furthermore , thay say it dose not requaer frome you a hard work and it will save your time . all of thease clames are not true at all . its clear in this ad that thay ara trying to say some thing thet the costomer want to hear . so that he or she will by it based on what they think about the product not about waht the product provide . in canclution , ad these day is not what it should to be . it sould talk about the true good thing in the product and the bad thing so people can determen wather to bey it or not .
