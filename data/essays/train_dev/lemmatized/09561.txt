i believe that the people who try new thing and take risk in order to be succesfull are exposed to good luck and you should call them just `` lucky '' . while successful people really are the one who learn how their knowledege , intelligence and skill can drive them to success . the diference between people who try new thing and take risk from someone who is doing what he know to do well , in order to be succesfull is that the second one will manage their success for the long term , while risky one do n't have the ability and backround to manage their `` suddenly '' succes . i believe and example of this is the founder of microsot . he invented a new operational system for computer called window , back in the 1990s . i do n't think he just created the most important company in the world by triying a new thing and taking the risk to put some money in that business . what i believe is that he really knew exactly how to change the computer world by adding a new firendly user interface to personal computers ( pcs ) , and he anticipated the impact that pcs will have in the life of the human kind . also , microsoft 's founder ha been able to be succesful managing his company for the last 27 year , beyond the most furious market competition from their rival ( apple , ibm and others ) . if someone suddenly change job or follow a new idea , and from being financial advisor , he switch to the pizza business and invest all his saving in this new business , and suddenly he becomes the most famous pizza chef in the world and make a lot of money , i would call this person luccky .
