i agree that the , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , for several resones . first , this is the way of studing . if the student want to be seccessful in their study they must to understand the idea and concept first . for example , if the student ha a giugraphy class and the teacher gave hime or her the information what he or she need . but they are idea , and they agnist the fact . then , the same studen ha an exam in the same class . and he or she faced a qustion about the information , which is the teacher gave him or her . then , he or she wanted to write the answer to that qustion and the answer wa an idea , which is agnist the fact . if the studen wrote the fact , he or she will miss the point , but he or fhe wrote the same onformationn , which is the profassor ha given her or him , he or she will get the point . therefore , this is very important . second , it be helpfull for student on the futuer and incress the knowlge of them . how it is come ? learning the idea and the concept is leading to fact . for example , if the student learn the idea and the concept , then they knew there are fact about the same thing that will encorge them to find the fact . and if they kept in the same way , which is understand the idea and the concept , then they will have really great knowlge and that will help them in the future . therefore , the that will incress the student ' knowlge . in short , it is nice to learn fact too but i still agree that wa why i agree that `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is fot them to learn fact . '' so , idea and concept then fact .
