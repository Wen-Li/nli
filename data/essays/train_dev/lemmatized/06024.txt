it is reported that the number of car ha been increased for past ten year . in some city , person not having car are regarded a to be even strange . however , i strongly agree that in the future le car will be used because of their bad effect on environment and other transportion . to begin with , current used car have many drawback . first of all , the environment ha been polluted by car . the harmful gas from car cause respitory disease . on top of that , the gas result in globla warming . this is why government regulates sale of car . for instance , in many contries , bicycle are encouraged to use for going near place in stead of using car , and in korea , a person who have over three car should pay tax a six time much a a person having only one car . moreover , annually , an uncountable number of serious car accident break out . this prevents many people from using car . in addition , in the future many better transportation way or vehicle will appear . already , airplane and express train are widely used thanks to their fastness . the need of them ha been increasing becasue moder people consider time important . for example , in korea , my countrary . an express traine wa introduced about three year ago . because of it convenience , usually , people choose it for going to busan from seoul . the fee of it is le expensive than the fee of gase for a car . in addition , engineer are inventing new transportation by using the state-of-art technology such a magnetic floating train . it is expected these new transportation wil appear soon , in a nut shell , i strongly believe that fewer car will be used in twenty year . a car is too dangerous to the environment a well a human . we will be able to use more convenient and fast transportation .
