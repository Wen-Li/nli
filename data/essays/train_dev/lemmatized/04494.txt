we live in a time where we are bombarded with advertisement from every corner , we turn on the television and we are showered with tv ad that even exceed the time of the actual program . and it is the same with newspaper or even in the street where those giant flashy banner hanging all over telling u we would feel happier and more complete if we buy and use this and that product . most of the time , advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . unfortunately , we became a consuming society wondering aimlessly , storing all kind of good we do not need to survive . for instance , whenever we feel bored , we drive up to the mall and start filling the shopping cart with meaningless junk that we do not really need , but seeing a celebrity use it in an advertisement give u this urge wanting to imitate him even in some extreme case become him , but the only thing in hand is to consume the same product he us in daily life - style , clothing , perfume , accessory and jeweleries . this however affect each one of u , and specially our child ; this generation that wa raised in front of the television , instead of getting involved in world issue and problem that really matter . personally , i think that we need to be more aware of ourselves and our entourage . we need to open our eye and look at the bigger picture and how this is affecting our planet since all of this product consuming can only result in an increasing amount of garbage and greater pollution . we have to think conscioucly and be feel the repsonsibility to take in our hand the issue of environment . i feel a if there is a certain curse of numbness cast on everyone that we need to break .
