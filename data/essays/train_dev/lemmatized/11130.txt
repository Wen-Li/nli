from my point of view , i totally agreed this statement : young people enjoy life more than older people do . nowadays , a great many phenomenon demonstrated that many youngster are enjoying their golden life time than elder people . i can list them more reasonablely a following . first of all , we should accepte this turth about the limit on human 's energy during their whole life-span . as a matter of factor , young people have more physical energy than elder . an increasing number young people can have extra energy to enjoy their beautiful life with many method . for instance , they can make a wonderful trip or visiting to various place a also go overseas . let take my own experience for example , in this summer , i had a wonderful trip to five different country of europe , including germany , switzerland , france , netherlands , a well a beligum . at same time , i took total sixteen day to visit the berlin wall , lourve museum and also many famous historical site and fantastic landscape . both of them can demonrtrate a young people ha enough energy to enjoy life . the second reason is from financial aspect of a person 's daily life . young have the economic ability can offer their expense on entainment , trip and any kind of ability for their life enjoying . from the statistical data of personal expense all over our country in the first three month of this year , alomst 85 % young people can offer themself on enjoying life while only 15 % in old people . as far a i am concerned , everyone can enjoy their lifetime both young peole and aslo the old people . we both have wonderful lifetime and various kind of ability can related to enjoying our life . but i do believe our young people can make full use of this opportunity to enjoy the fantastic world than old people .
