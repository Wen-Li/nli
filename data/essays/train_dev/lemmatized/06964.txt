i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in my point of view , i think all company doe . i think a lot of people could agree with this statement if they have their own experience of it . actually , the main goal of advertisement are make huge profit by selling the product . to do this , they should make good image on the product , and the product should appear to a lot of people . if it look not good in the advertisement , people will not buy it . so , this skill is very important to sell the product to the consumer . sometimes , people buy something without any information . i think this is because the advertisement already bulit their nice image on people 's mind . i have my own experien to support this . when i wa in my country korea , i saw an advertisement of mini radio from famous company . it looked really cool and useful to me , so i wanted to buy that mini radio . it wa brand new and it wa much smaller than mine . i always wanted to have small radio that i can bring everywhere . i ordered that mini radio after i watched the advertisement on televison , and when i recieved that i wa surprising . it wa not that small . it wa just ` little ' smaller than regular radio , however in the advertisement that i saw , it looked so small such a my little mp3 player . i disappointed a lot and i gave that to my older brother . after that mistake , i never order the peoduct just by advertisement . actually , it wa not ` mini ' radio . however , this could be require for the company because they need to make money . i can understand their view , however sometimes it make people disappoint about the product . in conclusion , most advertisement make their peoduct looking better than they really are . so , when we buy something , we should consider about it before make decision .
