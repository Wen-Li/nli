ofcourse , i agree with the statement that , `` advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' the main point of an advertisement is to attract people into buying the product . to achieve that , the producer of the advertisement program go to any extent to make their product look outstanding . even if the good product are not advertised , they will be on sale but an average or a bad product do need a good advertisement to make itself appeal to the customer . what happens during the february end ? its the time for super bowl ads . these advertisement are worth about 10 million dollar . that 's a lot of money into the ad but if the ad clicked in the `` people 's '' market , the owner of the ad would make lot of money . i wa watching a television channel and there wa an advertisement about a face clearing lotion . i asked my friend if she watched the advertisement . she said that she already bought the product which is worth about 20 dollar . but she wa frustrated at the product because it made her skin look worse . in the advertisement , there were 3 average looking girl who tranformed their skin to an attractive one using this product . it wa nothing like it appeared . few day back , i wa in the mall trying to get some stuff for my soccer practice . i went to the modell 's sporting goods , there wa a packet with baseball card on it . on the cover , there were about 10 card , so i decided to buy it . i went to my house and opened the cover and found only 3 card . i wa very frustrated at this . although , it my fault , i felt it wa n't right . in the above example , it wa evidenced that advertisement make product look better . there wa a saying , `` not to judge a book by it cover . '' in the same way , we product seem much better in their advertisement .
