for a student like me that must choose his future , this question is the question that probably i present to myself every morning that i wake up . from a side , probably have broad knowledge of many academic subject is better because in this way people have much opportunity . the world of work will offer to u a small choose to do . infact , many time people do n't work for the specific subject that they have studied . perhaps , having a large knowledge of many academic subject , can help the man to have and to accumulate experience from several field . i must say that specialize in one specific subject can present easily a great opportunity than have broad knowledge of many academic subject : a beautiful carrier . i think that having a great number of information on a specific subject can help the man to have a great vantage to other people . he can work on the subject with all knowledge and he can discover or develop the material that ha dealt of . a man that ha a broad knowledge of many subject ca n't develop the material without a good experience . he must work many time on the material for having the same preparation of a man that ha specialized . it must explain however that when to a specialized man is presented a material that he ha n't study , he must search some help to a man that have broad knowledge or to a man that ha studied that specific subject . probably in life is often a matter of luck , even if it must be considerate that everything that we 'll do in our life we must use our intelligency . i do n't know what i want to do in my future , i do n't know if i will have broad knowledge in many subject or i specialize in one specific subject but i know that i hold my life in my hand and i want to use every occasion that will present to me .
