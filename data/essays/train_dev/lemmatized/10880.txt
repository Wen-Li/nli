i agree to the above statement . its important for the student to undertand the idea and concept of the subject . understanding idea for any student is little difficult . we need more concentration ability for clear understanding . generally we understand thing when listen it or read about it . completely understang the concept is something that we need to spend lot of time for it . unversities should encourage the student for doing more project in their intrested subjets . this kind of system is avilable in very country such america , uk , australia and so on . as the student doe project on the subject , they go deep into subject detail , such how , where , and why . this are key word in any subject to understand it completely . if they just learn the fact it not usefull for them . most people forget what they learned in their lower class . because learning fact it is something that we usually mugg up . for example electical student a le knowledge than the electician , because the electrican practically work on it . as the student just learns about it . if profersior is explaing about television , he should bring tv to his class rome and explain about it part and it functioning , not just theoritcalys explaing about it . universites should provide a machanism that concentrate on student pratical knowledge about subject . and how he undertands idea and concept on it . one such machanism is providing project for the student . and allowing him to choose the project of his age , so that he can understand it easily .
