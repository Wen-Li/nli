success is often measured by the amount of money one ha or the number of propeties one owns or the number of car one ha . nowdays people have ample oppertunities to prove themselves in varios field of their choice and generally they venture into job which have been tested over a period of time and thereby reducing their chance of failure . according to me successful people are those poeple who willing to take risk and are ever ready to try new thing . according to me risk equal reward and the more risk you take the better will be your reward . when a person try a new venture he doe not know what the outcome would be and therefore he work extremely hard in order to make it function properly . taking the examle of the stock market where the risk factor is extremely high since you know you could easily loose money if the market collapse , and then you look at the return generated through the market which happen to be far more than what you would have earned putting your money in a bank fixed deposit . many people in today world have made career decision not according to norm laid down by earlier society which confined people to choose between becoming a doctor , or businessman , or accountant . etc but today even people such a artisan , computer enigeers , pilot , artist to name a few are doing incredibly well since recent society demand diversity and if you choose a profession which is likely to become a hit with society then you know that your risk or gamble paid off since you will be successful .
