in my opinion , a man should have a specialized knoledge on one specific subject . the reason , both including social aspect and individual aspect , are illustrated below . for the social aspect , today , more and more company require a person to be armed with a spefical knowledge . only by doing this can help company stay competiable because those people is the one contribute a lot to company by using their strong knowledge . for example , if a person who want to go to intel to design cpu chip , then he need a strong knowledge of electronic engineering and help intel stay advaced all the time . there is no reason for a company to hire a person who doe n't have any specific knowledge , because every people ha his specific job in the firm . even more generally speaking , company , a well a our society , need those who have a specific knowledge to make change in this world and let our world become better . on the other hand , from an individual point of view . the more he devotes himeself onto a certain subject , the more knowledge he will get . for instance , he who feel like studying law might have the change to understand his career direction earilier than others . this help him to stand out of crowd and becomes sucessful in future a soon a possible . bill gates is just a vivid example , who love computer science so much that even decided to quit school when he wa only a college student . later , he built up his career a well a this world 's honor : microsoft . by the same priciple , a person who concentrate on a specific subject could gain a deeper understanding on it thus broaden his view on this field , by easily meeting with a variaty of friend . meeting people , attending lecture , or conference becomes a good oppertunity for him to even become better in this field . based on those above point , i think it 's better for a morden person to specialize on a specific subject to give himself a big change to success a well a change our world .
