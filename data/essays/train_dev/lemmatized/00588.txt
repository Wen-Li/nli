the first question that come to my mind after reading that statement is `` did people in the past spend more time helping their community ? '' . to answer that question we should take a short look at the society in earlier time . a hundred year ago the communties where much smaller than these day . 300 year ago there wa no supermarket in small village . people had to work together to survive . the farmer had to grow food , the tailor had to produce clothes . everyone wa interested in getting the best out of what they were doing . therefore they often contributed something to help their community . that ha changed . today a lot of people do n't really care about their neighbor and/or surroundings . for example we have a big house with 6 floor . 20 families are living in this house . the house is very dirty inside , when you step outside you can find dog 's excrement everywhere . neighbors call the police all the time , because they think their neighbor is too noisy . here we can see that even in a small community like the house in my example is not working together . they are not helping eachother and instead try to make life harder for everyone around . the country germany is another example for a community . we have many different province in this country and they usually do n't work together that much . every province try to get the best result for themselves , but instead of doing that through helping other province and contributing something to the community they just try to get the most amount of money they can . so why is it that people nowadays do not spend a lot of time to help their community ? we all know that people have the time . people watch many hour t.v. everyday due to boredom . they could use that time to help the community . the problem is that a lot of people do n't feel responsible for their community anymore . they see that the house is dirty , but they are not willing to do anything about it . either because they think `` i 'm not going to do it , someone else can do it. '' or they think `` if nobody is cleaning it , why should i ? '' . a way to solve this issue could be to encourage people to contribute something for their community and make life better for everyone .
