i do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . the reason for my believing so are several . first of all people have diverse interest and taste . travelling in a group led by a tour guide follows one path for everyone . just a one shirt can not fit all , similarly one tour can not fulfill the need of every tourist . a tour guide take people to major attraction of the destination and some people may like one place more than the other and hence may want to spend more time at the place of their liking . this is not possible when one is travelling in a group led by the guide . secondly there are some place where one would want to travel alone . travelling in a group may compromise one 's privacy so in such situation travelling in a group doe not make sense . i know of some couple who went on their honeymoon to a tourist location in a group . i believe that travelling in group can take away the romance away from such trip . furthermore some people gain more pleasure in travelling alone because of sense of adventure that it provides which travelling in a group with tour guide just can not provide . another disadvantage of travelling in a group led by tour guide is that you dont have control over your itenary or travel plan . if due to some reason one loos the group then one may have to face a very hard time to complete the trip just because that person did not plan the trip but tour guide did . lastly by not travelling in a group led by tour guide you can plan your trip according to your time and your financial condition . you may choose first class air ticket if that is what you prefer or may choose to stay in a cheap hotel if you dont want to spend a lot of money on the trip . you may choose to extend your trip if you like or shorten it if there is an emergency . in sum , based on the reason described above , i disagree with the statement that travel in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .
