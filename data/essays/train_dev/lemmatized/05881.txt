it is often said that one should be good at a special field . however , i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . the main reason are that modern society require student to a lot of special skill and many specific subject are beneficial for student to get a job . to begin with , today 's society demand student for a wider variety of skill such a economics , langages , sport . although student had to give up so many thing llke a he spend time playing with friend , studying many academic subject compensate for his future life . for example , these day are more and more globalized , many student are able to speak a couple of foreign langages such a english , chiness , japanese . in addition , a student with many special research area tend to easily get job that he want to work . for instnace , last year , my cousin entered the samsung , which is one of the world famous company because he had majored several subject while university . his research field are economics , eletronic engeneerings which impress on interview in conclusion , i strongly believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subject are better than speciallizing in one specific sugject becaus current society require student many skill and most firm consider into student 's various subject .
