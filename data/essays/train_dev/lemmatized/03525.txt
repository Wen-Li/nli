i think that young people nowadays are more interested in building their future they have le interest in doing service for their city or for their family . nowadays the world is getting very little , young people can travel around the world faster than the precedent generation , they recive information faster because they can use computer internet , and the television . they are more interested in the fact that happen in other city or also in other country , they don not solve the problem that their comunities have because they think that they are le important than the other just because they are getting addicted and used to them . they hear about the problem of their comunities everyday for that they need to listen to some news , somethig differet , and not the rutine that everyday live . i don not mean that should happen somethig of trerrible in their comunities in order to make them know about the problem of their comunities , but relative , parent and friend , better if older than them , should make them know , first , about of the problem thar are closer to them in order to impruve the future generation 's and their way of living . they should understand that they can not solve the problem of the world like the war or the hungry in africa but they should help first their community . i can not understand the people who leave their country in order to solve problem in an othet , when their country is going bad maybe for stupid thing . in italy is very commun this kind of behaviour : italian people and above all italy its-self have a lot of problem , they think that they are a reach and modern country , infact the italian govern ha muved his army in order to help others , they sacrificated a lot of young people to help other country and not to help theirs .
