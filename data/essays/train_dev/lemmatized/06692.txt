success is another way of expressing an achievment and successful people are known by their achievments . nothing can be cosidered worth a success unless certain risk fator is involved in it . hence i agree that successful people are what they are because they have dared new thing and have taken risk rather than doing thing already known . history of mankind is studded with unimaginable achievments to justify this aspect . the most daring and risky act , according to me , is discovery of america . though the purpose wa different , i.e. finding a new sea route to india , columbus dared to dream of embariking on a journey which wa considered impossible . his success is not discovering america but to have dared to go on a journey to the unknown world through neverending ocean . had he tried to follow same route to india , probably he would have become another rich business man but no the columbus we admire . sometimes the risk taken by a successful person speaks more than his achievement . in a survey conducted by a business school of arizona in the late 90 's it wa observed that out of every ten businessmen eight had adopted newer method and undertook risky task to reach the their position . many successful people belive that there is not much use `` inventing the wheel again '' when you have so much to do in the area which are not yet ventured into . i consider that when we do something it should involve some novality in it . because without any novality , what ever we do , it will not have life . and one should always be prepared to take risk because a it is said `` when going get tough the tough get going '' . and it is the tough which succeeds .
