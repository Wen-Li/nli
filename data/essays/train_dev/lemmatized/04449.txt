i strongly agree with this statement . it is more important to understand idea and concept than to just know certain fact by heart . first of all , i think that it is more challenging to come to understand a certain idea or concept , e.g. a philosophical problem . one first of all ha to understand the problem and why it occurs . based on this , one can then try to follow the philosopher 's effort and argumentation how to solve this problem ( or why it can not be solved ) . this coming to understand a certain logical stream of thought is a process of learning in itself and stand in contrast to `` simply '' memorizing fact , like the name of the problem and the name of the philosopher . i put the word `` simply '' in quotation mark since i do not want to dimiss the knowing of fact completely . i just think that a knowledge of fact should accompany the understanding of a concept ; only fact do not suffice . having fully understood an idea also help when it come to explaining thing to other people , such a friend , classmate , or , in case one want to become a teacher , student . when one ha fully understood an idea , it is easier to explain the respective concept to others . only relating mere fact would not help others to throughly understand an idea . furthermore , a fact , like a date or a year , can , when in doubt , always be looked up in an encyclopedia . this doe not hold for concept . furthermore , concept and idea can , and often need , to be criticized and/or challenged . to be able to question a concept , one ha to know and have understood what one is criticizing , to also justify one 's critique . facts can , of course , not be challenged . in general it can be said that fact are not unimportant , but the knowledge and understanding of a concept or an idea is definitely more vital in regard to the process of learning and the usage and applying of knowledge in everyday life .
