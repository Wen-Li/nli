in today 's society it is nearly impossible to hide from any kind of advertisement . not only tv and radio are full of advertisement , but also the underground tube , the newspaper , the wall of building and almost every internet side . this make people buy thing that do not need . if they see this wounderful and extraordinary new cheese on the colourful magazine page they can not resist . but is the cheese a good a they think ? normally not . most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . that is why it ha become a rentable buisiness . there are not a lot of good product on the market , but everyone want to sell his product equally if it is good or bad . so if you produce a cheese and it is the same cheese a everybody know it over year , but the people do not buy it anymore , then you need a new advertisement . most of the product are either new , nor good . what sell them is the idea of the advertisment . another point is the customer behavior and his shopping habit . in a regularly supermarket the customer may choose between several product . if he want to buy bread he ha almost twenty bread in front of him . now there are two kind of customer . first the one who relate on what they knew - they will always buy the same bread . second the people who have no idea of what to take . they will have a closer look on the different product and in the end choose the bread with le fat or whatever attracted them . in this case advertising help to take decision . but is the bread better , because it is said so ? nobody know . to come to a conclusion it can be said that maybe a really good product need no advertisement and that is how you can find it . but in the modern society it will be difficult to sell something without any advertisement at all . the people are used to it and maybe they even want to belive in what it is said on the colourful magazine page .
