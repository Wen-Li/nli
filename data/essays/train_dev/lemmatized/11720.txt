introduction : advertisements make product seem much better than they really are . i believe that advertisement make product much better . advertisements play a vital role in developing business . it is a part of business . now a day if we start watching tv we will watch more advertisement than what we are watching . it show the the product much better than the reality then the consumer will get tempted they will buy immediatly . advertisements are every ware . suppose one company want to sell babby product like toy , food , cloth they release the product by advertising . that advertisement show that how much the product is usefull ? what are the result of the product . obviously they will shoe good result . they will target on the consumer need . the product will sold . it often happens every eare not only the babby product . now a day people want do buy new product they will go and watch advertisement for few day than only they will buy . it show the popularity of the product . if the advertisement come very often on one project people think that is good one . for example resturants want to reduce prize to gain the popularity they go and give advertisement on tv like they will show good picture of food or they will create a little documentry . people get tempted and go to the resturants . media us advertisement often to gain their popularity on thier tv channals . sopeople watch their channals . some time advertisement is very usefull like we can give advertisement on tv if any one is missingit is usefull in finding the product popularity also . now adays every one is using advertisement not in selling product or ganing popularityof channals . we often seen in election also political party use advertisement to gain popularity of their party . these are the reason i strongly agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
