i agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for the following reaons . first , i believe that the government of many country in the world are recently beginning to restrict the use of car because of their several serious problem . for example , car emit carbon monoxide when they burn gasoline , which is poisonous to people , animal and plant . in addition , car also emit caron dioxide which is responsible for the greenhouse effect . second , the government also restrict the use of vehicle due to fear to depletion of natural resource , especially petroleum . that valuable natural resource is necessary for vehicle to move -- i.e. , to burn gasoline . in addition , it is necessary to manufacture vehicle . for example , the process of manufacturing car need high temperature which is given by petroleum . moreover , car use plastic a part thereof , and needle to say , plastic are produced from petroleum . in addition , according to medias and recent official report by united nations , the government of many country in the world are not only beginning to restrict the use of car , but also trying to find alternative transportaions which do not have problem which car have . for example , in my nation , japan , the govenment ha been investing in the research for commercializing of the `` linear motor car '' . it move by energy of magnetts , so that doe not emit any poisonous gas . experts estimate that the linear motor car will be used more popurarly in 15 year . therefore , i agree the opinion that in twenty year there will be fewer car in used than there are today for there reason .
