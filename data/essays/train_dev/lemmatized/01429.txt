a lot of people think that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i personally believe that peole whoo only do what what they alresdy know how to do well are more successful than those who belong to the other category . i have many reason in support of this opinion of mine . first and foremost , i feel that by doing what one is already good at one ha a good grip over the subject to be dealt with . this provides the person to think probe more deeply into his or her subject of specialization . thus success can be obtained quickly . for instance , a friend of mine who graduated in financial engineering tookup a job a an analyst which involves his branch of study . he tasted success within no time . his salary doubled within a short period of six month . in two year he grew to the position of a senior analyst . a nother friend of his tookup a job totally different from his subject of study and ended up earning not even close to half of my friend 's salary . thus this kind of success come faster and is more long lasting . the risk involved is literally nothing . it is any day a safer bet . aditionally , taking risk and doing new thing may give nore scope for creativity . but , the amount of time and work it consumes is is too much . the result are not seen immediately . a person who follows this path requires to have oodles of patience . it is impossible to judge if the new thing will click or not . in most case the risk factor is high and the person ha no idea of what he is doing . based on the above discussion , i feel that successful people are those who do what they are already good at rather than those who try new thing and take risk .
