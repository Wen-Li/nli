it often happens in school and college that student do not understand some topic and so cram it up and often forget it during the exam time . i believe it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . ofcourse it is sometimes much easier to just learn pre-stated idea or established fact then to do reseach on a topic . take for example , einstein 's equation of mass and enegy relation : e = m ( c ) 2 . we might just want to learn it a it is in school , rather than try to prove it like einstien did , because we neither have the time nor the intelligence to prove it at that level . however lack of time or `` einstein 's brain '' is no excuse to just learn every fact a it is . it is easier to remember information if we try to understand the concept involved in that particular phenomenon . for example , teaching a 5th grade student that `` sun rise in the east '' is okay , but the student should also understand that it rise in the east because earth rotates from west to east in an anti-clockwise manner . when a person try to understand the idea and concept , he question common belief and try to find answer to question that pop into his mind thus strengthening his inquisitiveness and improving his knowledge . understanding a topic , make it more interesting and make learning easier . it also make recalling an idea during exam easier . other than just improving one 's own knowledge , while trying to understand idea by questioning the common belief , one might even make new discovery . it might make a person curious about a topic or a phenomenon . besides , craming make studying boring and monotonous . it reduces our concentration level and thus reduces our efficiency . thus it is always better to understand idea and concept than just learn fact .
