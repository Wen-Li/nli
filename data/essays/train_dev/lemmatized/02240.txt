travelling is one of the most effective way a family or an individual could spend quality time , relax or have fun . therefore it is essential that tourist have their vacation orgainised so that they can have the largest amount of fun possible . to have a perfectly a orgainised vacation , people should travel in a group led by a tour guide . there are many benefit to travelling with a tour guide . firstly , the tour guide is a trained professional in tourism . he would know which are the best attraction to visit , and what would be an appropriate length of time to spend at each one . he would be able to plan how to spend the whole day effeciently , unlike if a person wa alone and ha to spend hour deciding where to go next . secondly , the tour guide would have ticket ready prior to the visit , and this would enable the group to go straight to the attraction without wasting time . for example , to go up the eiffel tower in paris , france , it would , on average , take a person 2 hour to get a ticket in the high season . however a tour guide would get you the ticket well before you arrive there , and then you would n't have to waist a lot of time waiting in line . thirdly the tour guide would arrange all the transport in advance , and for example would make arrangment with bus company to have bus present at the correct time , and tell them exactly where to go . if , on the other hand , a person is travelling alone , he would waste a lot of time trying to get from place to place . there is also a social benefit to traveling with a group , a it would be likely that your group consists of people mainly from your home country , and therefore you would be to socialise with them and discus the attraction you visit , along with the fact that you make new friend . however , some people may argue that having a tour guide deprives them from making their own decision , and their personal choises . also , it would not allow them to do thing that they have always wanted to do , if they visted a certain country , but this can always be easily solved by extending the vacation a day or two , or if that is not possible , missing the certain guided tour they are not particularly interested in . all in all , i strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . it 's advantage significantly overwiegh it disadvantage , and i beleive that most people would have more fun if they travelled in group led by a guide .
