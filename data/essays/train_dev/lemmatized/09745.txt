today , there is a competition in every area and the one who is succesful is gaining it . succes come from different way . someone get it by trying new thing and taking risk and someone do the thing that are experinced before . i thing the curiosity is sometimes good . when you try the new thigs that noone did , you may invent someting . for example , i am a biology student and i want to do some project about genetics . in this area there is a pcr machine which incereas the number of the gen . if i work on the prensibe of how machine is working , i will never find new thing . because it is allready known . however i want to study about the real-time pcr which is not obviously known . by this way , i am choosing the risky way rather than doing common thing . i might study too much but noone can say that i will not invent a new thing . if i manage it , i woul make a big succes . so it is sometimes required to take a risk for being succesful . because it is not real succes to get the others experinced .
