i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people to . while i would concede that older people are more likely to be struggling with health problem or to have experienced hardship over the course of their life , these factor are not exclusive to older people . moreover , one can enjoy life inspite of such negative experience . given the right circumstance , hardship paradoxically might increase your ability to enjoy life . if you have a positive attitude , misfortune can teach you - at any age - to value the good thing and the happy moment , to count your blessing . if , on the contrary , you have a pessimistic outlook on life and always find something to complain about , you will experience le joy in life , regardless of your age . in addition to age , other outside factor , in my opinion , also play a much smaller role than is commonly assumed . at first glance , enjoying life would seem to come easy to people that are in good health , independently wealthy and feeling loved by a significant other or a close set of friend . but on second thought , when we try to remember the time we have felt happy and enjoyed life most , what come to mind are usually little precious ( and fleeting ) moment in time that had little to do with money , for instance . none of these positive outside factor hurt , of course . nevertheless , i am sure we have all seen friend with chronic illness and empty bank account having a blast , while others have a tough time finding joy in seemingly rich and full life . all in all , i disagree with the statement because enjoying life doe not depend on age or other external factor a much a on one 's personality and attitude . a little lucky star , of course , doe not hurt .
