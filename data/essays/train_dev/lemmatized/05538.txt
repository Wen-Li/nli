there are two type of advertisement according to the chronological order . one is post-modern advertisement and the other is modern advertisement . the start of advertisement wa with modern advertisement which concentrated on utility of product . later on , after the cold war period , post-modern advertisement concentrating on the image or impression of advertisement began flourishing and it ha been mainstream of advertising technology untill present . now , here come the problem . post-modern advertisement tie mainly with appealing method of impression and to appeal others , it need such accentuation of positive portion and slipping out negative aspect or to cover the weakness of product competitiveness in utility , they will have to concentrate on overwhelming person with the other good aspect of product such a design . this , can be said that advertisement nowadays make their product seem better . it might be limited example for my country but a it is fair example , i 'll discus it . in my country , insurance company put tremendous asset to visual advertisement . they put some word like `` no additional money to pay for 2 month '' in big letter while they put some negative but crucial information in letter that ca n't even be seen without glass . people see the condition only written in the big letter which seems pretty charming to u , people . however , they realize that they were faked when they actually borrowed loan from that company . there is other method in making a product seems better than it is . it is not telling about utility or any other practical value but depicting beauty merely . this is especially severe in visual advertisement . impressing image overwhelms person that the person forget the real use of product is actually limited and sometimes , advertisement us person 's mind tending to follow celebrity and hire celebrity in making advertisement . person , just mimic celebrity then . surprising psychological method inherents in post-modern advertisement tempting persom to purchase product . by minimizing shortcoming and accentuating merit or by visually overwhelming person without any utilarian usefulness , advertisement show product better than it is actually and people often dull , get faked by advertisement . definitely , we 'll have to be aware of this that we do n't get faked . due to the reason above , i think that most advertisement make product seems much better than their reality , succesfully .
