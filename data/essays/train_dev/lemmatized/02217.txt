i agree with this statment `` it is better to have board knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . '' people should try to have board khowledge of many academic knowledge , it better for them they get to know lot of thing and have lot of thing to disscus and talk with people about and try to educate them by the thing they know about . people can read book to increase their academic knowledge or use the internet . there are lot of different way they can go to lectiers and learn thing that help them . my brother is a pilote i can talk with him all day long and not get board of him he ha lot of information and thing that interste me and help me with my life . i go to him when i need his help in my homework he know every thing because he love reading and surfing in the net . he allways tell me about his experiance . he talk to me about his mistake that he had done when he wa in my age . i am really prode that i have a brother with lot of board knowledge of many acdamic subject . people with academic knowlege have lot of thing that they can talk about or teach people with their academic knewledge . these people are useful to our community . people with specialized subject they are boaring they will talk about one thing they just talk about the thing they are familiar with . you can not disscuss thing that interest you . you will be inforced to listen to them every time you try to talk with them . people who are specialized in one specific subject they have to be come teacher and teach the people who are intersted in their subject .
