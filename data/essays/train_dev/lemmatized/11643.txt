i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take rist rather than only doing thing they already know how to do well . but is it only possible to do new thing and take risk when you have enough money ? normal thing like go to the cinema or make a travel in the own land is to boring for these people . maybe they have also made these thing and now they want to see some others . i also think that these people do these crazy thing because they are affraid of loosing there money or do not be rich for a long time . so in these short time they want to see a much a they can and take the chance . normally rich people are in a rich society . these people do not want to speak about a film you saw last week in the cinema . they want to hear about your last adventure trip in thailand or something like that . some thing you can only make when you have enogh money . and i think that anybody want to make so special thing but have no money for that . so it would be only a dream . but i also think that it is better to have some dream and go working for it , a you have the money and can not join the special thing . for rich people many thing are normal , to normal . they think driving a big car and make an adventure trip every half year is a normal a eating and drinking . when people have to much money , so much money that they do not know what to do with it , they often do not get enough from all and that is why they take risk to be happy . i think people who have to much money should give it to an organization who give it to poor people for which is it not normal to eat or drink .
