the argument at hand is whether we should travel in a group led by a tour guide . i disagree with this statement . in my opinion , travelling on one 's own is a better choice instead . i can conveniently plan my schedule , use my budget more efficiently , and most importantly , learn about the history of the country that i visit . firstly , travelling alone mean that i can have a flexible travel plan . i can book my own air ticket , reserve my own hotel room , and decide when to visit place . but when i am on my own , i do not have to worry about the need of the others . i can choose my time to buy a cheaper air ticket , and rent hotel that appeal to me most . i also do not have to visit place that i am not interested in . secondly , i can use my budget more efficiently . if i am to be led by a tour guide , i will have to pay . the fee is usually very expensive and will account for a large part of my travel expense . and since the quality of the service provided by the tour guide is unreliable , i think it is a better idea to spend the money on the travel itself , instead of hiring a tour guide . with more money , i can go to more scenic spot and attraction . i can also afford to buy more souvenir , and taste expensive cuisine . thirdly , i can fully explore the history of the country that i visit when i travel alone . tour guide only give superficial information about place , and they seldom tell u about the history . all they care about catching the coach bus on time , and hurrying place after place . when i travel alone , i can talk to the local people , and ask them about the local history . this way , i can have a closer look on the historical background of the region , and learn more about it culture . to conclude , i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i prefer travelling alone . i can plan my own schedule , utilise my budget more efficiently , and learn about the history of the country that i visit .
