many company spend a lot of money for their advertisement . because advertisement are closest u who buy many kind of product . but i think advertisement are sometime too much and too attract for u . because they ca n't give real visual and texture for u . i agree with the following statement . fist of all , we can see a nice product advertisement , but it 's not real , and real color . in my experience , i got a wrong color dress which i did n't expected after i ordered a brillilante dress on the internet . i wa sure the dress color , because i cheked it many time . but i got not my favare . i wa so shocked . but it wa my fail . because they said sometime color is different your expect on the screen ! second , when i saw a tv shopping , they sell a confortable sofe . on the tv , a couple were sitting comfortable , and reding book . it wa a my drem sofe . and i bought it and i cried . because the sofe wa uncomfortable and unfit for me . in my opinion , we shold n't belive any advertisement . many company spend a lot of money and attract u a lot . but we ca n't see real and touch , smell , and feel . we should buy a product after you know really one .
