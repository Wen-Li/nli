i dont think all of the young people nowadays are helping their community but i believe some of them do helping . sometimes this kind of topic appears in the news or the newspaper . adults think young people dont help and playing around but i dont think it is true . now in the world , many people are working for theirselves , for family , and for the world but adult say they are not helping but is this true ? i dont think so . there are a hundred of the young people working for the community . but why adult say that ? maybe because they have not seen it . how can they show the adult that they are doing for their community ? do they have to come in front of them and show what they have done ? no . young people nowdays are working and helping their community in their original style . forexample the club dj . from the adult point of view , they can only see is the young people playing arount untill the morning . but they are working hard in their own style and helping their community . if you look around really carefully , then you can see young people nowadays are giving their time to helping their community in their original style .
