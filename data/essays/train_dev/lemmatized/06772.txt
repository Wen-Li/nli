learning process can not be separeted from understanding . that 's why , we can never compare understanding and comprehending process with learning a they are already the part of the learning itself . as an english teacher , having dealt with teaching and learning process for year in the univercity , i can never think of an individual to divide these process which are closely related , even tied strongly to each other . ( comprehending and learning ) i think , hereby , the description of the ` learning fact ' gain importance . undoubtly , learning fact have vital importance for the student in practical mean . but a reality ha to be taken into consideration , even a ` learning fact ' process is a part of understanding the idea and comprehending concept . imagine that a teacher is trying to teach the student the vaporation characteristic of the liquid . it is an undeniable reality that you may make the student vapour a liquid . the teacher make him/her perform the vaporation action several time , again and again and the student may perform the action very well but if the student doe n't grasp why she/he is doing that , what is the importance of it or if he'she can not make the necessary connection logically and can not generalize the situation to an anvironmental reality ' then what is the meaning of it ?? learning fact also have close and strong relation with the understanding and comprehending process ! you may teach fact to animal also , by repetition , they even learn to sing or imitate people 's feature which do not belong to their nature . an animal may learn a fact , but never can understand idea because it ha no thinking ability . on the other hand , if this repetition doe n't become continually , they forget . . but people have logic , ability to think which is the main characteristic differing them from animal ! you may teach everything to the student only making them understand , grasp or comprehend . that 's why ' it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn effect .
