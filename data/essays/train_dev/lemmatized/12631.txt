i do n't think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today by three reason . cars are expanded too much to cut off from our life . as many people know , car are very convinient and usefull machine . in japan you can get a driver lisence for no reason except if your are older than 18 . many people ha a dream to drive a car especially if you are a male . so it is impossible to say that you can not use a car for daily life . in a several year , i think car wo n't use a gasoline than now . it is true that car are not good for environment . but many car company are triing to make a new type of a car . for example , hybride car . in the future , there may be a car that move only by a electricity and not by gasoline . this can prevent a green-house effect . so there will be any reason for not useing a car . if you do n't use a car for transport , there should be a alternative transportation . not useing a car mean you have to use a different transportation to go somewhere . in japan train are very common , but it is not so common to use a train in other country a in japan . for instante , america . these are my opnion for the statement .
