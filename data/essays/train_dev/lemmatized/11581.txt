sometimes the man need to know at least a little of everything what happen in his life . for instance , if you go to the mountain and someone hurt himself you should know how to act in this case , i mean , what kind of medicine or method is the most indicated to help him . but , in the other hand , if you are a doctor you should take a specialization in an specific part of the human body to help people who need , for example , traumatological procedure . actually , if everyone will know a little about everything sometimes it will not be great or helpful . how we will do with a child with cancer if doe not exist anyone who be able to operate him ? or , in other case , if you will know just how to make a good cake , do you think you have future in the kitchen ? i do not think so , you should know at least few thing about how to cook fish , meal , etc . since your chilhood you are learning what the world and the circunstances put in front of you . all the people is abble to affor a variety of situation wich are present in our life . even so , when you get into college your study must be directed to make an specific labor . the one you think you have the best development . i am going to study computer science next year , these are general study about the computer , but i do not want to stay just with this study , therefore , i will be deligthed to learn about network and designe through computer software . in short , for all these reason , i am not abble to say if i am in agreement or not with the statement . learn all the subject you want but do not forge to centralize your interest in something you think is the most important , interesting and comfortable for you .
