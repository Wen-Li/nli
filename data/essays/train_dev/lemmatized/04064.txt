nowaday , bill gates is the first wealth on the hearth . he ha constructed it on a very famous firm , microsoft . this latter month a new product ha been launched , windows vista which is a new software which enable every people to work more efficenctly with their computer . what is that product ? only a old software which ha been improved . this lead to my point of view . according to me , successful people are those who develope product based on their previous experience and knowledge . if we spend so much time at the university is to gather and increase our knowledge to pretend to a good job . at the time being it is almost impossible to succeed in the unknown . every people who ha succeeded started with a familliar topic . how can we be good in something we do not know at all . a business to be launched need strong basis or it is deemed to fail . once it is properous then we can decided that something new could be done . when a manager point out that the bound are reached and that the business is not growing anymore , at that time he can decided to find a new strategy or a new product . new investment must be the only way for a firm to survive the growing competition . but it is not necessary to change completely the product the firm is selling . pizza hut for example , to revive the business , invented the cheezy crust pasta . the product is still a pizza but that pizza is improved to `` grab '' new consumer , increase the profit and be better than other competitor . so , successful people ha develope a thing they were knowing very well , improved it and then renew that thing when the time ha come to find new found by extended the market . the subject is innovation . many people who tried to succeed in something they do not know at all were a lot to fail . that is what we witnessed in france at the begining of 2000 . a lot of new firm were started on the internet thing but many of them were completely ignorant of that totally new thing and the result wa appaling , more than 80 percent of those firm closed during the first year .
