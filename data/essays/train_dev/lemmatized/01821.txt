although it 's essential to have a car these day , it seems to be hader and harder to afford and cause many enconveniance to those who own a car . it 's not only because the money but also for enconvineance that people encounter so i think that in twenty there will be le car in use then today . firstly , oli price ha gone up so high in past few year and it became big problem not only for the driver but also to the economy . i remember when i first started driving in 5 year ago . it wa n't cheap but it wa still ok for the convinence that i got from driving car but when i go to the gas station to fill the tank now , it cost almost double than what it used to be . because of it i try to use public transportation when i go to school instead of driving . secondly , nowadays one family owns more than one car so there are so many car and there are n't enough space for parking . especially korea , which is very small with high papularity , it is a huse problem now . when people get back from work at night they have to have another `` war '' to find a spot to park . it is very annoying because you are already near home but ar n't able to go home because you ca n't find a parking apot . to conclude , having car is not a good a what it used to be , people will decide not to have a car or have le car in the future . i think that to solve that the problem above people will buy more bycicles or motor-bike in the future . it cost le money and more convineant than having a car . when people start buying them instead of buyinh car , the number of car will gradually decrease .
