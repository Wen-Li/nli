as the need for a better life is growing in developped country , there is more and more commercial business offering different product . some of them will make the same product . those company , not to lose money will , therefore be at `` war '' adainst each other . they will need to advertise for their product . to do so they will show u that , first we need this type of product , and second that the one they are offering is better than the one from another company . how do we know if the product of a company `` a '' is better than the one from company `` b '' , or if the product is a good a it seemed to be ? everyone had once asked the question . we have to understand that the company have to sell their product whatever might happened , and they have to produce it with the le cost possible . so we may ask ourselves if the product we are buying are a good a the advertisement want u to believe it is . it 's quite a tough question if we are looking at it closely , there is some company who will show u the product a it really is and some other who wo n't . how can we make the difference ? i guess it 's up to u . we have to remember that they are here to sell whatever product it is and therefore ha to make it look good . you wo n't buy a product if we are telling you the whole truth , the whole thruth being that there is side effect on this new diet pill or that this cheap tv will only work 45 minute a day . for me company have to sell whatever product they are making , and in order to do that they have to present those product on their brightside and telling u only the good part of the story . some will emphasize the good part and let the customer wondering if this wonderfull product really exists and some other will show u the product a it really is . we can ask ourselves how we will be acting if it wa u to sell something to another person , either we will be eager to sell it without mentionning couple of problem we had with it , the car we are selling will breakdown at the next corner , or we will be telling the truth saying that the car we are selling will break down but this car is worth the repair to be done . either way , we are not telling the same thing , but we are selling the same thing . i will then say that advertising make the product seem much better than they really are , but it 's for one purpose to sell and you wo n't sell something that it 's not good enough for your customer . adverstisment is to me like a painter painting a portrait , it will make the product seem better than it really is , the same way a painter will paint the face of someone seem prettier than it really is . we just have to know how much we want to beleive the magnification of the truth .
