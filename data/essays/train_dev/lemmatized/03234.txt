there are many people understand idea and concept but they do n't know what they are . the student have to do what they are from doing to learn fact is better than to understand idea and concept for student . here are some reason to support my idea . first of all , there is a soccer ball . everyone know what to do with the ball . if there is two people that person awho ha naver played soccer ; however know the soccer ball very well , and person b ha experience to play soccer but , he doe n't really know about the ball . person b know about a soccer ball because he ha learned fact to play . person a know about the ball ; however , he doe n't know how to play because he only ha idea . second of all , there is a blind , and he understand to play soccer . however , he ha never seen it and played . the blind ha idea ; however , the idea is not worth because he ha naver done . to do what he think will make the blind to learn playing soccer . third of all , there are student in the classroom and a professor is giving a lecture . the professor make student understand idea and concept ; however , the student do n't know what they are because of no experience from the idea . finally , there is a korean adverb which is `` to do once is better than to listen to idea . '' according to the adverb , even if a person had idea , there would be nothing before doing thing . therefore , he will learn what the idea are . in conclusion , i believe that to learn fact is better than to understand idea and concept . i 'm writing an essey with learning fact . if i only understood the idea of writing , i would never write anything .
