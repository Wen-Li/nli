i agree with the title statement . youung people enjoy life more than older people . i can demonsteat form three aspect of it . first , young peole ha more activity to do . young people can go to travel to any where in any condition or do all kind of sport even they are not good at them , but he older people because of some kind of sick . they could not take some traffic like the ship . there are also some sport because of the age problem , they could not enjoy it . and we often see some instruction on playground . some really good game are have age restricted . second , young people 's mind are operer than the old one . they are easier to accpet and learn new thing . for instance , the internet . young people can use email or some on linetool to communicat to each other like msn or skype , but the older people could not . for example , my mother can just simple look through the internet . it is not that easy to send email or chat on the inernet , that is because the speed of typing for is very slow . for my grandmother it is a problem even she want to sufer on the internet . computer game have so much fun , but they could not enjoy them . so young people enjoy life more than the older people do . at last , young people ha good boy to enjoy life . the older people often trapped by the heath problem . when they become older . they often get some serious illness . sometimes to move is a problem for them . they can just lay on the bed . but the young people can go to club or just enjoying to run in the rain or fight to each in the snow . from what we talked above , we can draw the conclusion : young people enjoy life more that the older do . that is because they have have good body . they have operer mind to accept and learn new thing .
