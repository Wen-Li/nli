from my point of view is this statement not to support . there some significant reason to reduce the use of car , for instance the environmental cost through pollution , the expense in general for the car owner like for fuel etc . but i strongly believe , that even if the natural resource are running out and the price of fuel will continue to rise , and even if we pollute the air and do not do ourselves a favour , i believe that the mankind will not use the car le , a long there are any car available . and this opinion ha many reason . the people today do often not care about the world tommorrow , they just live in the presence , in the time of comfort and waste . people want to be independend , they do not want to wait somewhere at the busstation , being ruled by a scheduled arrival and departure . using the car is often the most comfortable and fastest way to get somewhere , especially to a workplace . often it save time taking the car than for example the train . nowadays we are too individualistic , we also want to have our own private space , and often prefere to drive somewhere just on ourselves quiet and relaxed , than having chatting people around u that could disturbe our peaceful moment in the car . having and using a car ha also many practical reason . if you go somewhere for shopping for example , your car is able to store a lot , you do not have to carry heavy bag around . especially for a family do have car an enormous importance . it is more pleasant for a mother having your child close by you in your car , than using with them the public option , that only would cause stress and bring you child in a danger . but i believe that if our economic system will continue like that , having a car will become much more luxurious . but i am convinced that people rather would increase their depth and getting a loan to afford having a car than missing this out . the human being in the industrial world are just too lazy and comfortable for being more sensible and thinking of others or considering the environment .
