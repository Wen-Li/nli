we are facing thousand of advertisement in our life . they are easy to say `` nothing is better than this '' . however are they all true ? i do n't think so . they do ` over-advertising ' the product than the real ability of it . first , i declare most advertisement make good seem much better than they are because of my experience . last year , i had really long black hair but my hair condition wa not good so that i decided to make my hair healthier . at that time , a ran into some advertisment with a very attracitive woman and her hair looked like silk . what i felt that time wa , if i use that product i would have facinating hair like that woman 's ! i used it for a long time but i could n't have had a silky hair like that woman . first i wa depressed , but than i began to think , that 's what advertiser do . ` over-advertising ' . moreover , in my opinion there is resonable reason that the company ha to over-advertising . from my experience that i mentioned above , i wa wandering why they are doing it ? why could n't be just honest so that no one would expect which would be never happend . then , i got the idea . there 's hundred of different shampoo in the market . to take attention from people , they have to be attractve to survive from the compete with others . in short
