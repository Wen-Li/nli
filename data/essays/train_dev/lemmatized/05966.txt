some people say that nowdays young people do not have enaugh time to help their community , that because of the rithm of our life we , i am 19 year old , do not have time to help poor people , to talk or to be with old people who feel alone , to make thing to help to reach the peace in some countryes or even in some family . .. it is true that our life have a very high rithm and that we do not have a lot of time to help our community , but that doe not mean that we do not want to do it . some yeras ago young people did not do lot of thngs for their community , but the implication of the new generation in the project of help ha increased a lot during the last year . we can see that there are more npo 's , no profit organization , and whose member or the people that calaborate with them do it totally free , with no maney retribution . the objective that these npo 's try to reach are really different . there are those who help poor people that do not have nothing to eat or those who help dependient drug people . there are also some corporation that help to preserve the environement , like greenpeace , and those who help in general kid , like unicef . others try to help woman and others try to figth against the illegal prostitution . there are lot of organization that try to help our communitie and that are gowing in the number of activist to sum up , i will like to say that more an more young people are helping other people , even if we do not have all the time we would like to have to do this activitie . but young people are trying to find free time and spend it helping others , what make u more human .
