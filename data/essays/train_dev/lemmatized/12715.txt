people usualy say `` no risk no gain '' . i adhere to this principle . in order to get unconventional success one ha to aquire unconventional mean rather than sticking to conventional way and just manage to do well . so the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , is true . our history give the evidence that how courageous and enterprising people excelled . in primitive day when sailing wa difficult and dangerous , people with pluck set out to sail and ventured new land and accumulated wealth . these people are still refered to a successful people . did primitive people stick to convention and would have been complacent with their simple life , our world would have had a different face today . in an entirely different scenarioi would like to bring in an example of a motorbike company . this motorbike company had a monopoly in the sector of two stroke bike . i remember every youth those day wa interested in buying this perticular bike . suddenly one compititor of this motor bikelaunched into the market a four stroke bike with a better mileage . this new bike in the market wa the hot cake now and the company that had the monopoly earlier strted losing ground in the market . though this is an example of a manufacturing company but the moral of the story can very well be used for people also . the reason why the successful motorbike manufaturing company lost it 's market wa that the company wa complacent with it 's performance and it never felt the need to innovate or take new risk in the field . so in nutshell it can be said that being enterprising and taking risk are one of the greates attribute of a successful person . and by breaking the convention successful people acheive unconventional result .
