i do not agree in total with the statement mentioned because there are two side of the coin associted with issue . let u discus those issue in agreement with the topic . the world ha been transformed in to a global village . life seems to getting busier and busier everyday with the youth playing a pivotal role in any organisation thay work . . people especially , the younger one are occupied with their job and other trivial commitment associated with the job . it is clear that they donate a chunk of their time to their job working for the success in their career fantasing a real comfortable life . . with the development of science and technology ( which indeed reflects in medium ) , the social responsibilty towards the community is lacking . people no longer feel it is their duty to have a clean community . let u begin at the elementary level . keeping a street in a good condition is seen a a duty of the government organistions and all the blame go to them for not keeping the street neat . while a deeper probe in to the issue may seem to lead to a funny situation a the citizen especially the younger one are very irresponsible to it . the young people no longer feel that the duty towards the community are to be fulfilled rather than the right which they demand for . so , duty should always outweigh right . the establishment of social-service community especially to enhance a feeiling of duty towards the community clearly asserts the fact . now let u deal with the statement that young people have enough time to help their community . it can be described a the insensitivity of the author to look at the issue from a different facet . what doe community helping mean ? it simply mean having and donating time to a better , efficient and prosperous community . i believe that even though the direct approach is lacking to help and participate in the community help programme , what the youth are doing is indeed going to improve their own community by and large . illustrating this ,, just think of a situation where the division of labour doe not seem to exist . the butcher , milkman , vendors selling awide range of thing , blacksmith , gold smith do not start doing their duty . the community would be literally in chaos and this would led to inefficient functuioning of the society . not to forget the central fact that the order in society is basically bulit on the type of job the youth who comprise a substantial amount to the soceity .
