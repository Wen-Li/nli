the idea of teaching may be described in few step . the first step will ofcourse be the theory . to understand a given subject one should know what is already there , what exists . after that , a the second stage they will need to learn what is said about the existing case . a person becomes a student to learn , learning includes learning how to think . for instance if you are reviewing a company a it 's general director , you should first know the basic thing like it 's field of production or expertise , capital , number of worker , it current standing in the market . after knowing what is there , you may start to create your way of carrying the company forward . the thing you have to learn in the first step are the fact . when you are ready to walk on , you start taking idea and concept on how develop . it is similar for a new learner student . if he or she doe n't know that two time two equal four , he or she will never understand the basic of mathematics . after learning the main rule and factor they may look into idea and concept that have formed around the fact . so saying that a kid refusing to learn the main rule of math will be a genius in the future , under the name of open mindedness may be nonsense . if only the factor were tought to student they would probably become narrow minded people and never get to see different aspect of life . so combining the two becomes a must . while knowing the fact one should also understand the idea about it . from this frame i would like to state that understanding idea and the concept is need for a student to be able to see different point of view towards a single subject , but it doe n't carry a meaning without knowing what the subject is which is formed by gathering of the factor .
