some people say `` broad knowledge of academic subject are essential . '' however , i do n't think it 's true . the purpose of attending school is basically for becoming a professional in one field . broad knowledge about other field is not necessary to become an expert . normally , we learn subject of various kind in elementary school , junior high school , and high school . however , most of subject which we learned there are not practical knowledge to live . for example , i studied biology and geology for more than 4 year in my junior high school and high school but i have never used this kind of knowledge to solve problem i encounterd . i am sure that it wa waste of time because they are useless . i majored in music composition in my college for 6 year . i received ba and ma from the college . however , i am still studying music composition in an another institution because i thought what i studied in my college wa only a small part of entire subject . i am sure that it take a lot of time to become a real professional in one field so i think all student must concentrate on just one field to become a real expert since we do not have so much time . if you learn several subject , especially in college or university , it normally cost more . if you major in two subject , for example , fine art and mathematic , you have to pay normally more tuition than student who major only one subject . in addition , you have to buy more book and material for several subject . however , you have le chance to become a real professional on both field because you spent le time compared to student who major in only one subject . it doe not make any sence . it 's just waste of money . broad knowledge is not essential to become an expert . knowledge in other field is normally useless . besides , it take time to real expert in one field so you do n't have time to learn other subject . moreover , it 's espensive to study more than one subject .
