the way for many student to reach good result is to learn fact and reproduce them when they are asked to . in general , i never wa a friend of just learning fact without understanding the background . but i must agree , that it depends on the topic , which is the best way to learn . when learning a language for example , you have to learn the vocabulary . or when studying medecine , you ca n't get along without just learning the whole anatomy . the same case is when learning about history , there are some fact that you just have to keep in your mind . but : it 's only the preparation to be able to work . you will work with the anatomy or the historical fact , that you learned . i think , it is much more important to understand the idea of an concept . that is the only way , to be critical with idea , to think about it and maybe even to innovate or improve it . at the week-end , i 'm an instructor of first aid at the german red cross . i never say to the participant of my course : that is the perfect way to handle a medical problem . as an example , i would like to tell about the `` stabile seitenlage '' , which probably can be explained a laying a consciousless person in a stable way on the side . very important to me is to make the people understand , what are the danger of loosing their mind . and to solve these problem , we think about possibility against these danger . finally , the technic called `` stabile seitenlage '' is a proposition of me , how the danger of beeing `` bewusstlos / consciousless ? '' can be handled . but if a person ha understand why `` bewusstlosigkeit '' is dangerous and what can be done against it , he is always able to find a solution even when he ca n't remember the technic of the `` stabile seitenlage '' . for an ingenieur , who want to ameliorate for example a car , it is not enough to know about the fact of the car . .. 60 hp , maybe 1.100kg and so on . he must have understood the idea of the concept , how the car work , to be able to change anything . in summary , i think you always have to learn some fact and keep them in your mind first , but when you want to reach at a higher level , you absolutely must see `` behind '' the fact , you have to understand the concept and idea . and often , you have to understand the concept only once , and you can solve any problem by logical thinking . you can learn all the result of mathemathical term by heart , or understand one time , how the calculator function : - )
