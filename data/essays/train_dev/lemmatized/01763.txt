i do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not devote enough time to helping their community . to be more clear , by young people i would mean people in the age group of 20-35 yr . as time are changing , people are getting more and more involved with themselves , and the materialistic pleasure of life . this is especially true of the young generation , who value money more than anything . as a result , most of the attention of our youth is on earning money , and hence they are busy fulfilling their aim . today 's world is very competitive and in this struggle , young people often do not find the time to contribute to their community . another reason for such a thing , is that community are no longer close knit a they used to be . there is a lesser feeling of belonging to some particular community , and there is the emergence of a global community . more and more people travel to various place , and hence it is difficult for them to associate with a particular community . reasons apart let state some example from our experience . one such example is the lack of participation of youth in voluntary organisation , such a those for educating the poor people . it might be true that young people contribute money in such scheme , but we dont see too many young people , actually going out there and teaching . another example is the absence of young leader in our government . young people do not find such a career very financially rewarding and hence abstain from actively participating in the functioning of a government . so a time is progressing , young people are getting motivated to work more for themselves , than for their community . i would not say that this is true for all young people , but it would hold true in most case . such a drift away from community responsibility is primarily motivated by the current lifestyle of the younger generation .
