nowadays , we can see a lot of car in all street of the world in spite of the growth of th price of the oil . i think it wo n't change in twenty year . i think that people want to be more and more indepedant and the car is one of the signes of this independance because you can go where you want when you want , you just have to pay the oil . the need of move is very important for the man and people prefers take their car instead of the bus for exemple . and it 's why i think car will not disappear with the time , but the oil , will do . it 's a big ecological problem because oil pollutes a lot the ozone , and we must find new way of car energy in the future like alcohol , it 's already done in some country like brazil for exemple . it is also a political conflict , a i said after , poorests country than france , like brazil , had already adopted new energy but for richest country , it 's a way of earning money because there are a lot of tax on the oil . the society of consommation and benefit we live in is also a preponderant factor , because people are attract to buy more and more , they are touched by the advertisement done by all manufacturer , and if you close car manufacturer , it will have big consequencies on the market , and create unemployment . but by the same way , if you reduce the use of the car , you must create new underground structure so it will create temporary worker which can be helpfull for the unemployment of people who are not qualified for another job . however , a thing that we must know is that for the 2006 year , the statistic show that the sale of car have dicrease for a lot of big company like renault . to conclude , it is very difficult to predict the future of the car market , but from my point of view , i can not live whithout my car , i am keen on driving . so i hope car will not disappear . ..
