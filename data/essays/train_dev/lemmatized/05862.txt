i am agree with the opinion that there will be le car in use than there are today in twenty year . one reason is the oil is limitid and it get le and le resently . and the now energh such a sunshine is not able to take the part of oil . we may have a lot of difficulty to solve the energy problem . after twentiy year oil could be not enough to apply to all the car we have , so apart of people have to choose another way for traffic . or more people choose the eletric train to go to work or study . another reason for this is that people could not have to be in the office to work in the future . now mor and more people choose the way to at home . the internet is changing our world , we can make a meeting on the internet easily and make report and send it to the office by mail . because of this a lot of people do n't need to drive to the office every day and even some of the people do n't need a car at home . the traffic is not stop to change it style in the history . we can imagine that may be in the futhure people can find some more useful way for traffic such a personal plane . i belivie that car will be le than
