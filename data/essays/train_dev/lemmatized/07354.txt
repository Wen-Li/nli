i think there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . of couse i think car company will produce a new model , and we want to buy more . however , it is difficult to increase car more , because there are 2 big problem , poluteing enviroment and losting fossil energy . at first , we have to think about the poluting enviroment . now , the car 's gas is poluting our enviroment . i think if we have more car , our enviroment would be change . and it is not only poluting the envitroment , but also effect our health . reasently , there is a news that there are many people in tokyo are worried about cought is because of car 's gas . so , poluting our enviroment is big problem and we have to reduce the car 's gas . moreover , we have to think about the fossil energy . now , most of the car are moved by the fossil . but , the fossil is not produced easily , it is limited . so , we have to reduce to use the fossil . accoding to these reason , i think tere will be fewer car .
