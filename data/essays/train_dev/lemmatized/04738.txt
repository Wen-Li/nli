i agree with the statement that it is important for the student to understand the concept and idea well and not just learn the fact . the main reason for my view are given below . first reason for my veiw is that we need to implement the idea and concept in real life and just learned fact will not help our cause . what we learn in school or college is of importance in real life and we need to implement it in real life scenario , so just by learning the fact we wo n't be able to implement them . concepts of physics or chemistry , which are essential in our day to day life , will never be clear to u . we can learn that earth rotates around the sun , but we will never understant the reason for the same until we understand the concept and idea behind the factor like rotation and gravity . so just learning fact we limit our knowledge and understanding of the small small thing which we have to deal in daily life and from time to time . second reason for my view is that the learned fact are easily forgotten a compared to idea and concept which we understand well . we do n't forget the concept which we understand well and are able to remember them a long time . the student who just learn for exam have le knowledge and forget the subject early a compared to those who understand the concept . however , it is also sometmes neccessary to just learn the fact and not understand . like the case of history subject . we are not required to understand the concept just learn and know the fact . in conclusion , it is important to understant the concepst and idea a we need to implement them in our daily life and also we tend to remember the concept which are well understood a compared to just learning them . but there are situation where just learning is required like the case of knowing the history subject .
