i disagree this idea that young people nowadays do not help community . i support this idea for specific reason . i wathed tv proglam last week , and that proglam is about volunteer activity . i saw many college student were doing volunteer on tv . the student support elderly people . these elderly people experienced world war 2 , and the student want to listen these elderly 's talk about war they have never experienced before . by making good relationship with these elderly , the young people try to understand their sadness , and they try to find the meaning of peace . they said , `` we do n't know war , and we feel we are living in peaceful country , but there are still many war around the world , and people killing , and dying more and more . . we think young people should learn from war-experienced people more than text book . '' i 'm also belong volunteer club which is teaching japanese to foreigner . many of them are kid , and they came japan because their parent came japan to find thier job . in japan , salary is much higher than developping country . of course they can not speak japanese , so their child can not keep up with japanese student . even more , they often teased and descriminated by their friend . they need help . abouv all , young people
