knowledge is devine and is a must to everyone in any form it may be present . but most of u consider that knowledge of only certain limited thing or subject around u enough . the knowledge in those limited thing may be deep and secialized but it doe require the knowledge of certain other thing also . so , i go with the thought that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . this can be proved in a number of way . if we consider feild of biotechnology a an example we can find many deciplines in it like cell biology , microbiology , genetics , bio chemistry , bio organic chemistry , thermodynamics , instrumentation process , bio process engineering , bio informatics , genomics and proteomics , molecular biology , genetic engineering , etc. if a person taking a subject a biotechnology a his major and try to confine himself toward the specialization of a certain subject rather than aquiring knowledge in all his academic subject it 'll be very difficult for him to do anything . if we consider a person want to specialize in genetic engineering he just can not do that without the knowledge of cell ciology , molecular biology , genetic map , instrument to be used , etc. so it is a must for him to know all these subject from his academic in order to master genetic engineering . now a day all the diciplines have become inter related and it is very much difficult to say that a person can master in a specific subject without the knowledge of the other subject . if we consider gardening a our next example we need to a little of botany a little of chemistry and a little of math too . we can explain this a such , firstly the person intrested in gardening should know what type of plant he want for his garden and are those plant able to survive in those climatic condition and next he ha to know a little bit of chemistry to know with which chemical the plant is to be treated if infected by any knid of disease or pest and finally math to know how much quantity of chemical is needed to get the required amount of the treatment effect . so , in this way if a person want to maintain a proper garden he ha to know a little of the above deciplines . like this almost all the feilds are inter related and no feild is specific to itself . thus i can strongly conclude that a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialization in one specific subject is always better .
