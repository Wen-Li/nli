it ha been long discussed if it is more important for student to understand idea amd concept than it is for them to learn fact . i disagree with the statement that it is more important for student to understanding idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . facts are the thing that we seen that is virtue and used a the basic of the idea and concept . you can hardly tell weather the concept and the ideal are true or false , because everyone had his or her owe observation . we know know that neithergh the earth nor the sun is the certal of the universe , but most of the people believed that the concept that the earth is the certail of the univese . also concept s and ideal always determine our own thought and lead it to the wronf or even opposite way , and take u far away from the truth . it is widely known that the reaserches of the brain cell had not made any progress for year since the sicentists use their concept and ideal out of date to anylses the brain cell . this concept that every kind of brain cell use the electrocity to transfer their signal made them totally ignore the importance of the other cell . the last but not the least the fact not only provide u the matereals to observe but also functioned a the inspiration of the sicentists . by learning the fact we can thinking in our own way and then leart to select the best way of thinkin . as we know that men must suffer to be wise . if you suffered from your own thinking and figue out what the fact reflected , you will finally be able to handle the problem that you will face . by this way people became much more matrue , and know the essential of life which do not had the concept of how to live in a good life .
