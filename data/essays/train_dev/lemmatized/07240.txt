there are many way to travel around the world , by group , individually , in a family , with a tour guide , friend or even by yourself . first , traveling in a group might be good if you know the people you are traveling with . a tour guide might be good if you are to lazy to learn and adventure yourself . if you travel you have to be open minded to face new experinces . traveling to another country or a new place is not going to be exciting unless it becomes challenging and fun . the only way to step on those emotion is guiding yourself , otherwise if you are gonna take a tour guide better stay home and buy a book of the place you desire to go , a well traveling in a group is more a waste of time . secondly , a tour guide will only show you what he thing is important , or whatever he belief that is interesting from his point of view . therefore , if you want to really learn of the place you must do it by yourself and probably with a partner to have a safe trip . in fact , a a tourist you migth miss some important detail of the place , but a well from everysingle place is visited you will be more likely to be able to depicted to others because you had to figure out everything by yourself . unforgettable experience are those experinces where our mind wa working in it maximum . in addition , traveling in a group is not the best idea because usually they travel in lower pace nad because of the quantity of people together is not comfortable to go to small place , where it is already overcrowded . traveling individually give you more flexibility in your schedule . time is gold and what you with in during your travel is very important . for example if you go to louvre in a group you might have to wait 8 hr . to get in . instead if you figure out that late night you only have to wait 20 min. you are more likely to go around paris and enjoy your day and then go to the louvre , other than stick to the group and waste your time . in conclusion , traveling alone is more fun and useful than in a group with a tour guide . life is about learning and taking adventure . you want to live , so travel and have fun , but if you do n't better buy a book and stay home or waste your time traveling in a group with a useless tour guide .
