i agree with the statement a it say , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are three advantage . first , a you traveling in a group led by a tour guide , tour guide will let you know every single thing you need to see in the journey . for example , if you want to go sightseening , a tour guide will escort you to the sight . the tour guide will be resopnsible whatever traveler want to do . they just don ' have to worry about reserving the resturant or doing some speacial activity . espeacialy when they can not speak english or german or whatever the language are spoke in the country where they travel to . second , since go traveling with group , they will definately get along with each other and have fun . if traveling alone , it wo n't be able to have much fun a traveling with group . third , traveling a gourp with a tour guide is much more safer than traveling alone . of course a tour guide know about the location where is not safe enough to go so they wo n't go to the dangerous side of city . ever since transportation developed amagingly , the world get closer . we can go to the another side of world by airplane in ten hour or it may take a day to get there . it used to take about two , three month to get to the other countires . the world is getting more dangerous , most of people have gun and knife . so traveling with a tour guide is very helpfull to the traveler . in my experienses , i have gone to australia by my own . it wa still scary to go there by self . espeacialy in town side . when i went to town , i lost my wallet . i did n't lose my passport , thougt . so ever since i believe traveling with a tour guide is better and safer .
