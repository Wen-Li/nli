some people who support most advertesements make product seem much better than they really are but others argue with it . but i have to say that , if i were faced with the direction , i would probably follow most advertesements make product seem much better than they really are . first reason refers to profit . only you show your product is very nice , the people will by it . but problem is their product not really so nice . so they use advertisement to expend their merit of product . secondly , no consequence and law to control their behavir . in the following disscusion , i would like to reason and provide evidence to support my viewpoint . no issue is more important than now the one that refers to profit . history witness and present many example . such a some product of company lead the people dieth or disable ; or some hair condition include the toxin ; or some toy hurt the child . but alll this product in the advertisement is the best product compare the sample kind of product in the wold . the people do not know the truth , and buy it . this way can make a huge number of profit for the company , so they like to do that . do you think these example are very persuasive ? another reason is head and chief that i have chosen to put here . it is no better illustration can demonstrate the view . for instance , the people know some advertsements is not true . but they also are not so much fake , too . so the people can not use the law or some rule to control their action . this case is exist in the most of advertisement . if you can see that , you can understant it more deeply . so the most striking conclusion is obovious . to sum up , givern the reason discussed above , we can arrive the conclusion that most advertesements make product seem much better than they really are . no only did i prefer to agree with this point , but also i were a witness , too .
