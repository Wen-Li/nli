this is very difficult question for me , because i am a one of the young people who do not have a relation with my community , so i copletely agree with this opinion that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . there are several resons i think for this question . first , almost young people do not know their neighbour , because there is no opportunity to contuct with them . in the past of japan , people did anything with the community member , because the people who belonged to same communitiy were family , so people decide the important thing , like a rebuilding the house or changing the job , with the community . people do help the others in their community . however , people nowadays are not interested in others , and they do not want to have a relation with the neighbour , because the horrible actidents occures recently . second , older family and younger family have a generation gap . if there is a chance to do something together in their community , but both family have a different opinion . it is a natural thing for the people , because they tend not to have a complex problem , so they do not give enough time to helping the community and not have a relation . when i wa a child , i had to clean up the park where i always played with my friend for the community 's event . this wa a task for the child . many adult observed u , but another day , many adult taught sport for the communitiy club . i agree with this opinion that many young people do not give the time for their community , but we should change this custom to improve the relationship between the neighbour and me , because if the accident happens in daily life , others near u help first . people help each other and get a good relationship in the community .
