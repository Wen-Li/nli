although for some profession it might be better to have a profund knowledge of their specific subject , in my profession you are dependend on a rather broad knowledge . so i tend to agree with the statement also knowing that there are strong reason to think the other way around . being an architect my client not only expect from me to make an excellent design which fit their demand , it involves also at least a basic knowledge of many other profession like electricity , pluming , wood work etc . so if i would just focus on skill concerning the design , i would not be able to meet the demand in the other field . but then of cause i am also dependend on people who know more about specific subject than i do like i mentioned in the beginning . there is an other example to underline my point of view . surgents often need very specific skill and knowledge about deseases in order to be able to cure them . but then it need also le specialised doctor who are able to diagnose the desease in the first place and this might involve more than one field . but on the other people who are specialized can be very narrow minded a well . they do n't show interest in other thing such a cultural matter like theater and art because they do n't know anything about it . for some profession it is even necessary to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject such a buisiness man . to be able to communicate with others in different field can be a very important factor for their success . so all in all i think it is better to be interessted in many subject than just in one , it give a a better understanding of others and open up your mind for the `` unexpected '' .
