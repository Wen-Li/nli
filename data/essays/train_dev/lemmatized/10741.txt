this statement is something that ha always been said . in the past , for example my grandfather ha told me , that they tought that in the year 2000 everything wa going to change , machine were going to be able to controll everything , even u , car were going to be able to fly . .. but more or le every thing continue being the same , somethings have changed but some others have not . in my point of view this statement is not true . everybody now want to have a car and investigator are looking for some new idea to build the car of the future , a car which probably consume le petrol than one normal car doe nowadays . everybody will try to have the best car and the one with the most sofisticated dessign , a now having the best one and the most powerful one and if it is possible not only to have one car even try to have two or three car , is the same to be an important person every body will try to be the most important person with the most impressive car or car . it is possible that pollution might be reduce a car have to pas more control each day and that pollution is becoming a more important problem every day , so that engineer are searching new way to not pollute a much a car do now . in addition , a city are becoming bigger and bigger every day people will need their own car to go for example in a big city from the north part to the south part , a distance that in the past could be covered by some minute walking . in conclusion , all these reason state why my opinion is that in twenty year there will not be fewer car in use than there are now .
