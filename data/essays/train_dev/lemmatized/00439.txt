in the old day the community almost equal to the whole world people are living in . therefore , there are strong connection between people and their community . however , nowadays , thing have changed a lot . as a global village , people can communicate with others who are far away . the connection with community seems not a important a before . that make the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . in modern world , there are so many thing happen at the same time , and people usually only concern with those thing have strict relationship with themselves . for example , in the community , we often see that it is always the older people who participate in the work . why ? it is because compared to the community work , the young people have many other thing are more important to them to accomplish , such a studying and making money . it seems that all their time are occupied by these thing already . in the long run , the whole society seems to adapt this phenomenon . also , gradually it ha build up a wrong concept that because there are other thing more important than community work , young people do not have to be responsible to their community . they not only do nothing to help the community , but also sometimes waste the resourses provide in the community . in other word , because of the wrong value of the society , instead of doing something good for the community , the young people do someting harm to the community . therefore , i think it is important to change this misthinking . parents should take their child to help their community togather . when they are used to doing this , they would not use `` no time '' to be an excuse for not take part in the work . now young people state that they have do time are not true , it is just simply because they do not want to . if you are willing to help the community , you can always find time to do that .
