the success of people is strictly related to the level of risk taken . the real success is the materialization of the people 's ability to differentiate themself respect to other . a good example of success story could be the steve jobs adventure in the technological world . steve jobs , that is the father and the creator of the apple company , know very well , that to be a successful man , you must take some risk , and try to do the thing in a different way respect your competitor . as professor porter say the real and most valuable competitive advantage for a company , but at the same time for a person , is the ability to be different . be different , not mean , only doing new thing ; be different could be doing the old thing but in different way . every time that we try to do a new thing , we take at the same time more risk , but to be successful , we must be able to evaluate the differents risk , and to figure out what could be our return , and what or in which measure the failure could affect our life . then , from my point of view , success is related with a multiple series of different factor : ability to create , to immagine , or to perform something in different way respect to other people ; predisposition to the risk , in other word , could be very difficult reach the success , if the subject is a risk adverse ; but at the same time , is very important , the ability to measure this risk , and to create some different scenario , to be able to predict what could happen if everything take the wrong path . returning to the steve jobs example , what signed the success of the apple company , wa the visionary ability of jobs , in figuring out what will distingue a product like ipod from a different mp3 device . he choosed an innovative path , he calculated and evaluated the risk correlated with his idea , and , reaching some failure , taking some lose , he finally succed with his device . then , when someone have success , is at last , cause he wa able to understand and to learn from his failure and his error , that could derive from trying to be different , and taking some risk . success is in my opinion , the prize , reserved to who have the courage to be like no others .
