i disagree with the following statment , `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . if we are just try take a glance to the increasing shift of the technology all over the world , then we have to believe that the number of the car will accodringly increase reaching the top of the peak . the reason which contribute with this huge car incline are many , such a the great advance develobment in the technology , and the remarkable extinst of the population who lived on the earth at the same world . there is an advance technology exisit not only every day but every moment these day , and the people try to provide the customer with best product . if we comapare to number of the model of the car before twenty year and now , we will see the remarkable difference . the same way if we try to comare today 's model with twenty year from now , we will diffenitlly be shocked by the statistic . moreover to this advance technology , the number of the population which are n't only exceed the estimated limit by our mind , but we can feel it indirectly through the noiseness , crowdness , and the number of the people who died from these car accident . lets say that this is the tax of the technology that we want to lived in . in other word , the number of the car will raise , year after year , and this increasment will be out of our control . because of the technology and the population growth , the car after twenty year will be more not fewer that today . if i get the change to own my own car i will never hesiste to do so . at leats i can get red of the driver , depend on myself , and do all of my requirments by myself . no one will do them better than me .
