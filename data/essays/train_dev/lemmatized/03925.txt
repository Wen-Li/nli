i agree with the statement that most advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are . the advertisement including not only those on tv show but also on the newspaper . the perpose of these advertisement is letting the customer think the product are good and want to buy them . the perpose made the advertisement do these . in order to let the customer think the product are worth to buy , what they need to do is to show the product is good enough and worth them to buy . the advertisement ha to make the product look better than other similar product , then they have to made up thing to show the product is better than others . this is the reason why the product seem much better than they really are . in china , the advertisement make the product look like they were perfect are normal . there are many similar product in china at the same time . making the product that thay sell look best is the most important thing to make their product sell well . for instance , i bought an expensive pen which it said will nerver broken under any condition in the advertisement on tv . but only after three month that i found the pen wa broken already . i found the seller to ask for return . the seller said something that made me understand the true propose of the advertisement . '' do you think there will be a pen that never break in the world ? i do n't think so . '' she said to me in a smile . '' all the advertisement do these , not only u . '' from that on , i do n't believe any advertisement anymore . there are more than one example can show that the advertisement made product seem better than they really are . base on my own experience that i can tell the statement is true all the time .
