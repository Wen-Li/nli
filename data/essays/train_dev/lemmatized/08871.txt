i strongly agree with the idea that it is more important for student to understant idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i am going to explain my agreement , based on the level of education , in the next paragraph . first , student at the elementary and high school level need to understand basic theory before they are in contact to the world a independent people . they must know about logical solution and good behavior . althought parent care for the development of their child , school are a fundamental part in the adquisition of basic knowledge . second , at the university level , student are in a continious process of learning because everyone want a career . the understanding of idea and concept is the most important for them in the adquisition of knowledge . althought learning by fact is important too , student gain more knowledge from idea and concept . that is the reason why there are so many university and school around the world . students must enphasize in theory rathen than in practice . they will practice later but they need to understand important point before they enter to the working enviroment . third , a graduated student , they should practice and learn fact , but the process of learning would be longer if they did not spend too much time before understanding idea and concept . it is true that people learn a lot from experience but it is also true that it take too much time for people who do not have the basic concept on their mind in order to apply them into the practice . as far a i am concern , i believe that it is more important for student to gain their knowledge by understanding idea and concept . althought experience is important , this process would be endured if student do not press attention to the theory .
