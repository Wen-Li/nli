some people said that travel with guide are boring and noneffective because they have to move according to maden plan . but i agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . to begin with , guide provide service for traveler to enjoy the well-known place for it fullest . because guide have lot of knowledge of place , traveler are not needed to prepare to know about them . as a result , they can spend remained time to enjoy the travel . for example , when i wa in high scool , i went to je-ju island . a beautiful guide helped me to acquire a number of information i 'd never known and i remember the full story of je-ju island until now . on top of that , we do n't have to make plan owing to guide . usually people make an effort to plan where to eat and sleep , and what route to go through . but guide get rid of all concern . because they have already held many travel and had maden plan . we are required to just enjoy the travel . we ca n't watch place that are not in plan , of course . but we are able to get enough information . if i have a chance to travel , i would like to go to america . it ha very extended territory and many beautiful scenery . but i do n't know where to go first , sleep and eat . although i can prepare the plan through many book , but i have no time to spend to it . in conclusion , i have to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
