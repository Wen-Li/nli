i think it is a difficult question because it can have two simliar meanigns . first if it is better for a student to know the theory rather than the practise aspect ; but it can mean also , if it is better for a student to understand a concept rather than the fact which the concept come from . in this second meaning , for example , if it better for a student to learn principal political idea of the french revolution or to learn fact that brought to the revolution ; or to know cause and effect of the second world war or to know personal hitler history . i think that there is not a more important thing between understanding idea and learning fact . in fact , education can not be only theoryc . so i do not agree with the statement . for example , in chemestry , student can not learn only formula . he-she ha to do experiment , otherwise science can not go on , because theory have to be proved . maybe only who study philosophy can learn only idea of ancient greek or roman philosopher , for instance . that mean that who work only with concept can have an abstract way of learning . even though also in this field there is a sort of evolution . for example , some branch of philosophy , of humanities , like antropology ha to study human behaviour so it ha to know fact . in the field i study , that is law , fact are really important . eve though there are many rule , we can not use only them to give a legal advise . we need to refer to fact that really happened .
