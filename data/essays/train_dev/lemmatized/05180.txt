i agree with the saying that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . altough private car have played an impotany role in people 's life nowadays and people tend to more depend on the use of the car , i think this situation still will change a lot in the future twenty year . twenty year is not a very short time , it can mean that one generation have grown up and become the most dorminant people in the society . in many developing country , the child nowadays have been taught more about the importance of protecting our environment , otherwise mother nature will punish humankind for what they had done . so when these child become adult in like twenty year , they will do better than their parent in the aspect of environmantal protection . what is more , there is already a lot of event in both developing and developed country that people automobally decrease the use of the private car . for example , i heard a lot of people in western country nowadays always share their car with their collegues or classmate , or just take the bus instead of driving a car to decrease the waste from the car which will pollute the air in the city . and in china , there is also news about some elementary school student persuade their parent not to use car to send them to school , these parent then receive their suggestion and use bicycle to pick their child . so we can see from these event that people have become more and more concern about their environment , this is why maybe the use of car will drop in the future . some other factor also can make change in the use of car . first , the price of oil ha become much more higher than before and continue to increase . maybe many people in the future can not afford such high price and change their way of going outside . second , there are also a lot of convienient public transportation in the city . such like subway , bus , railroad . this kind of transportation is not expensive and can attain anywhere you want in the city , and especially the subway can not be influenced by the terrible traffic above them . it can save people a lot of time , and it is quiker than driving a private car . so , the high price of oil and the convinence of taking public transportation can make effort to the decrease of the use of car in twenty year . in conclusion , there are some reason why there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in my opinion , the most important is that people in the whole world can realize how serious that using too many car can make our blue earth a dirty planet , .
