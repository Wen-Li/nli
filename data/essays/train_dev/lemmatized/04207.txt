i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing because it wa their risk that wa responsible for the technology we are enjoing in our present life . there are many situation that would support the above point some of them are if we take the field of restaurents then we are seeing that many established restaurents are always trying to keep their presence in a new way and also we can say that people are also enjoying that . so that we can strongly say that these hotel trying in a new way wa helping them . in the case of automobile also these company are trying to follow the new way and are also these company were investing a lot of amount on the research and developmet and were providing their customer with better facility to satisfy their customer who will be wishing to go for a better one . from these example we can get that trying new wa always better but it wa also having some drawback and if they go in a wrong way it may leed to their destruction , so they should be concious while going for the new way . risk wa must in this competitive world and with out that we can not be taht successful in our life so a successfull person cannnot stand on the same thing because he wa successful only becasuse of the risk they had taken in their life . finally it wa clear that notonly those successful men every body should go for risk to enjoy a great life of achievemets . we have some living example like some bussiness legend who reached the peak of their bussiness and were preparing themselves in social service . no body can walk with out falling often , so nothing can be achieved with the risk .
