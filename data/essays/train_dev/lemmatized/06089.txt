the discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be splitted into two part . one the one hand are people , which try new thing and take risk to fullfil their target . on the other hand are people , which do what they already know to do well . such two different type how to handle with risk will reach the final success . people have different kind of meaning about their own apility of risk . if i think about such difference , i will talk about two friend of mine . the one boy is about 35 year old . he reached one of the best school examination with a grade of 1.2 during his school periode . he began studying law and finished university after le than the regular studing time of 4 year with a very good grade . his first contact with the economic or in gereral with business had taken place for him with 26 year in a big company a an assistante for law specific question for consoulting contract . he wa very resistent against risk , maybe because of his first contact with the business world . he had been in such office and position for almost 9 year without a lot of experience , but also without trying any higher risk , than going home early then 10 minute before the regular business closing time . my second example is a boy , who is 28 year old . he finished school with a grad around 2.5 , which hab been the middlefield in his final examination year . he started an own business idea after his examination . his business wa about the offering of it solution for small and middle sized company . in the time of the new market economy a lot of company used the consoulting work of his company . he had have a lot of fixed costumer , which needed his help regularly . during such periode he had have the idea to export the concept to other country , which he started in 1999 with austria . banks helped him to fullfil such target by offering a lot of money . after two year he had have 4 office outside germany and a sum of 4.500.000 euros a a negative deposit on the bank . the concept failed by the crash of the new market and he lost all the life standart almost in 2 month and will not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his life time . as a conclusion of my two example , the level of risk can not be argued by the level of school education , meaning the final examination grade , and the university status . moreover people with a ability to try risk , will have a faster success and will be stay there , if they control themselves regularly . the risk of falling down , because of uncontrolled mistake is more realistic in comparision to the risk resident people . however , every human beeing have to know for themselves which goal and objective he or she want to reach and how fast to get there . in adition such factor will bring the level of risk ability and the success .
