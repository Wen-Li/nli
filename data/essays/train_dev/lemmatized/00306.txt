there are different type of people in the world which show diverse action on risking and not risking thing . successful poeple seem to try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i actually agree with both statement because you can not really put people into category . sometimes it work but in this case it doe not . in real life you can notice a lot of successful people . but how have they become successful ? indeed most of these people have risked a lot to become what they are now . most of these successful individual have acted risky once in their lifetime but after that point they most likely become reasonable . if you have been successful and started a life which really count to you e.g. you have a good job , a settled life with a famliy and kid and a house ( in my opinion exactly that is what winning describes and what life is about ) , you must be a fool to risk that . there are some typical workfields which fit in this case , e.g. broker . if i assume being a broker and have exactly the kind of life i have just mentioned it would be probably very hard to not risk anything because in this workfield you have to risk to earn money . but people have to be reasonable , risking at highest what they can afford and do what they can do best , being there for the family . to conclude thats exactly where i want to come back why i agree to both statement . some of these people who have job which let them having risky decission to make can either go on with being what they used to be or they can concentrate on what is going to happen in the future . if you have decided to act reasonable and not risk anything anymore combine with doing the stuff that you are good at then you will be successful but just in another stage in your life .
