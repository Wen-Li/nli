as we are staying in a world which is changing from day to day they are many new thing that ha been invented and this is because people are trying to invent new thing even though there is risk invovled in doing it . it is true that successful people try newthings they take risk to achieve new thing . they will not stay out of trying new thing even they face failure and if they face risk also . for example i knew my brother who will not keep away trying even if it is involved with risk , he is very interested mainly in thing like playing in fire , making the bicycle go threw the fire even though he had been burned in fire he did not stop trying it at last he succed in what he tought . some people make adventure thing like playing with fire and climbing mountain and hill . i think if they stay away with doing what they had already know how to do well there is no use in it . if they do in that way there may be no technology development and the the world may be the same how it is thousand of year ago . mainly scientist make many thing like atombombs though it is risky for them , tey do it for the sake of country and they will succed in doing that thing . aeroplanes which flow through river though it is very dangerous they did not stop inventing it , now it is very important to u it save our time , many other thing like missles , rocket etc have been invented without those people our life would not be so safe . i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . there is proverb saying that `` risks are the stepping stone for success '' and this is the one they are following .
