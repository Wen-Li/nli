in this world you can find people who have a broad knoledge of many academic subject which can do lot of very basic thing and people who are specialized in one specific subject and can resolve very complex problem about a subject . i do not agree with the statement because he following reason > first of all in a laboral enviroment people specialized in one specific subject are more likely to be hired , because they have a bigger knowledge about the job what are they going to do . for example > when you have a cardiac desease you would prefer go to a cadiologist with a phd to go to a doctor who know just a little of every desease because you do not know if he or she can help you . my second reason why is that is easier to know a little of lot of subject than have a specialized knowledge about one subject , what i mean with this is that someone specialized in one subject can learn easier a little of lot of subject than someone who ha a broad kwnoledge of lot of subject . for example > if i am specialized in a subject i can after start to read about diferent thing and learn aout it a little , while if i am someone who just know a little about some thing i have to study very hard o have the specialized knowledge . in conclusion because a specialized is more required in a laboral enviroment than someone who just ha a basic knowledge and because is easier o become in someone with a general knowledge i disagree with the statement .
