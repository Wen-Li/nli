`` innovation is mother of success '' i strongly support the prompt that successful people try new thing rather than only doing what already know how to do well . surely , success come to those who try new thing . `` risk is another name of success . '' if one take risk to invest in a new bussiness then two condition take birth . first one is that he will earn profit for himself which is positive aspect of the risk taken . but on the other hand there is equal probability of his failure which is a negative aspect . in my opinion , both of them ca n't be stated a success . because what real success is to learn from failure and then again hit your target , but this time with full preparation and timing . then i am sure that the person will not loose again . this implies that a person learns from his failure . yes , i agree that , success come to those who try new thing and with a proper planning . but it not only trying new thing without even pondering over it . if a person take risk to gamble then it his luck that will win one time or two but it not that he will win always . its just wasting maoney and above all time . so risk should be taken in a right direction . it should not in vague direction . let 's have an example of the great industrialist of india late dhirubhai ambani , founder of reliance group . in his early career he only tried his hand in textile and he succeeded which encouraged him to try in other field too . he tried and got a victory over all the field he invested in . this ca n't be stated a luck rather it wa the risk taken by him and the planning which gave him the crown of victory . to conclude . i would state that it not trying new thing which gain you victory but the planning and hardwork along with risk . blend othis could make anybody a `` winner '' . `` success is taking risk at proper time with proper planning and hardwork .
