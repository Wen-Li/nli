i have to difine what is success or who is successful . in this essay , iwould like to define the success a people who could get a lot of money in business or who could get the fame and status . there are many people who could suceed in some particular field . i feel that most of them did new thing and carried out the new planning . therefore , i agree with the statement . the first reason i agree to successful people always try to new thing and take risk is because just following what people already know how to do well never lead to success . doing exact the same thing with other people doing do n't people grow up . in other word , the people who do n't grow up can not suceed in any field . the second reason why i think successful people try new thing and take risk is because most of people who do n't suceed think that they do n't want to take risk . they choose the safer way . i believe that succeeding in some field always associate with some risk like financial , time , human relationship , and so forth . if success does't associate with risk , everyone could suceed . success is not so easy task in the society . in conclusion , i strongly believe that successful people try to new thing althogh there are some risk in what they try to do . fearing some risk dones't lead to suceess .
