nowadays , people are used to living with their car in such a daily way that most of them could not act without it : going to their job , doing their shopping , and so on . on the other hand , the increase of oil price seems to lead people to think of using their car le . as a consequence , such a controversial situation can make u to wonder what the future is destined for car . to my mind , even if ecology may act so that in twenty year there is fewer car , there will be a many car a today or even more . first , in my opinion , we must consider the situation in state which are developing , in order to have an idea of the future about such technology . indeed , in country such a india , people ca n't afford a car for every member of a family yet , like it is the case in the united states , but in twenty year the state will be more developped and the citizen might have more money and thus might be able to buy more car which stay a sort of myth of success . hence , even if new better technology were put in place , they would be too expensive for the developping state , and that 's why i believe that there wo n't be fewer car . secondly , the habit and the economy are not to be changed staight away and people may be going on buying car . as a matter of fact , people are used to driving themselves everyday and everywhere ; a a consequence it would be difficult to make them to use other mean of communication . for instance , although student have a large access to bus and metro , parent still buy a car to their child for their majority in the united states ; more than an indispensable object , it is a symbol of freedom and of wealthy . otherwise , the factory are not also ready to give up their usual product , and this all the more since it is very expensive to look for new system of communication . therefor , i think that the car is so integrated in mentality that it will take more than twenty year to change is place , and so people will still buy car . finally , from my point of view , news technology will permit to improve car , in particular about oil necessity and pollution , however they wo n't lead to the end of car . indeed , i think that scientist will find new manner to make the car to function but i fear they wo n't find such a revolutionary mean of communication that people will no loger buy car . for example , even if tey find a new product , they would have to adapt road , to make it not too much expenseive and to answer to all the demand . it seems to me that is more o project for fifty year than twenty . for all these reason , i think that they will not be fewer car in twenty year ; this useful tool is part of our life for still many year .
