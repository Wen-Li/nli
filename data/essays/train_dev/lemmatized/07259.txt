many people who success these day , have underwent many different experience . espeacially , the one who are introduced in the news or the internet , is speacial from others . so , i agree with the statement , ` successful people try new thing ' because they have courage that they would succeed in trying a new task , and try to develop the present . to begin with , the people who have succeeded in their life try new thing , since they have a faith in their heart that make them succeed in a certain part . if they did not have such courage , the successed people would not even have had a chance to change their life . for example , i have an uncle , who is a mountain climber . since he wa in college , my grandmother tried to make him give up his dream , which wa being a mountain climber . since it is not that of a famous job , my grandmother tried everything to stop him , even acted if she wa ill to make him abdicate in that job . however , my uncle did not give up , and practiced very hard and became a successful mountain climber who teach student and help them win contest . moreover , since trying to develop what we have now make people successful , people should have the chance to try new thing . making what other could not think of is a huge step up . for instance , if bill gates did not try to invent microsoft , the society would not have been developed this much . his attempt to develop the human life also made him repectful and succeed in his life . i think that his courage for such an attempt , which made him through all the way to being a the inventor and the richest people in the world , wa the key for his success . to conclude , having risk or trying new task is the way to be successful because that person had the courage enough to make it trough . also , since the people who succeed had the mind to make a better world , people should try new thing . people should try anything to make oneself succeed in their goal .
