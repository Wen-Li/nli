nowadays , we can see lot of young peole who go out with their friend , go to the movie and enjoy party . some youth think that they are the happiest people in the world . youth are more active than older peole and look enjoy their life . so they might enjoy life more than order do . but in my opinion , old people really enjoy life more than younger peole . first of all , old people have lot of experience . they live longer than youth and have many different situation . sometimes , they had really hard time to recover their failure and they had unforgetable day in their life . whenever they have hard time , they do n't give up and try to recover it . and by having these experience , they can enjoy their life . also , they have more friend than younger peole . because they 've already been to elementary school , middle school , high school , and college , they have really good friend who are always with them and help them a lot . during living for a long time , old peole could have friend who adviced them whenever they had hard time . so old people really enjoy their life with their forever friend . furthermore , in the case of adult , they achieved their hope . they have studied and had many failure to get job that they want to have . by having those day , they experienced a lot and finally achieved thing what they want . so they can enjoy life more than young people . young people enjoy their life by playing and having lot of party with their friend . but older people enjoy life more and know how to enjoy their life because they have enough experience and more real friend . thus , i do n't agree that young people enjoy life more than older peole do .
