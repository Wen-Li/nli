young people do contribute to the community in some or the other way though not all do . but most of them get involved in social activity helping the community and the society a well . youngsters always have a special feeling for their country and the society they live in which make them to contribute for the community . but not all are with that spark , reason being many like the atmosphere there are brought up , the personal experience they had and etc . many help their nation by offering social service and thats how they take time to help their community . youngsters due to many reason feel a lot for their nation . the have a very good spirit of helping the society . one reason could be the heartwarming delivery of civic lecture from an well versed professor . it could also be the different tv show broadcasted on the theme of patriotism . young people are engaged in their college with variety of task . most of the them point to their responsibility towards their nation . the classroom lecture and the general conversation among the peer make them to think about how well they can do for the betterment of the society . once the thought occurs , the very first answer would be to get involved in social activity by joining a community if not many . i can cite few example from my personal life . there wa this conversation among my peer group with our lecturer guiding u . suddenly , the technical aspect of my country were related with the political issue . on further discussion , it came to my notice that the infant too were the victim for the country 's citizen 's carelessness towards the society . we started by browsing for community doing good social service . we all joined it and helped it in encouragin child to opt education over work . we helped a charity home from being devasted by filing a petition in the high court and giving a consistent strong support . in my experience of getting involved in such activity i realised that there are many student and younsters trying to do something for the nation by joining and forming community . i think thing have improved when compared to past regarding the young people . their interest are quite of a matured kind and contribute to the society one or the other way . a living and popular example of youngster taking enough time to help the society is `` lok paritran '' , a party formed by five indian ex-students of iit 's . its lucid that they take out more than enough time to help for the nation 's betterment . but i admit that not all youngster take out time for the nation or community . there are few who dont take time at all and wander here and their ticking their moment way . be it any community , not all show up active participation . few of them keep themselves away from such thing intentionally and few are not aware of such activity . few of the younsters are too busy with their acadaemics to even think of extra ciricular activity . few stand right considering their situation and circumstance and few do n't a they dont come forward though they have a chance to . but most of the youth ha focussed and is focussing on improving situation around . they join community and aim for accomplisments that serve better to the society . though not all young people take out time for social activites , majority of them do . few take out a little time and few quite a good time . there are people from the youth who dedicate themselves to community . coming to a stand would be very difficult because of the varitey of people living and acting according to their circumstance . on and on the , younsters do contribute to the community by taking out enough time , but not all .
