some people say it 's better to specialize in one specific subject . but i think it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject for two reason . therefore , i agree this statement . there are advantage to specialize in one thing . and also it 's needed in some occupation . a example which make this clear is that a pilot need special knowledge about an airplane and how to fly it . but i find more advantage to study many academic subject . first , i think if thier knowledge are broad , they can have wider view . for instance , a an internet service ha invented and a better transportation system ha developed , you go abroad more frequently . also you become to see many people who have different background . at that time , you have to recognize and understand other culture or history . if you do n't have a wide view , you ca n't understand and it may be a conflict . second , today , t 's really complicated connected society so it 's really important to study several academic subject . for example , if you are a doctor , you must know how new machine work too . if you know about the mechanism of human body , it 's meaningless . these day there are so many high tech machine or robot . so doctor need to know high level phisics too . overall , i think we should have broad knowledge of many academic subject , a we can get wider view . also , because a society is complicately connected .
