in this text i will discus the question `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . at first i have to say that everybody will be old at one day and this is my first argument . when young people think `` i will be old sometime '' they often think on `` but not yet and i have anough time to enjoy my life ! '' . then the young people often do something forbiddin or something `` freaky '' . for example i read about parcour . parcour mean that you run accros a city and always run straight on even if there are car , garage and house . you just climb up the wall and than jump down and that is what many young people do . for older people enjoying life is often spending time with the family , go traviling and reading something in what they are intrested . for example can not everybody remebres his grandmother or grandfather doing something that your parent would have never allowed or something like that ? and most people think that only older people have got the money to travel to hotel ? older people most just enjoy their life . but the young people are often not allowed to do the thing they want to do and often the parent are the reason for that . so the real question is who actually can enjoy his life ? but this would take to long so i will write my oppinion on the question `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' i think that young people enjoy their life more than older people do . i think that , because i often hear story about oler people beeing very ill or having pain everywhere and like this you ca n't enjoy life . young people often do forbidden thing and that give them a kick and the thing with girlfriend is although giving young people a feeling of enjoying their life . so i think young people can enjoy life more than older people do .
