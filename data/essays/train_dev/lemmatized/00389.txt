i am agree with this statement . because nowadays people ha so many convinient tool and living under the good enviroments . tipically in young people like school age , they do n't have to work for to living . so i think , young people nowadays and all age people can take enough time to helping their community . on the other hand , i think a small part of young people dose not have or can not make enough time to helping their community . my conclusion of above line come from the wonder of their life style . a small number of nowadays young people living in so stressful world . for example , pressure of there job norma , working skedules , etc . recentry people become phycometry disease so easily . something of our life style become strange from old time . now , i think we need re-thing about our community and our relatively . most of u forgets our heartfull rerationships and our true meaning of life . i think we can use community relationship for our rehabilitation of emotional problem . so finally i agree again this statement with hope for future .
