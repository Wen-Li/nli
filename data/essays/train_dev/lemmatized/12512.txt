in our time , young people definitely have a real disrepute . they are thought to be violent , drug-addicted . .. all of them would tell you that cliche are completely wrong . do young people give enough time in their community ? we will first see that some young people are completely out of their community . on the contrary we will see that most of them seem to get involved in their society . that is true some young people are in a total disagreement with their community or society . that is why they do not want to be involved in other 's life . so they stay with their only friend and live in a total different world than their parent and their relative . but they are not example for the whole '' young people community '' ... actually , most of them are really involved in other 's life . and i can highlight lot of example : in my highschool there are three or four group [ of twenty people ] who organize some show to get some fund to eventually help some destitute people who live in opalling condition . i am able to cite another example : in my girlfriend 's school , people are giving money to the student to help them to organize a travel into the rwanda to lead this country to go back on a better way than ever [ education , food . .. ] . even if i live in a rich social class [ i am conscient about it ] i do not let the needy people in their dreadful condition and lot of my friend share the same fancy of helping our community . that is why we spend a lot of time in doing a lot of thing for our society a far a it is possible . to sum up there is no denying that some young people are completely cut from their society , torn apart angry and sadness . but most of young people are getting involved in their community to help others and why not the young one who are not included in that community !
