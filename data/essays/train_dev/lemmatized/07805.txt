i think that the greatest part of advertisement give an idea of the product that is not true . industries are only focused on their business , on money and for this reason they are able to do anything . in addition i would like to put in evidence the fact that sometimes annuncements are realized in a particular way aimed to provide not real characteristic or trying to hide other one . clearly i belive that statments are developed only after a deep and long period of studying and reflection about which can be the better advertisement , the proper way of underlying something . moreover i belive that sometimes theese kind of statement do n't make sense . for example , some year ago my family decided to buy a new bike and we considered differents opportunity . after a few , we thought to have the just product for our need . we watched that bike during a programme on tv . it wa fantastic all of my family desired to have one of that incredible bicycle with that cool color . suddenly we decided to phone and we had to wait for two week . we were waiting anxiously , imagining what we could do with the new bike , when it arrived . immediately we tried it . i can not explain how much astoniced and alo worried we began we at the first curve my father broken the wheel . it wa incredible but it happened . in that moment all of u realized why that bike wa so cheap . from that moment i do n't belive in any kind of advertise since i ca n't see and test a product by my self . concluding i would like to suggest to every one to follow my advertisement , in this way we can oblige industry to realize true annuncement .
