cars have become the most impotant way of moving from one place to another since they were invented in the end of the 19th century . in the following essay i want to make clear why i personally believe that the number of car will rise in the future . the first point i want to mention is that we live in a growing society . the world 's population have risen for last decade . and so it will in the future . this is a clear sign for an increasing demand in car all over the world . another really important point is that not only the world 's population rise but also the wealth of people grows . china and india are some of the fastest growing economy around the globe . with an accumulated population of more than 2.4 billion people there is a huge potential of future car owner . if just half the population of these two country will buy a car within the next 20 year the amount of overall car will rise significantly . also an important reason for the assumption of a rising number in car is that there is no real alternative . in most big city like london or new york public transport ca n't even cope with the amount of user at the moment . flying have become cheaper though but it still is n't an real alternative to the car . because it still is too expansive . in conclusion one can say that there are enough sign that clearly point to an ongoing increas in car number . the growing population just make sure that there are enough driver . far more important is that the very strong economic situation of emerging country like india and china provides these potential driver with the money and therefore with the opportunity to buy a car . and because we have no real alternative to the car these people will buy one if they can afford it .
