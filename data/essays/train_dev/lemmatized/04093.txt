first of all the year of young is great year and they will be a great memory when the young get old . the young year is like a fresh flower but will be dead when the young get old . every body doe n't want to be old , every body want to be young . actually the young people ha diffrent property than old people . the young people they are more healthy than old people . the young people also they can run long distance than old people . but the young people they ca n't feel about their young year untill when they get old . which is that wrong . the young poeple they should secure their young and trying to keep it with them untill when they get old . some example for how to secure their young year by playing sport , eating fruit , vegetabils , and doing excersice every single day , etc . secondly iam not agree or diagree yet until i finish from my explaining about the young and old people . actually some of old people they are tired and they have physical problem . these problem what they have from their young year because when they were young they did n't use it correctly . by different reason could be smoking , not that much exercise , or do n't eat good , etc . so the young people they should take care for them self and try to get away from the bad thing that can harm their young . thirdly the young people life could turn to the old people by the reason i mentioned in the second phargraph and also the old people life could be like the young people life . so the young life is not everything unless they take care of it . also if the old people take care of them self they will live better than the young people life . in conclusion i agree about the young people enjoy there life more than the old people unless they take care of it . finally i would say if we take care of our self we will enjoy our life with out any trouble or fact that can stop u from enjoying our life .
