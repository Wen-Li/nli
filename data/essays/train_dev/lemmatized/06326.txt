i agree with this statement the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are alot of benfits some of the this benfit is to know the location , may be i have a qustions and he will tell me about good place . first of all , the tour guide will tell me about all location and direction in the city in this case i will safe time and alot of money . for instance , last summer i went to rome in italy with my family and we have a tour guide to help me and my family to now every thing about rome . second , whene i go any intresting place may be i have qustions for something and the tour guide will be answre me for any thing . for example , two year ago i went to spain in barcelona city and i have a tour guide and we went together to wach a soccer mach in nokamp stadium and i ask a tour guide alt of qustions about this studiom what date is establish ? and he answre me it wa in 1877 . third , the tour guide will take me to good and nice place and he will help me to take a good picture with our friend . for instance , many year a go i went to paris with my frinds and we went to puitfull resturant it have a nice articul inside and me and all my friend we take alot of picture there . after that we went to nice park it wa so cute and pritty . also we take picture there . finally , my advice for all people they may be travel to another country to have a tour guide to help him in many way . for instance , may be he help him to delecius resturant or pretty park in the city . uther way he will answre any diffcult qustions for any thing . and he will make a good help to them .
