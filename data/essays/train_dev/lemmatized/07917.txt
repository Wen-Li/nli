someone has rightly said : `` life is an ice cream , eat it before it melts !! '' the topic that whether young people enjoy life more than older people is really a very interesting one , making someone to think real deep about it . ` enjoyment ' is one factor in life which is not related to age . i think one enjoys life with heart . but , age factor do have an effect on the type and level of enjoyment one can have and no doubt young people are at an advantage at this . firsty , the zest & zeal with which a teenage or an adult will enjoy doing an activity , an older person will n't be able to do the same thing with the same energy level . he will get easily fatigued & loose his interset soon . for instance , on my birthday party , we youngesters hade much fun dancing & playing games . but , on the other hand , my grandparents could n't enjoy that much . they were really tired and went off to sleep soon . secondly , the younger generation is more adventerious & like to discover and explore new ideas , things & places . whereas , aged people think that they have seen a lot of things in life and now they want to enjoy rest of their life peacefully . last but not the least , young minds are more tension free as they do not have any pressure of responsibilities and liabilities . the child in them always looks for an opportunity to enjoy like going for a picnic , restaurant or a movie . whereas , the pressure of responsibilities shouldered upon the older people limits the child within them from doing all these things . to conclude , i would like to say that both youger & older people enjoy their lives in their own differnt ways . while , fun , excitemnet , parties , dance & music means the way to live life for youngesters ; peace , calmness , cherishing old memories , means enjoyment to the old people !!
