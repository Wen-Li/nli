since the first car wa created , the number of car have increased every year . from my point of view that will be the same in the next year . i disagree with the idea that there will be fewer car in twenty year . basically i belive the social demand will going on increasing . city are overcrowed and we tend to emigrate from the cityies to area closed to the city but more calm and sometimes with le pollution that the city one . if we live some kilometre far to the city we will need a transport to go there . there is public transport , but usually it is expensive and le confortable than a car . human love to be confortable even if that damage for instance the environement . because of that , because we love confortability , we will usually choose our own car in stead of the public transport to move ourselfs . secondly , i belive in several year a less-polluted car will be created . people are more concern with the environement than year ago . we think more in the environement , damage , pollution cause , consecuences . in fact , scientifcs are reaserching a way to built car that emited le gas to the atmosphere , a electrical car . if they achive their aim , we will have `` healthy '' car and we will not have moral conflict in us them whenever we wanted . i mean , that maybe now , there are peolple worried about the pollution and because of that he , she doenot take car a much she woukd like . in conclusion , because of the argument aboved mentioned , ( there are other but the time is out ) in my opinion we could see much car running the road that the number of them tha we can see now .
