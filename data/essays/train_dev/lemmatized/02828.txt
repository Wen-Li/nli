i agree with the statement that student have to get the idea and concept than just learning fact . the learning will be more effective , improves their brain work , and the lifestyle can change posetive . first , the learning would be more efficient . students have to think and understand to get the idea and concept . and this process make them think why the fact happen and give them a purpose to learn . in consquence , they will apply that on every learning . for example , in science class , there are many kind of principle student need to understand , and thinking why this principle happen will make the student curious . that way lead the student more participate in class and ha fun in learning . it will be much better for the student to think by himself ( herself ) rather than just being taught the fact and try to remember . also , it will improve their brain working by understand the concept . they learn how to think logically and from that they get good grade at object like math , science , physic , and so on . not only the school grade but also the brain work will improve and the student could be more intelligent . for instance , the one who have always thought about the idea and the concept and the one who ha n't have a big difference in the quality of knowledge . finally , student lifestyle can change . they can get more posetive then they were . thinking logically or hard definitely creates a good mind . and those who do can easily get calm down and get relaxed . especially when they get angry , they can get stop arguing and start to think about solving the problem . therefore , i agree that it is important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . it make the learning more effective , improves their brain , creates a posetive mind . for these reason i agree with the statement .
