i am disagree . i see those advantage of travel with a group using a tour guide : - you do n't have to lost time in move from a place to other place , - you can share your own experience with other people with the same objective , - do n't get worry about get lost or be in dangerous place , - do n't have trouble with the language , - make your day easy , because somebody else is explaining what you have in front of your face . advantages about travel by yourself : - know people from the city , - see more the village , walk next to the people , take the same air , eat the same food , - tried to learn a language using some of their word , - be a traveller where to learn their culture will be the first objective of your travel , - ask where and how to know more about the city . i traveled a part of a group using a tour guide and wa just a bad experience . you are so rigid to any wish or activity you would like to do by yourself , for example : when you are travelling with a group you have all the activity and the time depends of other person . there are travel organized by time where you only get a city go to touristic place and go back . you are travelling a a tourist . i will prefer always to travel a a traveller , that make you more fun in your travel , you know more the city , the people , the culture and brief more the air of the city or place you are visiting . i wa travelling a couple of time in rome , the first time wa with myself , i took a guide then i wa walking around the city and see all the touristic place and eat in italian small restaurant . thats wa wonderful , i meet italian that then invited me to eat to their house to see an italian house , how they were living . with a group you will only listen some experience but not livinng those experience . i like to travel a lot and always i tried to travel with myself or not more to a friend in this way we can enjoy and share our opinion . only we need a backpack , camera and document . .. oh and money will help a lot .
