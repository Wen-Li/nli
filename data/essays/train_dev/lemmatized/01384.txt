i agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' people always try new thing in oneway or the other to make their life more affordable or happier . when a person try in developing something that would make life of society , he will succed in doing so because he have invested considerable amount of time and risk . once succeded , he look for new thing that are pausable for many people . he take this a a spirit or challenge . he brainstrom idea , put to experiment and take the risk . it is a desire to try newthings with risk for the people who were successful in the past . it make them fell happier and drive forward . i would give some personal example to strongly support my above statement . for instance , when i wa working on reasearch project at a pharmaceutical company back in my early childhood , i developed a drug for cancer that helped cure many people . i took the risk in developing the drug knowing the consequence that will have my life . this successful incident led me to try new thing . development of instrument that revolutionized the life of people who have diabetes ( people who can not regulate bood sugar ) . this happened when i wa with pfizer in early 1984 . at time there is no way people can analyse their blood sugar level without going to hospital . it wa really very hard on me to develop and instrument that would one day help everyone to get their blood glucose result instantaneously . i had spent considerable amount of time on this project . if i am right , it took me 10 year to develop this instrument . i felt it is like taking the risk , because i may succed at the end or may be not . i wa very successful in doing so . finally , i would appreciate the people who are successful and try new thing , eventhough knowing the risk in doing so .
