knowladge is very important issue that people should have but how to learn is most important part of the knowladge . in some country like turkey , people are forced to learn to fact rather than understand the idea and concept . i strongly belive that understanding idea and concept is more important to keep your knowladge widely and long time . students usually have a problem with little information in one subject . to have a large information about one specific topic , student should learn how to relate the information about they heard and read . for instanse , two group of student are learning something about the animal name . in one of the these group , student learn fact and memorise that information . the second group are learning where these name come from and the main point of this topic . some time later , if you ask a question about unfamiliar name of animal , first group of people can not explain the topic while the others have some information about the question . secondly , the main problem in learning is forgeting the information that is learned before . this big problem 's only solution is understanding the main point and idea . according to the my teacher the most important point in learning is forgeting the information because of not learning the idea and concept . student can easily learn and memorise the fact , but this knowladge doe n't take too much time . the major point is that if you learn how the topic are related and where that information come from , it can make sense in your brain . after long time pass you will still remember a little information about the subject . as a conclusion , people 's learnning style tale really substantinal role in keeping the information widely and long time and a i said before the best solution is understanding idea and concept . time is getting knowladge and using this knowladge in your work . at this point people may know the topic they studied on , but they drammatiacly do n't know how they use this information .
