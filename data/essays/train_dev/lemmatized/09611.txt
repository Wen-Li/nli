i am with the idea that make student understanding idea and concept should be main aim of education system other than to teach them mere fact . i can determine understanding idea and concept a formation . in my opinion every government in the world is under obligation to ensure it citizen neccesary condition to get education to live a determined life . only right education policy can give them that chance . the most important value someone can get from education is not knowledge on some spesific area or fact about some spesific process ' , but formation to get the knowledge or fact whenever he or she need . formation ha some advantage to fact . first of all , formation change somebody to a learning machine which operates most efficient way . a well equiped person know how to get information and how much of it . he/she can avoids uneccesary one . secondly , fact change but formation doe n't . some new information raplace old one , and only well educated person come to right conclusion when fact changed . lastly , if a person aware of importance of understanding and knowledge , he/she can refresh himself or herself comparing to others . he/she can learnnew method and aquipments more easily . in conclusion i belive the importance of undersatndind and concept behind the fact for the reason i implied above .
