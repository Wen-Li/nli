in our society student were confronted with new knowledge in school , but the question of whether or not it is more important for them to unterstand idea and cencepts instead of learning the fact it is another matter . from my point of view it is very difficult to take side over the other in these argumentation because it seems to me that there are both advantage and also disadvantage . in the following passage i will make my point of view clear . on the on hand , i think that it is in same subject important to unterstand the idea and the concept . in this context i can mention my own experience in my school time . i realized and unterstood mathe just because i really learnt the different way which i could choose to come to a solution . it wa sometimes definitely hard to unterstand . however , it lead to a deeper unterstanding in this area . another argument i can mention in this context is the history class i attended . history contributes so many fact of the past which are not essential to become an educated student . while there are positiv aspect for becoming aware of a good unterstanding of idea , i feel that it is in some subject not necessary to unterstand the whole background of the subject . sport for instance is a very theoretic lesson and the history is not important . consequently , my argumentation make clear that it depends on the topic if a teacher really should confront their student with all the information which are available or if he better focus just on the important and significant one .
