i agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are several reason for saying this . the group tour is not only convineant but also efficent . first of all , i can gain more information about visiting place easlly although i should accept a rule that is made by guide . for example , when i went to japan alone , i wa confused because i could not know that were taking subway or how i can go to hotel . therefore , provided information by a guide is more convineant for my trip . in addition , group tour is not expenssive than along because a tour guide provides useful information . also , i can choose reasonable restaurant and shop . saving my money is more efficent for me because i am able to prepare suvinior for my family and friend . finally , i can make relationship other tourist . it can be useful experience . whereas , if i went to foreign country , i could stay alone . for example , when i went to france in group tour , i have met a friend who is there are reason why i choose a group led by a tour guide .
