i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . this is because the current society seems to promote active community service in many area and encourage young people to get involved in community service by suggesting attractive reward by doing that . to start with , most school requires certain task of community service in school activity . i personally experienced this when i wa in highschool in sydney . i and my friend are regulary sent to certain institution or place that need help . thus we had to spend two hour a week in evey year helping our community . furthermore , it is now became compulsory for all student to spend certain amount of time helping community in order to graduate middle school and high school in korea . therefore , it can be said that young people spend enough time to helping their community whethere they want or not . secondly , community service do help young people enter a college or get a job . most college and company give extra score if a candidate have numerous experience of community service . in other word , more and more young people desire to help their community in order to enter college or get a job . in short , i strongly believe that young people spend enough time to helping community in these day . in fact , it seems that the society force young people to participate in community service more rather than vonluteer themselves . but this phenomenon can not be blamed because young people nowadays seems that they becomes more selfish than ever before . therefore , in which way they contribute to helping community , it is true that young people spend enough time to help thei
