enjoyment is a positive feel that a person relish , and each person ha a different perception of enjoyment and ha a different way to enjoy his life . there can be different people who enjoy harassing people or some some other way which may seem absurd to other people . the term joy is totally related with the personality of the person having it . the statement given is `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . the first thing to state about the statement is that it is not a universally valid statement that absolutely can not be applied to every person . when a person is young and want to enjoy by spending most of his time partying around but ha severe work load and is not able to alot any time for his enjoyment , this mean that , though he is young he is not position to enjoy , while he is still young , and if he think that he will enjoy when he is older , after the retirement then he will not have the physical strengh required to enjoy the way he wanted to enjoy . when the same person enjoys doing his work then he ha all his time to enjoy and will enjoy much more during strenous work time . it may not seem appealing that a person even enjoys the strenous work but it is analogous to the state of a person who dance in a party though it is physically strenous . when it come to the older people some people prefer to live in peace which mean that they can enjoy the state of being peaceful . some may want to achieve what they have lost during their young age , but it may not be possible at that age , when they are physically disabled to do any strenous work . finally i would like to conclude that enjoyment depends on the way an induvidual perceives it and is totally independent of age age factor .
