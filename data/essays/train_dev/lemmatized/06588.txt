i agree with the statement `` sucessful people try new thing and take new risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do '' , because a successful person may have confidence which may not there in unsuccessful person . by this confidence they take risk and also work harder to get success . avoiding pressure is the one of the important factor for a person to acheive success , but the unsuccessful person are in pressure which lead them not to do risk at that period . a successful may ovecome the pressure which is not possible for a unsuccessful person . for example , consider business people , the person who gain profit in bussiness may try to do risk by perfoming different plan . these people can withstand for any type of result that may give profit or loss , but the person who is in loss will never try to do risk a the reason that he may face loss if the plan give negative result which lead the person to huge ammount of loss . a successful person always need more success which lead in my conclusion , it is not possible for a unsuccessful person to do risk a a successful person can do .
