the dominating idea of the 20th century wa to have a wide range of knowledge about a lot f subject area . however , within the new century or with the rising of the automation age we confront with complex machinery which need it own specialist to operate . when we think of in this sense we see that for the new century it is better to have specialist rather than people who know a lot about a wide range of subject . it is the same also in the case of an individual study . the reason why i claim this is that the the science of physic have subjected u to many striking discveries such a the particle quark which is smaller than an electron and we have seen the implication of this discovery in the field of technology . we had machinery which operates with nano technology which is the discovery of the century . this discovery have fund it reflection in a wide range of the area from health to consrtruction . the crucial thing about this technology is that it need highly qualified professionels who are part of a team working on the various different section of the same project . these professional in question spend their time merely on the area of their interest and this enables them to focus on the whole aspect of the phenomenon that they are concerned . in this case the effort is flew into one direction and consequently more quick and effective result are taken from the experiment or the research . the notion of specialize in one specific subject enables resarch group to get better result in the sense that every member of the team ha his or her own space to do the necessary search on his or her topic and can arrange time without having any distraction or worry of completing various task in order to reach a result . to sum up , in my opinion for quick development and effective result team work and to specialize in one topic is necessary . by dividing the subject among a group or basically by canalizeing oneself into one spacific topic success is more guaranteed .
