as i learnt from my own experience , understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact for student . students are not able to face with the fact and it is easier for them to try to understand idea and concept . the first point i would like to make is that there some instinct feeling which make student tend to pay more attention to understanding idea and concept . this is related to student age . most of student who are below 23 have trouble with their feeling . the people under this age are tend to choose the easiest way in order to satisfacte themselves . the feeling control student . not only this feeling determines student preference , but also the place they grew up play a crucial role in choosing preference . for example a person who study at high school is adjusting his behaviour according to what he or she see from his friend . over all , in my opinion people who study at education center such a school , private course , preperation class etc . .. look like more interseting in realizing idea and concept . this is a burning issue and may be fully cleared in the future .
