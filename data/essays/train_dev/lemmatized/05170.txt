some say that sticking to one specific subfect , you can be specialist of one subject . i , however , think it is much better and efficient to have broad knowleadge of many academic subject . if you have many field knowledge , you can ajust society , find what you really want to do , and apply it to your majior . to begin with , you can do well after getting job , if you have broad knowledge . for example , in my company , which is mecanic compay , management is nesessary , since without management , the company ca n't earn money . all of the people in my company is engeneering majior . however , the trend of my company is good , since i have a experience in businessmajior and i 'm a managor of this company . my knowledge about business save my company . nest , if you know a lot of thing , you can find what you really want to do . i wa a business majior befor taking reveral art . however , i canged my majior after taking engeneering i took a a minor , since i wa fasnated by it . i thought engeneering enable u do a lot of thing s like magic . if i 'd just learnd about business , i could n't have find how engeneering fited me . finally , you can apply your knowledge even though it is not related to your majior . in my friend 's example , he reaearchs in biological center and his majior is biology . however his ha great knowledge of mathematics and found the important rule in living creature which is only explaind by mathematics . he cariculated all thing in the world is related each other and that men only extinction of one kind of small creature may threat human 's life . all in all , for these reason , i think that it much more profitable to have wide view of many academic subject . it can help you to adjust any situation in society , find what you can really stick to , and apply your majior .
