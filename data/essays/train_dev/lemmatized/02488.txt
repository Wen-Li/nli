i disagree with the statement that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year from now than there are today . my answer hugely depends on the country about which we are talking about . in a developing country or an under developed country , the number of car increase day by day . as the development take place in these region , more business activity will follow and make the people richer . as a result of this they will depend on the car a a mean of transport rather than on public transport . this fact is evident from the country like india and china where the number of car on a road are increasing day by day , challenging the infrastructure of these country . as the economy of a country develops . more people would prefer to have a convenient mean of transport at their disposal instead of running for the public transport . we can argue that two wheeler might increase in these country in place of the car , but car would always be a safer mean of transport than a two wheeler . so people would prefer car to two wheeler when they have enough money . but in country such a us , uk , australia which come under the developed country category , there can be a fall in the number of car in the future but i 'm not certain . as the number of car is already more in these country , people might be looking at some other mean of transport which is more comfortable than a car . the air network is so developed in these country that people prefer to travel by air rather than take a car when they have to travel long distance . whether it be a developed or an under-developed country , the number of car will always increase provided that the infrastructure keep up with the increasing number of car on road . so the main thing is the infrastructure development ie the road , bridge etc . increasing usage of car also mean that the world major car manufacturing company can look forward to expanding their business and providing employment opportunity to many people . so , the number of car are set to increase in the future a the economy around the world continue to improve .
