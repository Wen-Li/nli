i agree broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . when i wa a child , my parent want me to study a lot of thing . for example , except that i study my lesson , and must play the piano , learn dancing and ride a horse . they want me to become a broad knowledge people . they think there are three reason . the first . when you grown up , you may make some people or recognize a little person . different people you should speak different word . so you should ues different knowledge . if you just know a specific subject . you can not play with some different kind of people . you do not know what you should said and what your some different friend want to hear . for example , my friend want to make a friend that is a america girl , . but my friend doe not understand english , so at last my friend doe not make a friend with a america girl . the second and the important . if you know broad knowledge of many academic subject , you can have more chance of job than specialize in one speciflc subject . because you know different knowledge you can work in different envieroment and recognize different people even increasing your another knowledge . for example , if you know english , you can work in u.s.a or england and a lot of country . if you just know chinese you may work just in china . so you lose a lot of chance . so i think better to have broad knowledge of many academic subje
