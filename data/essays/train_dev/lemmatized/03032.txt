most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . this is extremely true in our modern day because the competition in the market is so high that business are willing to do anything to sell their product . i agree with this statement because i personally have bought many thing based on their advertisement but wa shocked later on by what i bought . this is a successful way to make the consumer loose trust in the producing company because when cheat and deceit come into the issue there is no way a person can depend on the seller . the market is full of other option so the buyer is not limited to this specific place especially after being treated unrespectfully . i , personally , have an issue with trust and when i put my trust into something i expect to get what i ask for with honesty and purity . as soon a i realize that i have been tricked then that is the last time i buy anything from that place . i do not think that i am the only one that think this way because if someone is willing to put their money into something than this thing better be worth it . whenever money is involved the topic becomes more sensitive because money is something that people work hard to try to earn and they will never just blow it away on something useless , unless they have a lot of it , then thats a different story . on the other side , though , the purpose of advertising anything is to make it more appealing to the people and by giving it a little `` push '' of superiority make it attract more people . so you ca n't really take it against them because that is their goal . although there is a difference between tricking someone into something and convincing them that this is the best product . if a person is deceived into buying something than he is n't very happy especially if this thing wa not really worth it price . but if a person ha satisfaction from what he bought because he wa convinced and appealed by it then he will not realize any default in the product because of his over joy with it . this issue can be argued in two different perspective and i do n't nessecarily think that any of these two point are wrong because they are both legitimate . my stand on this issue is that i do n't mind being convinced into something but i would never tolerate being tricked into it . faking something and misleading someone is the worst thing to me and i seriously would never put up with it .
