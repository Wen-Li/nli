for the past four year i have been the director of a group of misionary adolescent that help impoverished community in the caribbean , and south/central america . as a part of the program , we developed a cultural dimension to it . we have traveled all over the americas , the caribbean and europe . i have been the planner of the excursion , trip and tourism . in the process , i have learned that the best way to travel is without a tourguide . usually the tourguides tend to plan and direct an excursion or trip based upon their own interest . therefore , you 're completely attached to the person 's caprice and circumstance . tourguides exist a consecuence of the capitalist society and are n't neccesary . they are part of economic process and do n't consecuently appeal to cultural knowledge and interraction . for example , i once took a tour , led by a person who told u that he ha been working for the company for almost twenty year `` [ this meant that he had a vast knowledge on the theme he wa exposing ] '' . when i asked him a question i already knew but wanted to confirn my hypothesis about the tour-guides , he exposed an irrelevant answer on the theme , and redirected the consersation . on the other hand , the tour wa programed to visit all the shopping mall and and place that seemed to have some kind of economic dimension . the tour itself appealed the personal interest of the person who organized it . i have organized all the tour i have done in my life . i jhave learned the best way to plan a trip is to do it yoursel .
