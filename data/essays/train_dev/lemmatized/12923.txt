on the one hand , it 's of course important to have a broad knowledge on many subject because with a broad general culture it 's possible to feel more concerned about more subject , to exchange different point of view with many people because the morre the culture is high , the more you can share conversation with different people . a high general culture allow pople to develop theirself , to feel more secure when they are talking about something . .. but on the other hand , having a wide culture about only one subject ha the advantage that people know on what they are talking about . in some profession like archeologist , historian , physician . .. the people have a huge knowledge on their subject which can be very impressive . furthermore , in some profession like doctor , plane driver . .. it 's important that these people know what they are doing and they know their job by heart . .. also , we can remember famous people such a einstein , freud , mozart . .. because they almost specialized their life on something , and they allow u to improve with their knowledge , teaching u new thing that they could'nt have done if they did n't spend a lot of time on it . my opinion is that i prefer specialize on a specific subject because i think knowing a few thing on a lot of subject could be superficial knowledge . but of course if i specialize on something it doe n't mean that i 'll have no interest in other subject . for example for me it 's very important to know what happens in the world , to have interest in history but i specialized myslef since a long time on guitar . but i think it 's a pleasure to know a lot about something , to be able to argue on a subject because you know it well . but of course , to specialize on a subject , it ha to be a passion .
