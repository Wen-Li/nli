it is a matter of fact that doing only what you already know how to do it 's a safe ground to moove on . most people prefer to live a quiet life , without risk , and trouble , while trying new thing implies a certain degree of uncertainty . at the same time it is true that the contemporary world is extremely competitive and being a successfull person is everything but easy . to be successfull you need someone who notice you , and give you the opportunity to show what you can do . specially at the very beginning , it is hard to be noticed among all the others . trying new thing is a good way to avoid easy comparison . how can someone judge you on something which is completely new ? on the basis of which criterion you can be considered either better or worse han someone else ? sometimes competing on a complitely new groud ha a lot of adavnatges . i am deeply convinced that being successfull everyday mean basically being able to be different , without fear of being far away from the avarage . a successfull person need to be brave , in order to dare more than the rest of his competitor . you need to have a great self confidence in order to take the risk to fail . i think someone reach the real success when he ha no more fear to make mistake . everyone learns from mistake , it is a kind of natural rule . most mistake provide you with the right answer to another question , and this is the way life go on . in addition , i think doing only thing that you already know how to do is an acceptable way of living for oldish people . sometimes , when you get old , you are scared by all the new challenge of the world around you . old peole most time are weak . illness can affect the general mental condition of people , pushing them to be scared by everything around them . the problem is that the same attitude is generally widespread among young people a well . it is probably coming from modern culture , and the contemporary view of waht life is . the main issue shoul be what life could be , instead . i do n't understand why most young people living in big town always seem to be so bored of living . thet do n't even try to be successfull people . they simply accept to live an ordinary life , avoiding the risk to fail .
