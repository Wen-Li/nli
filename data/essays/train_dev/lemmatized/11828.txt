over the past few year , the growing infatuation of today 's world withs car , and in a bigger scale , with all sort of very useful - yet very polluting - technology , have been relentlessly denounced . most people fear the result of such a phenomenon on our environment , and in the meantime , statistic display that car 's owning is still the epitome of wellness in our modern society . yet , contrary to the prevailing opinion , some pundit predict the end of the car era ( at least in the way we know it ) in the year to come . i definitely side with them on this issue . first , there is no denying that new device are promoted in order to stop hurting the environment . worries are soaring , owing to the depletion of the ozone layer , the melting of the icecap , the increasing quantity of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere , the rising of sea level . facing these phenomenon , scientist tried to find new alternative to the use of car . the latter would be replaced for instance by none-polluting machine , like electric car . besides , we are more and more urged to use others way of transport ( i.e bus , or bicyles ) . moreover , with the success of cheap flight , passenger are sometimes more inclined to fly , than to use their car , a far a large distance are concerned . in a world , we may say that at first sight the car industry is flourishing . however prospect for the future do not support this view : given the huge number of problem entailed by pollution ( mostly caused by car ) , many alternative have been launched , in order to cope with today 's new challenge . even if those project are n't all efficient by now , i clearly stand fast in my conviction that in the next twenty year , their efficiency will be enhanced by new scientific discovery .
