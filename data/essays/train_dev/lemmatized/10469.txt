i disagree with what the statement say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i have three different point of view between traveling in a group and traveling individually . first , if you travel in a group led by a tour guide , of course you do n't have to plan for anything because tour guide know everything what to do or where to go . it save you time and you do n't have to get stress from planning for trip . however , when i go somewhere i do n't know very much , i 'd like to research first and study about the place i will go and the language they speak there . in this process , i will decide where to go and what i want to see during my own research . also if you study the language of the country you will go , you do n't have to rely on one tour guide to buy something or to order food . while you are planning for trip , you already earn so many thing and experience . second , if you are with the group , you have no choice for what to eat . you have to eat certain food the tour guide already set up for the group . when you travel , you want to eat the traditional food from local restaurant previous traveler recommended . i am sure tour guide will take you to some nice place to eat , but you have no choice eat something else . even for the food , i want to research what is the most popular food in that country and i will figure whether i can eat this food or not . if not , of course i will look for another place to go . for the last , traveling is all about the experience the new thing from new world at least i think . i do n't want to have a same experience what other people have . with group touring , you have to go same place and take a picture from certain place like others . whole group will have same memory from the trip . i want to build my own memory from expereincing the new world .
