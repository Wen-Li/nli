i do not agree with the statement that succesful people are taking risk and try new thing rather than doing what they know how to do well . i admit that a lot of invention and business concept have succeeded , because they were highly innovative . probably most people would have doubted that they would be profitable . on the other hand so many people try to develop new idea about being different and fail . most of today 's idea , that actually are pretty good , do not turn out making it inventor rich . so generally speaking taking risk more often lead into frustration and poverty whereas concentrating on your strength is more likely to lead you to succes . as an example i would like to tell you about a freiend of mine who had a great idea about a new sportsbrand . being an expert in marketing with year of experience and a wife who wa working in the clothing industry he wa very confident that his idea of a local brand would succed . he took the risk of getting into the new business of producing stuff he never had done before . dealing with all the new field that his business involves he wa not able to fulfill everything needed to develop a succesful brand . if he would have stuck to his root and would have stayed in marketing only , he would have been better off for sure . in conclusion i would say that sticking to what you know best is better for most people than being too risk taking . in my opinion learning from people who already are succesful is the best thing one can do . by that you can follow in someone footstep and , if done right , succed in a much easier and le risky way than someone who want to try out new thing .
