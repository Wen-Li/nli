everyone want to know about the world around him or her for the better understanding of different cultural back groundsand also to explore new thing . this unquenchable desire of humanns not only lead him travel to different place on the earth but also to other part of the universe . in the fast moving era everything in the world is at constant change , especially when it come to time . having proper time table is the most valuble key for better life . so inorder to save my precious time i surely go to trip with tour guide . if we go to new place , it better if we have any local person who call tell u about the history of that place . mostly local know better than the scholar who did reaserch on that place . because they will get all the information from their elder . not only that the tour guide can also take visitor to different part of the place from forest to rich green agricultural area . in this way visitor can explore from wild animal to small beautiful local bird . secondly , tour guide can show more place in le time . in other way it may take somuch time . i am saying this with my own experience . in my college day we visited a place called delhi . first we started at one end of city then we went to other end to see one historical place . then we remembered the fact that we forgot one most beautiful place which we supposed to see in the place where we started . because of that we extended our vacation to one more day . this is not only waste of time but also money so it is always good to go for trip with tour guide . in this way we can enjoy the trip with out doing much reaserch about place . if few people can share the expences in the process of hiring the tour guide this is also cost effective .
