as a young man ithink that young peopel nowadayes do noy give enough time to helping their community , from my experians i my self dont give time to help the community and i dont feel that is a thing that i have to do . young peopel nowadays taught from there parent that they dont have to help , and that they have to work hard to make themself better and that is it . most of young peopel dont have time to help community becaus they are spend all the time for themself a they taught so it is not their fault to act like that . another reason for not helping the community is that we think ( including me a young one ) that the company that support the community is doing every thing and the communitie dont need any thing from u . in the end peopel can change and young peopel also they just need some one to show them the way so they can help , like the teashers in school or advertysment in the different medium like tv , news paper , radio , this will help them yo understand that their is other thing need them and that is not every thing for the money .
