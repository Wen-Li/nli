in this world , it is better to have a lot of knowledge especially in acedmeic subject for example taking more than one subject or concentarting on more than one subject in school for your next year in the university . i agree in taking more than one academic subject for many reason . one of the reason is that when you take more than one academic subject you will have more knowledge and more idea and these ofcourse would let you be accepted by many company and so you will have a better future for you , when you marry and when you get kid , if take one subject you will have le idea and le knowledge and so le experinece and so you will be le accepted by company and so will not have that good future . second reason is that when you take more than one subject you can enter many course in the university and ofcourse you will be able to study what you want so having more and more knowledge and information . when taking one subject you would not be able to study a wide range of subject and so you waould face aproblem is that you would face aproblem when appllying to wok and so you would affect your future . third reason of why having a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize on one subject is that most subject and material are related to each other and so when you concentrate on one subject only leaving alot of subject that you did not take say in school for example you would face a big problem in university or in college is that you will see that most subject relay on each other even if it wa a small percent and so would face problem in what are you studying and so you would have a big probabilty to fail in what you are studying which make your future and life affected especially if you fail , but if you took alot of subject this will help you in your university and so you will not fail and your future can be saved , and even if u you fail , you still have alot of knowledge and so you can do your own small bussiness which would save your life and future . there are many reason but they need alot of explination , both have their advantage and disagvantage but for me i agree on studying more than one academic subject and so this would make me feel safe and comfortable .
