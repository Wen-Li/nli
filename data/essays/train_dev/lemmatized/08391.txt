it is a very common idea among young people that they are more enjoying life than older people , especially their parent ! but are you happy only when you have fun ? i do no think so . i belive that at each stage of your existence you `` enjoy life '' in a different way . first , when you are young , you have no child . one can consider that , a he ha no constraint such a feeding his offspring , he is more enjoying life . but i think that i will be deeply happy when my child will grow up and become an autonomous human being . at that that time , despite all the constraint , i think that i will `` enjoy life '' . in addition when you are young , even if your entertain yourself playing tennis for example , you can not do everything you want . you have to respect your parent rule . being an adult allow you to choose your activity and experience new leisure . for example my mother used to prevent me from swiming because she wa afraid of water . i discovered this sport quite late but now i really enjoy it . moreover , when you are older , you start appreciating new activity . when i wa young i found highly bizzare the idea of watching painting for hour . but now i am fond of art exhibition ! in the meantime i learned to enjoy life in a different manner . being older also enable to have a professional life . you can manage to reach great achievement and be financially rewarded for it . when i received my first income , i wa really happy ! the idea of making money just using my brain still thrill me . it is a way of enjoying life that i never thought about when i wa in my early age . in a nutshell i think that being happy and enjoying life is not a matter of age . it is more an ability to enjoy the best moment and learn from the worst . i hope being hppy with such a philosophy of life !
