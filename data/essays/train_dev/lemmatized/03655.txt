eventhough a tour guide can provide the traveller detailed and additional information about a place , i believe that the best way of travelling is in a group of people that self manage themselves . to me , travelling represents one of the finest and happiest moment of my life . it allows me to free my mind from the everyday routine through the discovery of a new country , different people , social custom and behavior . for this reason , i like to organize my journey by myself , leaving open a lot of possibility during the travel instead of planning the package `` ex ante '' with a tour guide . furthermore , nowadays it is very easy to obtain relevant information about a specific journey . travellers guide and the incredible amount of information contained in the internet can defintely help filling the informational gap of a traveller without hiring a specific person from the place . in my opinion travelling is a constant process of discovery the reality that sorrounds me . this is a learning by doing process in which every mistake lead to a potential unexpected and positive situation that otherwise would n't had occured . on the other hand , the presence of a tour guide would inevitably make the journey very precise and strictly scheduled without allowing for the possibility of error and unexpected situation . this combination of failure and success make me feel part of the place i am visiting and , at the same time , it give me the incredibile opportunity to get in touch and talk with many people . the contact with local is crucial in the discovery process of the travel and the presence of a tour guide would undermine a lot the ability to interact with other people . for all these reason i strongly believe that traveling alone or with a group of good friend led by themselves is the best way of enjoying and taking advantage of the full potential of a journey .
