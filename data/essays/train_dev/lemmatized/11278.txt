many people say that a student 's main job is to learn facts-sometimes by heart . it is true that if a student doe not learn his lesson he wo n't be able to understand his next class or get a good grade on his test . but is learning everything ? is it enough to fully succeed a a student . can a math-student pas his exam only by learning his theoremes , definition and demonstration ? learning is the basis for a student . one time , i had so much work to do and paper to hand out that i did not learn my lesson for the next class . and i wa lost the next period ! this experience enabled me to realize how concentrated you are and how well you understand the next class when you learn fact . when you learn something you make an effort and then ask yourself question about a fact if you ca n't fully understand it . but some people learn their lesson in a mechanical way and i disagree with this type of organization . when student learn by heart only their short-term memory is working which mean they only remember thing for a short time-period . when i learn my maths-definitions i repeat them to myself but try to understand them . this theory work because i have observed that when i do n't fully understand a definition i do not remember it in the long term . when you understand or try to understand a lesson you ask yourself question about the topic which make you want to know more and help you develop extra-skills . students who want to understand idea and concept ca n't be inaccurate in their work and develop organization and clarity skill . in conclusion we are faced with the fact that both learning and understanding are useful method for a student . to be totally efficient a student ha to learn and understand .
