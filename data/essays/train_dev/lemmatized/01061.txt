it is true that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there seems a lot of reseons , i think two reason are the most resonable ; short of time due to studying and selfish mind . first , these day young people are usually student or rookie . they have to study and work all day long and even during weekens , so they can not pay attention to their commmunities . moreover their parent urge them only to make good grade in schoos and make a success in company rather than mulling over the ploblems of society or finding the way to contribute to community a member of the socities . second , the young people are being raised in affuluent circumstance these day . they are usually the only child or have just one sibling in their home , so they do n't know the poverty or difficulty of others , and they don ' t konw how to help others . almost all parent raised their chidren a `` price or princess '' . accodigly , they are accustomed to be treated like that , which make them have selfish mind . in short , a i mentioned above , lack of time to look around the society and selfish mind make them not give enough time to helping their community .
