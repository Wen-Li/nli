technology ha revolutionized our life i.e. the way we live , the way be preceive . . everything ha changed with the advent of modern innovation . we have become accustomed to this technology in our everyday life be it a referigerator , washing machine , radio etc . in fact it is impossible to think life without these thing . modern technology ha given u pace . it ha developed modern mean of transport for fast movement . the car , train and areoplanes etc all are gift of technology cars . this is a quite familiar name in day to day life . in fact every middle class home owns atleast one car , car ha become more of a necessity in today 's life . moreover , to a some degree it also ha become a sort of status commodity . but that doe not hide the imprtance of car in in our day to day life . in life where time is everything car are one of the fastest mean of transport . cars are required at family outing . thus car is an indispensable part of our day to day life . but , although technology ha aided u , it is also leading to dangerous result . take for an instance , technology ha made living more comfortable resulting in decline in health problem and cosequently increase in population . thus this large population is a large pressure on our resource . our oil resource are depleting at a rapid rate and perhaps be exhausted in another thirty year or so . with their exhaustion , car , which run on petrol , will be of no use to u thus declining resource ha forced u to look for alternative which employ better utilization of these resource . thus the railway , tram come into picture . in fact twenty year will now , there will be fewer car in use then there are today . with the scarcity of petroleum product , it would become quite difficult to afford a car at that time . the people will go for cheaper mean of transport . now a day people ha become aware of this thing and already have started using public transport more often . thus the car purchase ha fallen . in twenty year time the existing car would be disposed off due to the finishing of their utilization period . this will also see an decline in number of car . thus it ha been clearly proved in the passage that with declining petroleum product , car quantity would fall in the time period to come
