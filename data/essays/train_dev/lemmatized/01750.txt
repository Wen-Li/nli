the argument proposed compare two completely different way of thinking life . for someone a fully way of living implies taking some risk . only facing risky choice people can improve their life status and their own satisfaction . on the other hand , many other people think - and consequently organize their life - to minimize or avoid any kind of risk . this type of people attribute a great value on safety . my personal feeling and approach about this matter is flexible . i think there is not an absolute best way of playing life but it depends strictly on the attiutde of the people . by the way , in my opinion trying new think is a wonderful experience and an important factor of human growth . first of all , i think that a wide range of experience get the people richer . if i compare my point of view , my culture and my feeling with different one , my mindset could be more open . this is the reason why i travel a lot and i have decided to work for some period of my life abroad . i think it is very limited to pas all our life in the native village . probably it is a safer choice but absolutely le interesting ! second , if no one take risk in this world and try to experiment something new the progress doe not exist . in a world like this we could not appreciate all innovation . i 'm thinking in particluar about technology improvement that in last decade have simplfied and improved dramatically our society and our life . we could find another example on pharmaceutical research industry . if pharmaceutical industry continue to produce the same medicine and doe not spend a lot of money on research there is any possibility to increase our life expectation . risky choice of scientist and manager in pharmaceutical have delivered the possibility to do more , feel better , live longer for many people .
