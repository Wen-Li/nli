young people enjoy life more that older people do ? to answer this queistion is importnat to take two point of view , the first one is to answer why young people enjoy life , and then answer why old people enjoy life , and finally i will see who enjoy more life , young or older people . i think that younger people enjoy life , becouse they are in an age that everything is knew , they are exploring the world , they are dreaming , they are building their goal , is wonderfull moment of life . is when people started to grow up , and during this process they understan and respond many question that only living can answer , is a stage when you can make a mistake , and is ok becouse you are learning , no one is going tu judge you , is part of learrning . i think that i am in a great moment of my like , i feel and i am young , and if i take my own experience i can said that i realy enjoy my life , i had dificulties in my life but wa just part of it , sometimes you need to felt and then satnd up and go on , thats life . by the other hand , i think that older people also enjoy life , because no matter the age that you have you wll always learnig , and in this point of your life you have more experience , so you dont have to worried about if you are going to make a mistake , becouse you know that if you make it everything will be ok . for example my grand ma she wa and old lady , but she always enjoy life like she wa a kid , she never felt old , she always wa with energy , she wanted to do all the thing that she didn , t do when se wa a child so she enjoy every minute of her like . know she is death , but she teach that life in only one and you have to enjoy it , no matter your age . the answer of the question about who enjoy more life , is both : joung and older people . joung because you are exploring the world and old becouse you are enjoing all what you have explore .
