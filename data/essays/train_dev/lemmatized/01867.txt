because i am not an old person yet , also i do n't live with my granparents and i do n't have close person who is old , so i just can imagine how old people 's life will be . or i could get information from watching tv or reading book . to enjoy life , i think it should be only one thing to do . have friend ! this is the most important thing people should do when they want to enjoy their life . this dose n't matter either the person is young or old . so i disagree with the sentence . having a conversation with friend will make my life much more enjoyable . i always feel that ` friend ' are my treasure . in other word , friend will be the key to enjoy life . when i be alone by myself , i need to enjoy just by myself which is very hard to do . if i am with my friend , i could laugh saying joke or having girl talk . also , i could reduse stress having a conversation or complaining about the problem i have . having le stress in life will make our life enjoyable , a well . therefore , i think we should have at least a little stress in our life to spend time more valuable . when we do n't have stress at all , we ca n't understand the people who had stress or we will waste time for not having a stress . but when we have to much stress , we ca n't focus on the thing we should do or need to do . having a good meal will also make our life better . when people get hungery , especially me , we will get angry and wo n't have enough space in our feeling to enjoy something . for having a happy life , our stomache should be happy like u . having a hobby is important like others . i love to play soccer and i 've been playing for more than ten years-including few year when i did n't . this hobby make me very happy and satisfied with the life i have . the most important thing of having a hobby is that we could be coneccted with others who ha a same interest . i had many friend from the same soccer team , which make my life enjoyable because of the first reason . maybe when i get old , it might be impossible to play soccer , but still i can talk about soccer with my friend ! there is no reason that old people wo n't have an enjoyable life like youngers . we could have same great life if we try to enjoy ourselves . i think the people who are not enjoying their life are not trying to enjoy . i am enjoying my life-following the reason i think i should do to
