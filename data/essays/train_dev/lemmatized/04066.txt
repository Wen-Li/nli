the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do is a fairly debatable statement . my opinion on the same is not in favour of the statement . i am of the view that one can not measure how much life can be enjoyed or life is being enjoyed by any one . some one appropriately said `` enjoyment is not a commodity , it is the excitement of life we all live for '' . enjoyment mean different thing to different people , different peaople dirive enjoyment out of different thing . a younger person who is more outgoing enjoys by going partying or meeting people at social event . a sport fan enjoys by watching his favourite team winning a championship . a young girl enjoys shopping for hour with her friend , whereas an older person derives pleasure and enjoyment by wathcing his/her grandchild playing in his/her lap or talking to his child about their successus or achievement . different people have different way to enjoy life and everyone is entitled to this right . so we can not justify that older people do n't enjoy a much a younger people do . older people have their on way to enjoy life equaly a much a younger people . with age only the speed of one life decrease but the spirit of life remains the same . with age only the amount of activity decrease not the frequency of joyful moment . this statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' in my opinion is a superstition . one which should not be encouraged . we should not forget that these very old people were once young themselves and enjoyed life the same way a younger people today . the younger people of today will only realize that older people have different way of enjoyment when they are in their shoe . untill we do n't experience the otherside ourselves we are can not make a fair judgement .
