in my opinion it is definitely preferable to have a broad knowledge of several academic subject to specializing in one single area . the most important aspect to me is the variaton in topic which one specific subject can not supply . if - regarding the academic - i had only one topic with which i would have to spend my entire working time i would eventually get fed up with the subject , a variation is the key to keeping me interested . specialization limit your point of view whereas a broad knowledge of different subject enables you to understand different people with different academic background . furthermore specializing in only one topic make it le probable to meet new people with different background at all a you will not leave your main field of interest very frequently . broadening your skill also might have some positive effect on your social environment . you might find more friend and have more success with the other sex a you will appear more interesting not being a ` freak ' who is only interested in one single thing but being able to look like a person with different facettes and diverse interest . in discussion with collegues , friend or other person at you will certainly have a le harder time being educated in more than one topic a you might easily find argument and example in your various subject . to summarize all the mentioned point make it by far more attractive for me to gain knowledge in not only one subject but many different , although one should try no to have too many interest , a superficial knowledge in many field of mind also will not bring you very far .
