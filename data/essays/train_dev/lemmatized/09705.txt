humans are curious by nature . we tend to know more and explore the area which we are unsure about . curosity in turn , cause new invention and thus improves our living style a we can see in the case of developing technology . in my opinion , risk are a part of new invention and it help u knowing more about the unresolved mystery that exists like the part of neuroscience still under development . risks open new path for development . people working for nasa , take several risk of trying out new thing which were never tried before . landing on moon , launching rocket with human being in it to get an exact picture of space . nasa is at it peak of success and it 's much more because of it ability to try out new thing . trying out new thing add adventure to life . without taking any sort of risk life would be like a stagnant pool of water with steady result or rather no change in the usual life style . risks are a little dangerous a the word itself might suggest but it doe open up new dimension for human to work on and explore more . risks are not to be scared from . if taken in limited and sensible amount , it will have more positive effect than negative . nasa doe n't take a step without a scientific background to the information it work on . they calculate and prepare for the worst and achieve succesful result exploring new fact about space science . there is a well known saying called , `` no risk , no gain . '' it emphasizes on the fact that risk are a part of exploration process . without risk there wont be much to learn new thing from . almost every job ha some component that provide the employee with certain challenge to deal with , which might involve taking some risk or doing something new out of the usual practise .
