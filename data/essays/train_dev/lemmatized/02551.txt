my knowledge and my personal experience give me the reason to agree with the statement . second my knowledge because it 's true that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community because young people do not have time to do it . in fact , in the third millenium , the time is a very big and important source . this concept born principally for the business world . the famous statement `` the time it is money '' confirm my opinion . from the business people to the young people nowadays there is a very small difference for management time . as a very business man , the child must employ his twenty-four hour : school , sport and ... television ! ( social study say that a child watch-in medium - more of four hour of television at day ) . last but not least , the friend . where is the time to give to helping community ? there is not ! second my personal experience i agree with the statement that say that toung people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . when i wa i child i like give my time to helping my community , obviously second my personal skill . nowadays i am twenty five year old and i have not got time for helping my community . first because my work do not give me more two free hour at day . second because i am married and i have got a son . i must help my wife in my free time ! however i like help my community and i hope to achieve it . in my opinion the solution og the problem is in the manage of the time in particular of th efree time .
