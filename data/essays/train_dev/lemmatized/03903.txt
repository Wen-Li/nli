`fake it until you can make it ' is one of the main idea i try to keep in mind in my life especially when i need to make decision . i believe a person should be able to take risk and try new thing in order to be successful . if one 's limit itself to want it already know how to do well it ha no chance to evolve . for me having this attitud is like taking the highway to been bored . life ha to be a game or at least a challenge . how often do you realize that you just did something you could not imagine you were able to do ? this behaviour is for me the simple key of success , it is what make the difference betweem two evenly skilled people . in order to enhance one 's chance to have this positive attitud , i would even recommand to add an acting course to highschool ' core curriculum . it would help student to overpass their limit and explore their complex nature . another characteristic that is necessary to access this behaviour is self confidence . you need to trust yourself and believe in your capability to adapt yourself and learn quickly . but of course this behaviour is successful only to working people . you will never be able to make it if you do not work and just keep faking it . furthermore it could eventually destroy all you have done by discrediting you . if you not not plan to work , you should better stick to what you know how to do well . finally this behaviour is leading you to success only if you aim for something you are capable of .
