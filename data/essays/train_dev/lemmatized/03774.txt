one can undoubtedly say , that everybody in our society strives for success . but what is the underlying principle leading to success ? some people claim that successful people are innovative , take risk rather than continuing working on what they already know well . in my opinion , this statement is true for many case . people who try new thing or take risk are more willing to explore their boundary . this make it more likely to come accross discovery and idea that are revolutionary and lead to and outstanding performance . also , these people are usually more adaptable than their collegues who prefer to stick to their old pattern and spend their entire life in an office , performing the same task everyday . risky people are usually at the forefront of their field , whereas people who do what they know well , will always lag behind . people who are open-minded perceive change in their environment not a a threat , but a an opportunity and are able to take these chance to revolutionise an area . furthermore , people who are willing to take risk can not usually be discouraged easily by concerned friend or family when trying to set a very far-fetched idea into practice . a classic example of how being innovative lead to huge success is the story of a man working for a computer firm . this company had been specialised on the production of huge computer for a long time . this employee had the idea to build portable computer ( i.e. laptop ) . however , his idea wa rejected by his bos . as a consequence , the employee resigned from his job and set up a company who built laptop . as we know today , his idea had been a huge success - and the company still suffers from being reluctant to adopt to this change . critics on the other hand may say that there is no recipe to success . just being bold and trying new thing doe not necessarily guarantee a successful outcome . also , moving too far away from one 's initial area of study mean that a lot of time must be invested in learning new technique and theory , a many field require a substantial background knowledge in order to work in them . this , indeed , is a valid argument . however , a mentioned previously the attitude of people who are prepared to take risk is much more likely to lead to an outstanding discovery . clearly , there is no guarantee for success , but a the previous example have illustrated , only people who are willing to take risk and search for the unexplored are likely way to become very successful .
