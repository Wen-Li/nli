in our daily life , more and more entermaint place come up , most of them are for young people . so there is a debate also coming up we have to face . young people enjoy life more than older people do , is it true ? i have answer already . in fact , when a youny adult and an old man choise the way to enjoy their life , there is something different between them . the young people have enough energy to play , and even more some sport game with risk , like skatting . it is a pity that old people have not such energy to play crazily a the same a young adult . they can not drink too much because their liver are easily hurt by alchol than young guy . what 's more , in many aspect , old men are not able to enjoy like young one . i believed , when many people were young , some gamble thing often happened in our life . with the time flying , le and le risk would be taken when we are becoming older . i think the reason why that can happen is that the passion is lost with the age . i think sometimes , the gamble thing can bring u more passion and more happiness . unforturnetly , the old people doe not think so . they think safety is more important than anything , which make thing faint . in morden today , more and more entertamant place are designed for young people . why ? because the wise company catch the chance to attract young people , not older people , which represents young people can bring more economic development for the society than older people . that 's also why young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are abound life for young guy . in a word , i agree about that young people enjoy life more than older people do . whatever any aspect , young guy can feel more happiness than older one a the result of having a more younger heart .
