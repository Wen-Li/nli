education is a perfect amalgation of understanding of learned fact and their application . this is the essence of education . no theory state education is learning fact blindly . if learning fact matter a parrot can speak learnt rubbish. a lot better than a man can . it is understanding of the idea and their application which make a good student and distinguish him from an ordinary graduate . education doe not mean learning fact by heart or reading lit of text book . i wa taken by surprise when i accidentally noticed painting by small kid . one of them wa named ` flowers ' and the child drew blue colour for rose and black colour for sunflower . later when i wa going to my house i noticed a streeboy smaller than that age drawing flower in the ground using chalk piece and colouring them perfectly . not all thing are taght in the book , some are taught by life . personal experience value more than reading ` rose is red ' . if sir issac newton have had learnt the fact there would be no ` theory of gravity ' . innovative thinking add a lot to the vision of understanding fact . learn trade rather than remember what is trade . if albert instein would have learnt the fact that atom ha electron , the fact go to the next generation a atom ha electron ; but because he understood what is atom we today enjoy atomic energy through theory of relativity . if mere learning of fact is education , then that education fetch nothing but only useless graduation degree to our back . if we understand fact then we know how to manipulate the lnowledge we know for a better work . with the modern busy life many dont have time to understannd idea . what all they have is time to learn fact . if learning fact blindly is education then that education is useless . if a student learns what a machine is and ha never seen a machine or never seen a machine at work , he only remembers the formula of working of the machine and nothing else . in practical life he is not more than a fool or a numbskull .
