it is a very important question , but the answer is not very simple . the number of car in use change due to several reason . 1 ) the prices of oil ( gasoline ) in the world . if the price of oil in the world will be higher , then people will try to use the public transportation , because it will be cheaper than using the car . 2 ) the economic growth in diffirent country will increase the number of car in use . 3 ) the growth in population . 4 ) the developed infrastrcture constructing for public transportation such a : trains , subway train , electric train , etc . .. 5 ) the effort to make the enviorment le polluted . the abovementioned reason effect the number of car in use in the future . while someone may say , that the enviorment issue ( pollution ) will be a very important problem in the world , and it will be solved by reducing the use of car , the other will say that this would be right for the country with a strong economic basis , but not for the third world country or for the non developed country . these country may face an economical growth in the next twenty year , and therefore it 's citizen will use more car , in particular if there will not be a convenient public transportation system for use . in addition , these country may invest there major effort in the future in increasing the economical growth , instead of handling enviormental issue . i believe , that the use of car in the strong economy based country will be reduced in the next twenty year , and that is because of : 1 - the develpoed public transportation system they have . 2 - high price of the oil in the world . 3 - enviormental issue , that will be very important to be solved by reducing the pollution of the enviorment . 4 - the minor increase of the population itself in these country . on the other hand , i am not sure that the use of car in the third world , and develpoed country will be reduced in the next twenty year , but it may happen afterwards .
