for student to become successful in the future when they graduate from school and pursue their career in different field , i beleive understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact . the fact related to history and politics tell u what happened in the past and we can use those fact to compare the new situation to those that happened in the in the past . similarly the scientific fact such a quantum theory help scientist build up their work based on these fact . however , being able to use idea and concept are much more important when we face new situation . especially in today 's competitive environment , we need to make decision that will help u become successful in tough business area . most of the time our ability to make judgement for a situation come from our knowledge about different idea and concept . learning these thing in school will give u the tool we need to use in the business world when we graduate . the fact wo n't help u much when we face a situation where we need to make a decision . we need to understand what consequence may occur a a result of our decision and how our decision will affect the future . to be able to understand this we need to be able to have analytical skill so that we have a good decision making process . i believe that this is accomplished only by understanding idea and concept . in my home country , the educational system is based mostly on fact not on concept . we learn the fact with detail in college but i do not think this prepares young individual to use their judgement in the business environment where decision making play an important role . especially in today 's competitive environment i beleive that making the student ready for business life is much more important than just teaching them the fact .
