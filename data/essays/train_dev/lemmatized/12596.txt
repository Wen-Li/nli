in my opinion , to learn fact is more important to understand idea and concept . because learning fact would be practical and memorable for student . to understand concept and idea would be the base of learning fact . however , without learning fact , idea and concept which student understood are nothing but their knowledge . first , to learn fact is very practical . for instance , when a child wa going to touch a very hot kettle . his or her mother would say `` stop ! do not touch ! it is hot and dangerous '' the child might understand the meaning of `` hot '' and `` dangerous '' a the ida or the concept . he or she might stop their action , although their curiosity would never disappear . we can say the same thing for the student . when they understood concept and idea about karate , they would think `` karate is not that difficult . '' is that true ? when they only understand idea and concept in class . they would think that they know everything about that , but that is not true . second , student could learn fact and they would not forget about that . in japan , we have old word about learning fact and understanding idea and concept ; hyakubun ha ikken ni shikazu '' that mean `` when you see it , you will learn everything in no time and never disappear '' . for example , the child who were trying to touch the hot kettle , would reach the kettle and got burnt , he or she would never forget about that . on the contrary , after student learn fact , to understand idea and concept would be easy for them . when they lost at karate match , they would learn the concept and idea about karate very quickly . even when they won , they would understand the concept and idea why they won in conclusion , understanding idea and concept is very important for student . yet , without learning fact , their knowledge can not be practical and memorable .
