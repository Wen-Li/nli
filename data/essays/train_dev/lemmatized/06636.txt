i disagree with this statement . first of all i think that the lack of help within the community is a problem in general . it doe not only concern young people , but everybodey . i think it is more a problem of people ' state of mind than of young people beeing selfish . the overall attitude of people towards helping each other and puting themself up for something good ha gone worse . most people are completely focused on themselves . they only care about their work , interest or their own problem . but in my opinion there have been many attemps to improve this situation . many company for example expect from the candidate who apply for a job that there ha been some kind of engagement , which is not supposed to relate to their education directly . that is why many student join organisation in their community , which purpose are to take care of other student or engage for social matter . this way they learn to take over responsibility and keep this state of mind up in their future life , teaching this to their kid later on . there are also some company who support their community themselves by making donation or supporting student , hospital , kindergardens etc. in their community in some other way . the value of the community and taking over responsibility ha increased i think . the issue ha become more present in the meantime . hectic and pressure are controlling many people ' life . for young people it is especially their fear of the future . but eversince this way of living ha occured , people more and more feel the need of comfort and support . the urge of having someone helping and supporting them , will hopefully result in a chance of mind . that is why i am thinking that there will be improvement concerning this issue . not only in young people ' but everybody 's mind .
