i agree that young people enjoy their life more than older people do , but they enjoy their life in a different way . young people do not care if they go to party on weekend until they are exhausted , burned out , and physically in a bad mood . youg people even do not care , about the further problem of alcohol abuse , nicotine abuse and other drug , they strongly belive that nobody , even themself , could never take their live apart . they just live for the moment and do not take responsibilty , because there is nobody for who it would be necassary . older people do enjoy their life otherwise , they are happy , if they can observe growing child , or growing nature with it 's neverending moment of live and death . the just enjoy to be part of a changing and moving world . so my point of view is that maybe everybody enjoys living , but in a different style . maybe it is not fair to judge somebody if he is enjoying life more than another person . everybody is individual and thats what make live enjoyable . so everybody should be lucky to be part of an individual and fast changing world , it doe n't matter if the person is young or old . my experience is , the the nothing else effect the mood of a person more than the surrounding and the family , which is responsible for life circumstance . young people may not respect this matter of fact a old people do , they do know how important familylife can be for enjoying life . children , with devorced parent , may enjoy life than other child with working family do . it is easy to see that the surroundings are important how and if you can enjoy your life . old people may have more life experience and do know what thing they do need to be happy in life , that would explain , why young people experience so much in their teenagerlife until they can stopp and just be happy and lucky about just beeing on earth and enjoying life the way life is .
