nowadays most of the young people care a lot about their own problem . they do not worry , if they can help an old lady to cross the street . focusing on their own aim is very important . in additon they only live , because they want to enjoy their life . they do not look for people , who need help . i think , that young people should be asked or even forced , if they do not want to help other people . on the whole most of the young people doe not spend enough time to help their community . working in a hospital for a low sale can help to remind especially young people , that they will become older . for sure , they are forced to see a lot of deseases , for example if their grandfather suffers from a bad illness . this experience can help to persuade younger people to spend more time to help their community , especially their own one . young people can change their mind , because they see , that it make older people very happy , that their is somebody , who visit them . secondly parent have got le time , because they have to cook for their childen , make the whole housework and they also have to earn the money . even because of this fact , most of the younger student do not help their own parent . that is really scaring . once they will become parent and than they look back and see their bad behavior . changing their behavior can help them to improve the general situation . as a conclusion i can agree with the statement . i hope , that young people change their mind . the general situation of the society can really be improved , if people think more about each other and not about their own problem . for sure that is a really hard change .
