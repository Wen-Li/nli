i think that helping one 's community mean taking part in the community actively . therefore , if given the choice , i think that yonug people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are two reason . first , young people nowadays are very busy . for example , i would like to think about junior high school student in japan . they go to junior high school , of course . after school , almost all of them go to cram school . they have to prepare for the entrance examination of high school . they ca n't come back to their home until 10 p.m or so . they do n't have opportunity to meet their neighbor day time and know what kind of people are in their community . they do n't have sense enough to feel living in the community . second , young people tend to enjoy their free time in thei home even if they have much time . these day , there are many enjoyable good which you are alone . one example of this is the internet . with using the internet , you can communicate with not only your close friend but also people in the all over the world you have never seen . the internet make you decrease the opportunity to meet someone face to face . taking part in the activity held by community and touching your neighbor make your community more powerful and cheering . but young people do n't go their community because of being busy and atractive good in their home . as a result , i think young people do n't help their community .
