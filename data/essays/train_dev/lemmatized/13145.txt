some people know a lot about advertising and so they can imagine that company have to present their good a perfect a possible . these kind of people antizipate this behavior and know that not everything told in advert in true . to this people this statement might be wrong . but i personally agree with this state because you can not suppose that a lot of peole know enough about the taktics of advertising . one reason why product seem to be better is that the company compete with other good on marked and need to show that their product is better than the other one . this is only possible if they tell and show thing obut the good wich might be not true . for example if you take a look at the red bull advertising zou see that they say if someone drink red bull , he will become wing and can fly . an other reason is that company have to show the consumer why they should by something or why they need that good . once again they have to create a situation in in their advertisement which present product in the perfect cause . an example for that are the axe advertisement . they show you that a man who doe not use their product can t get woman and men who do use axe will do much better . i think an other important reason for supporting this statement is that product usually are shown bigger and nicer than in reallity . imagine a picture of a new burger at mc donnalds . the seem to be so big on the advertises and this cause you to go and try one . but if zou have one of those new burger in your hand you don t recognise the burger from the picture . so altogether i agree with this statement and this cause me to think about this problem before i by something new .
