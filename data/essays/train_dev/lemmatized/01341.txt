is not about the age , is about the vision and the experience the reason because the young and older people do and think about different thing . when you are young , you think in study , work to get money for spent with friend , go to party , do not obbey the older people , and do anything that you want . the teenager think about their friend , the clothes that use , the fashion , the tv , the game . they are worried about live the moment , no matter the consecuences of their act and the family is only the group of person that wait for they at home , and give them money . with the year and the experience , the vision of the life change , you think in get a real job which allows you to get all staff you need , you think to get a couple wich share the time and you initially , do not want child . when you become older you already have a family a home , and think so much the way to care about their . you think and work for your child finish the school and go to the university , and you live only for your family . they think about prevention . precisely because the older people enjoy their youth ( in most case ) do not think in do the same thing , they are looking for the better condition for finish their life . for me , is not that the young people enjoy life more than olders , is just that have another different point of view about life . only the experience that can get with every moment along their life can modify that shallow vision and transform it in a mature vision of the life and the world that allows to be a grown up person . just the time and the thing you live , can change your vision of the life .
