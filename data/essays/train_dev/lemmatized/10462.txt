i disagree with the statement becuase young people have some time a better way to express their emotion , in some case they have more energy than older people but , it doe n't mean that older people lack energy to express what they feel about life , it just a natural behavior that older people are more reserved than young people on expressing emotion . older people know the great value that life mean , that is why i belive that older people really know how to enjoy life . perhaps they have in their mind diferent type of problem or disease they always try to be positive in those adverse situation . young people doe not matter about some aspect that older people have in mind so they can express more easily their actitudes related with life , but they can not visualize all the time they have lived and they can give a true value about life mean , while older people have lived specific situation , problem that many time they affront , this type of situation give a more complete think or sense in what life mean . i consider that older people in some way are considered person that are not usefull anymore , and this is a wrong statment that many young people have in their mind . older people are great teacher of life , youth people need to be more related with older people is a good form to find the true meaning of life . for instance , older people can help with their knowledge and their skill to young people on difficult situation , and advise is always accepted if became from an expert or a person who had lived an specific situation . perhaps older people in some need to fight with special situation like disease , demise of a relative , economic issue , they always tried to give a positive actitude to people , and they also give an idea that perhaps all of their problem they enjoy their life a much a they were young .
