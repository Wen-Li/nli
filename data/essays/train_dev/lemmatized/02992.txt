the issue at hand is that is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialise on one subject . this is important becauseit make u know what student are actually interested in . ipefer it is better to specialise in one subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academic . first reason to support my statement is that when we concentrate on many academic subject we could not concentrate well on all of the subject . and we can not do well in all the subject . when you take one specific subject and specialise on it you could concentrate well on the subject and can do justification to the subject . for this reason i think my choice is superior . secondly , by specialising on a specific subject make you learn many new thing without any difficulty . and you can focus more on a single point in a better way . by researching on the subject you can discover many new thing in that subject . for example many great prople such a einstein devoted his entire life to a specific subject in which he is interested and many discovery in that field such a mass energy equivalance theorem e.t.c therefore from this reason i support my choice is best . finally , all the people would not be interested or capable of learning all the academic subject . for example if somene is forced by something to learn a subject in which he donot have interest he can not learn it in a proper way . so it is better to specialise in one subject in which he ha interest instead of learning all the subject . so according to the above reason mentioned it is better for a student to specialise in one subject in which he is interested rather than learning all academic subject .
