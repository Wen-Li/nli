one of the main reason why i dislike the italian scholastic system is that teacher pay more attention to illustrate the cronological sequence of historical fact to their student rather than to discus what there is behind these event . therefore if i were asked to answer the question : `` is it more important for student to understand concept and idea rather than to learn fact ? '' i would say `` yes '' . i sincerely believe taht student should concentrate their attention more on the idea that form the basis of the event rather than on the event themselves . in this essay i will illustrate my point . first , i sincerely believe that there is no point in learning fact , date , and name by heart . obviously , everyone should know when some important event ( such a the world war , the american or french revolution ) have happened but what we really have to care about is why they happened and what kind of consequence they have had for u . only if do we answer these question we will be able to understand ho we are and to learn from past mistake . second , it ha been claimed that we tend to forget date and name more quickly than concept . a a result , i think that it is no good forcing to force our mind to remember thing that we are bound to forget in a very short run . third , learning fact might turn out useful to get a good grade at school but it will not have any positive practical implication . what we have to know to keep up with time is the ideology that every period is based on . to sum up , i think that it is more advantageous for everyone of u to learn concept and idea rather fact since it can help u to achieve the full consciousness o
