cars are freedom and independence ! that 's what many people think about car offering them the opportunity to travel individually everytime and to whereever they want . i think that therefore in twenty year there will be at least a many car used in the world a there are nowadays , and i 'll try to show some more reason for that in this essay . first of all , people are very slow in changing their habit , so even a new technology would not suddenly stop them all driving car . and there is no technology to expect in the next few year that could challenge with that flexibility of a cabin that can be freely driven by one person , in other word it seems that there will be no alternative to car for year . if you think about car in the future you should definetly take a closer look at asia . china and india develop quickly and will soon use a lot of car , and remember that we are talking about nearly one third of the world 's population ! noone could stop them from using that easy and quick transportation technology , so they will be happy to start using it like the western world wa in the middle of the last century . some people say that there would not be enough oil for future use of car . but expert predicts that the oil would last for at least another 50 year and in addition every year more field are discovered . to come back to the first and most important point , the flexibility of car offering independence to their driver , it ha to be asked if you would be giving up that opportunity just for saving the environment or stop the traffic and noise on the street . while everyone know that car seriously pollute the air noone would stop using them for that reason , because they are not able to see the consequence of that pollution directly or do not recognize them . all at all , there wo n't be fewer car in the future and in twenty year we have to expect an even bigger number than today .
