i agree the statement that to have knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reason . first , i can meet many people . for example , when i wa a child at yosumi elementaly school in osaka , japan , in . i liked some subject such a an art class and a sport class . taking these class had opptunities of meeting people . when i joined an art festival because i wrote some painting for the art festival . i could meet famous artist who wa tadanori yokoo . he wa a great artist in japan so i wa really glad to meet him , i became to like painting more then ever . second , i can study many thing . when i wa first year of grad-school at tsukuba university in japan . i studied hard many thing . for instance , i wa not able to study only about design at university . so , i took many academic class , such a a reading class , a writing class a presentation class . alomost all university did n't need to take a presentation skill but i wanted to have the presentation skill , i took the presentainon class . taking the presentaion class wa so hard but i had that skill at last . the presentation skill wa important in current society . thus , i storongly agree the statement that to have knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
