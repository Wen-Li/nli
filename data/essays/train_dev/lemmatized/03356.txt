for a long a this sophisticated society ha existed , people have debated which advertisement effectively work to attract consumer . although this issue may never resolved to everyone 's satisfaction , the matter is very clear in my mind : i disagree with this statement . many advertisement do not make product seem much better than they really are . that not all advertisement success to attract consumer is evident for several reason . to begin with , some advertisement discourage people to purchase the product . to illustrate , in many country , the advertisement of tobbacos have warming sentence on them . when i traveled in australia , i detected that even the photo of lung cancer were used in the advertisement . in this case , the advertisement warn u the possibility of danger that is caused by using the product . indeed , the advertisement of tobbacos do not make product better . furthermore , some advertisement utilize an unique strategy to attract consumer . for example , yukiguni-maitake , japanese food product company , us the conspicuous strategy : its advertisement say that do not buy it product . this advertisement is unusual , therefore , many consumer are attracted and finally buy the product . in view of this , the advertisement sometimes apply unique strategy which doe not appeal merit of the product . nevertheless , some critic claim that the advertisement ' role is to appeal the product . however , the fact , a detailed above , reveals that some advertisement try to prevent customer from buying their product . in conclusion , i believe that the advertisement usually use different strategy to attract customer . it is clear from my example .
