i do not agree with the statement that there will be fewer car around in twenty year than there are now . in my opinion , the number of car will either stay the same or increase . there are several reason which support my opinion . first of all , i think that our society , at least in the first world , is so advanced and programmed on a continuing progress that we would not be happy about taking a step backwards by reducing the number of car . i could not imagine living without a car . people in today 's society have gotten so used to having car that they even rely on them in several case . a man , for example , who work in an office which doe not have any connection with the public transport network can not get to his office without a car . moreover , one can tell from the development concerning the car business that there ha always been an increase of the number of car since the invention of the first car . this fact make me suggest that this development will continue in the future a well . besides that point , there is also another reason which need to be mentioned . even though people know about the environmental problem which car fume cause and even though most of them are also aware of the fatal consquences this could have , such a pollution of the air and destruction of the ozone layer , thez do not intend to change anything . most of them simply get on with their life , driving their car a usual . consequently , it can be said that most people think of the consequence a still being far awaz from them and their personal fate . they do not realize the disastrous consequence of their behaviour because they do not show up that clearly at the moment . however , there is still an even more important reason why i do not think that the number of car will decrease in the next twenty year . in my opinion , there might be a point of time when more people actually start to worry about the environment and the effect of using car . anyway , i do not think that this will cause the number of car to shrink but that it will rather lead to an increase in research and development of new technology which prevents the car fume to harm the environment .
