i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take riske ratheer than only doing what they already know how to do well . i think if a parson who know something well and using the skill to be success will also be success but it will not be successful a the parson who try new thing and take a risk . the reason i think is because the person who know how to do well is just following the step that he know and the he doe not have any idea to challenge something new . that mean is he will never find any better way to do something even if there is one . even it is easer to do the thisngs that you already know and more le risky , if you choose the difficult way to try new thing there is more chance to success . when you see the person who are successed , i think most of them tried new thing with high risk . for example there wa a man who ha own a company which wa not doing well , and the one of the worker said that he could improve the thing that they sell
