everyone ha one day dreamt of inventing something new which would make him rich and successful . i must say i believe in people 's intelligence . i mean that we are all capable of inventing something which will make u rich . so i do agree with this statememt because being successful is only the last thing you get when you try new thing . when you try new thing you do it because you think that what you are trying worth the energy you are spending to do it . you are ready to do whatever it take to accomplish what you began . you are over motivated and that 's why you succeed in you attempt . this motivation show your ambition and that 's how you are going to make it . for example the film beatrix potter show why she became famous , that 's because she knew her idea wa good and she had enough motivation to get refusal and to be desapproved by her father . and once you have succeed you always want to have this feeling again . the feeling that nothing can stop you , like leonardo dicaprio in titanic , you think you are the king of the world . if you try something new or to invent something it is because you do n't like to do always the same thing even you can do it very well . it is a lot more exciting to invent something , to think day and night on how you can develop an idea and make it real . finally , you try new thing because it make you successful . you do n't like to be like everyone else , you want to be apart of the others . and even if you are doing something very well you have to try new thing or a new way to do it because it will show that you do n't rely on your knowledge . it will show that you really want to improve yoursel . mozart is considered a a genius because he not only knew how to play an instrument very young but also because he created symphony at a very young age . as a conclusion i would say that everyone should try new thing , it is not interessant to rely on what someone else crated for u . we have the try something new a well .
