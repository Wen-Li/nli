i can say that aproximately twenty year afrer today there will not be more car in use than they are in use today . in the technologic world everything started to be more easy . the engineer work in order to make more suitable world for people . and everybody know that the car are one of the major reason for the pollution . beside pollution they are serious threat for the traffic crowd . in my opinion after a few decade they will be fewer car in use . subways will be established everywhere . it ha already been using in most of the place in the world and it will be the easiest transition in the city . it started to be used more than car in some of the city which are very big and very crowded . the people who live in big city got used to use the subway but in smaller city there are still many people who have never seen subway before because they are not aware of this easy transporting machine they maintain to love their car and use them . i believe that when their city are started to enlarge and when they will get red of the crowd they will want to use someting else which is much easier . moreover not only the subway but also some other vehicle will be using after a few decade such a bycyles . there will be special road for the many people will be more happy than they are today because they will be more healtier . they will go to closer place by using them . ofcouse there will be still car on the road and somebody will continue to use them but in my opinion it will be fewer car than today because the new generation is more conscious than we are today . they will find better solution because they will be aware of the world 's beauty .
