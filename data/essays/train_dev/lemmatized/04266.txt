i do not agree with the statement that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . first of all the advertisors and the company have the main goal to gain new and a high amount of costumer by advertising for their product . so the main reason why product are advertised is to show the potential costumer or consumer that this specific product might give them a nicer time or a better or even an easier life . off course the advertised product need to be presented from it best side so that the consumer feel attracted to buy the product and to test it first . if the costumer is satisfied with the product the product wa worth it beeing advertised . but if the customer is not satisfied with the product he or she ha still the right to return the product and get the money back . in general nowadays the costumer have a lot of right to defend them self from cheater and company selling product with bad quality . to increase the competions in the capitalist market all company try to produce product with better quality and more attracting to the consumer . the second important reason why it should n't be in the will of the advertisors to present the product better than it is in reality is that their company and it existence depends on the a positive `` oral propaganda '' among the people . for example if one costumer is not satisfied with a product he or she will tell her friend , neighbour , relative or family not to buy it and so the company will loose costumer and off course money . the third point is that because all these given reason a company would n't sell and represent a product if it is not hundred procent sure of the quality of the product .
