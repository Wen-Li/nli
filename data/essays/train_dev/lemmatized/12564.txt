do young people not give enough time to helping their community ? at first glance , it sound persuasive because we have fewer family member than before and the lack of opportunity to mingle with more sibling could result in lack of chance or mind to help people in their community . however , i believe the young people are more active to helping people nowadays for following reason . first , instead of being exposed to more family member , they are engaged in activity held by community where they live in , which will help them to open up for the importance and necessity of the interacting each other in helping people and in develping the community . in the weekly local newspaper i am receiving weekly basis , i can find the article of the young people helping the community . they were so deeply acknolwdged the true value of joining the community activity that it naturally motivated them to prosper the place they are belonged to . secondly , many school are encouraging student to participate in the social activity and to serve people in need . moreover , most of the respectful university give better score to the student who have the good record of serving people in their community than those who do n't have community service experience . since student are fully aware of the fact and it value , it is evident that student will be eager to engage in social activity for their competitiveness in college entrance exam . i think this is a very good policy for the good of majority and we have to maintain this to be a tradition for our society . in sum , although the population of the community may be decreased and it might be one element keeping young people from helping people , community system and school authoties have encouraged the young to help people and servie their community . thus , i can confidently say that the young people nowadays are giving a enough time to helping their community a their ancestor had done in the past .
