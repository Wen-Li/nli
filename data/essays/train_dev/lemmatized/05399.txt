i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . because you can make use of idea and you will remember idea for a long time . first of all , when we understand idea and concept , we can make use of those in every daily life . for example , when we sometimes learn about plato , we just have to learn what age he lived or what the title of his book . however , if you understand his philosophy , you have different perspection and old idea and concept are related to our present life , so it might your life good . second , when we understand idea and concept , we will remember easily , for example , please think about chinese character . we learned it in a elementory school . when we learn how to write , we also learn how come this character . that is why we can remeber easily when we understand the idea . in conlcusion , understanding idea is more important than learning fact . understanding idea and concept provide u new idea and make our life good .
