there are many people are traveling many place and some of them are traveling with tour guide . i think tour guide is necessary for trip and it is a best way to trip with tour guide . i have several reason . first , i believe it is more safer than take trip without tour guide . for example , if you go to trip to some country that speaks neither japanese nor english , you will not communicate with people there and you can not say what you want to say . but , if you have tour guide with you , she know the language and she can be a tranlator . also , the tour guide know everything about the place you go , such a how dengerous is , how much money is need it , which restaurant is good , and so on . so , you do not have to worry about the trip and you can have fun . in addition , i believe the schedule or plan that they make is quiute useful because you can go many place in reasonable time , and having fun . to sum up , even it will cost extra , i believe that to go on trip with tour guide will provide you with many advantage , can go many place , safety , and not to worry about anything . so , i adovocate with the idea that the the best way to travel is to go with a group with a tour guide .
