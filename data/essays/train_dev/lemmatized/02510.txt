in my view the success depends on the area where he is working t. so , i belive `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already they know how to do well '' is true in some case and it is not better in some other case . firstly , taking a sport man in to concideration he should adopt some new method to improve his skill in his game rather than trying for some other game . so here the sport man is suggested to carry his carrier in the same field without going to other field and taking risk . on the other hand , let u see how the success come from the new thing . for example , white brother invented aeroplane a it is new to the world they were praised by the world . and later several people have made some improvement to that and those people who made improvement to aeroplane are not so much praised a the white brother . this is because the basic and the idea is given by the white brithers and the others just have made some modification . those people who have made some improvement also may get fame but not to the extant the white brother got . the people those who follow the procedure given by others may not get succed a much a the people who give the basic idea . we should note that going for new thing give succes but it may or may not be changing the field of intrest . in software field they need to change their domain frequently to give their best output . so here they need to try for new thing and take risk . they need to change from one domain to other very frequently . in conclusion , the thing give success if it is new and it dos'nt matter it is his new area or not . so , in some case improving their field is prefered and in some case goin for new thing is prefered
