yes , i do agree with the topic that young people enjoy life more than the older people . this topic is very interesting one because many people maynot agree with my view . life is not a it wa some year ago , it ha become very fast paced . due to this even the stress level have increased , so it is difficult for the older one to survive . the older people are not able to compete with their younger rival . this mean they are not able to enjoy their work or the sucess it brings . so it would be fair to say the young are able to enjoy life more . sometime back i read in a novel that alexander could pursue his plan vigourously only due to his youth . from history , we do know that the great emperor trajan lamented that he could do nomore conquest due his old age . so this show that in order to do most of the thing in life we need youth . so to even enjoy life and it 's pleasure we need youth . we have read in numerous story that men have been searching for the elixir of youth to stay young forever . even many of the modern day research are going on to slow the ageing process and it 's effect , billion of dollar are being spent on it . to do many adventure in life also we need youth . youth is a divine gift which must not be wasted because you ca n't get it back . so we must finish important thing in life when we have youth else we are too late . so this is my personal opinion . i am not saying that oldage is a curse or anything rather that youth is a blessing , so we have to use to the maximum i.e , enjoy life when we have the youth so we wo n't regret in our oldage .
