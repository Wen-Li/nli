as far a i am concerned , i agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . nowadays young people would like to attentd other activity and seldomly think about that they help the community . i will account for my reason a follows . first of all , young people have so many activity that they would not to consider to help the community . on the leisure time , they will make plan to go out with friend or spend time on computer . hence , because they have too many activity to choose , they mabe have a little chance to take the community into account . secondly , nowadays we are not so familiar with the people who resident in the same community . therefore , if yound people are asked to help community , they may be doubtful that why they should help the community or the people who they do n't acquaint . because of lacking the cohision and the concept that we like family in the same community , yound people wo n't spend time on helping their community . finally , in the educational system , parent and teacher may teach young people to attend the activity in the community . however , the concept doe not achieve through doing it physicially . the concept is just like a sign which is taught by parent and teacher . furthermore , nowadays parent are so busy that they wo n't encourge their child to help the community . in conclusion , there are many solid evidence to proof that young people do n't spend enough time to help their community . hence , i agree the statement .
