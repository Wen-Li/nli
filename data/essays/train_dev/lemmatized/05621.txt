at first sight it appears to be easier for young people to enjoy life . the context of academic study , into which most young people are , make it a lot easier to repeatedly meet new people , and also provides them with a lot of free time . everything is yet to be discovered , and a lot of activity are designed for younger people . being in a better physical condition during youth allows you to practice sport , even if it is still possible for older people . ln our society , adult life is mostly devoted to work . it doe not leave a lot of spare time anymore , and often it primary function is just to make a living . it seems to be harder to find one 's life exciting then . but enjoying life a an older person is not impossible , it is just more challenging : a good career and an exciting job , or just a happy and united family can give a feeling of acomplishment that it is impossible to have a a young . each stage of life thus ha advantage and inconvenients , but no one is more enjoyable that another . the feeling of happiness is only psychological ; there is no age to be an optimistic person , or to have a passion for kitten or anything else . one should keep in mind that someone 's life is what one doe with it ; there are always mean to make it more enjoyable .
