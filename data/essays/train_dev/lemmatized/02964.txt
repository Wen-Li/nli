recently , most of young people are concerned about how to enjoy their youth before they get old and when they get old , they want to have a calm , rest and relaxation . young people enjoy life more than older people do because of their youth and thing that available to young people . first , in my opinion , young mean full of energy , especially in physical condition . most of young people have the best or better body condition than older people . these condition make people able to do many thing like studying , playing sport , drinking alcohol and etc . for example , when sportsman get old nearly 40 , they usually retire because their physical condition are not strong enough to continue that job . moreover , when people get older , they keep on destroying their brain cell whether they want or not . thus , young people can enjoy their life more than older people do because they are mostly healier than old people . second , when people are young , there is so many opportunity to them . limitation to older people in the rollercoaster can be a good example for that . because of young , young people can try many thing even though they fail a lot . one more example can be , availablity in job opening . companies want young people to worl therefore , young make possible to do or try many chance . in conclusion , i like to say ` enjoy when you are young ' , where good body condition allow you to do many thing and when so many chance open to young people .
