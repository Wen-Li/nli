i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . when advertising , company tend to make their product sound like that they are the best by providing false information and false result . an ad on the tv may tell you thing that you usually want in a product . these information may misslead you to build an idea about the product that usually tern out to be wrong . for example , when you watch television , you see a commercial about a certain type of cleaner . on the commercial , they say that this cleaner can make old thing look new . you immediately think that this cleaner will help you make your old dress made by your mother look like a new valinteno . but instead , it shrink your dress . other commercial , show what happened when other people - actor - used this product . for example , a company that sell a drug for weight loss will show image of people who used to be fat , but now they are in a good shape . later , it turn that these image were either taken for different people , or were manipulated with by computer . when conpanies try to make their product seem much better than they really are , they fool people into buying their product . people will see later that this product is not like what they expected . this will eventually lead the company to lose it creditability and honesty , which will lead to financial nose dive in the future .
