the statement say that there will be fewer car in use than there are today , in twenty year . however , i do not think that the number of car will decrease in twenty year . i have two reason to support my opinion . first , car are the most convenient vehicle we have ever had to move wherever we want to go . for example , most place on the earth can not be reached only by other mean such a train , airplane , or by foot . i imagine that globalization will have spread more in twenty year , which mean that people will move more actively than they do now . when pople move more actively , car must be the most convenient tool to satisfy their desire to move . furthermore , if more car are produced , the price of car will decrease , which result in more people to be able to afford car . when considering the world population will get enhanced in twenty year , i am convinced that more people will posse car than now . thus , there is no chance to think about the decrease in the number of car in use . secondly , there are hundred of car manufacturer in the world . i do not think they will reduce their number of product , because their profit may decrease by doing so . manufacturers are good at marketing and catching consumer ' need in the first place . naturally so are car manufacturer . the world concern may be inclined to eco-friendly system in twenty year , but i am sure that car manufacturer will create those car which match the need of consumer and of the earth in twenty year a well a they do now . additionally , there have never been period when the number of car decreased so far . therefore , it is likely that this trend will continue , a long a car manufacturer desire to produce many car under the support of appropriate marketing . in conclusion , because of these two reason cited above , i disagree the statement that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are now today .
