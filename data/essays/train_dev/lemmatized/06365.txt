i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i hold this point of view because of the surging of the global population , the expansion of the urban city , and the research of the invention of future car . first of all , it is clear that the number of the global population is dramatically increasing by looking at the demographic chart . the number of people may soon reach it peak and it mean that there will be more and more people that their transportational necessary should to be met . and it can also observed that in many prosperous area , one family may have more than a car in their garage . so the accelarating of the number of human will result in the intense need of car . secondly , since there are more and more fellow men who settle down and pursue their life in city , the brink of city have extended , forming the so-called metropolis and this phenomanon show that many people dwelling in the outskirt or suburb of urban city will need car to access the core area of city due to the distance from outer place to the business or entertainment center and the convenience that car bring about . thirdly , because of the exhausion of the fossil fules , many scientist or coporations are now eager to research in the field of renewable energy and seek to invent environmentally friendly green car that utilize bioenergy , electricity or solar energy . since the further research and the actively invetion of green car , how can the number of car be decreasing in twenty year . accordingly , there will be more and more car on the road , no matter what appearance they may have . as a whole , in twenty year there wo n't be fewer and fewer car in use . conversely , what with the explosion of the global population , the swelling of the big city and the enthusiasm for producing future vehicle , car will still on demand .
