i am agree with this statement that young people enjoy life more than older people . young people are generally have great verve and energy . whereas , older people can not enjoy the life with such attitude . young people normally enjoy their life while doing their mundane job . but old people will do their job by creating unwanted stress around them . the health is wealth . if you are fit and fine then only you can live your life in most hilarious manner . but old people are often surrounded by such kind of ailment pertinent to age , which restrict them to enjoy . i have great respect for my grand aunt who is inhabitant of our street . i am watching her since i wa in 5th class . she wa very active and alert at that time . she had little problem because of diabetes , but she had overcome any kind of stress and problem at that time . now , the canditions had changed . most of time , she is not even able to walk properly . she is suffering from such kind of ailment which are very painful . whenever i watch her i can easily undestand the savour of young life . young people readily overcome most of the ailment because of proper physiological function of their body . the other factor which make the old people lethagic towads life is , `` pessimism '' . old people do not prefer to work after age of 55 or 60 which cause these people sluggish and prone to various dreadful disease . young people always ambitious about their career and goal which motivate them to enjoy life rather then to take a a burden . young people prefer to socialize and make friend with whom they can go to dance bar , hotel etc . old people like lonliness . my grand aunt previously wa fond of party and get togathers . but now , she disdain such kind of crowd and prefer to live in disgrunteled canditions . young people emancipate themselves from all kind of bondage and live life with vivacious attitude . in short , normal functioning of body and optimistic attitude of young people make them so that they can enjoy their life .
