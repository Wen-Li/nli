what make a person successful ? is it the amount of money they make , the car they bought with it , or the house they live in ? i believe that success is more than just having a lot of money . to be a successful individual a person ha to go through many obstacle without stoping , and ha to have a clear vision of the future . we may find someone that is really good in a certain task . but success is not just being good at something . i believe that it mean to be the best at it . in the present time people go through life trying to grasp anything they can get . there 's no such thing a easy money . because of the dificulty of getting a job , paying bill , and having enough money to pay for your child 's $ 30,000 per year education , many people have found themselves absorbed by life 's preassure . they stoped thinking about the future and have focus in the present . i believe people have become conformist and many mediocre . they are tired of working so hard and not improoving , so when they finally find something that 's ok , they 'll stay with it because they are too afraid of loosing the little something they 've got . most human do n't feel confortable in an unknown environment . this make it hard for these people to take a risk and move towards the unexplored . they do n't care if it 'll bring something better . the fear of change disables them to become better . so a successful person is not the one that stay with what he or she already know how to do well , but rather that other person who take the risk and search for self improovement . it is not enough to have one goal in life . what are you supposed to do when you acomplish it ? are you done ? is there no other reason for you to keep on living ? i truellly think that a successful person will always have something more to acomplish . miving from one objective to the next will make you go higher than being passive and staying in the secure zone .
