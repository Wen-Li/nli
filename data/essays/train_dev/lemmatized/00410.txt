all over the world , if we examine the present and past , there is two kind of person , one who serf their life in the known way , just simply survives and the extreme one who make new thing try to find new way and take risk which can not be taken . i am totaly agree that successful people are the one that who try the new and take risk even if i can not be taken before . firstly , success is something like not to be done by everyone , in opposite you can say that reading is a success , but nowadays it is not because everybody can read . in that point it might be a good example to give the wright brothers flying expriences , 100 year before they tried to fly , and they took the biggest risk which can be caused by death . they were successful inventor . and i think that is the meaning of success . after that i can be known that the time that risk are taken might be the break down of the history , and if you dont take the risk you can not survive . in the history , there is certain time that whole future is in the hand of a human being . one can not say that the risk of hannibal to pas tha alpines ( the mountain above the italy ) in the middle of the winter wa not a risk , but at the end he reached with his chosen army to the center of italy to rome . he wa a successful soldier . sometimes if you dont take risk you can not survive . finally , trying new thing is one of the most strong way to be successful . the other way done by lot of people lot of time and you can see that they all not did anything new . for example , the great experimental physicist m. faraday , try the new way of understanding the unknown area , and until he wa shown on the scene it might be tried these experiment over hundred time . of course he is a successful man because he tried the new and think the new . all in all , the whole world is turning over the successful person hand , and if you tried to look up their most attracted work they tried the new , they take the risk .
