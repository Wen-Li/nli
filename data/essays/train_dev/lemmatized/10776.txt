it is true that nowdays young people do not give enough time to helping their community . i think that this is an effect of a lot changings of the world . in fact in the past young people helped their family in some work , such a to clean their room , to do their bed and so on . in this way a young boy could develop your sense of responsability and so he also learned to helping their community . perhaps this is impossible today , because young people have many thing to do and they are involved in many activity . if we think that today young people spend the major part of their time at school or that they spend their time playing videogames or watching tv , it is simple to understand this changing . i think that for young people is not important playing or studying only . they should learn to love the nature and should spend more time out . in this way they could help their community cleaning the wood or organizing some event to involve the child or old peolpe of their community for example . to do this , it is important that the government give the structure to create and to develop this type of society . for me this aspect of society is very important because if we want a society in that all people can be to help for another people , it is important to develop this sense of responsability in all young people . in fact for me it is not nice a society in that everyone think only himself .
