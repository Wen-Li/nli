i agree with that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the advertisement can make product seem more amazing and special , and it make people want to buy the product . in addition that 's the reason for advertisement . advertisements should make product better than real to attract people . first , the advertisement on the tv such a commercial show can attract people attention . it 's directly influenced people desire . if people watch the cool soda 's cm in summer when they are thirty , they want to drink that kind of drink even though they know these product are n't good for thire health . if they watch the tasty steak cm before the dinner , they want to eat steak . the visual moving advertisement have big influence to people 's disare quickly . second , when you drive the car on the high way , you can see some advertisement bords next to the road . for example , when you go to local side , you can find the hotel or restaurant advertisement bords . it doe n't have the big impact like commecial on tv , yet , it can effect your mind to think about that kind of thing . it make you think that you need it or not . also , in most situation , you want to get it at that time because this bord made it there for exactly that people need it at this time although the situation is that no choice because of in local area . third , if you read newspaper , you might also get some advertisement paper for seling house and new restaurant etc . it doe n't pas you quckly like commercial show and advertisement bords . it can be left in your space , so you can look them later when you have time . it ha some advantage . you can see that whenever , so it can be seen more than other kind of advertisement thing . it mean it more effect to people 's mind . for instance , on the sunday , if mother see the new restaurant 's advertisement paper , she will ask about going to there to her hasband because ahe want to try new taste and she dose n't feel to cook today . in conclesion , the advertisement have many way such a the cm on the tv , advertisement bords and advertisement paper . these ha effective influence to people 's desire to want to get product . unfortunatly , in many case , people felt kind of disappoint after they tried the product because before they try it , they were hoping too much . actually , the product are n't so terrible , but because of thire too much desire and they wanted that by not big desire , they ca n't be satsfied by the product that on the advertisement . of course , in some case , they can felt satsfied yet , it 's le than oposite situation .
