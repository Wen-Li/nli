i disagree with the state , in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are so many car which are inventing , a the year pass by there are more people who ha car , and in our society we can not live without car . there are so many car which are invented and will continue to invent for the future because every year people are born and that mean more car will be made . there are people who work for the car company , such a sam sung in korea . sam sung is mainly producing car and everyday they are inventing a new car with new color , design , and shape . each year people buy new car because it attracts them and they do not keep their car for many year . in certain time they all change into new car . if there are no people buying car then the people who work for the car company will all loose the job . as the year pass by there are more people who ha car becuase everyone want to have independent car . as people grow older they all want to have their own car , house , and family . these day , everyone is educated that mean they are smart , everyone ha a job and they can afford to buy a car . lastly in our society we can not live wiout car because of our own social life and independence . most people use their car to job , school or for family . most people want to have their own car to go to work or do personal stuff rather than riding public transportation because it is comfortable riding their own car , they can go or do whatever they want , and what if their house is far away form the city and no public transportation going to their own house . these day people have another house to relax and calm down which are far away form the city . therefore , because of incrising of population , attractiveness of car , and personal life , car will still remain and more car will come after unless the earth doe not exsist .
