i agree with the statement porpoused in wich is stablished that for student it is more important to undertand idea and concept than learning fact . i do have to be clear saying that fact are not a important a concept and idea are , but fatcs are not secundary thing without impotance they are really importat in any learning process . i say this because i am student and i can now be sure that when a teacher begin explaining fact without a theory before that includes different concept and idea , the class is really a lack of time , because student maybe understand the fact but do not really learn the theory that it is behind of it . althouht it is also inconvinient for learning , when whe a student only recive concept and idea but no fact or example that explains what the teacher is trying to explain , because in this way possibly we learn a teory but we wo n't be capables of ussing it . a clear example of this matter it is when you try by yourself to read a law , for sure will be very difficult to understand what is regulating , but when a teacher give you some fact it is much clear and you really understand what is that law trying to regulate . finally i do have to accept that when a teacher us fact that really ecourage student . so i think i is clrear that concept are very important but thet sholud be accompai
