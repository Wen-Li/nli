students around the world have different method of learning , it highly depends on the subject in hand . some subject depend more on learning fact , other subject are more towards understanding the idea . i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , and i think that this statement should be applied to all subject . as a start , by understanding the idea and concept , student will end up understanding the subject in hand , not just learning it by heart . understanding the idea and concept will make it much easier for them to learn the detail by heart . for instance , in biology , if you understand the exact route of blood from the heart to the organ , you will find it easier to later on learn the name of the organ that the blood pass through . moreover , some subject such a mathematics , need clear understanding of the concept so that you could apply them to the question . after understanding the concept , you can learn the rule , and then apply them . in addition , it is more easy to forget a subject that you simply learnt , but not quiet understood . in my junior high school year , my worst subject ever wa history . i used to learn the fact , write them up in the final exam , leave the exam room already forgetting everything i had just wrote down . that is because i never bothered actually understanding the course . thus by understanding a course , you can remember it for a long time , and apply it in another course afterwards . finally , you can understand more about a course by reading more knowledge than required about it . it might not be in the syllabus of the course , but it will help the student to expand his mind more and learn more than required about it , this would make the course seem more interesting . to sum up , by understanding the idea and concept rather than simply learning fact , it would be easier to learn and apply , it would be more interesting and you 'll end up remembering the course for a long time . therefore , i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
