do you know that 82 % of the young people nowdays do not share and help their community . this belongs to many reason : they do not have a time for that , they have some dream and project that they want to do , and they must have a time for themselves to have fun or have a rest . first , young people specially the student do not have atime for this work . they have homework to do and quis to prepare . also they must work to earn some cash that will help themto live . second , they have some dream that they must work for it or project that they trying to finish it . in addision , they must have their own time to have fun or visit friend or joining party with family , specially on the weekend , the only time that they can help community on them . in conclude , take note that most of the teenager prefer to have their time alone with out sharing it with any else . most of them do not prefer to help others and i think this up to them . surly helping people specially the who need to help is a good thing but i am sure that there is many block that well not help them to do this great porpoese .
