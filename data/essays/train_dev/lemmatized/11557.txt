this question being asked to me just a couple of year ago , i would have agreed completely . but in the last year i 've had the chance to experience several situation that lead me to believe that this tendence is changing . to me , it look like that the world a a kind of natural security alarm , and when , over the last decade , the selfishness-altruism balance wa starting to be overloaded on the selfishness part , an altruist essence ha started to spread over western society . of course i 'm sure not all the society ha been affected by this phenomenon , but i could outline a couple of example to make my idea more clear . first of all , i 've got to get in contact with the wide reality of voluntary work . i started with an internship with an italian non governmental organization of international volunteering , and i 've been positively surpriesed to see how many young people want to get involved in the fight for a better world . a lot of student show their availability to work unpaid to make possible a lot of event , like exibitions , market , debate , etc. , to collect funding and to communicate the message of the value of human development . to look more closly , in italy it is possible to work for a year a social service volunteer , and , i 'm always surpriesed to see how many young people are willing to dedicate one year of their life just to help disadvantaged people and organization that work for the protection and the respet of every human being . almost all of my friend collaborate a volunteer in at least one association , and everyone of them affirms that his voluntary work is one of the few thing that make sense and give satisfaction in everyday life . to summarize , i would said that just until few year ago it wa true that young people did n't mind that much about helping their community , but i do believe that this tendence is nowadays changing and young people are taking a more responsible direction .
