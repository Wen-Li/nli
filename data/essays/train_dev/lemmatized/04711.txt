today , the word success is in every mouth and seems to be the motto of the 21st century . everyone want to be successful , in every apect that it conveys : success in business , success in love . and we may wonder it trying new thing and taking risk rather than only doing what we already know drive u to the way of success . first of all , taking risk doe not prevent someone from being successful a long a he ha carefully measured those risk . the example of warren buffet is edifying . this business man ha earned million of dollar thanks to an excellent perception of the stock exchange market . and i think that the more successful people are also the one that are very imaginative and can povide innovative custom-built solution . bill gates , who started from scratch , ha triggered a revolution in the sector of information technology with the creation of windows . no one had ever done what he did . he wanted to be a pioneer and he managed to be one . i think that this desire of innovation is deeply-rooted in successful people 's mind : it is a if it wa the goal of thir life : try or create new thing . however , being a risk-taker doe not bring success , if it is not combined with a sense of integrity and critical thinking . the dramatic story of vivendi universal when jean-marie messier wa at the head of this company is striking . som doing what you know well is sometimes better than trying new thing and taking more risk than advised . in conclusion , i think that successful people do not always try new thing or take take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
