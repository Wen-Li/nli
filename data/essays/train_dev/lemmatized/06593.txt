for century people have been developing way to help other people . nowadays society is concerned about helping people and every day is more common to find place where people can do some kind of social work , for example : charity shop , hospital and even there is some kind of comunity police . young people have always been treated like a problem , because teenager deliquency is every day more popular . some young people is worried about enviromental issue and some of them are worried about thir community . however , a vast majority of young people do not concern about anything related with their own community , they show more interest in topic like enviroment , unemploy rate and animal right . goverments around the world are trying to find the way of doing that young people become in a dinamic part of the community . if they are involved in the community development they will not have any time to waste . boredon could not be a reason for deliquency . furthermore young people can improve their condition and the community 's condition . everybody win wether everybody work together . as a young person i am spending some time helping old people . they need our help and if we can give them some help why do not do it ? in fact i belive that almost all of our problem are because people and young people do not want to do anything good for their community , they just want to spend all day doing nothing and this behaviour make unproductive people . deliquency rate and crime are slightly related with this problem . on the other hand young people do not realise that they some day will be old people , some day they will have their own child and they have to start to change the history if they want to live in a better place . finally i think that the stament is true and nobody want to spend their time doing good thing for th community . it is a real problem and if we do not find a good solution every day could be worst . young people should be more conscious of this situation .
