to be able to take part in the competitive world , people must be more qualified than before . everyone is trying to improve their skill by attending to certificate programme , seminar , internship program or attending to the top ranked school . the education they get there is a big step for their career . especially student feel big pressure on themselves , since they do not know where they will be after they finish their education and if they will be able to play a role in this global world . hence , they try to do their best at school by studying their course , doing homework , getting good grade . however , after they complete all these requirement they may not reach their goal unless they . learnt to understand the idea and concept . the education system force student to learn what is written in the course material . it is easy to memorise all the fact in the book and get good grade . however , these learnt fact will be forgotten quickly and easily . hence , it is important to understand the basic idea behind the subject and question everyting to gain permanent knowledge . for instance , a student taking a political science course may have an assignment about the difference between political view . he may study the different type of view like nationalism or fundemantalism . if he understands the basic idea behind those , he will never forget or confuse them . however , if he just learns the fact it is possible that his knowledge will not last long . as a student , i believe that it is more important to understand the idea and concept than to learn the fact in order to gain permanent knowledge . if a student is aware of the subject , he will be more likely to improve his skill and qualification . in my opinion understanding the consepts is the core for self development and may give you the chance to play a big role in the competitive world .
