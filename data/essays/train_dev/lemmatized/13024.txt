ideas , concept , fact are three important method to know the topic , this will be there for every aspect . in somecases all three are important to know the topic in detail . my opinion about this statement - i am disagreeing with following statement . each and every method is essential for better knowing of the topic . some aspect will require any of the method for understanding . while all some require all the three for better understanding of the topic . for example if a boy wa thaught about a topic , and he is thaught all the theory related to the topic and some reason lying under the subject , the boy will understand partially about the topic . if he is given some in example where and when the topic is used and show how it work , then the boy understand the the topic clearly . however the method depend on the age and in which grade is he studing . if the student is in primary grade all method are not necessary for him , moreover he rather get confused if he is thaught . and the student who is doing graduation or undergraduation , he requires all the three method a he ha to submit research paper on every subject . in conclusion , i rather believe that all the three method are important to understand , moreover the main reason for this is the student will be having no doubt on the subject and he will be familiar and perfect with the subject . i think it is better to know all about the topic , so that will be like `` digging a mine of wisdom '' .
