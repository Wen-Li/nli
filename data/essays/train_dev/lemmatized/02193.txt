i personally travelled a lot in my life because i think it one of the best way to learn about diversity and culture . since i wa born my parent would often take me and my brother on vacation . i consider my self lucky because i had the opportunity to visit country such a venezuela , india , canada , brazil and many others . well none of these travel were guided by group led . from what i know a tour guide job concern whit showing to tourist the beauty or something in particular of a certain country , and i am sure that they do their job in the right way . but i think that one of the most fascinating and interesting thing when you are visiting a new country , i would call it the `` taste '' of your vacation , come from your desire to discover the same beauty by your own . when i visit a new country a whant to feel all the tradition and culture that carachterize it , i want to become , during that period , part of what is going on . for example while i wa in india i 've been invited to a traditional buddist wedding ; at the beggining i wa a bit suspicious , i wa not sure to ware their traditional wedding dress , it wa a large pair of pant full of different color . at the end i decided to ware it and still now after five year i remember that day a one of the most emotionally intense day of my life . in all my trip arround the world i 've been in many situation that gave me lot of satisfaction and i am sure that i would n't feel in the same way if wa a guide who took me to that wedding . to end my paper i want to decair my adversion to tour guide vacation , you spend more and enjoy le .
