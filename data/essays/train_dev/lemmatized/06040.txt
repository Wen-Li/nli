eventhough , learning fact is important to pas exam or know knowledge , understanding basic idea and concept are very more important for learnig something . many subject have their own basic idea and concept . for exsample , learning the history , there are a lot af fact in the past . many student study event for their study , however , only few student think about why the event are occured . learning and findind out the reason of event is very helpful to know history deeply . not only history and but also math requires to know concept of process . maybe it is not inpossible to pas exam with only fact . students should know the concepta od process to prove the answer . understanding idea and concept are very important for student for make their own decision or study . if student learn only fact , it is hard for them to know what the fact ' purpose . they can not find out what they learned exsectly . in my country , middle school and high school student usually learn fact without idea and concept because passing exam is vety important for their life . however , when they imigrantto the other county espacially the unites state , they feel hard to study because they do not know the real purpose . also , learning idea and concept help making desicion because set up the idea and condept help lead to process and reach a goal and fact . in art class , many teacher teach student to explain their are work because final work are not important and it can not be good art work without thinking , idea and concept . in summary , i think learning idea and concept are more important to learning fact . most of fact of subject composed of their own idea and concept so knowing these are basic to know fact .
