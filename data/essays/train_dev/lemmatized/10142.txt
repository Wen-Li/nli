as told by our ancestor `` knowledge is wealth '' , adding to that most of the individual today believe that it better to be knowledgable about a many subject a you can apart from your academic . knowledge is never confined to one particular subject or topic it increase along with your intetrest . not many people try to explore knowledge base available around them . a person can do miracle in his academic but a person who can out perform in an area which is out of his scope would be appreciated for his achievement . any student need not try to learn everything available in the library but going an extra mile studying something which is not related to his academic but which help him in real life always benefit him . it may be history , politics or science anything of that matter . nowadays student realised the use of being more knowledgable about external affair which always been part of a normal conversation they have . many student who try to acquire bookish knowledge need to be taught about the importance of realtime knowledge . apart from academic subject we can make atleast basic of other subject mandatory for student by which they turnout to be more knowledgable . taking an example of biology student who is workng in a laboratory with electrical equipment may not be aware of the amount of power he is playing with , which might even cost him his life , so it would be beneficail to eduacte him about working of electricity a well . this allows him to be more careful when he is dealing with something which is not of prior importance to him . at the end i would like to say that it always help you to grow a an individual when you derive a much a you can from the vast knowledge base available around you !!!!!
