both young and old people could enjoy life . it entirely depends on the individual . this can be better described by explaining the term ` joy ' and ` happiness ' . the chief reason for my view is that the way people enjoy their life entirely depends on the way they percieve happiness . some people tend to experience happiness even at their bad time . we see defense personnel of a country showing a lot of pride when they loose their life in a war . this is unusual in the case of other individual . the other reason for my view is that joy and sorrow are part and parcel of the life , and one ha to encounter these two situation in a happy way . we see great sport person on the television who , at worst of their time on the field tend to carry a smile on their face . some of them , winning match even out of such situation . the reason being playing the sport in the true spirit by understanding the complexity of the game . others might argue that the way people enjoy their life is influenced by many factor such a their economic status , freedom and liberty . i.e in making their decision , ambience , health status etc . but the point i emphasize in my view is that one can not have all the mentioned factor which are materialistic . every individual lack something . in sum , i concur that people who learn to get satisfied with what they have and who do n't ob on what they lack tend to enjoy their life more . it is not the age factor ( . i.e young or old ) , but , it is the attitude of the people which determine how much they enjoy their life .
