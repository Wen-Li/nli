from the primary school to the end of highschool , in france , england or in the united states , student learned a significant number of various subject which mean they not have to operate a decisive choice in one or two subject they will have to study . this choice of specialisation happens when they are graduated and have to go to the university . somebody who know little thing about a unbelievable number of academic subject is cultivated and often it is interressant to talk with this kind of people because they always have something to say whatever the subject of the conversation but because he is not specialized he will maybe never teach you something . in another way , speaking with a too specialised man could be fast becoming boring . but here is not the question . i really think that is essential to master one subject perfectly , to posse a domain where you are excellent but i also believe that is vital to remains open to others academic subject . for example , great thinker from the past like r.descartes had knowledge in mathematics , philosophy etc . .. and i really believed it helped them to improve their predilection subject cause all or almost all academic subject are related . to my mind , beeing unskilled or too skilled in a subject are not good thing . between these two exteme model , everyone must find his own way . to conclude i would like to add that our educational system , often highly criticised , are finally not so bad . it offer the opportunity for the student to learn about a lot of thing , it give them the choice to eperiment the subject they would like to study later .
