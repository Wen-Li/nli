the purpose of advertisement is to sell a product ; the product will be promoted to allure the customer into purchasing it . therefore , i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . not only do they emphasize the product 's quality but they also do not mention feature that can make the product hard to use . emphasizing a product 's quality in an advertisement is not unlike producing a movie preview . it , unfortunately , becomes more and more common to be disappointed by a movie after being attracted to it by it preview on tv . have n't you noticed how it seems that all the good part of the movie are shown in the preview ? all you have left to discover , once you go to the theater , are the dull moment . just like a preview which show you all good thing about a movie , an advertisement highlight the great product feature . once you finally purchase the product , the novelty wear off pretty fast and you are left with the mondain task of actually using it . you may even realize that the cool feature they were advertising wa just that , a cool feature , and this product is not better than any other one . as much a an advertisement emphasizes the product quality , it will hide any feature that can make the product hard to use . let 's take the ipod for instance , it is small and getting even smaller a new model are developped . it also a all the control around a circle . this definitely look great on the advertisement but once you actually try to an ipod , you realize that this cool product will require a lot of patience in order to master the thumb movement and control it function . any advertisement would be faulty if it lead the customer to think that there might be any difficulty in using this product . as can be seen on any advertisement , only positive point about a product are ever highlighted . this is what advertiser need to do to make product attractive . therefore , they will make product seem better than they really are .
