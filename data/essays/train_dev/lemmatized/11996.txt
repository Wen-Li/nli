i agree with these statement and i will support my point of view through three different argument : the fact that our city in the near future will be saturated , the need for living organism to have a clean atmosphere , and the problem of finding energy to fuel the car . to begin with , it is precise to note that these day a car owning a car in developed and developing countris is becoming easy . the car dealer present the costumer with many financing option . these option and the present day necesities are incentive for poeple to own car . the fact that many people are owning car present a problem of saturation in city and make it hard for people to effectively transport . furthermore , the fact that many car are being produced and put in circulation present a mejor problem to our atmosphere . the fuel used by these car produce polutants that are harmfull to living creature on the planet . soon , in my opinion , government in developing and developed country will begin to make law in order to make it more difficult to own car . many country have developed efficient public transportation a an alternative . finally , it is imperative to be aware that manking is rapidly using up the available natural source of energy such a natural gas and crude oil , the basic element from which the fuel car fuel or gasoline is derived . finding alternative sour of enrgy are costly and not always a efficient . by reducing the amount of car in circulation , mankind may save these natural source of energy making them last longer . today many developing and developed country in europe , asia , and the americas are making available other mean of efficient transportation like rail system , metro line , bus , and tramway that may be used collectively to reduce the amount of car in circulation and a an alternative to people who can not afford car .
