the statement `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' is a statement that can be enhanced or contradicted . i agree with this statement for many different reason . first of all , everything depends on the definition of a `` car '' . if we consider a car to be a vehicle with four wheel and a engine that depends on oil in order to function , the statement ha a lot of chance to be true . it is possible that in twenty year we wo n't have any petroleum left . the kind of engine we use now would then become obsolete . even if we consider that we will have some pretoleum left , the product would have become rare and it price would certainly rise . only wealthy people could then afford to drive , which would lower down the number of car in our street . however , it is possible that we find new kind of energy that would adapt to other kind of wehicles . would we still consider those new wehicles a car ? if not , the number of `` car '' would be le than it is now , but we would still have new traveling way . it is also possible that we change only the engine part of the car , using , four example , hydrogen energy . we would then keep the four wheel pattern , and we would still be driving car . as time pass , the global population tends to get richer . it implies that the number of potential customer who will be likely to buy a car will rise over the year . even now , some country a china or india are industrializing quickly . more than a billion people are now demanding for car . if we find news way of energy , the number of car owner will rise expodentially . the statement will then be wrong . however , if the scientist do not find any other type of energy , our petroleum supply will turn to be empty in a few year . since i do not belive that we will be able to find and put in use new kind of energy that cost the same price to exploit than petroleum in le than 20 year , i agree with the statement .
