like many others statement , there is n't an universal true . it depends on many different thing . a person who ha broad knowledge of a precific subject can became very good in this subject and dedicates all his life to it . but to know many subject is more pratical . for example , i 'm very good in math and in scientific subject till i wa very young and every professor said `` david is so good in math : he must do scientific liceo `` and so i focused all my attention on this subject to increase my ability and i did also the national math olimpic with good result . but now i have to pas this toefl test and i understand that in the past i 'd study english better because now i 'm very good in scientific subject , but if i do n't pas this exam , how can i finish university ? it 's a big problem . ..
