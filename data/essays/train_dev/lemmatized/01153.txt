do you know this situation ? relaxing in front of the tv , watching a good movie and in the most exciting scene . .. advertisement . .. ! watching it you will recognize that all product are shown there , the best , the healthiest and the chaepest . but are they really that good , advertisment is promesing use ? if you ask me , they are not ! take for example pill or cremes that promise you not get older and look like an fivteen - year - old - teen while you are an 50-year old grandmother . this is , short to say , a lie . tests have shown that these cremes and all this stuff doe not work and doe not help you , to look younger and fresher , a it wa promised . one of the best example is the new coke zero . less sugar , even zero sugar but with the best taste you can imagen . so drinking coca cola will not longer be bad for your theeth and shape , the advertisment is telling u . but this is untrue . replacing the original sugar through chemical reproduction , the new coke affect in the same way our theeth and shape like the old one did . in addition to that , in germany there is at the moment a run on product indicating to you and shown in serveral advertisments , that after consuming them , you are feeling better and fitter . so called wellness-products . in this case the problem is the word wellness is not saved and everyone is allowed to use it . so now many producer in germany put the word wellness on their product and sell it to the people . people buy them , hopping to feel better but nothing will happen . wonder why , it is the same product a it wa before only with an changed name which include wellness . so i think almost every product shown in television seems much better than it really is . consumers have to fight against this , because everyone ha an right to know what is in the product and if the are helpfull or not .
