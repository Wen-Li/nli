i am agree with this statement . it 's true that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . as advertisement are used to attract customer and to make the product more popular , the company would n't lose this chanllege to show the best side of their product . sometimes , they also give an image which is not true of their product to customer . this is an image which customer desire but not an image which below to the product . we kow that most company face to a great competition , there are son many comapnies produce the same product . so company have to do much effort in order to be more stronger . meanwhile , if there is one comopany have atoped some advertisement to make it product more attractif , it 's not fair that others company of the same sector do nothing . but should customer be victim of company ' competition and profit ? no , we are the customer , and we have the right to know the truth . we want to buy the product which we want . we pay for what we desire , and we wo n't pay for lier . in some paticular sector , like medicin , some people died because advertisement did n't give the truth . but there is n't a rule agains this action . so between moral and rule , we should have a correct choice .
