i partially agree with this statement for many reason . young people have le responsability , they just have to study or work , or both , but after this they usually have spare time to spend with friend , having fun . this is a nice aspect of being young . young people have their thing to think to , but rarely they 're responsable for someone else 's life . older people have more to think to . they usually have a family which brings a lot of joy , but also a lot of stress ; financial stress for example , parent 's have to think how to earn many to go on , to make their child study and have fun . young people do n't have this type of problem and this make their life more enjoyable , in a certain way . young people want to feel strong emotion and live new experience . everything ha to be intense : loud music , disco , staying out late at night . older people already lived these emotion , they know how it feel to be young , but they do n't need these feeling anymore . they belong to the past . i think that when one get older , he find joy and happyness in smaller thing . for example just by spending an afternoon with his family or old friend . there 's no need to stay up until the break of dawn , but just to live life and appreciate it simple thing . this doe n't mean that older people can not have fun , it 's just a different way of having fun . a young man 's challenge are ( in my case ) : university exam , human relation , family life and a job to pay cd 's and amusement . growing up one need more , or ( i think ) should need more than just having fun dancing at the disco . after the study one need to find a job , someone to love and to start a new life on it own . a marriage is a great accomplishment . the partner and the son become the most precious thing one could have . this is happyness . i do n't believe young people enjoy life more than older people . the way of having fun change with time , but life is always enjoyable .
