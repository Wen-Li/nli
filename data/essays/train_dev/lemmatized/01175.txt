some people like to have broad knowledge of many academic subject while others prefere to stick with one subject and do the best they can improve what they learn . personally i prefer to specialize in one subject for many reason i will explain in this essay . first of all , consentrating on one subject make you a professional and knowledgable in that subject . also when you give a mach of your time a you can , you will be very successful . it is better to stick with one subject than being confused with many subject which will you forget in the future . secondly , it is a quiet challenging when you specialize in one subject . for example , when pick one academic subject and study it for you whole life and get an advaced degree , your life is going to be better and your child will get better education . talking about myself , now i am thirty-three year old and i am still studying and trying to get my master degree in engineering . i picked that subject when i wa in highschool and still is in mind and do whatever it take to finish what i started and it is like challenging myself . finally , i would like to say that picking one subject is much better than having more subject which very complicated for me . specializing in one subject is even challenging yourself or others , and also you should put your mind in thing to be successful in life and be better educated .
