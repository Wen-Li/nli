life is a journey from birth to death . through this journey , a person experience many thing . but when it come to enjoying life , certain quality of a person affect the level of enjoying . one of this quality is person 's age . and i think , the le your age is , the more you enjoy life . that is , young people enjoy life more than older people do . first reason that come to my mind why youth is more enjoyable is because you are healthier when you are young . if you are not healthy nothing can cheer you up a much a it is supposed to . it is obvious that when you get old , health problem begin to lower your satisfaction from life . and also the thing to stay healthy get harder to make , for example , sport . in addition to health problem , the fear of death begin to bug your mind more often when you get old . when a person is young he/she rarely think about death , because it seems far away from him/her a if it would never ring his/her door . existence of this fear make life le enjoyable than it wa when he/she wa young . hope is a very important thing when it come to enjoying life . hope make you to gain the power needed to struggle with the problem of life . thanks to the many year ahead of the young person and relatively bad experience , he/she keep his/her hope more easily than an experienced old person . hope may not be necessarily result in a desired situation but the hope itself make life more enjoyable . lastly , a a more personal opinion : if i wa an old person i would be sad that i wo n't be able to see the possible advancement in world . for example , i can predict that we will be able to see man like robot in twenty-thirty year . having the possibility to see these advancement make life more enjoyable for me .
