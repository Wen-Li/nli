i think , that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than to specialize in one specific subject , because nowadays is very important understand and know a little bit of everything . in my opinion , day after day , life is becoming harder than before , you need of a lot of different skill and competence , not just to find a good job but for every day life . for example , when you apply for a job , they ask you a lot of information like : subject studied at school and at the university , computer skill . in a lot of job , you need to speak more than one language and moreover you have to be always updated with politics , economics and marketing information . in these last year , the school of different country in europe , are improving the knowledge of many academic subject . they are introducing many different subject that are becoming more important for the life , like , computer course , technical competence , marketing , economics and politics . in my opinion , it is very important to understand and to know different subject , because you can talk with the people of differents matter and you can say your opinion . moreover , when you read newspaper , you can understand better the problem of the world . on the other hand , if you want to do a specific job , for example you want to be a child doctor you need to specialize in one specific subject . i think that there are a lot of job that need of specific competence and you have to study very hard to specialize in one in one specific subject . i can not image if a doctor doe not know well all the disease that a person can have . .. what a mess will be
