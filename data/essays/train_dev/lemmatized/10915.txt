nowadays people are talking about a broad range of controversial topic . one of these topic is big amount of car that are used in the world . some people belive that whithin twenty year the number of car must be reduced a lot . however there are just a many people who do n't agree and say that there will be a growing in the quantity of car used in the world . both of the group have several reason to argument their opinion . one the one hand those who believe that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than nowadays , say that the goverments of the differents country must set restriction in the use of car to stop contamination problem caused by the combustion gas , such a acid rain or the growing of the hole in the ozone layer . also many people want to prevent car coming into the city centre in order to make the city more confortable to their citizen a well a to avoid traffic jam . on the other hand there are people who strongly feel against the reduction in the number of car that will be in use in the future . their main reason to say this is that the car is quicker than the public transport therefore it allows people to save time in their movings . furthermore the high prize of the ticket for the bus or the underground do n't help leaving the car at home . to sum up the topic of the number of car in use in the future will remain controversial . while some people mantain that in twenty year the number of car in use will be smaller , you can find just a many people who think that this number must even grow . in my opinion , unless we discover any kind of non-contaminating car , we should restrict the use of vehicle to preserve our planet in good condition .
