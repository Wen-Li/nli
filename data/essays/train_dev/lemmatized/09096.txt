due to experience i have made not only within my closer circle of acquaintance but also in other country , i can agree with the statement to a certain degree . yes , many young people are not prone any more to commit themselves socially and help their community . in the time of the `` computer age '' , a lot of young people find it more interesting to play computer game with americans of french than to go outside and look for people who really need help . some time ago , my school started an appeal that older , more experienced student should help younger one to get along in critical subject like latin or math . it can be seen a a major catastrophe that only three student acutally showed up and offered their assistance . all others used excuse like `` lack of time '' or just blatantly revealed their aversion against spending time to help others . this reluctance may also be a result of the transformation many society undergo during the process of globalization . the loss of importance of the local communites also affect the church , an institution that ha always taken care of the disadvantaged member of societey and that ha encouraged especially young people to help . these day , these young adult lack this encouragement and incentivement . the solution to the problem may not necessarily be to revive church a a social institution , altough this could be helpful . however , one ha to use the receding to boundary to show people where and how they can help . numerous student do not know that they are actually needed in their community . but in the age of the internet - with which many young people spend a significant amount of time - it should not be too difficult to convey that message . everyone , from every remote location , ha the possibilty to encourage young people to commit themselves in society
