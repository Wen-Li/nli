sure , i think the successful people always take risk and try new thing because they have high self - confidence , they believe on every idea that he or she is thinking and sacrify . while other kind of person keep doing the same thing all the time because they fell save . the successful person always see the world like a place to develop new project , although maybe , these will not have the good result . but there , is playing a specially situation , the self-confidence . a success person not always have all the idea like a glass , because in this world there are a lot information . but , they take or use all the information first , to develop thing . maybe they will take much time to have the answer but one day , they can have a excellent project . second , if person believe that her or his idea is good , this person will finish it . but one person that always play to keep save never have a new idea to follow . third , all these characteristic , after mentionate , are important but the sacrify is necesary , too . one persona who doe not have sacried something never will reach a subject in her or his life .
