recently , it is said that young pepople do not give enough time to helping their community . i agree this opinion , because young people of nowadays are so busy of their own thing , and they are poor ability of communication , and they regard the community a not so important . on the first , young people is very busy , because they need to go to prepschoop after school . in japan , the end of primary school , there are entrance examination to the junior highschool . so they need to study hard . moreover they learn many kind of thing , for example , tennis , swimming , piano , something like that . .. after enter university , they are busy to social life such a the party , part-time job , the date . . there are no time to spend for their community . secondly , young people do not know how to communicate with the many kind of people . usually they are grown up small familly , so they are not good at communicate another people except their familly or school mate . so it is difficult to communicate for them . thirdly , young people regard the community activity a not so inportant . some of them are busy for theirselves , so they think that it is useless to attend the community 's activity . in these reason , i think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . it is pitty , but it is real situation in japan .
