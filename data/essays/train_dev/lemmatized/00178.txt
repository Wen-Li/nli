i agree that the people nowadays do not devote enough time towards helping their community . the community can prosper only when everyone get along and make the community better in many way . these may be due to various reason . one reason is today people hav become so busy that they hardly have time to spend it with their community they are so preoccupied with other matter that they dont give that much prefernece to whats going on in the community . they hardly are able to make enoungh time which can be spent with community let alone helping it . because of their complex lifestyle people generaly prefer to have time to spend in other intresting thing than going to community and help others . even though it important to help community one cant be forced into talking up the cause . the people can not be forced into doing communitiy service without their willingness . the people who do not do coommunity service doe not know what it is all about the imagine it a one of the borin thing in life . another thing which take people away from helping community is theit hectic schedule . the people usually work in weekday and want to relax during the weekend . the consider helping service a job which make them think whether they should get involved or relax and get ready for the next week . due to their poor knowledge regarding what is meant by ` helping their community ' also big factor which force people away from the participating in community service . people should made aware of the effect the helping can make on the society it is for their betterment that this type of service are being conducted . the people are more concerened about themseleves and do not give much attention to the happening in the society . for example lack of awareness people dont even now whats going on in their surroundings . to conclude people are getting away from their duty . they tend to forget their responsibility towards community which indeed is a larger family . helping the community will only give satisfaction that he or she ha contributed to the society in one way or another . thus people should try and make some time for helping others in community , which can only make the community better to leave in .
