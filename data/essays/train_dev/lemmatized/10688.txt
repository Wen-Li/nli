traveling is an experience that is extremly related with every individual 's personality , style of life , and interest . that is why people travel in very different way and there is always a market for every type of traveler . for me traveling in a group led by a tour guide is one of the worst and most unconfortable way of traveling since i am an adventurer and in those kind of trip it is difficult to get so much flexibility a i like . traveling for me is one of the best way to form our own personality and to have experience that will shape our life for ever . when you have a tour gide , the possibility of achieving those experience will be drastically limited because you will always be lead by another person 's point of view . visiting museum , ruin , antique building and all of the rich historical place for me is what make the difference on a trip but being led by a tour guide on all of them is not the kind of experience i would like . it is important to have a guide while visiting historical place because you learn thing that by yourself you would never have discovered but , the problem is when the guide is the same person in all of them like in most tour guided trip . when group travel with one guide they recive the point of view of only one person everywhere they go . i believe that history is is closely related with fact but those fact are always related with the historian 's point of view , tour guide a every person who know about history imply their opinion on their explenations and by listening only to one person will limitate u to create our own judgement . flexibility is also very important for me when traveling . i am a kind of person who like to decide every detail of the trip and by having a tour guide you are not able to do those kind of desicions . also i belive that doing several thing with out planing are always fun because the experience will be always different . this way we meet different people , we live thing that we thought we never would and finally i could say that we are able to enjoy thing that we thought were not going to happen . traveling , meeting new people , living new experience , ha made me the person i am now . i do not like to be led by someone else . i think that defending my personal opinion is the most important thing i can do . traveling with a tour guide may be the best way for traveling for many people but for me traveling is so personal that it ha to be an experience compleatly of your own .
