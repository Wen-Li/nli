i personally agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i may say that this aspect of our contemporary society is not due to the selfish behaviour of new generation ; there is something deeper that can explain this situation . we belong to the internet era ; everything is flowing , everything is moving very quickly . the society and it way of living have changed a lot from the 20th century : nowadays people have le time for themselves and so for the others . although helping poor and needy people and other remarkable activity are still commom in our community , very few young people do that , just because they are not educated to ; the will to help their own community is something that young people have to find inside themselves and only their parent can help them in this . to sum up i might say that every era in history ha it own child . the globalisation era ha been making the world like a big total town ; everything is near or it seems to . in this situation we can understand why a little community may not catch the attention of young people ; they are son of the world and they might find difficult to look at it from the perspective of a little town .
