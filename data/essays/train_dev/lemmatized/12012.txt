people face an overwhelmig number of challenge and difficulty during their life . and there is no specific time for the occurance of good or bad moment . each one is living his own and unique life , some people enjoy their childhood while the others do n't . therefore , we can never agree or disagree that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . while the fact that young people are usually le responsible than older one can not be denied , we should never forget that some young people witness the death of his parent at early age , and find himself deprived from the care and the love of his parent . then , how can we claim that these young people are enjoying their life ? therefore , we should independently rely on each person 's life and observe the moment of joy and sadness in order to assert whether he enjoys his life a a young more than a an old . besides , many people believe that a person feel much happier when he get older because he ha always waited for the moment he becomes independant from his parent and ready to strive his own path in life . who doe n't like to be independant ? to have his own home ? and later on , to get married and have his own new family ? being hapy in life is relative . it solely depends on the person himself . but what matter is that we enjoy every moment of our life and benefit from the experience and challenge we face
