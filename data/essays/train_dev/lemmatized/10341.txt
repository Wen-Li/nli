i-m agree with the statement and i really hope so . i think that in twenty year a lot of thinghs must change and the use of car is obsolutely one of these . considering first the main problem > the price and the disponibility of petrol . in twenty year maybe some giaciments will be empty and the new one more and more unusefull becouse of the revalities between the east and the west of the world . so if the price of petrol is too hight we can-t use the car , is too expensive for a family have two or three car . .. so become only one . another important reason to get fewer the number of car is the pollution ! if the number of car continue to encrase we will be summersed by smog , smoke and poison ! isn-t possible to live in a world more sick than this . i think also that inthe 2026 all town will have new kind of bus and train more conforteble , cheaper and faster than the actual one . so to go to the work , to go out for a pizza or to do anithing else you will take the underground not like now . infect a lot of town don-t have underground an the most of people don-t fell safeful taking it ! for example i-ve been in japan , to kyoto and i can surely say you that there wasn-t traffic !! all by bicycle or by train ! so you can go aroud and not hear the noise of the car and without sniff their smell ! i rally hope that in all the world people can enjoi their country , can live in town without problem and expecially that all economical and en problem close to petrol will desappear ! i give you 20 year of time
