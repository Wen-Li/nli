i do not agree with this statement . i believe that we are , now , able to see what it show really in advetisements . i will tell you reason using advertisement of car maker . first , we are having , now , real eye which we did not have about 40 year ago where tv advertisement wa introduced . at that time every car shown on the screen might have seen much better than it really were . because we could not get much information of car a it depended on only visuality . but now we have so many sauce of infomation , for example car magazin , special internet site and so on , in order to know real product of car . after we collect all , we can know the reality . second , whenever we saw advertisement , we became to suspect what it said on screen or paper . in other word , we became wiser enouth to know the real product . now we are living in the world full of information , we became carefull whenever we buy anything . finaly , when we plan to buy a car , we are trying to find the information from our side . we are not just waiting for it anymore from car maker . the meaning of advertisement ha been changed since the internet had been introduced . advertisement give u a chance to show where we could find our desired information . as a conuif advertisement try to make u deceive , it doe not work any more in the modern time .
