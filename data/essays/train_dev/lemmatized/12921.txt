the way your are living your life and the vision you have about are obviously changing when you get older . you are not the same when you are 15 than when you are 70 . at the first view , young people enjoy living much more than older . but on the other hand , maybe older people know how to live more intensely than the young . you just have to look out in the street . you will probably see kid playing , cry , hurting , running . .. look better and you will be able to gaze two tenagers kissing each other behind a tree . that is life ! these young people are dry from life . they have so much to discover , so many thing to try . every moment is a surprise . on the contrary , after long the year spendt on earth , you probably have lived everything , you do not expect a lot of thingd \ s from life . and in many case , the older you are , the more difficult your body to use is . so how enjoy life a much a when you are young ? indeed young people seem to enjoy life more , but is n't it an important advantage to have experience to live better ? young people can not understand how life is precious . they live their life a they burn match . life is just a highway in wich you have to drive the a fast a you can . but this is not enjoying life . it is living in a hurry . when you grow up , your experience help you to deal with problem and more important , to really appreciate the time you spend , for example with other people . when you are young you can not realize how lucky you are . but wiseness come with the year . and it is when life ha really hurt you than you realize this kind of thing which allow you to live in a better way and ti enjoy more life .
