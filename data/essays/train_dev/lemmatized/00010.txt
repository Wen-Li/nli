i agree with the statement . knowing fact is very important but we always need to think , and i believe that it is more important to have better understanding of thing and concept to make good decision in real life . understanding idea and concept give you a skill of sloving a problem when you come across to something . understanding idea and learning fact are closely connected . if you have an idea about something , you think about it , learn about it , and everntually learn a fact . in another word , is a process of learning fact . for example , if you know what is happening in iraq , if you do n't have an understanding for it , you do n't do anything for it . facts without your opinion or concept are useless even though how important the fact is . process will lead you to the result and you learn a lot of thing through out the process . i believe this from my experience . once when i had a homework to search about the titanic , i wa just looking for a website that say what happened to it in the beginning , but soon i realized there were lot of thing that happened other than sinking nad i learn much more interesting event that actually happened before it sank . process is more important than a fact and i will lead you to the result which is a fact . sometimes , i say to myself `` care about process than a fact '' because it is easy to forget and only look for a fact .
