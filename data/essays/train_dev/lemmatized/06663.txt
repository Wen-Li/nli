advertisements are born to sell a product and , in order to this , to invite people to buy something . of couse they need to be actractive for the public and obviously they look better than they are . personally , i will never spend my money for a good that is represented in a way i do n't like , for example if it doe n't seem beautiful to my eye . particularly , if there are more type of the same product , i 'm going to prefer the one that in the advertisment look better , even if i know it lack in quality . the most significant thing for a lot of people is only appearance . another important aspect of advertisments is that they have to catch the attension of an a great a possible number of people , in the middle of thousand of similar advertisments . moreover , the greatest part of people doe n't have or , better , doe n't want to waste his time in controlling the real usefullness of a product and so they have to trust in what advertisment tell . so it 's obvious advertisments make poducts seem better than they realy are , it 's their `` job '' . although this , advertisments have n't the right to do disinformation about a good . they ca n't deforme the reality beyond a certain line , because this could be dangerous even for the advertise itself . a said before , people have to trust in advertisments , but if this fail this aim more than one time , people will change kind of product , choosing to listento another advertisement . it 's a matter of trust , but above all it 's a matter of money . even if it 's not very correct to behave like this , it 's natural in a world of buisness .
