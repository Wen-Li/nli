will we have more car in the future or not ? this is a question that many people would like to find out whether they are car producer , environmentalist , or just regular people who either taking public transportation or owning a car . however , i think it is important to address that different part of the world might have different result . it is because people in different place give different cultural meanigns of the car and they might have different priority in relation to what is imporatnt to them a a group . i will start by pointing out how different place preceive car in some way and how these difference might increase or decrease car in the future . first , in some developing country , such a china , car is a symbol of modernity and wealth . when this connection is formed and built , it is quite difficult to expect that poeple will decrease car in use within twenty 20 year since what people desire is development . and , this image of developement happend to also mean `` having car . '' in this sense , i think it is quite unrealisitic to agree that people will diminish the amount fo car . after all , the major goal of these place is economic development and decreasing the ownership of car contracdicts to their major goal . on the other hand , for some place in the world , especially country in the west , the meaning of car and the prority of what is imporant to them are different . to them , car is more or le merely a tool . although i do realize that some people in the west aslo use car a a symbol of prestige , there is a degree difference in relation to how stronger that a car is tied with the concept of modernity . meanwhile , peopel in teh west might think the envirnment protection is at least a important a development , if it is not more important . in this sense , when car do not carry such strong desire of being modern , meanwhile the idea of environmentialism is appreciated , it is more likely that there will be le car in the nearly future . therefore , i think teh amount of car will decrase in some area in the world meanwhile decrease in other area depends on different context and the symbolic meaning of car in different culture . i think it is problematic to make a universal statment on this issue .
