school is a very important social structure where student can form their mind thanks to the information given by teacher . usually teacher believe that the exposition of fact is the most important part of what is called `` didactic '' . they expect pupil to learn the fact and to repeat them exactly in the same way the teacher taught them . this clealy creates a kind of disfunction of learning in the student who ha to learn mere fact . according to me the best way to improve both teaching and learning is the use of fact a the material support of a new element : the elaboration of idea and concept deriving from those fact . obviously it is also important to learn , sometimes also by heart , some specific fact , but what doe matter is the ability to search and to find the sense of a fact . people usually believe that learning fact is more important than elaborate them because people suppose that those fact carry the so called `` truth '' . unfortunately the truth is not given one time forever , truth depends on who is speaking , namely thinking . the mere exposition of fact is not a guarantee of truth . students should learn that idea are more important than fact : for example is more important to understand the deep reason that caused the two world wars rather then the day in which they started . it is clear that also the historical fact are important but they are senseless without a specific interpretation and knowledge of the idea . ideas and concept are what move the world , they are at the basis of what we define ideology . every society is based on a specific ideology which is , properly , the melting pot of the idea and of the concept that created that specific society .
