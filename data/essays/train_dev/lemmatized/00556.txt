most advertisement make you to see the good way of the product , but steel been bad , for example the cigarrets , bring a advertisement that if you consume that product can cause serios problem of cancer , so that is not the advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are . i agree that the product bring the advertisement , but dont make sure that is good , because the contain is the same . so is not better product or worst if that bring and advertismenet but , make more value if thatt cause and effect like do not drink or smok , because can cause serios problem , and the people really dont buy it because they know the consecuences because the advertisement said . a lot of people dont really care wath the advertisement say or may be just make joke about it , some of the baby product bring and advertisement that you can not give to your child if it is le than 3 year for example , and the people just dont get it and they give it to their child , so when something happend they dont want to asume the consecuences or they dont want to know that they have the fault . i dont really think that an advertisment it is enough , sometimes we need more than advertisment to do not buy a bad productc . but in the other hand , is not good to advertise for and industry to the people that their product is bad or can cause bad consecuences , becuse some of the population can stopped to buy it . so , in conclusion i agree that the product most bring and advertisement but dont make better then they really are , so we have to take care of all product that we buy every day , and read what they are trying to said . so thats is a i agree with this statement .
