the issue at hand is to know how the evolution of the population will contribuate to the development of the utilisation of car . i 'm agree with the prompt , thet state that in `` twenty year there will be fewer car in use '' first , the development of technology make that it easier to use other way that car for traveling . in fact , nowaday , the underground are very developed , and faster than before , and also really good accomodate to the people 's need . moreover , people have been used to use car to travel far away or to go to vacation site , but today habit have changed . people want to spend more time to enjoy than to travel so they choose to go with plane or train , and so do n't need car . those new habit made me believe that it will be fewer car in use than there are today . secondly , i believe that it will be fewer car in use , because there is to much trafic in the city . the fact tht in the last few year the number of car increase make a lot of diffuculties to drive into the city . to do just one kilometer you spend more time to wait in your car that to drive . i know from my own experience of driver , that if i want to be on time for a meeting i 'd rather choice to wolk or to use the subway , so we do n't need a car anymore . therefor i believe that it will be fewer car . futhermore , i believe that it will be fewer car because people are more and more understand the inpact of car on the envirement . in fact , the increase of car those few decade made the level of pollution very high . with the help of scientist who explain affect of gas on the envirement , people will choose another way to travel without having an impact on the envirement . for this reason i think that it will be fewer car in the future . finally , in my view it will be le car because it become very expensive to have one . in fact , i 'm living in paris and with all the new investigation there no place to park the car without paying , and with all that the price of the fuel doe n't stop to increase , so you understand that people thimk twice before they decide to by a car . this point also make me believe that the number of car in use will be fewer than today . to conclude , i think that it will be le car in twenty year thant today because car doe n't still have all the advantage of those day , and now much more desadvantage make the driver use other wat to travel .
