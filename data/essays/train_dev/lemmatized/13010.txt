in my experience i have learned that having a broad knowledge of everything is much better than only just focusing in one specific subject . when you are having a group conversation if you do n't know anything about the topic at hand you will be seen a a person without any kind of knowledge . on the other hand , if the topic that is being discussed is your topic of specialization there will be an advantedge between you and the rest of the group . unfourtunately , conversation topic change a lot so the situation mentioned above will rarely happen . i am someone who know a lot about a lot of thing , this give me an advantedge above other people because it may give me a really good appearence . since apparences are vey important in modern day society having a broad knowledge is of great importance . one example of this sort of situation can be ; if i 'm applying to a university or a job , my interviewer will not ask me question about one topic in particular . he will interrogate me about a series of different topic , because , in general , people want people who know about anything and everything . in a way , society oblies you to know at least a little bit about everything . what is the point of high school ? high school is a phase before the university in which you are supposed to gain a wide knowledge that help a a base for your superior study . everytime you turn on the television you learn something , when you see channel , live discovery , that specialize on documentary on a huge variety of topic , when you read a book or magazine . society imposes knowledge and one should be happy to accept it and use it when ever it is oportune . in my opinion , and based on my own experience , i beleive that the more you know the better .
