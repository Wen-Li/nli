`` where there is a will , there is a way '' , this may be the successful people 's favorite sentence , and may be the key of their success . as a matter of fact it is by willingness that they have reached their goal , and having goal , dream is already risky . sometimes to achieve one 's dream it implies that you will have to go further than your natural border . success go with risk , if you do not try to do anything , and then stay with what is securing for you , you will never be successful . if you are already successful it will be easier for you to try plenty of new thing , because you are sure of what you have already achieved . we can take the example of the president of an international company , he is setting up numerous business in many different sector ( such a megastors , soda , aircrafts etc. ) , he know what are his company competency but he still is looking forward to create something new . even if one or two of his new start ups fail , he will have the others to secure his position . however , i assume that they really know what they are doing , they are not planning thing that they know , they will not be able to keep . they do take risk or try new thing , but they are also aware of what they can do , of what they know , and therefore , they are not risking so much in what they do . successful people certainly have a lot of confidence on what they can do , and in their quality , thus they will be able to reach their own ambition in life at any price . but they are smart enough to know when and where to stop , they may take more risk but these are known and controlled . and perhaps this ambition give them the interest in going always further .
