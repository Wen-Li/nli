i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are two reason for this ; healthy and changing the life . first of all , young people are more health than older people . if young people feel that they want to climb up the mt , fuji , they can climb up . however , older people could n't . this is because , most older people are bad health . another thing is that they may have not energy to move , so they can not go abroad . they will feel that own country is more confortable than ather country . second of all , young people have longer life than older people . by trying a lot of thing , young people will change their life and the way of thinking . older people are hardly to change the life by trying new thing . for example , when young people listen to the music of an artist , they may change the thinkig . then they want to be artist may be . for these reason , i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
