i completely disagree with the statement that , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the first reason for my belief is , if any company or industry make any false statement about their product , they will be in loss not only with that particular product even for their entire life time . next time if they come up with really good product and they start adverising in the tv and in newspaper , but no body is going to buy it , a they already have very bad impression about their earlier product . so gaining confidence of the customer is very important for profit . so when they advertise about the product they should not lie about the product consequently the product or particular company will build a good rapport with the customer . the second reason for my belief is , not all the company will cheat the customer . to have good reputation the company should not expect the profit initially , first they should be humble with the customer and try to improve the marketing of their product . for example take johnson and johnson company product , initially they tried not to exaggerate about their product or not to lie about the product , they created some sort of trust in their customer . so a they come up with new product some time they do n't even have to advertise their product , just by looking at their company name cutomer will buy the product . thirdly , there are few product which will be given over impression a they really are . but it should be healthy it should not be something which play with customer life . some product will sell fast just the way they advertise the product . for example some clothing advertisement , they can give any type of advertisement because it is not going to have any kind of life threatenings , the same thing if they do in some medication which ha really bad side effect and still if they do false advertisement that is not healthy . advertisemant play very important role in competing with the other product , the competition should be healthy way , it should not be unhealthy , by false advertisement the company not only get loss but also never can be good reputitive company or product , even they come up with real good product . above mentioned reason will support my disagreement with the statement given `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' .
