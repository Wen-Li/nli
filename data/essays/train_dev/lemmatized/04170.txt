in older time , there were complete civilization that will see older age a the crown of life , the time when the spirit is free from the earthly passion and the brain is finally let alone to think , a opposed a younger age when uncertanty and emotion dictate people 's behaivor . in old greece only old men would have an opinion in politics and law . in china and in some muslim country only the elder can solve day to day problem and their opinion would be respected even when opposed to common sense . something happened to our culture that inverted the place of old people in our society , placing the young and brave on top while older people is seen a dumb and slow , to the point to pretend that they do n't enjoy life . there are a lot of activity that can be enjoy only when people is young , like snowbording and playing most sport . other thing require a very young age ( at least to start ) like ballet dance and gimnastics , but the fact that older can not enjoy this activity doe n't mean that they can not enjoy other activity , like traveling , reading , talking to friend , playing chess ( and i can tell my grandmother is a great chess player ) or visiting the family . there are still few sport that they can play regardless of their age like golf . therefore i disgree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because i think that there are many way to enjoy life and it may not require the adrenaline rush obtained by extreme sport nor the ability to dance in the disco all night . life enjoyment can come from simple ting like smelling flower , folding paper , painting , chatting and visiting old friend and far away country . i hope that when i grow old , i will still have the hability to love my wife and enjoy life with the many activity that i will be able to do , but i also understand that for other activity i have a limited amount of time and i hope to enjoy them a long a i can , because the day will come when i will need to stop if i dont want to get injured , and i will need to find new way to enjoy life
