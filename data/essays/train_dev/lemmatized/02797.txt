i think , fact are always real and ha been observed by many people in the society , i have seen many example like , if you do n't try to work hard in your business and just having idea and concept , thats is not going to help , because you do n't know what is the fact why i am not succeding . further more , fact are always truth can be veri fied any time in life . every thing you can n't hide from people . if you will find out what is the problem then it ha to be verified . its take time but you will find the way of your problem . for example , many kid doe wrong in theire life , after they tried to hide that some time parent also support that but that is not good idea because one day he will realise than he fel soory and regreat for theire parent what they teach u . facts are always learn by situation , like you made a mistake in your life that mistake or accident allow to you learn and you will fact . i am telling my example , i went three time for driving test wa unsucees then after being master in driving how ? i learned lesson what i made mistake than i learned fact . some time understanding ideal and concept help to people finding problem but they can n't realise without gettint fact at last , fact are always real and leanred by mistake . when people realise the fact they should try to improve
