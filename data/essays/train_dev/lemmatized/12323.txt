i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk to achieve thier goal . only if there are risk the life will be more interesting . and also if we work on the same thing we will feel bored . for example if a software engineer work on a same project for several year then there will be no improvement in his techical skill or i will actually lose his imagination power . only if he work in differnt scenario he can improve his own and knowledge and gain experience `` mukesh ambani '' is the best example i think because first he is a successful person in variuos kind of business . first along with his brother he started industry and developed those industry to gain more profit . then he started oil refinery and then come the reliance mobile . apart from this reliance energy resourses are doing a great job in the mutual fund and share market . this also help to provide job for people in different field . if there is only one industry then we can support only the people who are in that field . by trying new business also help to reduce unemployment and to develop various economic level . another one reason of doing variuos business is if there is loss in one of the business we can manage the lose because of the profit in other business . in case we are doing a one business then we can not manage that situation . eg . learning both hardware and software will help when there is le number of job available in software or hardware . so if we learn more and keep you update to date with the new technology then there is no way for loss . may be there are successful people who doe the same which they know ( same bussiness ) but the probablity is very le . trying new thing and developing the new skill set will give u in good position
