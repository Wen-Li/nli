i am disagree with this statement , because for me it is the same important . to understand idea and concept about a topic is important because you know about that , but if you can not see the fact you only will have your own opinion and you may not see how this thing will be carrying to the end . for example if you study biology you can not stayed only reading and understanding concept because when you finished your career you could not work because you do not how that thing make . insted if you learn for diferents fact you know how you should drive a situation in the moment because you have already seen and practiced . in my career , ingeenering , i have to learn of the fact because all that i made should be experimented and prove so this experiment is a fact . for other hand you can think that the fact are not only the most important so in diferents career is not a rule have the fact because are more important idea and concept , but in some case this thing should have some fact to prove and learn . so in my own experience the two idea are many important , if you have the first you should have the second idea , the first can not live whitout the second and the second can not live whitout the first . this idea are a complement each other and i think that the teacher have to carry to the practice this situation . use this two thing , the student feel more self-confident about that they know and how can they solve a problem .
