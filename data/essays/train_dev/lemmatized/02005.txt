the issue at hand is whether in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . it is an important problem , since it will affect humankind 's quality of life , exspecially if car will continue to use polluting fuel . in my opinion there hardly be fewer car in use than today . on the contrary , i believe that the number of car will esponentially encrease . one reason i think that car will grow in number is that i am not acquainted with any effective policy to make car decrease . of course there have been many attemps not to make people use their car ( such a taxation to enter the downtown ) , but any decision have not been made to stop definitely the production of car . this would probably be harmful to many country ' echonomical system , and would mean the end of many car company . another reason i believe that there will not be fewer car in twenty year , especially polluting car , is that the number of car is related to petrol business . as everyone may know , petrol business is one of the greatest in the world and it provides great financial gain to the `` petrol master '' , who have a certain political influence . unless `` petrol master '' will renaunce to their income , there will never be any effective decision to make car decrease . the last reason i think that car will not decrese is that nowadays there are many country in the middle of an economical boom , and their population , in order to satisfy their increasing need of comfort , are buying car . for example just think of china . its huge population on one hand is getting richer and richer , on the other hand is asking for a larger number of car to be produced , since it need them . ultimately i think that it is almost impossible that there will be fewer car in the next twenty year . of course this is not the best option for earth 's life , nevertheless there are not the right condition to get a better one .
