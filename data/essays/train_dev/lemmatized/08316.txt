offcorse i agree to travel by group led by a tour guide , it will be better and nice . many travel agenceys have tripe or journey with group , the tour guide can recognize and know the place that he can take you to it . example , when i wa in germany exactly at munich bavarian city i wa going with agroup to turn at all place , at morning we stay at one place together with all of the group untill the tour guide come , we have a contract with a bus company to go any place in munich , so that day we had gone to aplace called garmish international park , it is located at twenty mile from munich city at the center of huge mountain . it wa very nice place , the tour guide wa telling u about the place and about the casttle their , offertunality we had knew many thing by the tour guide . iso iagree the tour guide because he know many place at can speak their language .
