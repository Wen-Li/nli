some people think that young people now a day do not give enough time to help their community others think that they will give enough time for helping their community but i agree that younger people will give enough time to their community it true . firstly , in the community there is a lot of advantage due to younger people . younger people think that the community shoul be good because they think that if community is good country will good if country is good they will be good for example the people who are base le mean poor people are helped by many group of younger people financially they will maintain a small scale industry by prepering lot of small material that can be used in our country and exported to other country then it will increase our country fame and export that may indirectly or directly on u . secondly i can tell that the younger people are the person mostly spent the elder money . so many of them dont know money value so they want others to look like them so they help to fellow poor friend they want their friend to look like them but this case is not possible in elder because they earn their money so they dont want to put it in other people . we can tell one thing that if any helping foundation are there in community which were developed by film acters and actress the most of the person influenced by those are youth or younger people this is the main thing that is done now a day in my state there is a good actor who make younger people help by giving blood donation camp and eye donation at the end of the year he give the percentage in that most of them are younger people . finally i can conclude that there are some person who will not help to community they are very le compare to young who will help so i can state that young people will help to community .
