genarelaising there are two different academic education approach : one belives that is better to have a brite general knowlege in differens felds , the other think it is better to specialize in a specific domain . though both position have good argument i belive that it is better to specialize on one fiel . first we have to admit that if a student is accepted to a university he or her ha be tought for around 12 year . thus the school schould have jet given a general culture , and had to present a panorama of the differents subject . this is why the student how enter in the university normally ha already choosen his field of interess , and applies for a specific preparation in a scientitic sector . secondary we schould not forget the obiective of univesity an of a student self is to create a proffessionist who is able to manage with his subject and eventually to reserch on it . who could be possible to work and reserch on different not related topic in differents subject ? rarely have the human being the faculty to manage on an higt level competence and knowledge of many academical sector . we normally citate leonardo da vinci a a exeptional genial inventor . .. but of course . . he is an exeption . to conclude we schould integrate the specialization in a well based background of genar knowledge . but at the univerisity in my opinion is better to achive the skill and to denvelope the knowlegdes in one specific subject , than cultivate many subject which knowledge are not deep enought .
