since the middle of the 20th century the number of car on our earth ha been increasing rapidly . but is this trend going to last in the 21st century ( question mark !!! ) there are several point why i suppose that there will be fewer car in twenty year . taking into account that the natural resourses like oil will definitly come to an end within the next decade and consequently the price for fuel will increase drastically , i do n't think that normal people will be able to afford a car . in addition , not only the price for fule might increase , but also car tax and car insurance . even today , it is hard for most people to afford a car . another point is that in my opinion the puplic transportation in most city will be more supported by government in the future . just think of the billion of euro the governtment put into the transrapid . having a look at our city , the limit for car on the street must have been reached by now . i can not imagine that there is space for even more car , especially during rush hour . traffic jam and endless waiting is an every day image on germanys road , the number of car must decrease by any mean in the future . best example for a car - abbanding policy can be witnessed in innsbruck , austria . there , the innercity gas pollution and noice pollution became too much . after voting against innercity traffic , the resident of innsbruck now have the opportunity to sit at the maria-theresien-strasse and enjoy their innercity atmosphere . in my opinion this example should be a guideline for germany and the rest of the western world a well . if politician go on to refuse spending more money on the development of more economical car and the discovering of alternative fuel , i 'm sure that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year . if not man is clever enough to do something against wolrd pollution , environment will strike back some day .
