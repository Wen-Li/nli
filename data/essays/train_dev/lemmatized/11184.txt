i agree with the statement . we can see someone who success in his life with pursuing new thing and taking risk . we should n't be hang on our usual , binded thinking . creating something give u successful life , happy emotion , comfortable feeling etc . for example , our lot of equpiment , a computer , an refrigirator , an radio , an television , an laptop , a microwave etc were invented by someone long time ago . if everybody think same thing just like normal people and behave , we do n't live now with convinence . certainly we could n't manage our life just like now . thank to them , we can live comfortably . more and more the age change , we require more comfortable equipment , facility . we ca n't satisfy our reality everytime . so this time , we try to invent making something which will give u peaceful life . sometimes changing thinking accompanies danger . but we should break the nervous feeling , furious feeling . if we want to get innovation about something . besides , the japarody will create an fresh idea . depending upon only donig what i alreay know how to do well wo n't give me a good effect . it will help me just live commonly . so if we feel like thinking of varying , altering , innovating something , we should n't be hesitant to do it . shortly think and do it ! there is nothing to do with an great , huge idea to make an new idea . even if it is very simple and look so shabby , it is enough that you think about something by yourself creatively , differently over other people . only , with the reason , you deserve prasie . i think that development is from not an big idea but an new idea . it will be resource . so if we want to alter from out-fashioned to out of stated , we should try to do it . it will lead u to have successful life .
