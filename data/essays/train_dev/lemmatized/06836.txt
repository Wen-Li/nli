broad knowledge of many v specialization in one . in my opinion , it is important to have knowledge of various subject that are inter-related with specialization in a specific subject . this is in contrast to having broad knowledge of many subject or having specialization only in one specific subject . this ha to be seen in the perspective of the interrelation of various field to each other and the impact they have on the development and progress in another field . many theory in physic could only evolve because mathematician could find solution to the complex problem that such theory or hypothesis posed . if however , mathematician and physicist worked in isolation , they would not have been able to find solution to the problem that they encountered . infact , many of the greatest physicist were great mathematician aswell , right from archemedies to newton and more recently einstien . these person are physicist , but if they did not have exposure to mathematics they would never have been able to prove many of their theory . even in modern time , advance in computer technology have helped in innovation in all sphere . however , the requirement of other science ha also pushed the computer scientist to make better and faster machine . for e.g. , weather forecasting requires computer to carryout complex mathematical calculation . this ha pushed computer scientist to make faster machine and ha helped mathematician and meteoroligists to collaborate to develop forecasting model to predict weather pattern and simulate the same . these would however , not be possible if the people engaged in such research were totally ignorant of the advance in other field . they may not have specialization in every field but would need to have broad knowledge of the other field to be able to interact meaningfully with each other to achieve their goal . at the same time it is abudantly clear from the example above that the many advancement in science and techonology have come about a the person engaged in these had specialization in their own field and ha enough knowledge of others to call up the expertise of others or their own faculty to help them in their chosen field . thus it is important to have knowledge of the subject which can have an influence on one 's core area of work and have specialization in the core area .
