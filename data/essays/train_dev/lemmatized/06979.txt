generally speaking , i agree that it 's more important for student to understand concept than to learn fact . however , both studying method present advantage and disadvantage . first of all , though memorization ha the advantage of requiring le concentration and le effort from the student , it 's more likely to forget what you learnt by heart after a short time . on the other hand , though understanding idea in depth take a longer time and implies more effort from the student , it is easier to remember the concept you adequately understood , and to relate them to your background knowledge . for example , when i study maths , i realise that i ca n't simply memorize information , and that i really have to understand every detail in depth . on the other hand , i admit that sometimes it might also be useful to learn fact by heart . for instance , when i study history , it often happens to remember historical event according to the chronological order they occured . in this case , i think that it 's not necessary to spend time trying to understand idea , a i am just expacted to learn a list of event by heart . thus , though i really prefer to understand idea , i think that my position is between these two extreme . in fact , i choose my approach according to the subject i am studying . when dealing with a scientific subject like maths , i prefer to understand every detail in depth , a this is necessary to solve exercise and to be adequaltely prepared . on the other hand , when i am just expacted to memorize information , i prefer to learn fact by heart . for these reason , i believe that my approach to studying is between these to extreme method .
