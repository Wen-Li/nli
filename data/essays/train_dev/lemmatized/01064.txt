young people enjoy life more than older people ? i think this is a really hard question . both side have their own benefit . the role in life are kind of inverted . when you have the health to enjoy life , you dont have money , have to work , and cant enjoy it . then , when you are old , you have the time and money , and because of your health , you cant enjoy it a much is if you were younger . i dont agree in part with the proposed statement . when you are young , you have little problem and consequently live without stress , enjoying . once you start growing the problem get more serious and you start to feel the stress . i like very much to be young and am now detrmined with the thing i am pursuing . i am not going to tell you that i enjoy working a doing sport , but i enjoy my work too . if i could choose , i wouldnt change my position . life is about stage and i try to enjoy each of them . older people enjoy life in a different way . their knowledge and position allow them to enjoy specific situation ; obviously depending of the stage in which they are . they could have had retired and be travelling aound the world , they could have had their first nephew , they can enjoy reading about their real interest , they can spent some time in their beach house , they can play some tennis , they can develop their entreprneurship interest , etc . summaryzing , they have more experience and are in total control of their life . if they have a stable economic situation , they can do whatever they want and really enjoy life .
