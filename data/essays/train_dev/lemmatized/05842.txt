most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are , and i agree with the idea . those item sometimes betray people and do not work a much a it say on the advertisement , though it is customer responsibility to choose and purchase what they want , and business company have right to do so . first , a i mentioned before , it is customer responsibility to choose and purchase what they want . if they do not want to try , they really do not have to . if customer want to know how well it work , they can ask the opinion from someone who had used the product before purchasing it . furthermore , advertisement is crutial to business world to attract customer and increase the number of purchase . if they fail , they will not compete other rival company , which making the similar product . in my own experience , during political science , my partner and i had to run for president and vice president . we had to made twenty plan we will do if we were elected . to attract other student in the class , we had to make up nice plan that are obviously impossible if we were really running for presidency in real life . in conclusion , i agree to the idea of making advertisement which make product seem much better than they really are . afterward it is the customer ' responsibility to choose what they want , and the business world ha the right reason to do what they are doing now to survive .
