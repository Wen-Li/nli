young people are usually full of life , and need that extra bit of excitement in life to make the life more meaningful and rewarding . but , seeing today 's changing corporate habit , one can certainly notice that having fun and enjoying life is now more of a global attitude , whether that be somebody old or young . but , the people driving this changing mindset , are certainly the younger mind in the business . if one considers example of one of the major software company in india and the world , infosys , one can get a clear idea of how the corporate mindset and behavious is changing with time . people , young or old , working day and night for the company are continuously looking to get a change in their life , may be by taking a break during the day to play table-tennis with one of the colleague , or may be by organizing weekend party at the nearby resort . this drastic change , in fact is happening across all business and society . but the changing mindset is certainly coming because of the incoming of the new generation of people in these field . the young crowd is certainly the one which like to enjoy life the most , and in fact do so . one look at any of the city 's most happening club and party , and we can notice the number of young people frolicking those place . this ha brought a sea of change among the mindest of the whole society , and is now even entering the coporate boardroom . but , the fact also remains that life is not just about party and get togethers . some people also get the enjoyment of their life by being engaged in their work . these people who have the passion for their work , and the drive to excel in the field , see their enjoyment in the work itself . this can be proved from the example of sir richard branson , who ha continuously tried to develop his passion into his work and is hence reaping the reward of the hard work done all this time . such people redefine the age related dilemma about enjoying life , a it brings into the picture more older than younger people who seem to be enjoying their life . in conclusion , i believe that enjoyment of life is not a factor of someone 's age but instead a factor of the activity which defines ` enjoyment ' to a particular person . but , since the change is brought forward in today 's society by the young generation only , there is a majority of younger people who enjoy their life more than their older counterpart .
