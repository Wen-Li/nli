there are two existing view about the expected number of car in the future . one might think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . however , others might think that the number of car will not be fewer in twenty year , even that number will increase . i also believe that the number of car in use will increase a the time pass . first of all , i believe that the number of car in use will increase gradually within time because when we compare today 's situation with the past , we see that the number of car in use considerably increased within time . since i believe that the past is the mirror of the future , i also believe that the number of car in use will increase in twenty year a it did in the past . moreover , i think that the number of car in use will increase a the time pass a a consequence of growing car industry and by the help of medium and commercial . since there is a growing car industry all over the world , the producer produce a much a they can . most of the people can find a car that they like . there are variety of car and at least one of them take the attention of the consumer . moreover , by the help of medium , the car that are produced can be easily seen and discovered by the consumer . it is hard to not get impressed by the appealing car commercial . to sum up , despite the fact the some people believe that the number of car in use will decrese in twenty year , i strongly disagree that it will happen . such a the incrase in the number of car in use in the past , i think it will also increase in the future . moreover ; the growing car industry and the effect of medium will support that increase .
