i disagree with the statement . i strongly think that the number of car in use wil increase in 20 year . there are several reason to support my popnion . one of them is the remarkable increase in population over the world , especially in china . because of the growth of economy in the developing country , more and more people there are becoming rich , and they tend to seek for modern or convenient life . having a car is one of the most outstanding symbol for people to realize that the standard of their living are improved . therefore , a larger number of car will be purchaesd in those country . there may be a strong negative opinion to what i mentioned above because environmental issue caused by fossil fuel that are consumed by car are getting more and more serious . in addition , the recent price upsurge of petroleum might be a great infuence on the car usage . however , i do not think they will be a big problem . nowadays , new technology is being pu into our use to solve the problem of environment or energy security in the future . one of those technology is fuel cell . fuel cell can produce enrgy from hydrogen without emitting green house gas . even though it is useless if hydrogen is obtained by burning fossil fuel , that van bve produced by nuclear power station . also , thanks to introduction of electronic vehicle , we will not need to use fossil fuel to move car in the future . therefore , i am confidrnt that the number of car in use increase inthe
