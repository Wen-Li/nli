do young people enjoy life more than older people do ? this question is a very common one , and a lot of people agree with this sentence . why young people are supposed to enjoy life more than the older do ? ca n't people enjoy life at any age ? first , we you see a baby , he doe n't seem to have problem , the only reason a baby is sad is when he is hungry , and you can see on his face when he is happy or not . then , he fust enjoys life . there is no war , no economic depression in his brain yet . therefore , in that case young pepole enjoy more life than the others . moreover , when you are young , you are le afraid than the others by life . young people can put their life at risk , by doing extreme sport or by having a risky life . when they do dangerous activity such a drinking a lot , jumping a big gap with a motocycle , or doing a backflip in snowboarding , young people say that they enjoy life more than the others , a the others would n't have done those activites a considered too dangerous . young people are le afraid of death than older people do . i still agree with the statement in that case . however , there are many way of enjoying life . you fortunately do n't have to do basejumping to enjoy your life ! in fact , you can have for example good time with friend or with your familly . you can share some very pleasant moment with your husband or wife at any age ! when i see my grand-parents , i know for sure that they enjoy life even if they are about eighty . they still travel a lot and have great experience in foreign country . finally , i think that you can enjoy your life at any age . it only depends on the way you live , and the way you are .
