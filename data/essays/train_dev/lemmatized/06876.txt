it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts it is controversial to say that student should understand idea and concept than learnig fact . it is impotant for the student to understand the idea and the concept a well a to learn fact . understanding the idea and the concept is the first step of the knowledge . if the student do not understand or interprete the concept , they can not learn the fact about the real matter . the student may take wrong path if they do not understand the concept or the idea from the matter . it must be understood that working on an important thing is not easy . so , before the student take any action , they should understand the main idea and the concept from an appropriate matter . if they follow the first step , they may get good result , otherwise it may turn into a bad result . if the student understand the main idea and the concept , it is easy to learn the fact . then they may learn what exactly the matter is and mey get appropriate reason for the cause . for example , in a class room , the student is doing his research and he doe not understand the concept and idea , he may produce a wrong work on what is given to him . once he understan the concept and the idea , it is very easy for him to lear the exact fact . once he understands the concept and idea , it is easy for him to produce the result on his research work . sum sum up , it is coinsided that when the student is working on a project or any other work , he ha to undrestand the concept and idea a well a the fact . then it make student life more easy .
