even if it always usefull to know some major fact , i advocate the fact that it is more important , and fundamental , to understand idea and concept beyond the fact . there are three reason why i perfer to understand concept than to learn fact . first , to understand the concept may allow you to find or discover the fact . for instance , during a biology experiment you can get the right conclusion by reasoning . another way to get the result could be to know by heart the answer ' , but next time the result may be totally different and you 'll not be able to explain why . so learning without understanding may drive you to some dead end . that also the case in a lot of area linked to mathematics . you can find the most of the answer by manipulating a few concept you understood . in addition , the understanding is the basic of any scientific domain which are , nowadays , so highly valued . second , i think that this training of the mind will help you to adapt easily in new situation . i learned japanese character a few year ago . i wa in china a few month ago and i had no big trouble to deduce the meaning of the character and find my way in the city of shanghai . even if the chinese character are more complex than the japenese one , you can still deduce the meaning thanks to the asociation of the unitary character composing the bigger one ( called kanjis ) last , i 'm sure it is the best way to remind thing easily . for instance if i ask you : do you know what are the main color used by miro in his painting . you may know it because you saw many painting from this artist but a very easy way to remind it is the following one . once you know that miro used to live in a small city called ` mont roich ' , which is a small city close to the sea . you begin to understand the first color is the red . it come from roich , which is close to red . the second color is the blue which represents the sea . the third color is the green of a certain plant ` the carroubier ' . and the least one is the color of flower : yellow .
