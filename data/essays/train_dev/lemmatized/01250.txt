about this topic , either option have disadvantage and advantage . if i choose one side , i will choose learning broad knowledge about many subject . there are three supporting idea about my choice . the first reason is broad knowledge about subject help people to have enlarged work choice . if i know knowledge about science , marketing , and bussiness . when i invented good product , i will start bussiness and marketing by myself . i can be an owner of company , scientist etc . these broad knowledge help me to get more choice of job than when i just know about science . furthermore , it will bring more financial profit and better reputation . the second idea is extent knowledge substitute people 's work when if people fail their main subject or work . let 's say i just know about painting industory . when the other substance , which will use instead of paint , is invented , i ca n't get any job because my major knowlegde becomes useless . however , if i knew many knowledge about many subject , i can work at the other area . therefore , learning broad information about subject is better than just learning one subject . the last reason is it help people to stand out at many place . if i just know about science , i can show off when people talked about science , however , except science , i ca n't show off my ability because there are none left about the other subject . however , if i know many part of subject , i can show off my knowledge everywhere and everytime . it help me to live more confidential , moreover , i can self-satisfy . because of these three reason , learning just one subject is not a good a learning broad knowledge about many subject . therefore , i think that if people already learn about just one subject , i wish they got an attitude to pay attention to other subject also .
