most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , i stongly support this view . the medium ha played very important role is misleading people , and made people to believe in what is not true however there are always exception . the medium industry ha been playing with people trust in order to sell the product of diffrent company because they pay alot to make attractive advertisement . to verify my point i am going to give few example . for instance i bought a washing liquid after seeing it on the tv the product give you garanttee that it will take away all the mark no matter how deep they are but after using the product i wa not satisfied . infact it wa just waste of my money and time . i have a rough estimation that 8 out of 10 prodducts are not reliable , after my past experience . alot of thing play a role in making the product so appealing , a high budget advertisement even take well know celeberties to emphasis the quality of the product and to some extent we all believe the well known figurs and we might again mislead ourselves . you may see alot of commercial on the weekend which compel you to buy the product which you really do n't need , you just get impressed by the comercials and later on after using it you realize it doesnot benefit you a the comercial show . another example i bought a shirt from mall after seeing the model wearing it , when i wore the shirt it nothing felt or looked like the model ha promised . the light , the makeup and the setup made it appear far better than the quality and even the look of the shirt . i do believe that there are few product from well known company which have developed trust over time but mostly the others are all not at all satisfying and are just waste of money and time , they play with one feeling . the better the advertisement the better money the company ha paid to make the advertisement to the reality itself .
