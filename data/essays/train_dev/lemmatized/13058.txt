as we can see everyday , car are the most important imlpement people use to travel from a palce to another nowadays . but if this siuation will last to the twenty year later . i do not think so . firstly , a we all know , the car run by oil . but with the development of world , there are more and more car on the stress while the crude oil resourses are running out every minute . with the use of oil , the price of it will go much more higher after twenty year later , a we can see from the year 2003 to this year . if so , most person can not afford the cost of drivening car . secondly , with the development of technology , there are many new kind of communication appear , compared with twenty year ago , for example . so , i can say that the communication between people will be much more convenient twenty year later than today . at that time peolpe can exchange all kind of information on the internet instead of drivening here and there . thirdly , a the atmosphere become worse and worse a the result of oil burned by car , the government of all country will make new law to restrict the use of car . last but not least , also with the technology developing rapidly , there will be many kind of new method of traffic . for instance , the network of the subway in most big city will become much more developed and complex so that people can move themselves by underground railway to any corner of the city more quickly and safely than by using the car . besides , there will be more traffic motheds running by electricity or even sunlight . in conclusion , the world develops day and night . the car do much harm to the enviroment and it is not so safe ( you could notice that they kill hundred of people in the traffic accident everyday ) . more convenient and safe traffic thing will replace the car in the near future . so i think there will be le car after twenty year later .
