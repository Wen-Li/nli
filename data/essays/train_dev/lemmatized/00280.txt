i do not agree with the statement , stating that broad knownledge of many academic subject is better than to specifiy in one specific subject . i think it important to specialize in one specific subject . from my point of view it is important to specialize in one specific subject for many reason a described in the following . first , if you specify in one specific subject you will have a lot of knownledge of a specific subject in contrast to people who rather have a broad knownledge . so when a company is looking for a person who can solve a specific problem they would rather hire a specialist than a person who only ha broad knownledge of a specific problem . another reason for specializing in one specific subject is the development of our society and the business world . since there is increasing competition between company in all sector of business . companies have to start specifying in order to gain all possible ressources available on the market , for example . for this reason , companies start looking more for specialist on a specific subject rather than looking for people with broad knownledge . however , it is important that specialiyed people do also have a little knownledge of other subject too . for example , if a company is looking for a new employee it doe not hire the most specialized person . the company wolud rather pick the most specialized person with the most broad knownledge . in my opinion it is important to know that broad knownledge of many sectors/subjects is important but it is even more important to specify in a specific sector/subject . as a conlusion you can say that it is not only important to specialize in one specific sector/subject . at the same time it is also important to increase one 's knownledge in other sectors/subjects .
