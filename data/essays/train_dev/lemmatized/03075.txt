many people might find ` specialization ' a convincing and advanced position especially in the modern business world . it appears to me , however , that those who have broader knowledge of many academic subject , who might be called ` generalist ' , will be getting more and more important . i work in one of the biggest banking group in japan , which includes more than 30,000 permanent employee and over 10,000 part-time employee . generally speaking , the product and service that a bank provides require high-level and specialized knowledge , particulary in the stage where those product and service are developed and organised . however , those are not provided not only for professional within the same industry but also for ordinary people who do not have any special know-how or skill of financial instrument . in this marketing stage , the importance of those who have broad knowleadge of many academic subject can be clearly identified , because such people have a variety of perspective based on the academic background and can approach the possible customer from various angle . this is one of the most important element in promoting and enhancing business . secondly , according to my business experience , i would like to stress that good manager in an organization often have various academic background a well a a variety of business experience . i am not saying that a specialist who concentrate on one specific subject can not be a good manager . however , in most case , it is the fact that senior manager need to cover extremely wide range of business area . in this context , a company is highly likely to regard those who have broad knowledge based on many academic subject a potential candidate for good manegers or , finally , future board member . in the reason stated above , i believe those who have broad knowledge of many academic subject are more highly appreciated than are those who specialize in one specific subject , especially in the future business world .
