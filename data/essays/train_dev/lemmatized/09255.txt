i agree with the statement that it is more important to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . my reason for this are three fold . firstly , in my opinion , idea and fact are broder termsthan fact . therefore , when a student learns about idea and concept she \ he may also have the chance to see the fact behind them . however , if a student only learns about a fact , he \ she would not be able use this fact when necessary . this would be mainly because of the inability of the student to make this fact concrete in her \ his mind because of lack of idea and concept related with this fact . secondly , learning a fact alone would not probably take the attention of the student very much . however , in oder to motivate student to learn more about their field of study , the topic of their study should be interesting . most probably an interesting lesson would help student to be more willing and more motivated to make further research and investigation about that topic . in that way , understanding idea and concept rather than merely learning fact would help student to develop themselves a well . thirdly , to my point of view , understanding idea and concept make student more creative . if they undertand idea and concept about a topic \ then they can apply them into their life . for example , they can develope new theory . which can also make contribution to their field of study . being creative is a very important aspect and of an education system . due to that reason , understanding idea and concept would be critiical in the personal development of a student . ultimately , for all of the reason i have mentioned above , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
