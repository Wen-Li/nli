i disagree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give sufficient time to helping out their community . on the contrary , their level of awareness about the plight of people around the world ha increased from yesteryear and a growing number of youngster are lending a helping hand to the society . today people are making a mark for themselves at very early stage of their life . young movie star , musician , sportspersons and the like of them are winning the heart of million around them . in the process they are making million . but one can proudly say that a considerable proportion of their fund is directed towards charity . the `` bill and melinda gates ' '' foundation wa set up a long time back when bill gates wa in his prime . the amount of work that ha been put in by the then young couple is commendable when it come to talking about aids and cancer relief . although a middle aged couple now , their work go on . if we dont talk about the celebrity and concentrate our attention on the school kid , we find that community service ha started coming more naturally to them . there is a sense of pride attached with reaching out to the le previliged . children consider themselves to be hero of sort if they do a good deed and help out people . the fact that school and college have taken a positive step by according due importance to social work while considering admission is an added impetus . it prompt youngster to do their bit . even if done out of personal interest , it expose one to the joy of `` reaching out '' and prod them to do more . one can cite numerous example of engineer and doctor who have graduated from ivy league college and can easily make big buck . but statistic show that an ever increasing number of these graduate are turning their back to high paying job in favor of settling down in small village and town . all this because they feel a sense of attachment and duty towards their homeland and truly believe in alleviating the trouble of their nation . thus , the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to their community is unqualified and underrates the contribution of youngster towards building a better society .
