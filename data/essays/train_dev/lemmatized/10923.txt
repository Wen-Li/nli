i completely agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' . young people have different type of thinking and always the mind of young people is wandering all over the world whereas the olderpeople doe n't think more because a they think of their life , family and child firstly , younger people have different type of idea and thinking in mind they always want to be cheerful , they enjoy alife lot and they doe n't think much about family . there will be no limitation for the younger people and they achieve every thing always they want to be whereas older people will have limitation . for example if a young person want to do a stunt he will recklessly do it he doe n't think about the next situation what is going to be happened whereas old person will think of it to do stunt and some time he will egt apanic to do it . young people will have a lot dream which can be achievable wheres the dream of older people can not be achievable sometimes . secomdly young people will enjoy a life lot with no limitation in the world and behaves like a freebird whereas older people ca n't behave like that due to their age and health problem . for example young person want to dance and he will do it with out any hesitation wheras older people wo n't dance a that of young people dueto their age and thinking of their health . even in food point of view also younger people can eat each and every thing but older peoeple ca n't young people have a lot of dream and can fulfil their dream but old people can `` t fulfil their dream at sometime . suppose if a21 yearold person want to invent spacecraft he can invent it but wheras 81 year old ca n't due to his age . so from point of view always young people enjoy life more than old people
