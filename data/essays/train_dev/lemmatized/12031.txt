to be general , student can be childeren , teenager or university student . all of them are not so matured , especially childeren , then teenager , the last one university student . becuase of being so young , they need to learn first , then they can think . in primary school , first they learn how to write and read . to provide communication and understand what it is going to happen in their environment . they try to learn writing and reading . after learning reading and writing they start to read all book , newspaper and to write a poem , a letter , a note etc. , they start to learn more in highschool either about class or about being person . after high school they go to university and again they still need to learn a lot of thing about life and about their major area . because of these situation they need to understand idea first then they can learn fact . if they understand idea first they can think themselves . they can have their own personality . if we do n't teach different but good idea in school , they can not learn the fact in true way . because of that in school , they learn all class like math , chemistry , physic , biology , history , phylosophy , religion , health , etc . after taking these class they understand that which area they like and which occupation they want to have in the future . after graduating university when they get a new job they face to real life and they start to learn fact . because they have responsibility of new job and they earn their own money after all . they do not live their parent anymore and they live alone to take their desicion themselves . at that time they start to real thing in life and maybe they will be worried about their future . because of that they will want to be again a family and they will marry and have a child . according to my witings in the above , first student need to understand idea then learn fact . in my opinian it is the healtiest way for student .
