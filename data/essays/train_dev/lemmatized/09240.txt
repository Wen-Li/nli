i disagree with the statement . if anything , there will be a lot more car in twenty year . first of all , according to what i have learned in school , oil is not a renewable energy source , but there is definately enough of it to meet global demand for at least the next fourty year , if not more . second of all , the number of car ha been increasing since they were first invented around the early twentieth century . so according to this trend , i do n't see how the number of car will suddenly drop within two decade . the reason this statement is even debatable is probably because of the fact that oil is a non-renewable energy source so some people may think that it will eventually run out ( which it will , but not within twenty year a the statement say ) and we will have to find or invent different mean of transportation that do n't require oil . but a long a oil is around and accessable , the number of car will continue to increase . car company - like bmw and land rover for example - are doing everything in their power to increase sale . they 're giving better offer , their increasing the quality of manufacturing and they 're meeting public demand . as long a they can keep their customer content with their product , which they have been doing since their company are flourishing , the number of customer will only increase . i honestly do n't see how the public will just stop buying car for the sake of it . they have n't stopped for the past ten decade , why will they stop in the next two ? i have absolutely every reason to believe that the number of car will continue to increase a they have always increased , for the next thirty or fourty year , till oil eventually run out . a car is probably the most important mean of transportation today . if oil run out , another energy source will just have to replace it . if it doe n't , then yes , perhaps the number of car will decrease . but i disagree with the statement because i believe that the number of car will continue to increase for well more than twenty year therefore the number of car will not be fewer , they will be greater in twenty year time .
