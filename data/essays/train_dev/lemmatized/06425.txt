i really agree with this opionion . what i study now is the technology of electricity . but what i should learn not only this thing . i should learn math , physicals , computer and a lot of other thing . at first , i do n't know why i should learn it , then i know it . if i wa asked to figure out something about the power of electricity , i should use math , and how the electricity move , i also need the knowledge about the power and other ting . sometimes i need some special computer programme to figure it , then i should write these programme by myself . the more borad knowledge of other academic subject will help me the better in my specific subject . not only in my experience , i also think almost all learner would agree it . beacuse nothing is exist in one theroty alone . here is a very simple example : when an apple fall dowe from the tree . this phenomone support on a lot of thing . such a why it leave the tree , why it fall down , how fast it fall down . .. all these different question need different subject to answet it . and also , board knowledge of many academic subject will help u see a question in different way . also there is a simple example : also there is an apple . it become smaller and lighter everyday . you cant find any reason of that in botantical or physical subject . but you will know why if you have learned chemcial . beacuse the water cell in the apple get outside , so you can kown well why it become smaller and lighter everyday . everything in the world need broad knowledge . the more we learned , the better we can kown the world . this is my opinion of board knowledge of many academic subject . you will find interest in a lot of knowledge .
