it is true that many people succeed by only doing what they already know how to do well . in fact , the artist or claftmen are successful people . however , i do agree that if people try new thing and take risk , they can be more successful in their life . trying new thing creats new invention and technology and new experience . moreover , new thing can solve problem in a society . if people try new thing and take risk , they can invent new technology . bill gats is a good example . his invention of microsoft made people 's life more convinient and easire . he become a millionare becaue he tried new thing and took risk . if people try new thing and take risk , they can have more new experience . moreover , the new experience is the key to be successful . for example , one of my friend from taiwan trid to come to canda in order to get phd dgree . this wa very new expericne for her and took risk because she had to leave her country and live by herself . however , she become a famous resercher after she graduated from the university . more importantly , whiout trying new thing , many difficult problmes in this world wo n't be able to be solved . if people can solve the probelms , they can be very halpful and successful . for instance , the lack of energy is one of the social problem . my bos at universtiy ha been studying about a fusion energy . he and his co-wokers try to creat new energy for the future . even though his reserch ha not complied , he is one of the famous scientist in the world . in conclustion , many may belive that doing what people already know how to do well becomes more successful . however , if people try new thing , they can invent new product which are necesarry for many people . additionally , if poeple challenge new thing and take risk , they can develop new experience . this also made people successful . finally , a people try new thing , they can solve many problem in the future .
