i strongly agree that young people thesedays do not give enough time to help their community . there are three main reason that illustrate this trend . first and foremost , the number and the size of the community itself ha dimminished . in the modern society , mobility of the people ha increased and the oppotunities of the transfer because of changing job have rapidry increased . therefore , the community is dimminishing so that there are few oppotunities for young people tto attend helping their community . in adittion , young people are becoming more and more independent of their community . highly developed transportaions or telecommunication reduced the neccecity of the community . the dependence on the community increase the motive to contribute to the community . therefore , the le young people depend on their community , the le they want to help their community . last but not least , developing social welfare are taking place of the help of young people in the community . some decade ago , to help the elderly or the poor in each community , the help of young and tough people wa vital . however , in the modern society , to care for the elderly or the poor is the domain of the goverment . therefore , the community itself doe n't need young people 's help . in conclusion , the role of young people in the community ha been little value and the role of the communitied for young people ha , either . therefore , not only the motive of young people to help their community ha be le , but also the opptunities to do so ha also been reduced . what to be blamed is not only young people .
