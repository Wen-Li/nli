i agreed with the statement , because when the student understand the idea and concept with clear example in class more information the student retaint in time , and then the student can use this idea and concept in the near future and in the far future . i think this because i use this principle all time during my studing life , and in my profesional life , in fact many time i use information adquired in my first year of university in special topic of biology and chemestry , matter that i not use normally in my work . another point is when a student understand idea and concept , the studet can use this idea and concept in relation with others , to understad new know , or made theory about unknow topic , and this is very important in the creation of new concept or the developmewnt of the science and ingeniery . is more , is the base of the evolution of the society , when more idea or concept understand the studen best development have in the study and in the futre work . for another hand , if the student learn fact is more difficult to the student made relationship between different fact , because is possibilite they don-t have a clear relation , and normally to find a relationship between fact is necesarie idea and concetp to help to find the relation .
