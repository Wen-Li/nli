i think to understand idea and concept are more important than memorize fact . why ? first of all the concept and idea represent the core of any mechanism or process or any theory . in philosophy for example if we do not undrestand the idea or the concept behind how socrat use to think , we will miss all his theory and his propency in thinking . gathering fact on socrats will be useless . the second reason is that fact are kind of detail supporting concept and idea . to memorize them is good but if we do not it doe n't matter exept for the most significants . more over fact can be found in any type of memory extantion a data base , enceclopdia , book . some of them are suffisiant to be be listed a example to support the idea or the concept . in a lecture teacher are focusing on idea and concept because they now they are important and they spend more time explain them to make sure that student understand them . how ever they may let student work by them self on gatherins fact , because they are easy to find . the other reson why concept and idea are more important to focus on is the huge amount of information availble on different subject in labrariea and throught the internet . the student have to learn how to focus on the most important information and get red of the le important in other word , student have to know how to classify their knowlege or how to prioritize their knowlege . the complexity of new subject like technology or like human science doe not allow to be losted in fact , i mean in detail students ha to understand first and make the complexity mastred before going and memorizing . in conclusion would say that understinding cocepts and idea is the most important part when learning on a subject , fact can flow and c
