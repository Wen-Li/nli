in my opinion the stated argument is right and the amount of car will decrease during the next twenty year . there are many alternative to using a car , there will not be enough space on the rout for all those car . in addition i am sure that there will be certain law in the future to keep the amount of car at a certain level . today one can use the train , a ship , a plan or even the public transport systen to reach diffgerent place . those alternative will become more attractive because of technological progress which will finally make the use cheaper . many people in germany for example prefer to take the train because it is more convinient and it is sure to arrive on time . furthermore the oil price increased during the last year and a change can not be seen . the industry reacted to this problem by building engine which need le petrol but because of the eclectronical equipment the sum of needed petrol could not be reduced . another argument is that city will become more overcroweded and there will not be enough space for new car . for example in japan is not enough space for new building and the street have reached a critical size which can not be enlarged . one solution is that people just share car to to go to work . and finaly there will be certain law to keep the amount of car on a certain level . the world ha many problem with pollution and governmants just started for example to introduce special law in the faster growing economy . by doing this the state want that industry and common people pay more attention to their use of energy . if this group change it behaviour one consequence could be that le new car will be bought . in conlusion this are my three main argument why there will be fewer car in 20 year .
