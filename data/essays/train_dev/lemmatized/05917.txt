i think there are some people who wish to travel in a group led by a tour guide , especially abroad . but i do n't think it 's the best way to do . i disagree with the statement ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' . there are two important point about this statement --- ` travelling in a group ' and ` led by a tour guide ' . first , if we travel in a group , we ca n't see thing and think in our mind quietly . that also mean we have to adjust the pace to walk or see thing to other 's . second , if we are led by a tour guide , we have to listen to his or her guide all the time . even if some of their saying is already known by u , we have to put up with hearing it . moreover , if we take part in a group tour , place to go are chosen beforehand and unchangeable in most of the case . certainly , we may feel much more secure if we travel in a group led by a tour guide . we do n't have to worry if we feel bad or get deseases compared to the situation of travelling alone . and we can meet unknown people of touring member . also we do n't have to find a place to eat because it is decieded from the first mostly . but despite these point , i prefer traveling alone because we can go anywhere we want if we travel by ourselves . and we can enjoy many place --- including some local area which is not popular --- that the touring seems not to go to . moreover , if we do n't have a tour guide around u , we have to check the information of the destination beforehand and plan the whole process of the travel . that make u know much closer about that place , and enable u to have a strength to deal with thing happening in unknown place . feeling secure and being comfortable are totally different . these are the reason that i perfer travelling alone . so i disagree with the previous statement .
