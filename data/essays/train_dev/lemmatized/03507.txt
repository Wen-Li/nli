enjoyment in life is very subjective . what one person enjoys doing in life , the other person might think it to be boring and uninteresting . however , the young people have a larger scope to enjoy their life than the older one and hence i agree to the statement that the ` young people enjoy life more than older people do' age is always associated with ailment . during the old age , these health ailment refrain the people from indulging in activity they would have loved to do . for example , outing and adventurous trip are not feasible for them . the younger generation can enjoy the excitement of adventure sport , though not regularly , but surely during the vacation . the activity like driving , gyming are not recommended for the older people even though they might find enjoyment in it . the older generation start looking at life differently . they do n't enjoy going to movie and play which is actually fun . they rather find themselves secured within the four wall of the house . i have an example of an old man in my neighbourhood . he just watch the young people playing and being energetic about life . he often tell me that he doe not enjoy his life , the way he did in this young day . he express his desire to get involved in some rigorous physical activity and feel rejunivated . however , his health doe not allow him to do so . he just pass his time by listening to old song and watching the daily soap on television . on the other hand , there are a lot of enjoyable activity for the young . if they wish , they can indulge in party quite often or go to the movie hall or watch the play at an auditorium . they can explore the thing which the old can not . the quality of life is higher when you are young than when old . hence i believe that the young can enjoy life in a better way than the old people .
