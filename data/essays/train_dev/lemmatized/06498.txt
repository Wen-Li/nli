i think it is true that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in my opinion it happens particularly during spot on television : in fact each of u can remember that he brought something because it wa introduced very well , or because the spot wa really nice or interesting . it happens because the power of tv is too much strong , in fact each of u ha a tv and watch it every day . all the reason that cause this phenomenum concerne business , in fact industry use spot to convince people that their product are very useful and they always insist about the good quality of them . in my opinion sometimes producer lie because they want to be richer and richer , but sometimes they lie because they live in a critical economic period , even if i do n't want to justify them . in fact we must consider that in the period of globalisation a lot of product have generated a real invasion of market all over the world , and it is very difficult for industry to defend their product because the competition with other product is hard . about this aspect we can remember the most important new element of global economic , that is represented by the chinese market . this market through it low price cause a real crisis of modern economy and force a lot of european or american industry to be more competitive . as a result a lot of this industry try to send their product by doing false advertisement about their quality . i think it is completely wrong because the customer always want to buy faithful product , characterised by a real good quality ; so if they are not satisfied by thing they buy , they will change product immediately , particularly in the period of globalisation , during which you can find a big variety of product .
