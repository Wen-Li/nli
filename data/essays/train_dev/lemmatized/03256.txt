along with the development of human being ' society , more and more product are in our life for people . it lead to the development of advertisement industry . someone said that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . i do not agree with the statement . firstly , advertisement industry is a huge industry controled by government . and the medias for advertisement are also controled by government . there are many kind of organization to check and exam them . the advertisement should be killed and cut down if they put some false word or mislead customer on the advertisement . in addition , the product on the advertisement would not be selled and the factory or conpamies will fall down . secondly , the purpose of advertisement is to let more and more people to know their product and buy their product . for example , many kind of factory to produce car . different people like different style and different style are suitable to different season and road . people do not know how to choose and which one is best for themselves . in this case , advertisement are very important . they help people to choose and make their final decesions . thirdly , the standard of product checking or examing are same in a country , even around the world . for example , food 's standard are same in the food industry . when a advertisement for a new style of food will be on the public , the food and medicine office will check and exam it before it is on the market . the food would be produced continuously if it could not be passed the checking or examing . based on the above statement , we can safely draw the conclusion that most advertisement make real fact about the product because most factory and company want to keep their factory and company developing and make more money . so believing advertisement and buying accodring to your need !
