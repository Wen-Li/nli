looking at this statement every student would be happy ! he doesn-t have to study anymore but he just have to understand the idea and the concept but he will not be asked on how much he learned . what i think concerning this statement is that the student should for sure understand the idea and the main concept and their teacher should give them all the time they need to deeply fix the topic in their mind . so if for some of them is taking longer they should not be afraid that somebody will get angry at them , but on the other hand if for somebody the subject is really easy and they get frendly with it immediately is a waste of time to get on it several time , taking the risk that they will start hating it . but what i also belive is that expecially now a day is important to have a good knowledge about everything , otherwise is really difficult to compare ourselfs with other people and to go on in common life , more and more we are asked for fact . the knowledge we need we can only achive it with learning fact by studing them and repeating them . let me also say that there is nothing that make you more proud of your self a the possibility to show that you could learn fact and that you are able to repeat them to other people correctly . knowing thing is something that make you feel better with your self and with the other people , it make you feel complete . in conclusion what i think is that it would probably be nice not to have the task of learning fact , because sometimes studing can be very boring , and would be much better just discus and try to understand the concept all together , but i dont belive it is possible , because you can now have the feeling that is not important to learn fact but at the end you will notice that without any background you will easily feel lost in the future .
