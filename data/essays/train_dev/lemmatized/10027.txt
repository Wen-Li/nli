i fully agree with the statement , because it 's just what i 've always done in my life , every time i had to learn a new thing . i always try to focus on concept and not on fact , so i can understand the reason why something happens and not simply how or when it happens . in this way it 's much easier for me to remember the huge number of thing i need to remember for my study or even for my job . i think that this way of learning let you remember thing for the rest of your life , because once you learn how to ride a bycicle , you can not forget it anymore . even if you do not use it for many year , your brain can still remember how to ride it . maybe you need some minute to revive your technique , but after only five minute , you are able to ride it again a many year before . in the same way , you can learn theoretical concept , like long and appearently complicated formula , just trying to understand what is behind them and how to re-create them from scratch , starting from the concept that they represent . instead , if you just concentrate on fact , like sequence of event , date or other `` useless '' information , you may be able to remember them for a certain period of time , but definitely not a long a you live . actually there may be important fact to remember , but this is not the point . in a few word , i would say that the most important question we have to ask ourselves a student is `` why ? '' .
