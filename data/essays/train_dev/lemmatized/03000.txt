it is admitted that the optimization of already-gained competence lead to success . there is indeed a high degree of certainty to reach goal , achievement when using mean that are already familiar and well controlled . however , to me taking risk is a derterminant or aggregate to feeling and being more sucessful . i would even say that to me it represents the extra-mile . from a personal experience , i wa quite successful studying in france , in my mother-tong french . after a pre-degree i decided to take a major risk and instead of going abroad to pursue my study for just one semester ( a the big majority of student doe ) , i opted for dual-degree program , where class until the bachelor degree were delivered in german . at the time , my knowledge of german were not the best ever and it wa difficult to follow in class . however , i gave myslef time to adapt , i worked hard enough , and after two year , i am fluent . it wa a major risk , to compromete my good grade . indeed it wa logical that i would probably not achieve the same level of grade a in france . this wa in fact a big deal , since i wa planning on integrating school for master , which for the selection require high grade . after weighting the pro an the con , on a long-term i came to the conclusion that this risk-taking experience had been one of the best decision i ever made . i must insist on the fact , that at the beginning it had not been easy . however , through this experience , i had the opportunity to adapt to a unknown environment , culture and society , to learn i language and to improve my intercultural and interpersonal communication skill . i soon realized then that having taken that risk had entirely been worthwhile . aaaas sucess i integrasted big
