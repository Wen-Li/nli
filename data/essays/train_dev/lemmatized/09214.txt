i disagree with the statement . there will be moer car instead . the most important reason is the unstoppable economic growth in the underdeveloped world , china and indis in particula . when you consider the prospective of their economy and the quantity of their population , all the other negative factor seem to be overwhelmed . of course , there will be ups and down in their economic growth . however , even a small persentage of car ownership in the two country mean emmense number of the car in the world . secondly , considering the duarability of present car will allows large portion of car in use now survive in twenty year . you can see this from the fact that in many under-developed contries , many used car are still use for people 's daily purpose . on top of these old car , more car will surely be prodused . the third reason is the people tendensy to stick to the old habit . or way of living . once you acquired the habit of driving a car around , unless you are force to quit it legally or economically , you wo n't cahnge the habit . in the developed contries where many people arre now driving car . such regulation or drastic economic dicline are unlikly . the forth point is rather tricky . the statement is not specific about the type of car it mean . therfore i would like to include new type of car such a electric car or etanor-engind car . with these new technology , the duration of `` car '' will survive at least nore than twenty year .
