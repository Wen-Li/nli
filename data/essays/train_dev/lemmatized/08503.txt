from my point of view , it is not advisable to think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . my argument for this point are listed a following . the main reason for propensity for fact is more important is that idea and concept are just a part of one thing , but the fact are the whole part of one thing . for example , i am major in japanese language , the language itself is just a kind of idea and concept , so i need to learn it fact and inside , japanese culture . from i learn a lot of knowlege about the culture , then i can learn lauguage more quickly and unstandable , and i am interested in it a lot . there is another reason that deserves some word here . idea and concept are not related to the reality , but the fact is related to the reality of one thing , it help u get more experices from everyday . to illustrate it , let u consider that when people graduate for school , they need to learn a lot of thing not only from the idea and concept , but also the student need to know the fact of job and sociaty . they also use their idea to do someting good , someting helpful , something important for this sociaty , so they must know the fact . otherwise , they will do nothing useful . third , if you want to the fact of one thing , you must experience a lot of thing , that mean you need to do experiment to get it for you . so the fact are very important for everyone . if you do not the fact of one thing , that mean you can not get one experience or a aspect of knowledge . for example , i want to get my drive license , that mean i need to know the knowlege about drive . on the other hand , i need to learn how to drive on the road , and keep everyone in the car safety . so idea and concept is not enough for me , i need to know the fact . taking into account of all these factor , we may reach the conclusion that to learn fact is more important than to learn the idea and concept .
