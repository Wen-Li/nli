these day there are a lot of trip in a group led by a tour guide but i do not agree this idea . of course , a tour guide know every information about the destination and tell u kindly . however , i think that this kind of tour make the pleasure of a travel limited . the pleasure of a travel mean that going to the unknown place , talking with the local people , you name it . in the travel led by a tour guide you can go to famous place , eat local food , stay at nice hotel but it is difficult to experience the pleasure which i said . i went to new york with my friend on summer vacation and of cource went to the world trade center , empire state building and so on but the most interesting memory is to talk with local people . i am not good at english but new yorkers i met were very kind and they tried to understand my bad english . then i felt the happiness to communicate with foreign people . in the travel led by a tour guide all schedule are decided by the guide so i think that you can not have enough time to do what you want to . in term of money i think that th travel led by a tour guide is cheaper than an individual travel but we can not buy memory by money so i choose an individual treavel . some people like to go to famous place and stay at great hotel . for such people the travel in a group led by a tour guide is better but for the other people like me the individual travel is better .
