for many decade professor , politician , employer , intellectualls and student in germany have been discussing the question what an academic education should be like : is it better to educate the student to generalist or specilists ? some people say that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . although this idea is supported by good argument , i prefer to specialize in one specific subject . first , it is better to take a study course in which you are really interested in instead of taking coures in many different academic subject , because the student can focus on one single topic . if he concentrate on one specific subject , he will finish his study course right in time and will pas his exam with good mark . taking too many subject course is very confusing , and a student doe not have the time to deal with each single subject in the way he is supossed to be . for example it is very complicated to combine a literary . cultural or medium study course with mathematics or ingeneering . second , company nowadays are not interested in generalist , because they need specialist . there are only a few branch where generalist can get a job . advertisement for job in newspaper always give a detailed description of the skill an employee should have . and mostly only a specialist satisfies the company ' need . therefor specializing on one subject is the best way to get a good job . finally , being specailized in one specific subject doe not prevent you from getting in touch with other academic topic and study course . if you are good in one topic , you might also deal with other academic subject that are interesting . but it is vital that you still focus on `` your '' study course . taking all this into consideration , i arrive at the conclusion that it is very important to specialize in one specific subject instead of having knowledge of many academic aspect . in some way , we are all generalist . but being a specialist is a unique characteristic that improves your chance to get a good job .
