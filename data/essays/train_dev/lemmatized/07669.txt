in the modern capitalist life , marketing and image are becoming sort of equivalent thing . the audio-visual medium generate and move huge amount of money , and what is more , in an exponential way . for example , let 's think in the tv . on one hand , tv move load of money so enterprise want to invert in it the more and more . on the other hand tv produce and strange decreasing effect on people 's critere and ability to judge . so the more and more there is people who just belive in whatever they can see in a tv commercial , and what is more , if your favorite tv star is wearing this amazing product you always wanted to belong , then there is definitely no reason to doubt about the fact you have to buy that product . unfortunately , enterprise now that , so they invert in marketing . for this reason i absolutly believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . but , what happen when the consumer realize the trick ? well in this case , what happen it is nothing . when consumer realized they have been trapped by the marketing technics , they just keep the product and go to buy another one in the way they thought the first product they bought wa . i think it is untolerable that this kind of thing can happen . the consumer association apparently do nothing , and when some upset consumer try to denunce the situation it is just like if you talked to a wall . so in conclusion , from my point of view the goverment should make any intervention and should promote consumer association to let them be more effective . on the other hand people should spent time in carrying out activity to develope their judgement skill , for instance reading book and not watching tv . unfortunately it seems that it is hard to happen . in my opinion , not only product seem much better that they really are ; it will be an incresing trend in this fact that will lead to the dicrease of the quality of product the more and more , and will make people spent money more frequently and major amount of money each time .
