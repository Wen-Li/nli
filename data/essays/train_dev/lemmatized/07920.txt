i believe that people who are successful try a lot of new thing even though they have high risk for the following reason ; changeing time , improve themselves , and enjoying themselves . first of all , time must be changeing . our life style are changeing with time change . for example , people who lived in sexteen century did not use car . their transportation wa horse , caw , and so on . however , now , we can not live without car , especially in the united states . a person , who made car at first , may be successful , and made u more convinience to live . one idea can change our life . second , when we are trying a new thing , we can learn how to endure without conciousness . when we learn new thing , we need a lot of knowledge , infortmation , and result of test . it will take a long time . i respect to mendel , who identified the existance of dna in 19th century . he tried mating pea again and again . finally , trying new thing make ourselves happy . in my opinion , people who do not have curiocity are like old-men . for example , i am very interested in science , especially biochemistry . when i study it , i am excited and i enjoy studying it . when i get good score on test , i am very glad to study it hard . in addition , i can understand what happened i , environment , and earth thorough the science aknowledgements . in my childhood , i wa not interested in science ; however , after i came the united states , i took chemistry class , my mind wa opened . i felt that i could do anything i want to do . therefore , i can enjoy my life , now . in conclusion , i think people do not have to worry about risk of trying new thing . trying new thing will make them more optimistic and give a lot of confidence to them .
