there is a famous saying that say , `` all fact are made out of prejudice of our ancestor . '' hence , i agree with the statement . although fact can be seen a a short cut toward studying , i belive it is more important to teach the student idea and concept then lead them toward the knowing fact . going though this process , the student may have a changeable mind and an ability to turn idea and concept into fact . if the teacher in school teach only fact , the people who study there will become computer , for they only have to remember the text and they can pas the exam . on the other side , the student have more challange and will learn more . for example , if a biology teacher only teach a frog is a slimy kind of animal that can live in both water and land , can the student pick the right animal when a turtle and a frog is presented to him . on contrasy , if the student are given the idea of learning by experiencing themselves , the difference of the two animal shall be easy . another reason that i agree more on learning idea and concept are , most of the great invention are started . youngs should learn how the great scientist acheve their success by starting on idea and concept others never or do not dare to think of . explaining the reflextion of a water based on the idea of light that run between the water and the face is more educational than just telling them , `` because there is a reflextion it is true . '' most importantly the student need to learn is the process between the idea to the fact . it is how thing work and knowledge form , from the question you find to the solution you make after cutting out all the other posibilities . only if they get this ability , they can learn more and learn deep into the subject , and they can find the useful fact for life . therefore , by only understanding the process between the idea and concept to the fact , the student may really learn something useful for their life .
