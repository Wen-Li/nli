in today 's world advertisement ha a really big impact on our life . in fact , we usually think of advertisement only a a boring phenomenon that interrupt our favourite tv or radio program or pollutes our street and underground-stations with it commercial . but advertisment is a much deeper phenomenon that involves our life , and many could even swear that it is a kind of art . the importance of advertisement should not be underestimated , a it can influence even our way of living . this happens through the need that commercial ad can create . for example , if we see the newest and thinnest stylish modern colourful last-generation mp3 player , we think that we need it , but we do n't buy it immediately . in fact , most of the people , called `` follower '' by marketing people , are not those who want to posse the newest commercial success , but those who want to have it a soon a it ha established itself a a fundamental gadget for the everyday life . it follows that a succesful commercial make the advertised product appear a something special , that make one be distinguished among other people because of some special feature , style , or sometimes just the brand that his or her object ha got . in my opinion , this mean that the product itself is much le worthy than it seems to be to the crowd that stand in long line in order to posse it . however , if this stuff is truly important , is up to everybody 's personal feeling . unfortunately , sometimes some product are even unhealthy , for instance some kind of food , for the consumer . those product can have a double negative impact on buyer . first , they could be damaging , and second , they could even become addicted , a it could be in the case of alcohol , tobacco , some fast-food or sweet drink these product are therefore not only worse , but even dangerous . therefore , in this time of consumism we are living in , everybody should be very careful handling with advertisement , a they can easily show u some aspect of a product and hide those that are not wanted by the mass , or even deliberately tell u a lie about it peculiarity . in conclusion , i guess it is really difficult sometimes to resist to the power of advertisement , but everybody should try to be a mature consumer , aware of the risk of not considering all the aspect related to our consumistic behaviour , a advertisement try to make only money . .
