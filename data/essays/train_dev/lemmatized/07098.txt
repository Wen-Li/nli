every coin ha two side . although some people may think that successful people do what they already know how to do well , i believe that successful people try new thing and take risk , a i will explain below . the first reason why i agree with this statement is because brave is the characteristic of successful people . there is little room to debate . people who can take new challenge in stride is a successful person . for example , some inventor success since they try to create a new invention . they need brave to experience the failure , and then research how to make a useful thing for people . therefore , successful people need brave to try new thing and take risk . the second reason why i agree with this statement is because the people only do what they already know how to do well may be limited to develope . with the rapid development of society , new thing appear quickly . people contribute their knowledge ; however , some people just do the same thing . they just want to do the thing they already know . in my opinion , it 's selfish . for instance , when a group discus how to make the report look impressive , some will put their best foot forward to think about that and try to make a special way , but others do n't participate the discussion . if that , how can we make the thing be better ? finally , based on the above discussion and analysis , i strongly believe the idea that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than onlt doing what they already know how to do well .
