in my point of view the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact is right to a certain extend . the purpose of education in my eye is not only to teach scientific fact to student , but also to convey the concept of the political system and set of value of your society . in order to do so it is important that the student develop the ability to understand different idea and concept and get to know how to critically deal with idea . this will help the student to understand why it is important fot them to study hard and gain more knowlege in certain area . by understanding the purpose of their education , student feel that school it is not something which is imposed on them , but will help them to deal with educational challenge in their future life . however , the base for different idea and concept are usually fact . in order to understand idea and concept it is necessary to have a basic knowledge of fact . without these fact , student can not understand where these idea come from or how they have been developed in the first place . however , teaching only fact can not be the aim of an education . if you teach student only fact there is a high probability that they will feel bored . it might be difficult for them to understand the reason why knowing these fact can be important for them and how these fact might help them in their future life . to summarize this i think there should be a balance between teaching fact and teaching idea and concept to student . they are both necessary to complete a good education , but i think conveying idea and concept should have the priority in a teaching concept .
