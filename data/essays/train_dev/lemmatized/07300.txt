i dissagree with the statement that say `` it is more imprtant for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' becasue of many reason . first of all , they will learn more about the fact becase it is real and they will believe it so it would help them more and more . in addittion the idea will not help them becasue they can forget them quickly and it could be wrong . second , it would help them it their life and give them more experinse and lesons . such a if anyone of the student had strange question maybe he had learn from that fact alot of information that would help him to solvie it . third , they will learn about new thing that they have not know about it . moreover it would get to the other generation . so that fact would be inhertants for all genetation and all of them can get what they want to know about . also that information that they get from the fact would make them more serious with this life . in addition it would make people who were sleep to wake up and go to worke because fact have many ture and strange information . in the end i see that the fact much better that the idea because the idea might be wrong and it will efect our society . so , learn fact is much better becase all the people and sientise kwon about it .
