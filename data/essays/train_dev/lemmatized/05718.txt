whether most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ? people differ greatly in their attitude toward this problem not only because of their respective background , but also due to their alein understanding . according to my personality and fondness , if i were faced this issue , i would probably think that the advertisement do n't make product much better than they really are . my viewpoint can be verified by the following consideration . to start with , the most crucial nowadays is the one that many advertisement are false . facts witness and present many illustrates a bellow : how can you image that some superstar say some kind of product are very comfortable or taste well in the advertisement , but they even have never used those product before ? how can you image that some people feel a kind of vechile is large and safe , but they have never research any data about the lagre and safe ? therefore , the example quoted above demonstrate that some advertisement do not acctually make the product better than they really are , but just show by some people saying . what 's more , the misleading in some advertisement is aonther and primary aspect that can be put here to defence my view . in order to see this point clearly , let me give you an instance : it is show in the advertisement that the price of a kind of product is very lower , however , the price doe not contain some kind of subsitutes . so if the cuntomers want to get the cheap price listed in the advertisement , the will not get the real good product finally . hence , another equally improtant aspect is that the advertisement may mislead the customer rather than actually make the quality of the product enhance . admittedly , it may be true that some advertisement introduce some high quality product . nevertheless , this alone can not lend strong support to the view that the advertisement will make the quality of the product be better . obviously , a to me , the disadvantage of advertisement carry more weight than the advantage of advertisement , so the most striking conclusion is clear . in summary , taking into account all the reason mentioned above , i can arrive an unshakeable that the advertisement do not make product much better than they really are .
