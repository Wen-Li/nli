the topic whether successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well is a controversial topic . i would agree with the statement . the main reason to support the statement is that trying new thing and taking risk somtines give innovative idea and better insight to solve a problem at hand . for example einstien , a famous scientist , continuously tried new thing and figured out innovative method to reach a conclusion . as a result he ha given the world new theory and explanation which the world wa unaware of . einstien is one of the world 's greatest scientist ever known . secondly , doing what we already know how to do well is just blindly ignoring the changing factor surrounding u . for example , my father knew how to make a spear very well . i learnt the art of spear making from my father . but with all the tecnological advancement and innovative methos around i can not say that the method known to me is the best method . today spear can be preapared with machine which are faster and more accurate . so in order to do thing well we need to have a clear understanding of the changing enviornment condition . third , if people donot try new thing and donot take more risk then the world economy would not grow and come to a halt . for example , bill gate , the founder of microsoft , took a risk of venturing into the computer industry when critic predicted that he would fail miserably . he continued to work hard and wa able to succeed in the end . microsoft generated huge employment and created product which helped ease certain task significantly . microsoft helped the world economy to grow at a faster pace by introducing technological advancement and generating employment . bill gate today is one of the richest person in the world . had he not taken the risk of starting a new company he would not have been successful . in conclusion people who try new thing taking calculated risk succeed . people who only do what they already know may become successful but not to the same extent achieved by people who take risk .
