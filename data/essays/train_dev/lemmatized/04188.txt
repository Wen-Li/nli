the humankind always need to trying to reach goodlife standarts therefore trying new thing is a very important aspect of humanslife . everyone ha a different point of view about the idea of trying new thing . some assume that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well in contrary to those som think that people should execute thing which they already know how to do well . i actually agree with the first idea . these are my following reason firstly , success is releated with responsibility . when successful people try new thing and take risk they trust on their responsible characteristic . for example i know a proffessor who is so successful at his job . furthermore he always know his duty and behaves according to it . in addition to this he never leaf his job about a luck . he usually plan his work and live for it . actually this feature brings the success to him in addition to this , success is reletead with the experience . if a person ha experience about the life or business or human psychology he/she can get the success very easily . also these experience help the person to try new thing and take risk with a comfortable way . plus the person can feel relief depending on the experience . for instance i have a friend who is so willing to travel and see the world . moreover she ha many kind of experience all over the world . basically these experience help her in her job to be more successful . she doe not afraid of trying new thing thanks to her experience . if the people do not live the experience they can not know the thing which they face . the last but not least success is releated with knowledge . knowlegde enables the people not to hesitate try new thing and take risk . furthermore people can get the risk more easily because of the fact that they can know diversity of information what they will do . next people can feel more self confidience with the knowledge that they have . they do not think what to do in a long time . all in all a i said before success is releated with both the responsibility and the experience a well a the knowledge . these valuable thing make people try to new thing and take risk than only doing what they already know how to do well . the long and the short of it is that there is an old saying that change brings life . i hope people do not disregard what i mentioned
