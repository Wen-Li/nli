to predict what will happen in the future is almost impossible even to the so-called futurist , but i can be sure that no matter what the shape will be , car will never be le used in twenty year . becoming one world as time go , the world is being combined together and the definition of borderline itself is also being obsolete . we can easily find those example in europe unions where the physical borderline have been removed , and nafta where , although physical borderline are still there , economically no borderline exist . and a the nation are combining each other , people are moving from country to country with their own car and trading are made between country by car because of it convenience . urbanization as country being industrialized , the city will become larger and more people will maintain most of their life in the city . but the problem is , most people can not manage to live in the city because of high cost living in the city and a an alternative , they will choose nearby city area a their residential area to save cost . to live in the nearby city and to commute everyday to their day-life area , the city , they need to commute by their own car because this is the cheapest and conveniest way . economic car today , people classify their car a one of precious asset they have and this is not a surprise considering the price of the car . the other problem we are facing is the expense we should sacrify to use the car including gasoline , maintain expense and parking expense . however , a the need of the car are shifting to daily essential tool , we can simply imagine that we can buy very economic car in the nearlest future that consumes le gasoline , le parking place and , of course , cheaper price so that everybody can manage to buy it . in conclusion , considering the convenience of the car and the change which i have explained above , i disagree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use that there are today .
