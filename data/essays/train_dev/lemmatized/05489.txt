i do agree with the statement that most advertisement do in fact make product seem much better than they really are . the reason i think this is true are a follows . firstly , most advertisement always highlight positive of the product but do not mention any associated `` con '' of the product . although it is true that without stressing on positive , the product would not sell , but leaving out detail do not give complete information about the product . for example , a macdonalds advertisement would highlight the `` experience at an afforable cost '' but would not mention anything about the trans-fat content of the product which could have ill-effects on health of the consumer . secondly , advertisement use association to sell a product and lead consumer to believe that acquisition of the product would materialize the association . for example , the `` air jordan '' shoe marketed by nike sold the association of having the `` ability to play like michael jordan '' using the air jordan shoe . we all know that it requires a lot more talent and ability than a pair of shoe to play like jordan . hence , the association always end up glorifying the true benefit of the product . another reason that result in misplaced information about a product given the advertisement is the use of celebrity model in advertisement to sell product . even though the product might need a particular attribute in the customer ( for example a fit body ) to be beneficial to the customer , the customer doe not sense that on seeing the advertisement . they rarely recognize that what look good on supermodel like cindy crawford might not necessarily look good on them . given the above mentioned reason , i would agree that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are .
