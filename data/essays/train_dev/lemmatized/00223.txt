i am conviced that student should understand idea rather than learn fact . nevertheless , i think that it is often worth paying attention to fact and , more precisely , regarding them a a strating point for a deeper study . first , i think that learning fact without trying to deeply understand their origin is useless . for instance , in economics , there are lot of fact concerning the way unemployed agent behave when they try to get information about vacant job . when i wa at the university , i have been precisely told about the percentage of worker that use word of mouth communication to get a job instead of formal mean of getting information ( newspaper , unemployment agency and so on . .. ) . to know such a percentage is really useless but make more fundamental question emerge . when a student understands the idea and concept that lie behind an observed fact , he really develops his capacity to adapt to different problem and situation . he is then able to analyse a greater number of situation than the number he could have analysed learning the fact itself . to restrict his attention to fact prevent him from developing his autonomy .
