there ha been a lot of change in the behaviour and attitude of the youth towards their community nowadays a compared to earlier time . today , young people are more concerned about their own personal development rather than the developement of the communtiy they live in . because of more professional competition between people and a desire to move up the success ladder , people have forgotton their social responsibilties . they have forgotton what their community ha given to them and what their duty are . young people leave no stone unturned to be successful and work with all energy and detremination for their own growth . but they often have lack of time for helping their community , most of the youth are not concerned and sometimes are not even aware of who their neighbour are and about the society they live in . in earlier day , youth worked hard for community upliftment . for example , swami vivekananda , apart from his personal growth , also worked for improving the status of woman in the society . his follower preached his idea and principle and this led to the betterment of the society . such example are rare to be seen now . advances in science and technology have helped the society but have also brought many mishap . people are thought of a machine , who work day and night without worrying about their parent who would be waiting for them at home . youth have forgotton towards their responsibility towards their own parent . youth have taken to several different form of entertainment a a source of passing their time . in their free time , they would surf the net or hang out with friend . to give an example , many of my college mate pay no attention to the news or any natural calamity . they are only concerned about them and their relative . this trend can be easily seen in case of a calamity like drought , flood where people above the age of 40 are actively involved in the helping the affected people . youths are preoccupied with other non significant issue like a party at their friend place or a routine get together . hence , with the help of the above mentioned point i conclude that youth nowadays do not give enough time to help their community .
