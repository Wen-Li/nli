i do not completly agree with that statement , because it is possible that you have more success with continuation . on the other hand a change often produce opertunities and chance . but the possibility that you have succes is not automaticly bigger than the possibility of failure . change may often be the right choice but is certainly no garanty for success . the same applies for taking risk . taking a risk can pay of . it is , however , not necassary for having success . generally you can say that taking a high risk can give you a higher profit . surely especially many company founder are people that are willing to take risk and try something new . they are regarded a successful people by the society , if they manage to run their business well . so part of the statement is definitvely true and correct . without taking risk many thing would be unpossible and many discovery and achievments of the human society would have been never made if nobody would ever take risk and everybody always just wouldbe doing what he already know how to do well . but you can also be very successful if you work steady and reach perfection in your work . i think that the statement is true for many successful people . most certainly it is not correct for every successful person .
