i agree with the statement a stratege of promoting product a way of attracting customer from existing market as we are in the twenty-first century , we are facing more challenge in promoting our product to occupy the market than before , more especially the new product . therefore , manufacturer a well a retailer must find an efficient way to sell the product . advertisement is the very important way to introduct the product to the market . there is a marketing department in every successful company to promote the product or service to existing customer a well a potential one . take cell phone company a an example , in us , we have verizon , t-mobile , singular etc . thus , their advertisement are really play critical role in attracting more customer . so there are famous sentence such a : `` raising the bar '' , `` the best network follows you '' or `` get more minute '' and so on . cellphones serve the function of our communication , so i think those advertisement do not describe the real function of their product , in other word , it is a kind of exaggerating . we have more product to compare and to choose in the limited market . i still take cellphone a an example , we can not use more than one cellphone in our life . we make our choice according to the advertisement of those cellphone company or the recommendation of our friend . i signed my contract with verizon simply because they advertised their family plan . as a matter of fact , the `` best network follows you '' sometimes did not work out in my situation . in certain area or in the moving car , i experienced bad signal problem . to sum up , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are in order to survive in the competitive society . as a consumer , we should protect ourselves by purchasing rationally .
