in any kind of educative , teaching , or learning institution , there are many way in which class ( specifically academic ) are imparted . many teacher like their student to understand the idea and concept they are learning , and other teacher like them to learn about the same thing by teaching fact about it . according to both of this idea of learning , is it better to undersand idea and concept of certain topic ? or is it better to learn the fact about the same topic ? i think that it is very important to learn fact about any topic you want to learn about . learning fact is something that will help you in the future because they are very useful . for example , learning the fact about certain roman leader who lost the empire will help you in the future , if you are a leader of any kind of institution , to avoid commiting the same mistake a he did . another important thing about fact is that they can never be changed and that most of them are important to know about in order to understand people who are `` expert '' in the career you are applying to . in that way , you would understand what they 're talking about if they mention any of these fact . finally , fact are important because they full-fill your general knowledge on many aspect ( a they say : knowledge is power ) . in my opinion , understanding idea and concept about any topic is something very important in life . understanding idea and concept about anything will help you to apply these same idea and topic in the future and make thing right , thus becoming a practical person . when you understand a concept or an idea , you do n't need to learn anymore about it because then you can use it or apply in any way you want , especially in a job or a career . when you understand a concept , you can even explain it in many way or in your own word ( it 's better than memorizing thing ) . if you understand an idea , then you can apply the knowledge you have about it and turn it into something practical . for example , if you study to be a mechanical engineer , and you understand the whole concept of car motor , then you can be able to use this concept to fix motor , or to explain or teach others about motor in a simpler way than how you learned it , so that they can apply the concept in a practical way . in this example , if you keep doing this or applying your concept on motor , you can even become the owner of an important car company or an important workshop . after these explanation and showing my reasoning , i think i agree with the statement that say `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . this probably sound too rude , buy i really think it is better to be a practical person than just being a `` smarta '' , and you can achieve this by understanding idea and concept a a student to apply them afterwards in real life . and who know , maybe if you do this , in the future these idea or concept may help in your career or in any day life event . this is why i completely agree with the statement expressed before .
