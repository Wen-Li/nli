the author is arguing that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i agree with the author point of view . the number of advertisement ha increased . while watching a tv show , a person will have an interupting advertisement period in the tv . in addition , most newspaper have specified a number of page for product advertisement . this huge number of advertisement ha affected our thinking about different product . companies spends million of dollar to create convincing advertisement . this spending is considered part of the marketing stratigies . it is well believed that the more advertisement there is for a product , the more it is sold . the million of dollar that are spent on advertisement is considered only a small amount of money in big company such a pizza hut . however , these company do not care if they have to lie in presenting accurate information about their product . because of the colored and well designed advertisement , consumer will be confused about the real quality of the product . because of advertisement , some product have become more expensive regardless of their quality . for example , toshiba labtop is a well known brand . through out the year , toshiba ha proved that they have good quality laptop . overtime , toshiba laptop ha become expensive . moreover , people around the world have got an idea stick in their mind that toshiba laptop are the best . however , being a computer specialist , i have noticed that toshiba computer quality ha declined . few week ago toshiba company had to withdraw laptop battery from the market for a specific toshiba laptop . poeple who are not interested in reading information technology news will not know about the battery withdrawal . they will remain in believing that toshiba laptop is always the best . about nine month ago , i wa convinced because of an advertisment that assets air conditionars are of good quality . the company that is advertisement for this brand is well known in my country oman . after buying two assets air conditioner , i found out that these conditionars are not a wa advertised for . i could n't stand having them for one month . i had to purchase new air conditionars . people spend a lot of money because of the misleading advertisement . they do not bother searching more about the product before buying it . it is maybe not worth it to search the internet before buying a can of bean , but it worth a lot to search before buying an expensive product such a a car .
