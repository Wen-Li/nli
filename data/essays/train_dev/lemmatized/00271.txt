the issue at hand is about the broad knowledge of many acamedic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . this issue is important for the versatility in any field of interest . in today 's world we need to explore ourselves in a complete manner in our academic career . but on the other hand we need to specialize in one particular area also . because education demand broad knowledge of everything but the career job demand specialization in one field . i think both are equally important in a balanced way so , i disagree with the statement . first , i think my option is preferable because of lack of expertism . for example if someone want to become a manager then he/she need to have knowledge of subject like finance , marketing , hr operation , it , etc.but if that person is not having specialize knowledge in one area then he/she will face problem in getting a good job because of lack of expertise knowledge . second , i think my choice is better because of lack of problem solving ability . for example a person ha learnt a lot of programming language like c , c++ , java , . net , etc. but he ha learnt only the basic or in other word we can say that he had not practice or given attention to one particular langauge , then he/she is going to face lot of problem in a software development of one langauge . third , i believe that my choice is appropriate because of decision making skill . for instance one person ha learnt lot of fundamental about the mba but he ha not specialize in one area like finance . then he / she can not take adequate decision in favour of the organization because of insufficient skill in that area . finally , i would like to say that a mba person or manager is `` jack of all but master of one '' . it mean that in today 's world he need have broad knowledge of all area but expertize in one so that he can take certain decision in favour of him and the oragnization fianlly , i conclude my choice is correct .
