actually , why do child go to school ? this question should help u decide whether it is more important for student to understand idea and concept or to learn fact . i would personnally say that sudents need first to understand , then to learn . i would n't say that one is more important vthen the other , i would more likely try to convince people that one ha to come before the other . order usually doesn-t seem so important , but in my opinion in this case it is . i-d say it is a matter of democracy applied to school : a people need first to be able to choose , the only way to put them in the right condition to do so is to teach them how to think how can child be thaught how to think ? their curiosity must be called , they need to be interested in the subject they-re studing . if the teacher succeeds in that , the child will ask question a a result of a personal thought . a response to that question will make them understand the concept and remember at the time . and putting understanding and remembering toghether the teacher lead to . .. learning . that-s why understanding ha to come before simple learning . let-s assume , for example , that a student is thaught that in 1789 french revolution took place . he will know the fact , but will he be able to explain how french population ha arrived to that situation ? and most of all , will he remember this fact and this date for more than the lesson time ? i don-t think so . i pretty sure he will forget a soon a he will exit the classroom or , in the best of the case , after the examination , precisely because the fact ha come alone without a personal and maybe emotional participation to the moment of learning . understanding provides this essentially needed personal participation . people are not computer , the only way to give them a real effective culture is to make them think and understand , although we could say that cu ; lture is made by the knowledge of fact .
