i 'm not sure of this statement , i known a lot 40 year old more sad than older people . to make an example , my grandfather is 70 year old and he still enjoy life going around the world two time a year . i like his love for life , and i hope i 'll have the same because if you do n't enjoy the life you should spend all the time sad and it is n't a good thing . i do n't think that the age is so important to determin the love for life . logically a young people can have more from the life than an old people if the speech is about the physic activity ; i can stay all night long or do many kilometer by bycicles . thing that an old people ca n't do . but a i wrote before is closed to the physician charateristic . the problem are that many young boy do n't ejoy life and i ca n't understand why . too people in this time are sad maybe for the stress the fast of life-style that is concentrated only on work and stupid thinghs that you have to had to be similar to the other people . i think that the statement is too restrictive , we ca n't say surely the young people are more attracted by life than old people because is not always true . another example is about a professor who theaced me few year ago , he wa not young however his behavior were like the behavior of a young boy : his vitality and his capacity to relate with my classmate ( young boy ) . luckly the people who go out with me are full of vitality , so i never spend my time boring myself like other people do . i say this becouse i know a lot of people who seems afraid of life and stay at home all the time watching tv while out the sun is bright .
