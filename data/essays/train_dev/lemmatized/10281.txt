i do n't agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i think the young people nowadays do n't seem to be giving enough time to help , only because the people who say that fail to correctly observe what the young people can do , and are doing to help . they expect the help to be in a certain form , and they fail to see that the young people are giving help because the help of nowadays may not be in that form . for an example , let 's say there is a child with a rare blood type . this child ha somehow lost a lot of blood , and need a large amount of transfusion . but because he ha such a rare blood type , him and his parent are having a hard time finding enough blood in the hospital , and need a living donor a soon a possible . when young people of today find out that there is someone like this , they take action to help using new mean of action , for example , by posting an ad on their internet homepage , or sending out e-mail to all the people they know , to go and donate blood if any one who see the ad ha the same rare blood type . if the child doe find the right donor in time this way , i 'll say that this is a good way of giving time to help someone in the community . what i want to say is that if the observer expect the help to be only in some physical form , such a going out to sweep the neighborhood , they wo n't be able to see this kind of help , and they will be apt to judge the young people to be not helping . the world is rapidly changing . if we observe the young people of nowadays using the standard that are decade old , they might appear to be not caring about their community . but if we give a moment to understand the world now , and to compare and see how different the life of today and ten year ago are , we will be able to see that the young people of nowadays
