in my opinion i disagree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. '' the reason for why i do not support that statement are written below . firstly , when a person doe a job for a long time and repeat the activity of his or her work over and over again , they become specialized in the work that they execute on a daily base and this suggests that the person doing the job is best suited for it and that also mean that that person doe not have to worry about being unemployed any time soon whearas when a person decides to take on a task that he or she know nothing about , this mean that they are unsure of what they are good at and that they live their life by the moment which is not a smart decision for anyone . also when a person is firmiliar with their work , new way on how to preform a task are developed and this save time for the person doing the job , and also increase productivity which in turn increase profit the buisness make , but if a person keep on jumping from job to job and not getting himself firmiliar with any one job , this will most probably end in a buisness losing profit because the work wa not done by a professional . so many people in the world today take risk in the job they do but it is a known fact that only a few of them ever prevail and achieve their dream . so finally , i would like to end this essay by saying that eventhough taking risk can sometimes turn out good for a person we should not think that we will be lucky enough to have such goo fortune and instead we should work on the thing we know best inorder to succeed in this life .
