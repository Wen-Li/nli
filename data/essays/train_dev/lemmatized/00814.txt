i agree with the fact than advertisment make product seem much better than they really are . to begin with , advertisement do n't show real life . they show a world created around the product they advertise for , where it is vital . they show a world where everybody is in need of the product , and ha no other alternative than using it - they are quite happy with that , by the way . in the real world , customer have choice , most of them perhaps do n't need the product , they have alternative . furthermore , everything is clean in an ad . even in advertisement for hoover , the dust seems to be just put down there , and go with one use of the hoover . this make the product look better by comparison with the environment it is presented in : people think if they get the product , their life will be cleaner and easier . then , in an advertisement , everything is presented to attract people . when a demonstration is needed , a for medication for example , the product act fast and efficiently . the demonstration itself is made with colored drawing or animation . the product of course never crash down , or is never used in a way where it would n't work a well a in the best condition . this also make people think it will be easy to use the product , the effect occuring a fast and effective a a big colored arrow wiping the problem off . finally , advertisement are made to make a product look better . it is their purpose to make people buy it . and a there are in most of the case many concurrents , and few really revolutionary product , you have to enhance what is good in a product . this is not recent . just going back to the middle-age , herald were used to sing and tell the capacity and act of their master . they always made them look better than what they really were . most religion do a well promise better than what they can be sure to give . for a long a human have existed , if one wanted to sell a product , one had to make it look better than what it really wa . it is then normal to suppose modern company selling modern product just do the same . to conclude , it is true advertisement make product look better than what they are . but there are no lie in them , just a little more than truth !
