i agree the statement `` it is more important for student to undestand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' we can see those situation eveywhere all the time . for example . when you start it new job , you do n't know anything abuout this job . so even you get new stuff which you have to do , you can not do it and might get confused . so the people who work there longer than you , teach you how to do you r stuff . however , if he / she teach you just the fact , you will be ok at the time . but you might be get confused next time . because you do n't understand the basecly work which is idea and cpncept . this kind of situation will be at school also . for example the boy girl who just start to go school and if they have first math class . of course they do not any skill math . but , if the teacher give them question about 2/3 + 3/2 , the student can not understand it . because they do not any basic math skill . in conclusion , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them t
