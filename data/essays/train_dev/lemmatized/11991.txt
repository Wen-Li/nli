nowadays people are living in a mixed world with all kind of generation and where the community grows faster . how help yours communauties with the time you have ??? fisrt of all , in my opinion , i am a student of twenty year old , and i would say that in your evderydaylife , you never find anought time for all you wanted to do . as far a i am concerned , i would say that giving time for other people , or be investigated in an activity requieres to you a lot of human qualityand a strong engagement . it might not be easy to help our communauty when you have responsibilty at work , at home , with child . in order to manage a good way of living we have to make choice at any time during our own life . secondly , we can considerate the problem with a different point of view . if you are living in a huge town it will be more difficult to help communauty than living in the country . thank to there small village in the country , everybody know everybody . the fact of the densification of the popuation , it 's easier and faster to make link and create central meeting . obviously , the communauty will grow up with helpful younger . i do n't really agree with the fact that young people do not give enough time to the communauty . for example , sometimes in your job , the director asks to you hight resposabillities , even if you did'nt choice you have to control and help your company . but what we forget it is the fact that it it probably for the biologic research , and htne the communauty progress . to believe that young peolple are not enought helpful with the communauty will be wrong , their behavior is different . they stay investigated in this huge world .
