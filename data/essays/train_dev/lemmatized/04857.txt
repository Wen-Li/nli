it is generally believed that to have a broad knowlegde of various academic subject is preferable of being specialised in a sole subject . as far a i am concerned , i utterly agree with this statement for the following reason . first of all , having a broad knowledge of more that just one subjet is certainly more useful to find a job . in today 's society , the marketplace is extremely full , a a result of which it is particularly difficult to find a job . if we take university student a an example , the chance that all of them will find an occupation in their respective field of study is very slim . it is indeed extremely complicated to find the job of your dream . therefore , given the current situation , it is far better to have a broad knowledge of different subject , since this is likely to improve the chance of obtaining a temporary job of any sort . secondly , to my view , this first option is better for the simple fact that it more interesting and sensible , especially if you are interested in many subject . should a student have a many interest a i have , he will have a lot of difficulty in trying to decide , once for all , what he will study for the rest of his life . personally , i like a considerable number of subject which are extremely different from each other . as a result , it is hard to make a choice , especially if you think that this is a decision that is bound to influence the course of your life in the future . cope with such pressure is very difficult . as a third point , i would like to add that a person who is specialised in many subject will always have the opportunity to choose a more specific field of study later on . in this way , instead of making hurried decision , he will be able to consider all the advantage and the disadvantage that the subject entail , and therefore be better prepared for his future working experience .
