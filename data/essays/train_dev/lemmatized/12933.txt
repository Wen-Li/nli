i do not agree with the statement that in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today due to the following reason . firstly , i believe that in the future , people will travel not only to the region in the neibourhood but also for the far remoted area , which include foreign country . it will bcome possible in line with establishment of highway , constructing the huge bridge between country and convenient carry system such a huge ferry to transport such car in passage of time , more and more people need to move by themselves for their own purpose because business will be expanded to the wordwide and it is essential to keep mobility for individual . car could be desired and obtained per person like a is the case for mobile phone . therefore , the situation could be happen that each individual will have own car per person . secondly , i belive that there should be some technical enhancement to the car and the subsistue energy of petro oil will be invented and introduced to the car by the engineering and research of automobile company . the example of such fuel are electroricity , energy created by nature such a sun or oxigion and so on and it is also good for the environment . such introdution of new energy will decrease the cost to maintain the car than today and i presume that more and more people can have an access to car with smaller initial investment . i am insisting the above oponion on the assumption that the form of the car could be changed and transformed like the one now develpoed by some of japanese company and current concept of car would change . the car could become much smaller one which allows only one person to ride and safety is assured in order that people could move place to place by such own veihcle . with the above three reason , i personally belive that more car can be introduced than today in the future .
