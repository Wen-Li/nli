in my opinon , most advertisement are deceiving people by making product seem better . there are two specific case of example of trick to present product much better : changing the look of the product by changing it color of it cover and changing it name to make it look like high quality . first of all , advertisement change the color of the product cover to attract the customer . generally faded color will make the customer think that product is made with an old technology , whereas bright color deceive the consumer that it is made by high technology . for example , brighter pencil are generally preferred to faded-colored-pencils in turkey . that 's why many advertiser force manufacturer to produce bright looking pencil to increase selling . secondly , advertiser force the manufacturer to change product name of a specific product to increase the amount of product sold . in turkey , that is usually done by giving a foreign name to that product instead of a turkish name to trick the consumer . in this way , consumer may think that the product is a high quality product because some of the good manufactured by turkish industry lack quality . there is a real case for this in turkey . a-spagetti-producing-company changed it product name a couple of year ago and gave an italian name to it product to deceive the consumer that it is an italian product . hence , they have increased selling their product . this is the way to present their product much better although it is same quality a before . to sum up , most advertiser make product seem much better according to some technique listed above . unfortunately , this technique are becoming so widespread that consumer will unlikely encounter a product revealing it real quality .
