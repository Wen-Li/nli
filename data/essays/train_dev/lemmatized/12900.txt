it would really depend on how much time i have to make the trip . if i had more than two week to travel trough a city or two i would rather prefer to travel on my own and follow my own pace too , and more likely if it wa a historic city of the european union . if i had to do a fast tour through several city in a short time , i would prefer to have a guide , so he or she could show me the most significative place to be seen in each city and i would not feel i missed the most important thing . other good thing about guide is that they usually are very familiar to the place and it history , they know the little detail , shop , story , costume and typical food every visitor ha to try at least once to get to say they actually been there . maybe there wo n't be much time left to wander around looking at the arquitecture or the landscape furthermore than what the guide ha already scheduled , besides there is always a great number of person within the same group of tourist , taking picture and asking question all the time , so the tour can turn into a stressing race against time . i would really prefer to travel on my own with plenty on time , but who would n't ? unfortunately that is not always possible . it is always nicer to walk looking around at the same time , steping by little shop and cafe , talking to people , asking for direction , going to the place you choose to go to and discovering everything on your own . i think that is the travel ideal for many of u , but we usually have a hard time on finding the time to do it that way , and instead make plan with too many destination all at once in a small schedule .
