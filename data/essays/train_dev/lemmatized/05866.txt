yes i 'm agree it , i think it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . nowdays student very clearly , they can use thier think do every thing , if they ahve more interest in something , they will do it all time . a a student not just learn some information and knowleadge form class and teacher , more and more people think use their think about something more useful just learn some information from calss . with world wa development , more and more comnpany want to own high skill people , but people have high skill not just learn from class , you must think about everything use your brain , if you think about some idea , it 's wa yours . not other people , although your idea wa not very true , it wa yours , it mean you make your brain , and think about something , you unstand these idea and concept then you can think about again , you can use your option , some of country , they teach student some knowledages , they just teach then htese , they never let student why you chosse this , then student also dont ask teacher why , i think it wa not your knowledage , you could n't remember it , beacuse you not understand it , you just read it , it wa very bad for your study . now , most of school wa suggestion teacher how to teach student , i think when you learn some information you must understand these meaning , it wa basic , beacuse only you have understand these meaning , then you can use youe own idea to explain it , it wa a good behavior , if you always to do it , then you have a good behavior , it wa very useful for you , if you have some trouble , you not wrooy about it , you will face to it , beacuse you know you can use your brain to do it . so i think student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . everybody must learn it , it wa very useful for you .
