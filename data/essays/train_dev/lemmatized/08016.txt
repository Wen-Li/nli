at school and university , student are asked to study an enormous range of different subject . also the way student confront class differ widely according to what they 're being taught . some course require that the student memorize fact ( e.g. , history class ) , others try to develop student ' particular skill ( e.g. computer science class , sculpture class ) , and in others student are asked to concentrate on particular abstract concept ( e.g.philosophy class ) . i therefore think that a successful method of studying depends on what is being studied and focused on . it is not possible to state whether it 's more useful to understand idea and concept or learn fact , unless we consider what time of subject is being taught . the topic of one subject may be mainly factual , while in other class the focus is on the discussion of concept . if we take a cooking class for example , we see that both concept and fact are important . we may want to learn where and why italian pizza wa created , what the condition of the land that concurred in it creation were , and why it is called pizza . but at the same time , because we 're attending a cooking class , we want to know how to cook it . the ingredient that we need and the kind of manual work required are the basic element in our lesson . so , in this case , both concept and fact have the same importance , depending on the emphasis the teacher or student give to what they 're examining ( in this case , the creation of a simple but successful food ) . this example demonstrates that there are more than just one way in which one could approach his/her subject of study . therefore giving more importance to one aspect ( fact ) rather than the other ( concept ) or viceversa is not a successful way to learn .
