i do agree with the statement and i woud be even more radical : i think all the advertisement try to make the product better than what they really are . sometimes they do not succeed but i think the intention are always to present the product at best , no matter what the real feature are . the reason must be searched in the aim of the advertisement itself : an advertisement is a message that must convince and persuade people to buy the product it talk about , and to buy that exact product and not some of the others on the market . to obtain this aim the people who make the advertisement can rarely escape the strong temptation to go beyond the line of an objective description of the product , especially if there are many similar product on the market a customer could choose from . therefore a the number of product on the market have increased esponentially , the advertisement had to introduced more and more sophisticated and intrusive mechanism to get it aim of convincement . in this way the real feature of the product advertised have lost more and more attention , in favour of other message which are indirectly and in a more subtle way connected in our mind to the product itself . these message make use of attractive area like beauty , beautiful actress , actor , model are often showed connected to the product , sexual message are also used in different way , other message that make use of some value and stereotype , like brave men , happy family and so on . summing up i think advertisement ha gone far beyond the limit of presenting a product , maybe ignoring the negative feature and emphasizing the best one ; it ha become a powerful and intrusive activity that make use of all the mean it can to obtain it scope . it not only want to convince people to buy something instead of something else , it also try to create the need of new product and service . therefore it is not surprising that many time we are convinced to buy product by the way they are presented in their advertisement , or just because we want to feel like the handsome actor using that product , but then we have to face a strong disappointment .
