it is often said that knowledge limit you . i could never truly figure out what that meant until i saw it in application to life . and i agree with the statement that - young people enjoy life more than older people do . as one grows up , he undergoes many stage in life . each stage is a learning experience in itself . each stage ha it joy and sorrow . a baby would be considered at it 's first stage in the game of life . his trouble would be limited to being fed at the appropriate time and probably aquiring a new toy . that 's why you see young kid smiling at all time , even in their sleep . as we grow up we realise that life is not all peach and rose a it wa painted for u to see , but in fact each action ha it set of trouble and maybe sometimes reward . we are induced with new worry and tension with each passing day . securing a job , supporting your family , aquiring a suitable pension plan , and eventually settling down in life is all that one sum up his entire life a nowadays . this constant struggle to achieve his aim , prevent man from stopping for a moment and enjoying the celebration called life . young people are more blessed . they have limited amount of stress a they are not completely aware of the problem that await them in their higher stage . they enjoy each moment a it come . to put it in better word they live life . consider an example of a father who slogs day and night to earn enough to put his son through college . he doesnt mind putting in those extra hour at work a that would secure his son 's admission into a good university later on . the son , on the other hand , would be blind to the hard work and effort that his father put in for him , and enjoy each evening out with friend . maybe a responsible son would match his father 's effort and maintain top grade . but let take a practical view on this ; that hapens one in a hundred ! it 's not that young people shirk off responsibilty but just that they are more smart in shifting them to another day . older people are more serious in their approach to life . this is a continuous cycle and might never end a young people grow up and one day replace the elder . so live each moment a if it is your last .
