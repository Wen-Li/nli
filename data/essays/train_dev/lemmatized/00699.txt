no i fully disagree , according to my perception it is important for student to learn fact than understanding idea and concept . facts make life easier for the student beacuse if they know the fact what is happening they can continue living happily in the world . learning the idea and concept is more imagination ie the idea that come in our mind is not always true or fact that it is right . for instance , there wa a bomb blast in the train and many people made an idea that most of them have injured and fewer have lost their life but the fact wa vice-versa most of them had lost their life , so there wa wrong information shown in the television . fact also tell student to believe in the world they are living in . they should not depend upon the television news all the time they should see on their own and beleive . students should learn fact than idea because they live in the world which tell that what recently is going on ask them about it . . ideas they can apply their own but fact is a fact they ca n't change it anymore after it had happen . they should be fully known about the fact that happened in the world , not the idea that what is going to happen . students also should n't have to depend upon the teacher or say ` yes ' to their ` yes ' , if the teacher is saying a fact student should n't agree until he get some idea of understanding , after understanding it only he should agree for the fact . no doubt they should understand the idea and concept that how this fact have come , they should be given the reason that why this fact have been occured , they should understand the reason of this fact . seeing all this i then too disagree with the statement because the advantage of fact carry much more weigh than understanding idea .
