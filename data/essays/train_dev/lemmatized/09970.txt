in the actual society , the marketing is very used for the factory to trying to sell their product . they use famous people and they make differents action , but when you try to make it at home , you see that it 's impossible . for example , there are lot of advertisement about product for cleaning the house . when the girl of the advise use it , she need only few minute to obtain an important result in their clothes , the oil of a jean dissapear in 30 second or the white of a shirt return . other example is the car whose colour change with the weather , it 's not true , but they make a nice advise and you think that it 's possible . furthermore , this product are more expensive than other with the same characteristic only because their adverisements are more popular and because they have spent much money in them . there are person who believe in this advertisement and when they buy it , they show that it is n't that they hoped . but , only if every person buy this product one time , the factory will be rich . for it , the factory only think that they must attract the more quantity of costumer however they buy the product only in one ocassion . in my opinion , the government should make more restriction with this advertisement . they should study their skill and they make a ranking of the better product . nowadays , is very usual to see a little letter in the product where we can read that this product ha passed all of the requirement and it ha a very good quality .
