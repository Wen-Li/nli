this is a very common question in pedagogical circle . sometime , it can become a very political question . in fact you ca n't really decide to learn with one method . a student who understand the idea and the concept behind a course will have a good grade at the final exam . this method of learning allow a student to develop it own comprehension of a course . he can develop some `` way of doing something better '' . if he understand the course , he can also anticipate the next class subject for example . he can also ask some interesting question to the teacher . in general , this method of learning develop the student 's brain . he will be more reactive . for example , in a mathematic course , it is very dangerous to learn fact only . you need to understand the underlying idea behind a theorem to understand it . years ago , i once decided to go to a math exam without praticing and understanding the course . the result wa naturally bad because the professor wanted u to understand totally the concept of his course ! at the opposite , learning fact can be also a good manner to learn . some course can be very complex and with very little time so the best manner to finish the course is to learn theorem for example without demonstrate it . also , in certain domain , like history or geography , you can only learn fact . there are not many thing to understand . you just have to learn . in high school , i had a history exam . i just learned all the note i 've taken during the course and i finally had a a-grade . i really think that understand idea and concept is the most efficient way to learn . i had the chance to have a lot of professor who teached like that . but in some really special course , simply learning fact can be the best manner to succeed !
