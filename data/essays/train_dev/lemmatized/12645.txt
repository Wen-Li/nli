i like to see advertisement , especially on tv . there is a variety of advertisement ( i.e. , tv commorcials ) . some advertisement look like a tv drama ; some advertisement look a if it thretes u to buy it . it is the company selling podusts who produce the advertisments for the product . there is almost no exception on the fact , i think . thus , i personally agree with this statement . need le to say , advertisments are made in order to encourage consumer to buy product . there is no wonder that a company try to show it product better a much a possible . i believe that it introduce it produt better than real . when i wa a child , i watched advertisement for an air plane toy . in the advertisement , i wa the plane flying the air . at that time , i wa so impressed and asked my paretent to buy me . my further bought me it one day . however , i wa so disapointed with the plaine , since it did not fly ! . my further also wa dissapointed at seeing me being sisapointed . i have never trust advertisement since then . recently , i enjoy advertisement a a kind of fiction of product . i believe that advertisement is a kind of presentation to express what product a compaly wish to make . thus , i agree with the statement .
