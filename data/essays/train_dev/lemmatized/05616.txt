first , it is important to know the meaning of `` enjoying life '' . is this entertainment in it pure form , only constituted of liberal pleasure such a going out , drinking or smoking , staying late up , eat a lot , have sex , or doe it mean to find a meaning in life , develop a a human being , have a family and a spiritual life ? actually , i think enjoying life can take a many form a possible , depending on the person . thus , i do n't think it is a question of age . i think it 's only a question of minding . some people are just in the right frame of mind to enjoy whatever opportunity life brings . an optimistic person will in general enjoy small thing one after another , and face difficulty a a challenge . we all know a negative person , so self-centered on it own problem that he or she doe n't see the beauty all around him or her . and is this a matter of age ? certainly not . but being in a positive minding doe n't come in any condition . it is a matter of need being fulfilled . a person whose basic food , lodging , reproductive and affective need are fulfilled will be a lot more likely to enjoy life . health being a main issue in this case , older people may not enjoy life a much a healthy young people . but again , it is not a matter of age . as we grow older , our body doe not support u a well a it did when we were young . it is common for old people to have health problem . therefore , anyone can be sick , even very young people . it is known that the poorest people on earth can be a lot happier than u , rich north-americans , for they are often part of very close human community . by fulfilling completely their need of affection , they maybe need le than u , who have plenty of food and physical comfort , but suffer from an individualistic society where we are often left alone .
