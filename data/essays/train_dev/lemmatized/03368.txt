i think that it 's not possible to state which is , between a broader knoledge and a more specialized knowledge , the most useful and the most correct at all . however , a a student in business administration i tend to believe that a wider prospective on the knowlegde issue may definitely help . first of all let ' s consider the working environment : nowadays people tend to change more and more often their job , following the labour market that demand flexibility and adaptation skill . a broader prospective allows people to be faster in such an important change a a new job is , preventing them to suffer from frustration and from the sense of inadequacy towards their new employment . this argument is by the way supported by the research of a famous italian professor , gianmario verona , senior lecturer at bocconi school of managment , a he claimed that innovative company tend to employ people who show `` t '' skill : the vertical part of the `` t '' represents the knowlegde of a specific subject , but the horizontal part reminds to the need for broad skill , that the employee is supposed to spend to understand the company strategy a a whole . moreover , even in more simple context a wide knowledge is useful ; for example let 's consider interpersonal relationship , of any kind . a broader knowledge positively affect the ability to join actively any discussion and result in a more interactive attitude of the person .
