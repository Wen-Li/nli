i 'm agreeing with author , that the younger people hwo are brought up in this generation they are not giving enough time to help the community which they are leaving , they are enjoying the time & the environment which there parent are giving to them and they are enjoying with there friend and having chit chating and wasting there time and not seeing outside world which they are presently leaving . the people are so blindly following the rule which they are kept by there own for the sake of tehre enjoyment and not helping to the community which they are in need of help and the help which they can effort they can give there hand to the people who are very need of them like denoting there old clothes to the childrens who they do n't have to wear also , they can give some money by buying the product and it help the childern who do n't have the money to go to school and they can donate some money to the hospital for the heart problem child by doing this type of thing they can save the one single life of the child , for this also the younger generation people do n't have time to spent the for this type of activity they will send the money to those thing which are useless and they will not get any thing from it they will just wasting of there time by watching movie and spending the money for party and enjoying with some body and getting some harmfull disease like hiv & aids , they most of the people are getting effetecd to this type of disease so are just spoiling there life at the begining of the life . the can join the community whch the government had intorduced for the sack of th samll child and the old age people they can help the people which were there in there hand . the younger generation people who are leaving in this genertion are not giving the enough time to help their community which were there at their sourounding they are help-ing to the people and they are not even looking at them also they are thinking that by helping them they will be joked by there fiend and they will looking form top to bottom so they are comming forward to help them , so my suggestion is that do n't feel shy and help the community which are going to help . so please help the community which are present in our city on give the helping hand to the people who are in need of u , by giving the hand they can also come in this beautiful world and they can also enjoy like you which you are enjoying today .
