i disagree that it is more important for student to anderstand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . one of the most important fact that student should know is idea and concept are not more important that fact . because of tow reason . the first one is idea alway can change by the time and place . the science always change a lot of idea about what we think in the past . for example people think in the past the earth is flat and the sun move around the earth , but with the time science discover that all of that is wronge . the second one is student can not egnore the fact , which other people concloded them in very long time , using large number of reaserches and experince . however there is a lot of idea change our world by scienses the change there life and human distiny by good idea , but that is not a reason to looke to the idea a afact we should excepted all the time weather it right or wronge . some time people can get a lot of idea in the same time they will changed . all of these reason are so important that make student understand that idea and concept are not important than facts .
