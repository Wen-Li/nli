i srongly agree the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are becuse , advertisement is showing up their product to evrybody and product ha lot of compition so they try to tell thier product ha more worthful and more better than the other produts . in the same way , same product ha lot of compition in the society so they tell about teir product throught advertisement but they did n't think about the quality of product . forexample last month i watch the adverticement about dove shampoo . so i thought is wa good shampoo . i bougt it 15 day ago . i used last thursday . i felt like it wa not good in qualitywise . after that i realised advertisement show more eligant but quality wise not good . like wise , this product hsa more worthful than other product . as an example , last week i saw the advil tablet advertisement . then i disided to buy advil when i got headache . so yesterday i bought advil for headace . i used advil tablet than thylinol nevertheless , it take same time for decresing my headahc but , it show in advertisement it reduse the headache faster than others
