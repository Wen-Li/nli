i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . for example , when albert einstine discovered new thing , he did n't know any of those thing . he wa n't familiar with his discovery and did n't know them well . but he took a risk and tried new thing which lead to his great discovery . if he did n't take risk and just kept doing what he wa already familiar with , he would have never found out all those famous discovery that he did . because he took risk and tried new thing , he discovered new important thing which made him successful . another example is the lewis and clark expedition . before they went on their trip , no one knew what wa waiting for them in the west . but lewis and clark took a huge risk , leading a group of people into the west , hoping that there would be a great discovery there . if they just stayed in area they were familiar with , they would have never found the great west . because lewis and clark tried something new , they were able to find the west which made them very successful people . my last example ha something to do with something that can relate to everyday people . my little sister wa working on a science project last week . after she had done all the required thing , she took a look at her project . she wa worried that she would n't get a good grade on it . so she called me over and asked what she could do to make her project better . i told her that she should do something creative that other student would n't do . something creative would make her project stand out and catch people 's attention . so my little sister took my advice and did something that wa n't even on the rubric for the project . by doing this , she wa taking a huge risk of losing point on her project . but because she took this risk , the teacher told her that her project wa the most creative project and got extra point . by taking the risk and trying something new , my little sister wa able to earn extra point which made her grade over 100 % and also a very successful student . in all these example , they would have never been successful if they did n't take the risk and try new thing . but becasue they tried new thing and took the risk , they were successful .
