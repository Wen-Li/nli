some people believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . however , in my opinion , traveling alone is a better idea . because i can manage my time by myself and save money . first , i do not want to be controlled my traveling schdule by other people . by traveling alone , i can make my own time schedule for my plan . for example , last year , i went to paris in a group led by a tour guide . first time , i thought it wa the best choice for me because i did n't need to book ticket , check the time and look for location by a map . but after a few day . i realized that i wa not the person who just like to follow other people and schedule led by a tour guide . i really wanted to see painting more in ruvere museum , since there were my favorite master piece such a monarisa . but a tour guide did n't want to spent much time at there . she guided the master peice and gave me only 10 minute . i wa so upset and embrassed , a i always eagered to see the work . after the travel , i decided not to go traveling in a group led by a tour guide . in addition , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more expensive that traveiling alone . i compared two case by a calculate and found that traveling alone is a cheaper choice . i traveled around spain two month ago by myself , then made a chart of spending money . i figured out that by traveling alone i could save more than three hundred dollar compare to traveling in a group led by a tour guide with the same situation such a traveling same day and visiting same place . if i travel with them , i have to pay for a tour guide and the travel agency . in conclusion , i firmly believe that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best idea . if i have a chance to choose traveling in a group or not , i will choose the last one . as i can controll my plan and my habit and save money .
