advertising is the art of encourage a customer to buy a product instead of another one having the same quality . therefore , it should not be surprising at all that , sometimes , advertisement can make a product seems much better than it really is . toys , snack and mobile phone service are three kind of product that are not usually a good a you may think after having seen their advertisement . last year , i decided to buy a new mobile phone , and so i also had to change my service provider . since i did n't have enough time to compare all the offer available on the market , i decided to make my decision just looking at the advertisement . i choosed a provider that offered one hundred minute of free call every month . one month later , when the first bill arrived , i discovered that this offer wa valid for international call only , and not for national one . for sure , i did n't get what i paid for . when i wa a kid , i once asked my parent to buy for me a new bike . i did n't want a traditional bike , but a bmx , which wa the most popular model at that time , mainly due to a big advertising campain on tv and newspaper . the result ? my parent bought that bike , which , by the way , wa also really expensive , and it got broken after just three week . it seemed literally unbreakable on tv . .. there is not a big difference from one snack to another . if someone give you an hamburger , i bet that you wo n't be able to tell in which fast food it ha been purchased . indeed , advertisement can make a snack seems better than another one . for example , you may think that , since a beverage ha been promoted by a celebrity , it is better than a le famous one . the truth , however , is that they are practically equal , and that , if a difference exists , it is almost unnoticeable . products are not always a good a advertisement may suggest . i had bad experience in my life when i had to purchase a product , and now i do n't trust in advertisement anymore . when i need to buy a new object , i ask for suggestion to someone who ha already bought it , or i just wait for a few month . time only will tell me if a certain product worth it price or not .
