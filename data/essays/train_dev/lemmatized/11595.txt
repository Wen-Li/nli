i think that today is most important to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . today for a person is most important to find a job , and to find a job you must have the knowledge that for example a factory requires . if i can do a bit of all but i don-t know the exact thing that i wa contacted to do i will never find a job . for me today factory search people with a specialize knowledge in one specific subject because is difficult today to find person that have an adeguate preparation in only one thing . to be a specialize person you must spend lot of your time studying and travelling around your country ( or across europe ) to increase your ability . but today for me person that have the like to do this are became lesser . i can see a lot of my friend that have just finished to study , they don-t like to travel to another city to become better in their work , they are huppy to stay near their home . fortunately they have found a job near their home but other person unfortunately didn-t find it also in other country . so to get a job that tey like they have must attend specialized course and they have must travel a lot to increase their knowledge . so if you want a job and particulary a job a you like and near your family , for me is necessary a specialize knowledge of something , something that you know is required in the part you have studied for .
