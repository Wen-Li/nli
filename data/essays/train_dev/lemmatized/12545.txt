in the past year , we have seen a growing conflict between older and younger people . in many country , the gap between generation is growing , due to demographic a well a sociological development . unemployment of young people is a hughe problem in many european country . in many case , young people are not able to get a good education because of their immigration-background or their social environment . also , many young people are not able to find proper job although they have good education because after massive job cut in many multinatinal company , no youngster are hired at the moment due to slow economic growth and the consequence of globalisation , which often cause outsorcing and transfering of job from expensive first world country to area , where production is cheaper . on the other hand , also older people are affected by these job cut . at the same time , european welfare-states have to raise the retirement age in order to keep their social system functioning and financeable . of course , this development sometimes cause frustration on both side . when older people who either have the will to work but do n't find a job or who have worked for decade and are now retired see young people in the street , hanging out , doing nothing ( except skateboarding , listening to music , playing computer game and shopping ) they might get the impression , that young people enjoy life more than they do or than they did when they were their age . and that impression , in my opinion , is probably correct . when today old generation were young , in the fourties and fifty , there wa not a lot of fun stuff to do in europe . they experienced the cruelty of the world war ii and the hard work that wa necessary to rebuild the country afterwards . young people in europe are lucky , to grow up in a safe and often wealthy environment . they have the chance to do thing , older people were not able to : they can travel , they can communicate with stranger and friend around the world , they can get to know the world in a totally different way their parent , grand parent and grand grand parent were able to . they have the time and possibility to do sport and ofther fun activity and to enjoy their life - maybe more , or at least in a different way , than many older people do . maybe this way of lifestyle many young people have , containing travelling , extreme sport and other way to test their personal limit , are a way to cope with their `` zukunftsangst '' , with the scary feeling many youngster have , that they have to be flexible all the time , they often do n't know , what tomorrow brings them and they are not sure , if and how long they will have a job ( and if they are lucky to have a job , they have to pay for the older people 's retirement , probalby without beeing ever able to profit from this system themselves ) . i think , young people have all right to enjoy their live a long a they can - sooner or later it will get tough anyway . older people should n't complain about this but rather try to understand the situation , teenager and twens are in . and sometimes they should even talk to their grand child and tell them : `` it 's alright , enjoy your life . go and have some fun !
