life is life ! young people enjoy life more than older people do . i do n't agree whit this sentence . because some time old people are young , so they enjoy the life . also all age have diffrence suprise in life . when people are young , they can enjoy life so much . the first of all , every people must enjoy the life every age , other wise you can bore in life . but when you are young , you can enjoy the life more than everytnihn . because you want to try everything in the world . you want to go everywhere with your friend . when you are young , you have lot of enerjie to do something , you want to live life , you want to see everything . sometimes you can learn some lesson about life . it can be good or it can be bad for you . as well a , when you make lot of thing , i will look fo extrime thing . you want live in city life . you can go bar , cinema , restourants . .. like lot of thing . also you want to earn lot of money to buy expensive toy , because this is the life . but in age you will be old man or woman . you can lived lot of thing but without somethigs . because in first paragraph i told you . life ha supries in every age for you . when you will beacome old . you can enjoy the life . maybe you dont like to city life , you can move to seaside or little town . you can grove your furits , or ou can play with your dougthers . when you will became old , it doesnt mean life is end . that wa the reason you can do lot of thing when you became old . but not extrime thing because you wont afford it . just you have to know how to enjoy the life .
