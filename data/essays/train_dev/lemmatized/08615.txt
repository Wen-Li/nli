for the discussion of the question whether young people give appropriate time for helping their community some definition have to be pointed out in the first place . first of all what mean helping the community ? these are probably activity that shape and support a traditional community , e.g. attending communtiy event such a festivity and celebration a much a helping out if there is any need of support for example for senior . secondly : what mean nowadays ? has there really been at time when this ever worked out properly ? the answer of this question touch the first aguement i want to talk about . of course there ha been a change of the situation and the meaning of community in the western world during the twentieth century . one aspect certainly is the strong increase of the density of population inducing a growth of community . by becoming bigger and more complex they lost their athmosphere of a defined neighbourhood , whicht definately determined the people `` s attitude towards their communtiy . an aspect whicht also might have affected this attitude are the rising requirement of a successful life . recently the social pressure for getting a high qualification in order to get a good job became much more important than it wa maybe fifty year ago . especially young people are highly determined by this and this cause an increasing lack of time for a vivid community life . a nother aspect is certainy the fact , that people have le moral value due to a lack of a religious backround . and i would conclude that there is definately a need for establishing new ethical attitude among people in general . the question is how to do this . in the end i would say that to agree the statement one ha to define the precondition of the statement .
