i would disagree with the statement , `` in twenty year there will be a fewer car in use than there are today '' , for many reason . firstly , i believe that the automobile industry is burgeoning and the number of car manufactured by them is increasing in an exponential manner and therfore the use of the car is increasing a well . the population of the world ha increased and hence the demand for owning a car a increased a well . in the present world people who even earn a mimimal annual income are also buying car because of the offer such a paying in installment , available to them from the various car vendor . hence the use of the car have gone up and will continue to rise a there will be better offer available to middle-class people . another reason according to me would be that , the variety of the car available in the market keep getting upgraded frequently . every new car ha a newer technology or some additional feature that make it better than it predecessor . this attracts people to buy a new one in addition to the one they might already own . this lead to more car on road and therfore adding to the use of them and we can imagine much better car in twenty year from now a well . another example i would like to sate is that in a country like india there is no law against car older that 15 year . this add to the fact that since the car are not being recycled or carshed , the number of car on road are just adding up and so is the use of them . therfore the number of car would reach a very high level in twenty year . concluding , i would like to say that , according to me the use of the car will not decrease in twenty year from now but rather increase in an unusual manner .
