in twenty year there will be fewer car than there are today . although car manufacteurs have increased their production the last decade , there is strong reason to assume that there will actually be a lower number of car in the future than today . this effect will mainly take place through various political measurement . in addition environmental issue , a well a economic consideration will lead to this development . politicies of goverments around the world will lead to a decrease of the number of car . on one hand goverments will still oppose tax on petrol and car . in addition to an contant increase of oil price car will become more and more expensive . many people will not be able to effort a car and instead use public transport . the environmantal issue will become more of a problem and urge people not to use car a they used to . i am confident that awareness for the problem of the environment will change the way of behaviour worldwide . the need for government ( and other institution , such a ngos and also the un ) to make environmental-friendly polity will become stronger . this in particually will lead to measure that support public transport , which will make it more attractive to use these mean of transport . instable economical development will also lead to a decrease of total number of car . we will see economical difficulty and even crisis . these will have an effect on the distribution of wealth . wealth will be le shared among many people in the future . many people will have a low income . at the same time fewer people will be rich and be able to pay for a car . due to economic uncertainty people will invest le in luxury item , such a a car . because of politcal , environmental and also economic reason there will be fewer car in twenty . this total number of car might not change significantly , but still there will not be an increase .
