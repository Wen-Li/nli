people respond to this issue differently . in my opinion , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping thier community . as a young girl , i do n't think that i can give enough time to help my community . here come some reason . first of all , young people nowadays have more vivid personality than decade ago . in this situation , young people try their best to be themselves and do everything they want to do . so they may have fewer time and may be unwilling to helping their community just because they think it is stupid or rediculous if they help thier communuties . in other word , they think that helping their communitis is not the thing that a young man should do . for example , young people in my country indicates that young people should go outside and try something new and exciting , not just stay at home or in community . participating activity of community is the thing that old people do . although this may not be a correct idea , it really influence you in addition , a advanced technology is invented and applied , there are more and more activity that young people can do . but we only have 24 hour a day and it led to a fewer time to hepling our community in contrast . for example , we can go see a movie or go riding , go kloofing , or even attand to a big computer game competition . there are too many thing for we young people to try and to experience . that is , we can hardly get eough time helping our community because there are more and more interesting and exciting activity that appeal to u . to summarize , young nowadays really do n't give enough time to help their community . but this doe n't mean that we do n't love our own community , afterall , there are too many thing enchant u . we have the right to participate an activity that is really interesting to u and this may help u to learn more and experience mor from it .
