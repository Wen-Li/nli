successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . nowadays , people dare to change their way of acting , their way of thinking and just throw themselves in something new to them , because they are lucid enough to realize that nothing is free nowadays , and above all bored enough with their dull everyday life enough to refuse to me doomed to constance and non-evolution . human being are made to love dangerous and exciting thing , to be curious about anything they never had the chance to experience before , and have hidden ability or even talent for thing they did not know . in my opinion , taking risk is inavoidable in order to succeed . risks may frighten you and make you feel weak , unconfident with yourself , with what you are doing . but still , they strengthen you , allow you to discover your limit and your gift . i think that people can absolutely not do anything without being aware of their own limit doing that thing . for instance , last summer while i wa in england for a linguistic journey with some of my friend , i saved someone who were drowning in the swimming pool . in the very second i see that little girl going down the water , i knew that wa the moment of my life . i could not think or imagine what could have happened if i let her drown . my reaction wa so instinctive and natural , i just threw myself in the water , embrassed her little body and lift her up so she can breathe . i would never have imagined before that i wa capable of saving a life ! it wa a shock for me but above all a great discover , since i commited myself to join a club to learn how to save people in emergency situation . now , i created my own club , and decided to give myself to helpless person who need help in some difficult and brief situation . i took a huge risk in saving the little girl but i succeeded in doing it in i am very proud of myself . i have always been a shy person , not that sociable and i just discovered something that existed in me . i figured out the person i really am or can be and this pushed me to take more and more risk and chance to do a many a possible wonderful thing on that world because people do not know how good person they can be and have to prove what they are able to do for their world .
