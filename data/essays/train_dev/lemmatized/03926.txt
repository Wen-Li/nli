here the question is about having an broad knowledge about many academic subject we have learnt or by doing the specialization in a particular subject what we have learnt . i consider doing specilization in a particular subject is mainly necessary . i give some example why it is so in below paragraph . i consider specilization in a particular subject is good and necessary because , in a particular acedemics we dont concentrate on all off the subject . we like only one of the subject . we learn more about the subject if we do specilization in a particular subject . it increase my intrests to learn more about the subject . there is an saying like `` what we have learnt is like a drop in an ocean '' . this state ment is true because , we have only learnt some amount . there is lot of thing to learn next . we can do research in a particular field of intrest and learn more about the subject which we can implement in the society which lead to good result . we can also go into the researching field of our intrest and into the teaching field by showing our intrests towards our subject . for example if we have intrests in the general chemesty subject we must do our specilization in that and do research and go and experiment on our universe . if we are intrested in any of the pharmaceutical field we can do our specilization and do phd program by discovering many drug on a particular research . as the present society is filled with many disease the drug discovery play an important role . if we are intreasted in politics or journalism , we must do the specilization in the particular subject and must go into the politics or a an journalist , this is why because in the present societ we are lacking in educated politician . finally , i conclude from my above paragaraphs that the specilization in a particular subject is necessary why because it influnces the society a lot . as i mentioned that what we have learnt is just a drop in the ocean prof my above example . finally , this is my view about doing specilization in a particular subject .
