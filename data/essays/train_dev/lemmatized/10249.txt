for me , a i am one of the young people according to nowadays , i belive that we do give enough time helping our community . i would like to introduce our work for our community . in school we are asked to do voluntiering work for an exact amount of time . according to my knowledge i believe every school ha the same amount of time to do voluntiering work . our school ha to do more than 20 hour of voluntiering work for 3 year of junior-high school . this may feel that we are foreced to do it , but even though we are forced to do voluntiering , i say we eventually help out community . young people nowadays do n't only spend time helping their commintity but also spend alot amount of time helping their country . korea is a small country with no fossile fules or what so ever . the only resource that can help korea to keep on going to the top would be student or young people intelligence . a few day ago i found out that not even japanese student study a hard a we do . what i also knew wa that korea 's student had high grade in math and science than other country student . many adult are counting on young people to lead the country better than now . the result to this , many parent of korea 's young people are making their child to work harder than any bodyelse . for example by sending their kid to after school academy and so on . according to my thought , i think young people nowadays do give enough time helping their community . although helping by voluntiering which is forced to do from school , i believe young people do realize they are helping out their community . for a small country without any natural resorce like korea , young people are studying harder than any other student in the world to eventually help thier country .
