i agree with the statment saying that it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than yo specilize in one specific subjet . i believe thats it nice to know many thing and to learn to many thing u dont have to be specialized in everything you learn but it good to know a bit of everything . it feel good when u sit somewhere and say their talking about politics for example beacause you have a background about rthis field you cant join them in the confersation and not just stay quiet and be useless . and if it wa about time that u dont have time to learn all these thing you dont have to learn everything in one day everyhting take time you might staying a couple of monthes learning one subject there nothing yo be ashamed of because in the end your gonna make a differense even if the thing you were learning you think ise n't somthing will make a chane but it will even if u dont note it but evantually u will . if it wa for me i would want to be an e.r doctor to help people , a loyer to put all whats bad behind bar and to become an invesigator to help solve crime . it funny that i want to be all these thing but in the end if i dont become workijng inb any of thows carry i know that someone will and that their doing it for a good cause and that they want to help others because in the end if everyone put their brain where is suppose to be and by working together we will make a differense and we will change whats going and will destroe what wa distorying u but know because we will all stand together no one and anything could distroye u again . so i believe that it is great to be a person who ha veriaty of differnet academisc knowledge .
