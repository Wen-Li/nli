there are two different thing which are idea and fact . those are seems like so simular , however , it is so different . some people think fact is truth , however in my opinion , it is not true . what is fact ? it is the thing that we believe it is true . for example , before galileo believed earth is one , no one believed his opinion . facts are usually confined in one paradiam when people are belong in there . campare with fact , idea or concept suggest people to think about different way . for example , the fact which wa believed that the earth is flat , it made people stuck on the thought . however , the idea which wa believed the earth is one , made galileo to think about that and research about earth . idea make people to have more creative way and method about thought or solution . idea is motivation . when we were young , we underwent that we watched animation on tv . usaully the subject wa about treaveling in the universe . now we read article in newpaper that nasa succesed to reach the moon or the other planet . these kind of idea motivated people to estimate and reseach about something that we do not know yet . we can also feel that idea and concept are more important than fact in the classroom . before 19c , especially during the war , school more taught about fact and physical thing than idea or creative thing . however , nowadays , school are changed to teach and encourage about idea and creative method , so they make student to learn about more creative thought . we still live in industry revolution paradiam . we still leave to descover about earth , universe , or more about technology . nowadays ' society is getting to change so fast , so i believe it is better to teach student more about idea which can change to our next paradaim , than fact which might not be truth no more .
