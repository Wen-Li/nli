i fully agree with this statement . young people donot give enough time to helping their community . they mostly indulge in activity that they want to do or having thing they desire , instead of looking at the problem affecting their home and locality . i myself , being a young person and living alongwith numerous other fellow in a hostel , ha lot of experience of such neglect shown by young individual towards social and community need . most of the time being spent by young people go mainly in fun activity like partying , gaming , chatting etc. or either in studying , preparing for the exam . there seems to be no thought process in the mind that deal with the immediate difficulty , shortage or problem that is going aroung the place which need to be solved . for example , in our institution there is a major problem of standing water body in and around campus which provides a typical breeding ground for mosquito that can cause dangerous infection to the ocals living in and around the area . but inspite of this , there seems to be no concern shown by the student who themselves might be affected by it . the situation can grow worse if not taken seriously . effective measure can be applied with the help of young student if they are willing . similarly , there are issue like education of poor worker and their child , who work in the campus for construcion of new building . young student can really help such poor people by organizing free weekly or monthly class within the area and it could be of great help to the child who can think of having a much better life in future . but till now , nothing ha been done by the young people living here . young people mostly dont listen to the advice given by senior or the elderly people . they always do what they feel is right . spending time to help community is not the popular choice in their mind . going by what i have seen in my campus hostel , most of young people , including me , like having fun , go to bar and restaurant , have nice unending chat or just study the curricular course and interest related subject . spending time for social and community service is not there nowadays among the young people .
