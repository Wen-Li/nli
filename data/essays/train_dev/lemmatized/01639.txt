i agree with the statement that most advertisenments make product seem much better that they really are but not always . media nowdays play a big role in making correct decision . advertisements are used to promote selling of product so that the company can have profit . it is never for the sake of one 's good . companies care for their profit and loss and that 's the reason why law have been enforced for making advertisement to protect privacy of people and filter the content of the advertisement . insurances are to protect people not to show their lifestyle or something . by saying that what i mean is the better insurance that you get people think that the better off you are . by better insurance i mean the reputed one or the one that ha a lot of medium influence . for ex , i see an advertisement for geico car insurance almost everyday on the t.v. trying to get more customer by saying that their price are lower , but what it turn out to be is that they reduce price in one place but make up for that and profit in another section . it is basically tricking people . like if you do n't you well on a certain part of the test you try to make up for it in the other section but it doe n't help because it affect your grade anyways . advertisements are not always like that they sometimes they are made in favor of the well being of the people . for ex. there is ad which asks parent to be friendly with their teenage child and talk to them about not going on the wrong way like becoming alcoholic or smoking . i think that ad like that are not bad and they just help reduce generation gap in my view . in conclusion , it depens on the type of the ad wheter it is trying to make the product seem much better or not . but most of time the statement is unfortunately true .
