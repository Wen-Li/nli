yes i agree with the statement given that `` succesful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already knoe how to do well '' . i think it wa important and necessary that the succesful people might go on new thing . here the reason for my agreeness are stated . for example take the person who ha in the book of guiness record , let 's think he wa able to done the foot that he can balance a twenty number of glass by placing them on his mouth . by the next time he wa trying to or attempt to balance the one which ha more wait than the previous glass and not to increase the previous number . let take example about our scientist who discovered or invented the thing that are now very useful in our daily economy like fan , refrigerator , television , telephone , etc . coming to the technology first they discover the telephone with the wiring communication . after that they did work on improving the communication without wire or wireless communication and not stoping there . now a day we can made remote control so that we can operate or control something else what we required . i think these may not happen if the talked people were not take risk and invent the new thing . to agree my statement i can take cricket hero who had breaked or won the many number of record . recently in the 2007 world cup that wa going on one of the match between south africa versus netherlands the south african batsman named gibbs made an unbeatenable record by hitting six sixer in a over and scored thirty six run that no bat men evermade . telling more about the cricket related to the statement given every team must put their maximum effort to create the new record . so , i can agree the given statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . i think the statement can motivate the person s who can do the same thing everytime .
