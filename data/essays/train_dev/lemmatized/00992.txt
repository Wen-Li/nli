well , i dont think success is a resultant of experiencing risk . risk may help to prove oneself new way of doing thing ; new possibility to aboard issue or face fear and conventionality . but i really dont think that by taking risk one can assure for it life success . the main problem that i detect on the statement is that the concept of success is limited to the risk one . fisrt of all we should define what those term stand for in modern society in order to really understand what are the possibility involved in that particular process . for instance , i could be very succesful without risking anything in my life . i may have proven formula that have worked for me all my life and that not necessarily make me a succesful person in term of money and fame , but in my own reference term , that could be anything regarding a good quality of life , or even not simply that . if we try to make a general analysis about what is beleived in modern society that succes may bring to a person , the argument would orbit around phraes like `` money eventually can make you succesful '' , the same thing with fame . so , why is money and fame the two main reference to explain succes from my point of view ? because those concept are the one that prevail in modern capitalist society . yes , capitalism , far from all the so-called economic benefit that it supposes for mankind , it ha also produced a terrible social need for material whealt in order to expose social status and succes . i may finish my toughts on this topic by referencing the one and only clue to understand postmodernity : `` the more you buy , the more you are ''
