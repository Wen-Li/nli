i will be agree with the specify point . as i know student graps the idea and concept very faster by interactive learning then exposed to the fact . as i think the experience with the concept make him to understand it clearly , while fact are the written statement which often make the student obcure or uncear with basic idea . i will like to put forward some reason to clear the view . understanding the idea and the concept behind the idea by the experiece of the student make him alert in future when he exposed to the same situation . while idea and concept can be made clear by demonstration such a visual effect or audio effect . one of the example i will like to make , if a person is prone to car part such a cluch , break , accelarator , engine and given a demonstration over it . he will be confident about to drive it and will make him drive smoothly . and this basic idea or concept he will never forgot if any difficult situation arise in furture regard car . for some if the undestand the concept very counsiously they might tackel the difficult situation uncounsiously also a they are previously prone to it . while the fact are the given statement which are not explanatory , which leaf a negative or positive remark over a person . infact he might be not clear of the fact given . which lead to mislead and aslo loose of some confident over it . example over it is , a given satement of fact about the car part over break , cluch , accelarator or engine will not make him or put him in to reliability to drive a car whiout given demonstration of it . and their is chance of misleading or damaging a car . thus for the student who are learning much of new thing should required a basic concept very clear so they can easily and confiently approach the test and also get higher grade . while if student are been told to refer the library or other material for the test without giving a explanatory lecture over topic may often confuse them and result will not be expectory . thus undestanding the idea and the concept behind idea will leave student confidentially to approach .
