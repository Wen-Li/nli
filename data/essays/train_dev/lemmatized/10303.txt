in the daily life , we are surrounded with advertisement , whatever we may do : listen to the radio , take the train , watch television . .. yet , we can wonder whether these advertisement really reflect the truth . do not they sometimes make product seem better than they really are ? do truthful advertisement exist ? on the one hand , we can think that advertisement only consist in showing a product : nothing can really be biased this way . indeed , in an advertisement , a product is shown , described and sometimes we see how it work ( for an electronic device for instance ) . so , how can we possibly we cheated on ? they make product the way they are . for example , when you see on television an advertisement for a new type of cake for child , you see a new type of cake on the screen and nothing more . the product seems to u just how it is . however , we can think that a lot of marketing is involved in the conception of an advertismnent . consequently , every advertisment is carefully thought and designed so a to make u buy the product . that is why the advertisement maker try to play with our feeling . for example , more and more product in the advertisement are described a healthy , or good if people are on a diet . .. advertsiments maker use the new trend for health , diet . .. that ha been running for some month . they try to make every prodcut look healthy , even though it is not . for example , every product with an original high rate of fat is described a `` lighter in fat '' but hey omit to add that there is still a considerable amount of fat in it . another way of making product seem better is the use of small letter . for example , for a loan , you will see in big letter that you can get a loan in no time , but when you read carefully , you notice how much it cost . .. the same thimng happen when you suscribe something with an internet supplier : an attractive price is written in big letter in the advertisement , but when you read more carefully the small letter , you notice that the rent of the modem is not included , that this price is the one if you engage for three year . .. another tool for the advertisments maker to make the product better-looking to u is the use of a `` star '' to present it . people who identify with this `` star '' think that if such a person us this product , it must be wonderful . to conclude , we can say that people have to be very careful with advertisement . indeed , even though they sound like truth , they are not really the truth . most advertisement are conceived so a to make the product seem much better than it is , so a to convince u to buy it .
