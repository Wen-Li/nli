first and foremost let me try to put on the focus of the term : in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i do believe that will be true . actually , in the future , in the earth , the level of pollution will be very great , the air will be bad and this for the car 's pollution . even today in the big city there is the problem of pollution because on the street there are a big number of car from the morning to the evening . the people use the car to go to the work place , because is too far . a small number of worker , now , can go to work by tram or bus because the line are too short and so they ca n't arrive with the public object at the final place . also , only few worker can go by bycicle because the street is too long . this only for the worker . the student , instead , can take the train , but this is always in late . so a boy or a girl go by car . now i do an example that make my idea concrete : when i go to university , i 'm always in late because the train is in late ( everyday ) !!! if in the future , the government will decide to increase the train 's line , the tram 's line and the metro 's line , so that these will can arrive in time , more people will take these object and not the car . i hope that in the future the air will be le dirty than today ; i hope this also for my future child and for all kid . to conclude , i do believe that in twenty year there will be fewer car than there are now , or perhaps i hope this one .
