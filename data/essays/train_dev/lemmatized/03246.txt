i disagree with the statement that it is more important for sudents to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . facts are thing that are true no matter what and in pretty much every scenario . although idea and concept can vary . ideas are what a person or a group of people believe and may not be one hundred percent concrete . concpets can be altered , modified or even proven to be false . a fact would be , what go up must come down . that is a proven fact . no matter where you are on earth , whatever is launched up into the air not matter how high , it will eventually come plumitting down back to earth due to the gravitational pull . an idea and concept on the other hand would be the evoluion from monkey to man . this is just an idea nothing is for certain about this hypothisis or concept . many people may believe other wise that man kind originated from adam and eve and that they both lived in the garden of eaden . although one may be more believable then the other they are just idea and different concept made up from different people whom may have influeneced others . that is another problem with idea , they can be forced upon a person . it is not like a fact which are impossible to be proven false . there for you no choice in believing it . on the other hand , an idea or concept there is reason to doubt .
