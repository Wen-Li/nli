cars are one of the major mean of transportnow a day . many people use car a they are more convienient mean of transport . they save time and energy in reaching our destiny . but in my opinion in comming twenty year their will be fewer car than they are now . firstly now a day most car run on petrol , desiel , gasoline . these are fossile fuel . due to increase in the population over past 20 year , more car came into market there is a great demand for the fuel . but the fuel reserve are limited . this lead to the shortage of the fuel in the comming year . more over due to high demand for the fuel the fuel prises will go up . the rise in the fuel price can not be afforded by the common man. this will make him look for other mean of transportation may be public transportation such a bus , tram . due to advancement of technology the price of the car decreased rapidly , this decrease in the price made comman man to own a car . as the population is increasing many people started owning a car , this lead to the traffic congestion in the city and town . the present road may not be sufficient to accomodate the car present , and it is difficult to expand the road to the reqirement of the people owning the car . this lead to traffic jam and take lot of time reach their destination which wa the advantage of owning a car . so most people will avoid car in the comming year . due to increase in car the pollution increase rapidly . there will be a lot of air pollution and noise pollution . this lead to the global warming . to avoid damange there is no other option than controlling the polution . taking these effect into consideration the goverment may concentrate on the public mean on transportation , a this save fuel , pollution and traffic congestion . earlier people thogth that having a car is prestige but in future they feel it head ache to own a car and maintain it , they will move for other better mean of transportation in comming year .
