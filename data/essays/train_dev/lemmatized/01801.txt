todays , many student are forcing to perform a lot of role . they have to both study hard and help community . but they have enough time to perform various role . it can be explain to two reason . i will explain it in detail . first , although , they want to participate in community like activity helping orphanage or the poor , their parent doe n't like it . they think that their child have to study more for surviving competition . they give a good circumstance to study for their child . and they always saids that studying is most important . for this reason , student study harder in their school and their academic institution . let me take my friend a an example . his initial dream wa a counselor for poor person . he interested in book and class such a counselling for community . but their parent disagreed his idea . they always argued because of this problem . after all , he had to give up his dream . and he made up decision teacher their parent want . secondly , the society doe n't ask for these oppourtunity . students are likely to think that time to helping communitie doe not neccessary . instead of this time , they asked for them more high grade in their school and some qualification such a toeic or toefl grade . for them , community exercise is not their interesing requirement . during school period , student often worried about their grade and evaluation from their teacher or professor . in order to give a good grade , they have too much effort . however , no one worry about their community . in conclusion , from these two reason , young people do not give enought time to helping their community . they may want to experience this time to help other people . so , for solving a problem , both household and work place help young people .
