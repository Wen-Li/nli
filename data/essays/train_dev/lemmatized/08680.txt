i think that young people enjoy life more than old people because young people have more energy , have more free time , and have le responsabilities . young people have more energy than old people , for example when i wa very young i used to rock climb . when i used to climb i used to have a lot fun and enjoy the outdoors . i used to fell very happy , like a wa free . now i can do it anymore because i do n't have the energy anymore my body doe n't want to do it anymore . young people have more free time than old people , for instance they can do more thing to enjoy their life . when i am in the park i see all the young teenegers talking to their friend and having a good time , in contrast i see the woman who have her little kid runing around them . she is not having a good time , so the older you get the le time you have for yourself . i believe the young people have le reponsabilities for example they usually do n't have to pay bill , they do n't have to worry about going to work or how can i be more sucessfull . when you are young you just worry about where i am going this weekend ? . young people can just go to movie or stay home without having anything to worry about , but old people always have to think about something that they have to do . old people think to much before doing something that is way old people can enjoy every moment of their life . i always heard from many people that best moment of their life where went they where young . is like the firts kizz . in conclusion , young people can enjoy their life better because they have more energy to do what they like , they have more free time and they do n't have to many responsabilities .
