in my view it is not true that young people do n't dedicate enough of their spare time to helping in their community . in the contrary , i see a lot of young people supporting local project to help the older , the poor or to help child to grow up und thrive in a more healthy and heartfelt environment . i experience that a lot of help is given through the local church organisation . they run a variety of project - from helping kid to do their homework in the afternoon to supporting the poor by handing out daily portion of freshly cooked food . most of the work done by the church organisation could not be achieved without the help of young people . although the young nowadays seem to have so many different option to spend their spare time , if you take a closer look , it is not so different a it wa in former time . sports , friend and other cultural activity may consume now a they have always consumed a part of the spare time . but just a in former day some of the spare time is dedicated to help others in need . i am aware of the fact that not all the young people suppport their community and that some project may need more help from the youth . but overall one can not say , the young do n't dedicate enough time to support worthy cause . the dedication of young people to community work may be le visible now then it wa in former time . mass medium tend to overestimate other news . they usually do n't concentrate on the small difference the dedication to a church group , for example , make . the help of the young may be largely unvisible to a larger community . nevertheless it make all the difference for the people that experience the help - just a it ha always been .
