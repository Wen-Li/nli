i agree with this statement , but i would like to clarify the term sucess first . what doe it mean ? i understand success a a moment in a person 's life when s/he achieves a very significant goal that had before , in that sense might be happiness , joy or perhaps money . after this definition , i consider sucessful people usually take risk and try new thing , but base on their own experience and knowledge and taking into account the advantges and the disadvantage that the new idea could brings up . in that sense it 's not just take risk , it implies a wise understanding of the situation . i believe it is very comfortable to keep doing the same thing that you already know , but at the same time `` monotony '' it 's something that doe n't allow to prosper and literally destroy our dream . there are many example of people who had taken risk in their life and failed , but at the same time you can take risk a much a you want , there is no limitation about it . i definetly empatized with this point of view , because if you want to be happy or to be leader you have to struggle and get your dream , they wo n't come by praying or by miracle . sucessful people are always trying to be different and looking for new target with a very clear idea in their mind and with many argument to support their plan . muy last argument is , our life is a very dynamic and a opportunity to create alernatives . people who have been working only under the same paradigm are wasting an unvaluable opportunity to shine and to achieve their goal . hence sucess people area always looking forward for planning new strategy in their life and be happy for ever .
