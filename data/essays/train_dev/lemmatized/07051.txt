have you ever experience it ? helping ohteres often give you a special feeling of joy and confidence . but i think nowadays only a few young people have experienced it . many young people do not give enough time to helping their comunities . let u begin with an example in my own community . when i take a look at the group sise of our local red cross facility , i could see a continually decreasing of member . sometimes we did n't know how to fill the sceduals . one reason for this is maybe the little time many student and people have nowadays . if you want to compete for a good job or a high education you have to work hard and so you have le time for other thing . but when we take a closer look , everybody should have more free time than it used to be . many new invention let u complete everyday routine much quicker , for example computer and telecomunications . i think the real problem today is the change of lifestyle . it seems like every day we get a new possibility how to use our free time , for instance waching the lates movie or getting to the newly opend bar in the city . young people do help in their comunities because they think they have to try all these posibilities . but all these new thing doe n't improve your feeling of confidence . when some people would get acive in their community they would experience how much fun it is to help . in conclusion i agree to the statement but i think helping in community could be easily improved if people try it . you are often more often give you more happiness than do thomet
