although many people tend to avoid trying new thing and take risk , i oppose to that attitude because to me it seems to be boring doing always the same . on the one hand , if you take risk , there is always the danger to fail . depending on how great the risk is , you may loose nearly everything you posse . admittedly , this is a even harder decision , if you are responsible for a family . i remember a time in my childhood , when my father thought of expanding his local drug store . certainly it had been a great chance but after severel sleepless night he decided not to take the risk due to his care about his family . in addition , trying something new always come together with a lot of hard work . why should you do it , if you can hold your status with a work you know to do well ? in my opininion , you do it , because you will get rewarded , if you try something new . i find , trying out new thing is fun and interesting . in other word , when i try something new , i have the wonderful chance to broaden my horizon . if you never give it a try , you will never experience if there is something you would like better . i , for example , invested all my money during my study to open a small copy shop for co-ed . what i received back from this little business wa not only the money to finance my study , but also the unvaluable experience of applying my theoretical knowledge from university to the real business world . this helped me a lot to succeed . in a nutshell , i agree that it is more comfortable to do only the thing you know well . however , risking something improves our experience and provokes innovation , the latter being one of the key factor that thrive our economy .
