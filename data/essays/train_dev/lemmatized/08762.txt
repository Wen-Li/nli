a common idea is if you do n't take risk , you wo n't succeed . of course in our modern society the high number of people who want to succeed make the success more difficult to get . and a a result you have to take some risk . nevertheless you have to be carefull because of the society you have to take risk but if you miss your objectif even with a fall short , the society wo n't forget it . and you wo n't be a successful person ( for a long time at least ) . at the contrary if you do n't take risk you wo n't be successful . the society is always moving forward and if you want to follow and to succeed you can not remain and wait , without changing . so if you are changing something you are taking a risk even if it 's a very small risk . if you do n't adapt your business , your life or your job could get worse . from my opinion a sucessful person took some risk , it 's compulsory . there 's too many people and too many business on earth so if you want to suceed you have to take risk . but the border between success and nothing or even something worse is very thin . so you have to take risk but you have to be very carefull . it mean the more risk you take the more chance you have to succeed but a well higher will be the fall if you do n't succeed . in conclusion i think in our society the only way to succeed is to take some risk but to be very carefull . because i think a well a very good way to loose everything is to take too many risk . it mean if you want to be successful you have to stay in the border between not enough risk and too many . and i think the most successfull people keep this border very thin .
