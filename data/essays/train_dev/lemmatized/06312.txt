during all the time , many people is going to be successful because they are going to try new thing . however , many people are successful with his knowlege . but i think , you can be successful if you know before the thing that you want to do . i am going to tell you some reason that support my statement . first , people who know what they are doing can find some solution faster than the people who doe not . for example , if you want tu have a coffe bussines , you have to know about how many kind of coffe exist , how it taste , when it is good and when it is not good , and when is ready to use . suddenly , in your own bussines is presented some ploblem about coffe grain . the grain look like different , if you do not know you need to call someone to check it . but if you know about it , you save money and time . second , the procedure could be easier if you know about the new bussines . if you are a person who work with your family or some friend , inclusive if you are working on that . you know what you have to do about what do you need to start your own bussines . for example , i am working at psychologist office and i am psychology . i woul like to have my own office . like i am working enought time there , i know the procedure that i have to do . i can do it without pay someone . if i do not about the bussines i have to paid for everything and i spent my money . last one , if you know about the bussines the risk decrease because you know about contact , people , office , money , bank . then could be easy for you . all the procedure are not knew for you . your bussines is in your mind with structure , organization and everything that you need for that . i know that you will need help but that help could be lesser than the people who doe not bussines before . in conclusion , make a bussines which you know all the procedure before , decrease the risk to loss your money and could be better successful that the bussines when you try a new thing .
