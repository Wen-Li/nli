do you agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ? i think it is true . people will always success because they like to try anything . they always get new thing when they try . if peop do not try , they always first of all , there is always not only one way to solve a problem . you always can use different way to solve a problem if you want . maybe what you do is not the best way , or what you made is not the best thing . you need to try . every time your trying is also a lerning . you try more , and you learn more . secondly , why people is better than animal ? because people can think . people create thing by their thinking . if people do not like to think , what different between peopl and animal ? for the same way , people who try new thing and take risk than only doing what they already know will always go fowoard . they always can create new thing , and everything is the way to success . in the conclusion , why people can be successful ? because they have many method to lead them ten to success , and those method come from their think . only when you creat a new ideal , you can do better than other people . try to tink much , and you will get much . do n't always do the thing by the same way . trying will lead you to see more thlngs .
