travelling is a wonderful experience that everyone should access to once in a while . so why ruin it with a group of people you do not know and who do not have the same interest a you do ? why let a tour guide take you to only the most crowded place ? i do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group , especially not led by a tour guide . let 's start by saying that we are all different , and that while we may have some point in common with others , there is always an interest that is unique to u . therefore , imagine arriving to paris and joining a group of people that doe not include just your family , but also ten unknown person . how would you decide wether you all want to go and have a traditional `` pain au chocolat '' with coffee or wether you are all going to go shopping ? or how would you decide if you are to all go to the highest level of the eiffel tower or just go up one level ? according to people 's interest , it is impossible to do everything that everyone want and you would be stopped from doing what you really want for the benefit of others . if you absolutely must travel in a group , i disagree on tour guide . of course , they can be helpful on specific information about the city 's monument . the problem is that they do not go at your rythm . for instance , if you are in new york and you wish to spend more time admiring the glittering times square at night , you may not be able to because the tour guide will have a precise timed schedule that he must stick to . i would therefore recommend buying a book with all the information about the specific city . this ha two advantage : you are able to enjoy the city at your rythm and it 's much cheaper ! in all , i do not beleive that a group or a tour guide are the way to go when it come to travelling because it brings too many restriction to what should be a complete free pleasure moment in your life !
