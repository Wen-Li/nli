i think there are two kind of people : the first kind is good in knowing general topic and so this kind ha a good broad knowledge . the second typ is good in knowing specific information about one topic . we need both kind of people to manage the living on our earth , because expert are needed to make new discovery in science , nature or anything else . without this expert our technical evolution could n't be continued . the human beeings who have the general knowladge are good to `` tidy up '' our world . they can create a system in which we can put the lot of information we get every day . such men or woman are also neccessary for our culture , way of live and organisation of the live . without the expert we would n't be so far in technique and social status , probably we would live with the dinosaur , but without the other group , we would n't be able to understand all of the new thing that are invented or discovered or die under the mountain of idea , new topic and invention . the most specialist are not good in explaining new thing , because the most speak in their own language . every topic ha it ' own language so you are not able to know what 's going on . .. we need a good balance between specialist and people who have a good broad knowledge . i ca n't say the one is better than the other ! i think that i 'm am specialist who know one or to topic next to another realy good , but not the rest . and my brother know much more topic , but not so deep like me . together we are a really good team wich can solve a lot of problem in a very efficient way . so this is a good example for what i ment in this essay . everybody only have to know what he want and maby a little more and nobody should be discriminated because of his knowledge or unknowledge .
