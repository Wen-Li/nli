i think that to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in only one specific subject , and i have three reason for this conclusion . first , let 's think about one situation , there were one univ-educateted student and he would work at a conpany , then if he learned many subject , i think that he could get many type of work and he could show his all ability . in this case , if he learned only one specific subject , i think that he might do good work , but he could get only one type of work and he could n't show his all ability . this is mainly reason that i think it . second , i think that large study might lead the person to a big heart . if you learnd many academic subject , you might have a big heart enogh to get the subject . for example , some learnd economics and politics at an university and the other leaned only economics at the same university . the former ha a kowledge about politics whether it is deep or sarrow and the latter ha no knowledge
