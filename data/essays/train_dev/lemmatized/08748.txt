i agree with the given statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well . successfull people adopt a very good approach to doing thing well . they have more self-belief and confidence that their new way of doing thing will definitely be correct . such people believe that it is thrilling to do thing in unusual way . they do not believe in adopting the same conventional way of doing thing right . they find it rather boring and stereotyped to do thing they already know how to do well . they believe to take the path le travelled because they find it more challenging to explore such unknown thing . such people are more adventurous , daring and dashing by nature . they do not fear the chance of failing when taking up activity that involve lot of risk . one best exaample that can be cited is of christhopher columbus . he braved the rough sea to discover the continent of america otherwise we would have never known that such a continent ever existed . he made this invaluable discovery during olden day where the method of navigation were devoid of the advancement in technology . all great invention like the wheel , telephone , electricity , paper etc have been possible only because their inventor took huge risk and faced several challenge in accomplishing them . it is said that necessity is the mother all invention . people who have made great invention and discovery had felt such a need which wa combined with a burning desire to make invention to satisfy the need . but all this would not have been possible if such people did not have the fighting spirit to overcome all obstacle they would have encountered . hence successful people always believe in doing thing in unconventional way wherein they dare to face all challenge that come in their way .
