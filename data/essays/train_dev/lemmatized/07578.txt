some people think that , it would be better to have broad knowledge of different academic subject because variation of subject add to human experience and provides possible solution in many situation . others think it would be better to concentrate on one topic and go on . based on my experience , both opinion are helpful according to my grade . when i wa in under graduate school , i wa fond of reading and attending different class which helped me to great extend to pas my exam easily and receive high score . on the other hand , when i wa in physical therapy school i concentrated on only sport medicine class which helped me to apply for master degree and find convineant job . finally both thought are important depend on need and goal .
