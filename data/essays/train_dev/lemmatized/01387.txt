i desagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i have several reason why i think so . first , travel lad by a tour guide is titely scheduled so you are not allowed to spend time freely . as a result of it , you can not experience the real life of the people who live in the place you visit . tour guide show you only what they want you to see . there are many other place you should visit to understand local people life . for example , the house they actually live or park local child gather in , not the place such a famous temple or historic building . second , it is better to travel alone than being in a group . to travel with your friend may make you feel relaxed , but , especially in the case of going abroad , you can learn how to deal with trouble by yourself . it will make you tough and much more self-confident . it is true that traveling in a group led by a tour guide banefit you much in term of seculty and safety , but one of the most important thing you can learn from traveling is to acquire the ability to handle the problem even if you are in a strange place . third , traveling in a group led by aguid tour is passive . if you go abroad , it is bettter to study the language that local people speak . language can not be separated from calture so in you would really like to understand it culture , you need to learn their language too .
