the appeared memo show that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because of the particular people interested in more way reach them goal or take risk to invest another thing . they also increase there self-confidence . one most effective example is invention of nuclear weapon and other source of energy . scientiests were tried to do new thing and a a result we can reach here . now a day we have more invention . invention of plane or invention of ship , car , and satalite is the good example of successful people who try new thing and take risk . another good example for me is that my elder brother 's history . he wa working in restaurant . he earned good money from this job . but he started his own business of catering and also he took loan from bank and take risk to start the business but now he is very successful in this field . and also he earned more money than before and also he get good name of his catering . now he is going to expand his business to other city . successful people most probebly try new thing and take a risk such a , the famous political leader mohandas karchand gandhi who also known a `` mahatma gandhi '' of india . he became law graduate from london then after also he joined politics and helped people by this way and he is very successful in his carrier . now a day he is call a `` father of nation '' . and very popular . it is possible only when he tried new thing and take risk . there are so many strong reason like discovery of all the new thing . there are so many strong reason to prove the statement . for these reason i am completely agree with statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doinf what they already know how to do well .
