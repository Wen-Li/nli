sompe people say it is much more beneficial to have the deep knowlege in only one specifie subjuct . in contrast , others argue that it is much better to have broad knowledge of various academic sudjects . even though , knowing subjuct deeply is advantageous , i want to be on the latter side . because , it help people to make many friend who are working in the different field and it is also beneficial in raising baby . firstly , having broad knowledge of many academic subject help one to get along with many kind of people . when we enter job field , we have many opportunites to meet many kind of people . sometimes , we face scientist , doctor , musician , or businessman . let 's compare two people . the one know lot of thing in many field and the other one know only one thing he or she is interested . who do you think can make friend if there is a party ? for sure , the former person win in this situation . because people get to know each other by having a conversation . besides , it is also revealed in movie . the movie named `` briget 's diary '' , we can see the main actress is alone in the party because of her shallow knowledge . secondly , it ha many good point when parent raise their baby . having broad knowledge is beneficial for both parent and childeren . since , the academic skill are made in childhood . if the parent know many thing , for instance , in the field of paiting , music , language , and so on , it is much easier for them to raise baby . furthermore , it also creats a talented baby . because parent can educate them by themselves since they are young . in conclusion , i think undoubtedly that people who have broad knowledge of many academic subject have many previleges . on the one hand , we can use our broad knowledge in making lot of friend and on the other hand , we can be a skillful parent and it also lead to make child talented .
