the statement declare that successful people take risk instead of only doing what they know to do well . i partly agree with the statement above . i believe , in fact , that to define a person a successful is a difficult purpose . apart from this personal belief , success can be defined a a situation where a person reach a wealthy way of life . in this case , i believe the statement present some weakness . to reach success people need to take risk although there are some other quality and factor that need to be mentioned . a person to be successful need to be lucky in life and healthy . people that take risk are usually brave and curious , i strongly believe this two quality are fondamental to reach a successful situation in the professional life a well a in the private life . on the other side , there are many other factor and component that interfer in life . for example people need to be helped by the fortune . i strongly believe that , in most of the case , taking risk is not the only component that define a successful situation . a second factor that need to be mention is the factor of health . a successful profile , usually , is based on a stable personal situation . for this reason , i believe someone that have an healty life have a big chance to reach a high level of success . in conclusion , i do not agree with the statement above . eventhough i consider taking risk an advantage for people to be successful , i trust that a stable profile ha , in the same way , a full range of possibility to reach happyness in life . to sum up , there are too many component that one person need to take into consideration while defining a profile of a successful person therefore the statement can be consider too semplicistic and not true .
