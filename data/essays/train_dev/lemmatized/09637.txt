in a way , i would agree this statement . in my opinion , it is essential to have a wide range of knowledge to state in this society we live in . for example when you discus thing with someone or when you have to write an essay you have to be pen for argument which may stay in conflict with your personal opinion . then you have to know how or why this argument is coming up and how you can built a new argument . this is a lot easier if you can see the linkings between all the the subject . this implimise that you hava to have a certain level of knowledge about several academic topic . moreover , the linking often give you the oppurtunity to create own and especially new aspect or theory of an issue . on the other hand , i assume that it is n't possible to be aware of everything in this world . as thing and especially knowledge are changing that qucikly in our society , it will be hard to bring yourself at the up to date level of knowledge in each academic subject . another problem is that people always have a special field of interest . this might be because they gained experience in certain topic in their childhood or their parent introduced them in a special academic field . for example , a lot of cildren would like to be an astronaut . as a result of that , they will probably concentrate on issue like astrology , star and so on . i 'm sure that this concentration on one field can change in your personal life quite a lot . therefore , i suggest that you will become a specialist in certain academic topic which are most interesting for yourself . but you should always try to keep an eye on other subject because knowledge can influence eachother and could give the movement to new aspect of knowledge .
