in the morden , some parent or teacher ignored student 's ideai . however , i do n't understand why are they disturb the student 's idea . i agreed that it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . firstly , they have to see the world more wider and higher than before . later he or she have a very various idea and concept like tomas edison . if some parent expect to some child 's opinon , they will learn very specific idea , they can contribute in society or polictics in the world . seconly , if parent or teacher have to expect , the student can expect their parent or they can help their parnets . for example , there is a very strange a boy . he always want to make something , so their parnents expect him to make a lot of idea . after 10 year , he became a very good inventor , . and graduated a very good university , also , he have to reply to his parent to make comfortable invention . lastly , we can make a lot of story when we are taking care of child and they would n't believe anything . most of child want to know curious something such a batman , superman and santa clause . if they did n't know the fact thet are shock their belief , and they would not believe anything later . we need to expect them continoulsy . the society is more complex , and thought of student is more complex , too . today is changing is very busy , and student want to rest something . some stuednts are retireing continously . if parent or teacher expect them first , student also try to expect them , too . student 's idea and concept is very important in this society , also student make to use their thought what ar they want we know that .
