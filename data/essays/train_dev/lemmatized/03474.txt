`` play it safe. '' is the thing we often hear from our family , friend and from other people . we see many people regretting about their past , for they lived in a routine and never took the chance they had just because they thought it wa risky . it is well known that the richest man in my country wa broke and homeless in his childhood . to me , taking risk is the main gate to success and happiness in your life , since that may be only chance for you to make your future dream come true and not to regret in your prospective life . in three month , i will receive my diploma and become a physician . the tendency of medical graduate is to specilize on a clinical branch and practice privately . i have not applied for the graduation exam yet and i will not , instead i am applying for a research scholarship in japan and planning to complete a doctoral course there . it is obvious that it will be more challenging and time consuming , but i think that once i receive a degree in japan , a door to study abroad academically will be open . but the door may permenantly be closed ; too . i am acting in an unorthodox way ; but a robert frost say : `` i took the one le travelled by , and that made the difference . '' `` if only i had the chance ... '' , `` i wish i could use this chance ... '' are the word i never intend to use and in my opinion , regret is the worst feeling one can ha in his life . time pass by and there is no chance to reverse it . the only thing that one can do is to anchor to that chance and go for it no matter how risky the situation is , so that he will not find himself in a routine life and he will never experience the feeling of regret . not to feel regret in any of the step of your life is actually what i perceive from the word `` peacefulness '' . in summary , i can say that taking risk is the main taste of life that lead to success and the source of happiness hide in a mind that ha no idea of regret about the past .
