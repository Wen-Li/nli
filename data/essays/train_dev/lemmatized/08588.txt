i can not really agree with the opinion stated above . i think that understanding concept , a well a learning fact , are equally important . on the one hand , it is very important to understand an underlying idea . it is the base to apply it to new context and to connect it with other concept . it is an essential ability to suceed in exam and it even enables the further development of new hypothesis or even whole theory . in my opinion , real understanding prof if someone is an intelligent , independent thinking person . and these are necessary attribute for a successful researcher and a satisfying academic career . for example , the principle of many basic learning theory , investigated by skinner , where cited by numerous other researcher . the researcher conducted many interesting experiment , resulting in highly useful application . in the other hand , you can not deny the importance of knowledge of fact . surely , the solely learning of fact wa exaggerated for a long time . whole generation of student only had to repeat information without having to prove their understanding . i totally agree , that this doe not make any sense . i also permit that it is hard work to learn them and it seems senseless from time to time . nevertheless , fact are important . it is not sufficient if researcher have understood a main principle . they have to know all included variable of a theorie , how the experiment were conducted , why , in which content . they should be aware in which time period a theorie wa invented and a fact wa discovered and by whom . this is all fruitful background information . the first thing to learn are fact . then understanding of the underlying idea is the next important step . and finally the further connection and application follows . the last step could not be achieved if one of the earlier step would be missing . therefore i draw the conclusion that you can not say which of the two learning strategy is more important for a student .
