when young people have to decide between doing something for their own benefit , or something that could benefit the whole community , they would mostly likely chose to benefit themselves , unless the action for the community would give them something in exchange . i agree with the statement `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' , and i also belive that they should understand why helping the community is important . nowadays young people are much more selfish and dedcate le time to help others unless they are forced to do so . schools most of the time need to force student to complete hour of community service . this is a right decision that the school take a the student have to learn that sometimes it is best to sacrifice some of their time to give it to the community that they live in . in addition , helping the community doe not necesserly take a great amount of work , time or dedication . even small action done frequently are a great input for the society . young people need to understand that they can not only take from the community but they need to give something back to it , not necesserly because they have to do it , but because they should want to do it . when completing an actoin for the good of the community , one should get back the satisfacion of being able to give something to the community that one is part of , the satisfacion of doing something good , and the satisfaction of being unseful to a great number of people rather than only yourself . to conclude , i personally agree with the statement and belive in a need for change in respect of the attitude of these young peopole who do not dedicate enough time to the community they live in , and do not understand the importance of giving in something for the good of a group of individual rather than only one .
