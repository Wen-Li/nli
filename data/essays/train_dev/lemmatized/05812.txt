nowadays mostly people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i totally disagree with this statement . there are three reason why i have this preference . for one thing people who are young have to spent their time with working and learning in order to get a job in the future . i am student . i have to study the whole day . and when i have finished my semester i have to work at a shipping company in order to get money . i have so much work and i have totally no time at all to see my friend . only a few time i try to go out to enjoy my life . furthermore many young people are in concern about their future . in consequence they do not enjoy life . there is a great competition surrounding the young people . many of them have no work , they do not get a traineeshipment or they are not admitted on a university . i have to reach 90 point in the toefl test otherwise i will be exmatriukulated . if i fail i have to find out another way how to earn money in the future . i am really frightened about this case . a next point is , that i have not a much money a the older people have . i get only some money from the company at which i work within my free time . because i do not work full time i get le money . from this money i have to pay my appartment , the university fee , the ticket for the train and i need money for food and clothes . there is no further money which i can spend for fun like for holiday trip . in conclusion you can see that young people do not enjoy their life a many people do believe . the majority have to spent their time on working and learning , they are more in concern about their future and a result they le enjoy life . finally they have le money which they could spend for having fun . only when you are old and you have reached something wthin your life you will really enjoy life .
