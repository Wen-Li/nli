`` we should try everything a possible a many thing before he become old . '' my parent used to tell me since i wa young . it mean that we can not do everything , which we want to do , when we become old , becasue old people can not have the power of life , eventhough they have exprienced knowledge and money . i aagree with the following statement . '' young people enjoy life more than older peole do . '' firstly , when we are young , we have the important thing for living our life , such a power of life and youngness . therefore , the two thing can help u challeng and try everything in our life . in the news , sometimes we could hear about news that young people challenge something incredible or accomplish something . few monthes age , i heard a news about handcapped group of peole challege to swim . and they finally accomplished their goal , such a making short time record . i believed that if we do not have the power of our life and youngness , we can out challenge and try to do everything . secondly , if we are young , we do not know abour fear . if could make u enjoying life more than older people . usually , older people know fear of life well , becaseu they have much more expereices and hear about more happendings many time . thus older people know more fear about everything . but , for young peole they are inexperienced about everything our life . thus young peole do not have much fear than older people . we could see many example world widely well , young people love to try very wild and dangerous sport , such a sky diving and snow bording . when i went ski and snow bording place , i could see the 95 percent of snow border wa youg people , who want to feel the danger and speed . young people love to feel fear and always want to challenge wildness in the world . lastly , eventhough older people usually have money , they can not evjoy their life than young people , becasue they think their future too much . older people think about their future , death , family and other suff alot , becasue they know their responsibility . but usually , for young people they do not think about theur future , job , family or other suff , becasue bascailly they have much time than older peole . young people could do their stuff in their future , but for older people , they do nopt have much time , so they have to spend their time more valuably . it always make stoping older people enjoy their life . for my personal example , just next my house , there is one family . the family ha old parent and two youg childrens . since last year , they all wanted to go travel every place in the world , the all family tried to go travel , but only their two child could go travel , becasue when they were living travel , parenst were start thinking anout their time , money , future , and everythings . but their childrens did not thinkg about their suddroundings , and just decided to go travel , finally only their chidrlen could go travel . older peole can not enjoy their life , becasue they care about their surroudning problem too much , espeicially time . in other word , young people enjoy life more than older people do , becasue young people have the power of life and youngness , these two thing make them challenging . young people are unexperienced people , so they do not know the fear of life . thus sometimes , they could be very brave . lastly , everhtough older peole usually have much more money , h \ they can not enjoy life , becasue they care about their surrounging problem , such a time .
