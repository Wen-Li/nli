i do n't think it is the best way to travel in a group led by tour guid . there are many good tour in the world today , and many people use them . i do n't think it is bad to trip because people said it is so useful . so i want to tell my opinion a positive and negative point . first , i will tell you positive point about tour trip . if people go to trip with some tour , they do n't need to prepare for travel such a serch famouce place or hotel . travel agent do everything for u if we pay money . we can go many popular and famous place and eat good food . if we confuse something , tour guider may help u immidiately . we do n't need to worry about anything , and we just relay on the guid and enjoy a lot . and also almost all tour plan is good prise like not too expensive . peaple can join it so easily . this is the positive point . next , i have opinion a a negative point . the reason why i have never join that kind of tour is i need my private time . if i go to trip a a tour group , i have to go everywhere with member a a tour and i have to move on time . even though tour guider bring me to famous place , if i do n't like there , i may want to leave soon , and even though i really like one place and want to stay there , if time to go , i have to leave there . i do n't want to be selfish , but when i go to trip , i use my money only for trip , so i should go somewhere which i want , and i should use all minites a precious time . i have two side of opinion about tour travel , but i really do n't know which is the best . i think depends on people , we can enjoy travel a lot and have a great time .
