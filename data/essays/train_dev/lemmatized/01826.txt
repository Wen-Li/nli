i would agree with this statement . i think successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do . first , there are successful people who tried new thing . eveyone know about these company named microsoft , honda , and so on . these are now big company but started by few people . they made new buisiness and made lot of money . nobody thought that they were going to success first . they took risk and opened buisiness and successed . ssecond , even if you do n't try new thing , some people ca n't success on their life . if both people who try new thing and not try new thing ca n't success , i think people who tried new thing are more brave . even if they ould n't success at the time , they might success next time . because tthey once tried and learned what is not successful . nothing is born form challenging new thing . i also think it is boring to do same thing again and again . people used to live without light long time ago . now , people invented light and we can do anything at night . third , i think their attitude for trying new thing is hard but they can get to learn some thing . even they cant success first , they will success at the end . people tend to respect who is working hard . some people might bring good plan to you . i think the important thing is learning and not making same mistake again . according to above , i think successful people try new thing . i want to success in my life so i will try new thing . i want to challenge new thing and learn lot of thing . i hope those thing i learned will help me in the future .
