i disagree with the statement , because every age ha it own oportunity to enjoy the life . motivation should be the keyword instead of motion to understand what really lie under enjoying life . against the undeniable power of the energy of young people older people have experiment to defeat the badly result that life carry . this can help the older people to immedietly convert the negative into positive . they only need to motivate themselves and feel confident . enjoying life doe not mean having a sportive life , a person can enjoy the life by reading , writing or just by watching and commenting about the thing that take place around him . everyone like to watch the concept that they created before . young people have the ability of being more healthy but they do n't have free time and money to achive the activity that they really want . however , older people have the financial power to enjoy these activity if they do n't need to spend so much phyisical effort . the enjoys can differ in different age . the thing which are very fantastic in the young hood can be very boring when you are old . finally every age contains it own way of life and in every age the person can create some motivation to enjoy tye life .
