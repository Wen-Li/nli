the need for understanding idea , concept and learning fact of the topic is necessary for a student . the concept and idea in a genetic engineering class will help the student to solve the unknow problem or analysing the result of observation during a research in human evolutation . therefore , without understanding concept a technical education ca n't be completed . whereas , learning fact about the same topic is also important but without concept it ca n't be applied to a subject . learning fact are essential during history class . so , both understanding concept and learning fact are very important to a student . as i am a technical student , i would need to understand the concept of my subject prior to the fact already present . therefore , i completely agree with the statement that understanding of idea and concept are more important for a student a compared to learning fact . the doubt between knowing concept or fact can be cleared from the history of science . earlier , scientist who discovered new thing never knew any fact about it , they just understood idea and concept behind an incident before introducing their theory . for example , observing an apple fall from a tree and understanding the theory of gravity . many of the scientist belived in concept rather than fact . facts can be important in learning history , art and many be sometimes science like engineering and medical . but the importance of the concept and idea is manadatory for development of mankind . when we consider science behind the growth of world , we ca n't forget the importance of concept and idea which lead to the science of particular kind . therefore , understanding idea and concept is important for a student than learning fact . for the science and technology to grow exponentialy , we need through concept of subject and understanding of idea behind it . computers , wireless technology , fighter plane , new medicine are the fruit of excellent concept and innovative idea of the researcher only .
