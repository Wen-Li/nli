in my opinion , a good education system should always start with the understanding of idea and concept rather than with the learning of the fact . this is true from the very beginning of your education to the end of your academic life . when you start your study at the primary school you are just a child , often unable to link the fact the teacher is trying to teach you , in a more complex grid . the substructure of this grid are idea and concept . although it might appear easier to learn fact before understading the idea lying behind them , this way of teaching always lead to a lack of background structure and , therefore , to a lack of understanding : child will learn fact by heart , yet they will be unable to collect them into a coherent structure , hence failing their test . while a way of teaching focused on the understanding of idea and concept is the best choice for primary education , it can be really useful even in secondary and tertiary education . for example , if you study philosophy at the university , you will be thought nothing but idea and concept : is , therefore , studying philosophy only a waste of time ? i definitely do not think so . if you think about how many former student of philosophy you can find working in very different field , you will eventually agree with me . why those former student , who never received an education based on fact , are so successful in the work life ? this is because they have a fully developed grid of idea and concept that always help them understand quickly what kind of task they are asked for , even if it ha nothing to do with socrates , plato or kant . to sum up , an education based on the understanding of idea and concept is a better choice in order to develop a grid of thought that enables you to vary between many different discipline .
