it is often said that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . some people might agree with this statement because of the probability of innovation by trying new thing . however , i disagree with this statement in that knowing how to do well is a much important a trying new one , and doing familiar is more secure than taking risk . first of all , doing what people already know is very important a much a trying new one . people who do only what they already know how to do well often lead them to be an expert of their field . because they do the same work repeatedily , they may know many useful information of the work . for example , my uncle is an owner of a restaurant . the restaurant had succeeded from his grandparent , and my uncle ha workd there for his entire life , and he did n't try to do new thing even though he felt bored with the work . now , his restaurant is very famous traditional restaurant in my city , seoul , s.korea . he know well the recipe of the menu , and sometimes teach the skill to his worker . in addition , when it come to the safety of work , doing familiar thing guarantee more stable life . some might say that many innovative invention were from the trial new thing and taking some risk . however , the success were very small part of the trial . much more people have failed at those trial and risk . moreover , many successful professional like doctor and lecturer have shown that their skillful work style wa the key of their success , but not just trying new and innovative thing . their work is very safe a well . in conclusion , it 's not bad to try new thing and find other way in their field , but it is not the best way to succeed in their field . this is because the importance and safety of doing what they already know how to do well can not be underestimated .
