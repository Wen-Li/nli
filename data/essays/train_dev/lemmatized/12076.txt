i definetely agree with the statement , ' the bet way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . ' travelling in a group is an overwhelming experience since you are accompanied by a number of people which make your journey much more refreshing and exciting . either taking a break from work or planning for a vacation result in exploring destination . therefore the best way to do is to travel in a group and also making sure the right person is around to help you out the most enjoyable time of your life . this is where the tour guide come into play . though it might be a bit expensive to hire one but for sure you wont regret your decision a you will access yourself to having one of the most fascinating trip of your life . a tour guide will help you plan everything , taking in account minutest of detail and will at the same time make sure you 're satisfied by the outcome . whether it be the choice of staying in a hotel or having certain meal during the day , all is taken care of . tour guide help increase your knowledge which lead to better understanding of detail of that particular place . on the way , he 'll be disclosing these crazy fact which you might have n't ever or read or heard of . usually a tour guide know three or more language which show how flexible he is and is well equipped to handle task at hand . this perfectly work well with family picnic and ensures quality time spent with family and friend . however there are always two side to everything . people who are ambitious and adventurous , and those wo really want to explore the destination on their own are highly unlikely to accompany with a tour guide . this is possibly found with a large bunch of high school/university student mainly because they 're young and energized .
