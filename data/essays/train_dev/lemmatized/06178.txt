i agree with the statement that '' most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are '' . usually the product in the advertisement are shown to be more good looking , elegant , tasty , good texture , and all the higher quality , for which most of the time they do n't posse all those quality . for example take an advertisement of suiting 's and shirting , the dress they show seems to be very beautiful and attractive , elegantly coloured , but the same when you see truely may not be so good , the stiching may not be so perfect , the colour shade may not be appropriate and it may not fit well . the other example , if we take the advertisement regarding the food product , they show them to be very tasty and delicious and they also show that they can be prepared within few minute , but actually when we really taste them they may not be that delicious , or it may even take long time for preparing it . even the advertisement on variuos medical product show that the medicine work really faster , in a more efficient way , and they show all the thing that make u appeal that the product is of superior quality , but in real they may be associated with various side effect and may act differently on different individual or even the cost may be higher . for example once i wa watching an advertisement over the television which wa an equipment use for reducing weight . the advertisement said that we got to workout only for 15minutes on that equipment and no diet necessary and it would make you lose about 5 pound per week , and even they were showing some of the people and their experience who used that product and by looking at all those i wa so tempted to buy the product and ordered it , but once when i got the product and started using for few day , i could n't see any lose in my weight but i also notice knee pain problem by using that equipment . so , with that i clearly came to know that never beleive in advertisement a they usually make the product seem better that they really are to increase their sale . so , atlast i strongly agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem better a , that this the primary job of advertising in order to increase their sale and benefit , and it 's our duty to carefully judge the true characteristic of the product and decide whether to buy or not .
