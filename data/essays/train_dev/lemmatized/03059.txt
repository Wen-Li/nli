wherever you are , you will always have an ad , pointing out at an amaizing product , even if it look weird or expensive . it will always show the good point of it , and if not , there is a chance that something did not go well ! we are totally living in a consuming society , this one reason you have that much ad on tv , magasines . .. i remember when i wa about 7 year old , i saw on tv an ad for the baywatch barbie and all it go with . i totally felt for it . santa clause brought me the barbie and the jetski which match with for chrismas . i wa so exciting that i started to play with it immediatly , but they were that tiny detail nobody took care about , the jetski wa not water resistant and when i dived in my bath with it i wa pretty disapointed ! who could have guessed that ajetski would not be water resistant ? from my personnal experience i know that thing always look better on and ad . however , two year ago i went with some mate to miami , and a we were laying down , watching tv , acting like real teenager , this commercial pop : three ballerina eating oreo 's cooky , they were so cute who would not fell for them ? i might not have fell for her but i totally went for the cookies , they are so good ! love them . i think the perception you got from an ad is so different from each others that it make it difficult to have a real statement toward it . things could look good and are totally not and thing can look so weird and funny that you would not go for a bite , and it turn out that it is okay . honnestly , green jelly , no way . i remember in ireland , the ad with that kid who were eating like ton of it . .. more discusting than anything . green shinning thing in my mouth , hell no ! well right no we are working thing out , i 'd rather go for the blue one as i said , you can never trust a thing before you tried it , thing can turn a way you did not expected them to . .. last but not leasr , the only person you should believ in is yourself not the perfect mum on the tv who is telling you that it 's the best thing she never had in all her life .
