for my personal experience , i do n't agree with the statement : i think that understand idea and learn fact have the same importance . i study engeneering at the university and in this environment i have learned that understand concept make you able to apply their one to different problem ; nevertheless if you practise what have you learned , you may fix in your mind the true mean of you have only read in a book : the two thing have to go with the same step . in life , in general , i have the same point of view : i think experience is all , thereby concept and practise imply one inside the other one . i want say that someone may learn idea by fact , or fact by idea , but it is most important make experience , so one person have to improve his/her couriosity toward life at the same way with the two instrument ( idea and fact ) .
