i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older poeple do because young people want to discover the world , they usually have more energy than older people and they are not really worriend about the future . young people enjoy more their life simply because they do n't know a lot of thing . this is an extra motivation to enjoy almost anything that they go through . more over , young people always want to taste by themselves everything that surround them and they will always try to discover new and exciting thing . some thing that probably older people wo n't do are for example do extreme sport , traveling around the world and so on . this could happen because of a lack of energy by the older people . energy is really important to enjoy life . young people are usually full of energy because of their youthness , which is a disadvantage for older people who are usually tired of working and spend their free time recovering . a lot of people would say that energy is not necessary to enjoy life and that could be true . another way to enjoy life is to get a relax time , but again young people can enjoy more this relaxed time because they are le tired than older people are . older people are usually busy with their job because they are worried about their future . although young people are also worried about their future , they will always be le worried on this kind of issue . this le worried attitude lead u to think about a lack of resposability by young people . but that 's what make life more enjoyable . young people will always think they have a whole life towards them and that is a relief from some worry that older people usually have . every person can enjoy life to the maximun , but for sure young one will enjoy it more because their path in life ha just began and they still have a long road to go through it , which make life more enjoyable and exciting .
