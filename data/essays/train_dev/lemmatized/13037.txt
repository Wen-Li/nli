most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i am disagree with this statement because a lot of twince the product are only beautiful but do n't do their work . for example cloth , pc , tv . .. are very important for their signature and beautiful for their color but are n't good piece . my sister buy a lot of product very cheapy but after a season she ca n't use their because are broke and i am very tired with my sister . i will never buy a cheap cloth because i like change very often my product and i do n't want use a lot of money .
