i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are three reason for this . first , the goal of a company is selling the product . second , advertisement make people buy their product in indivisual way . a company which own the product 's goal is making their profit and that way , the company make people to think that the product is nessesary for them . the company 's goal is selling their product a many a they can . therefore , poeple who are making a advertisement make better looking than real product and use it for the advertisement . for example , . in taco bell advertisement , half-pound beef and potato burrito look bigger than the burrito from taco bell in our town . advertisements make people think that the product is a neccesary item . few day ago , i saw a old navy commercial , they kind of made me think that if i do n't wear their jean , i just do n't belong to our younger men community . so , i bought the product but it look a same a jean i got two month ago . advertisement is for a company which is selling the product 's profit and it make most people to think that the product is what they need . i wa kind of addicted to television home shipping few year ago , the seller in the homeshopping mentioned about what kind of people need their product . he said , younger or older lady and gentleman . instead of saying everybody . that product wa a pen with the light by the way . this kind of mind contral make people that product is nessesary even if they are not very important product .
