based on my current observation and personal experiece , i agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . first of all , young people nowadays are too occupied by class work . take myself for example , when i wa young school did not demand so much class work a they do today . my younger brother who go to college now spend almost all of his weekend working on class projectes . he barely ha anytime to do anything that he is interested in . while in the past , my college wa not so demanding and i had much more free time to engage in cummunity activity . secondly , due to the advent of the internet and mobile phone , young people nowadays have very few connection with the community . young people nowadays spend most of their time in their room surfing the internet or talking to their friend through the mobile phone . they seldom go out and meet people in the community , not to mention offering any help to the community . recently , i had a chance to visit a child hospital that i used to volunteered when i wa in college . i wa surprized by the few number of college student now volunteering there . finally , i find an obvious trend from recent newspaper and magzines ; the number of hosipital and non-profit organizaion lacking volunteer is increasing . especially , those activity that were traditionally carried out by young people . for example , the taiwanese government started a program some year ago to recruit young people to offer volunteer work overseas . recently , i read an article on the newspaper saying that now the government is having difficulty getting enough young people to help the community . based on the three specific experience and observation i decribed above , i agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not help their community enough .
