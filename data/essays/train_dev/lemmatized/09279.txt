in this rapidly changing world , we always face new thing every single morning . some peole think car are most revolutionary device the human have ever made so thus in the future these will be used widely . in my opinion , however , i strongly believe that there will be other thing that we can use instead of car in the the future . first of all , technology people are exploring play key role in developing new device . this is largely because technology will create trasporting machine that are more convenient and time saving . to illustrate this point , when i younger , i read a cartoon which ha been famouse , dragon ball . in this cartoon , there wa a device that fly , but not a airplane . this made them go the place where they want go faster . i am sure that there will be a this kind of device in the future . on top of that , the car used by people now will be gone . due to their danger and harmful effect on both nature and human , these will be replaced in a certain moment like it introduction . according to the oe specific reseach conducted by some university , people have a tendency to avoid car for their transporting device these day because they make lot of accident resulting in death a well a they destroy both human and nature by making harmful gas . this show that the car will be replaced in the future . to conclude , i firmly believe that car will be gone and replaced in the future because new technology will make new and convenient machine and they cause critical problem to human and nature . all il all , i think one 's creativity can do everthing that one imagine .
