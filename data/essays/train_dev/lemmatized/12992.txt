i do agree with the point that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . at this point of time i would like to cite a very famous song ' we will rock you ' that prof to me that youth is full of energy , zeal , mischief and livlihood . these all make a young person excited and make him ready to take on the world . when a girl or boy reach a stage to be called young then his / her parent start giving freedom to them which they welcome and like most . when they do not work or get married they depend on their parent and study for their aim . this make them full of enthusiasm which old people lack a they had already been to a stage where they can not think of making their career and becomes dispirited . in young day one ha lot many friend to play with , to roam , watching movie and sharing their view which most of the time a person in old age miss . parties , sport , gossip , food and excursion are all part of the life in young day . with old age people start loosing their body strength and they get overloaded with resposibilities which young never care in their time . an earning old person have to think about his family before taking dicisions . he ha to abide of the state law of tax and ha to pay attention to their young for their future . they need to laid the foundation for the life of their childrens . young people work for the thing they want and when they achieve they find themselves much more happy than anyone else . when they reached in their professional life they start earning and with the money they purchase the thing which they thought of in childhood . so young people have an advantage to enjoy life more than anyone else and the reason lie behind the freedom and very few resposibilities . but a these resposibilities their action get affected with them and their freedom start decreasing . with age they become resposible and seroius with very le enjoyment in life .
