for me , i would agree to join a group that led by a tour guide ; however , to travel by ourselves in an unknown plave in very dangerous and will spend lot of money . let 's imagine a condition . if we travel to an unknown place with only a map and confused by it , will we have a lot of fun in that place ? i think everyone 's answer is no . we can not just visit an unknown place on foot ; we should drive a car . if we miss the direction , we have to keep driving and spend lot of money for the oil . without the help of the tour guide , we might live in an expensive hotel . if there is something we do not understand about the landscape , there is no one we can ask , and it is not easy to ask a stranger . once we meet the danger such a medical care , it will be very hard to seek the volunteer who can help u . if there is a tour guide , we can visit the place , which in the place we do not even know before , with happy heart and good consulors . we do not need to bring a map becuase the tour guide is our map . we do not need to walk or drive the car and spend the oil money ; we will have a comfortable bus and pay only a small amout of money for it . we will not have any question about the landscape becuase the tour guide will be a teacher . if we have danger , the tour guide will find a way a soon a possible to solve it . in conclusion , even though travel just by ourselves can make u have more freedom and time , but we will also bring anything that is uncertain with u , such a car accident and miss the way to go . we all sure want the happiness and peace with u when we are traveling , but without a good helper , everything will happen easily . if there is a good helper when we are traveling , we do not need to worry much about everything becuase the tour guide can led u to the happiness and peace . although we have to pay the money to the tour guide , but the most important is the safety and a nice spirit in a trip .
