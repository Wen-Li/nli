we often hear people saying that young people should enjoy life a long a they still can . therefore , it is sort of commonly accepted that older people are not enjoying their life , or at least le than the younger people . we will discus both side of this statement , and will express our final point of view a a conclusion . young people have le responsibility than older one : older people are responsible of younger one ! as an example , it is rare to see parent buying firecracker to make a joke to their neighbour whereas it is cliche for youngster to do so . young people do n't have to work a to make their family live ; they attend class and have a lot of activity ; they are young and they enjoy themselves , because they simply have le responsibility . but this is a youngster point of view . do older people really enjoy their life le than younger people ? obviously not . for example , having a family and giving birth to an offspring is enjoyable , perhaps the most enjoyable thing in the world ! if older people enjoyed their life le than younger one , our world would be a very sad world . .. thus , some young people do not enjoy there life , and some old people obviously do . the statement ca n't be true because of this simple fact . honestly , if older people did n't enjoy themselves a much a younger one , would it be worth to live this ? obviously if life is not enjoyable , then life loses it primary purpose , and living this life would be purposeless . i think the statement is a young people point of view , and is not really well thought . at first , we feel it is true , but in fact it is because what we think is enjoyable or not change when we get older ! loving to read poetry at the age of 13 is rare , but at the age of 65 it can be fully appreciated and understood , because the person ha more experience and can catch the sense of it . i think that how we enjoy ourselves is different , but no one enjoys him or herself more than someone , based on his age . enjoying life is universal , and ha no age . young people enjoy life a much a older people do , and vice-versa .
