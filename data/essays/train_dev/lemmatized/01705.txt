i think that this is not a very simple question . especially not for me because i am still young and not yet old . so i have only the opportunity to summerize out of my sight a a young man . nevertheless , i will try to find a well argued result . young people on the one hand are in common healthy . they have the physical possibilty to jump around , dance , make sport , or to move from one point to another . and all that without any disabbilities or any pain . older people on the other hand have often painful time . does not matter , if owing to a life 's work , or common disease . they are often not able to walk for a long time . they often have problem with their heart or their blood circulation . but a they worked for nearly their whole life , older people have gotten the possibilty to save some money . young people did not yet had this opportunity . and nowadays money is an important factor to enjoy one 's life . as a result of this let me say that old people are rich and young people poor . another result of this fact is that older people do not have to work anymore . so they have the opportunity to schedule their time a they want to . young people on the other side have to go to school , to university , or even to work . now let me say that time is also a very important factor in our current time . 2:1 for the older people . and now let me summerize . young people are healthy . but they have neither money nor time to spend in life . for me time and money is the most important to have fun , i. e. to enjoy my life . all these regardings let me think that older people enjoy their life more than young people do .
