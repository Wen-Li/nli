all of the student who is in all over the world , we must learn a lot of thing and sometimes writing report , orgnize idea , taking examination and showing how much that your understanding is . everytime we must know fact and specific information to when we present the idea , make presentation correctly . so we must learn fact correctly because of if we do not know the fact , we can not understand really idea or concept and we understand more different thigs to concept ( or idea ) . the first idea , we must learn fact more than concept for the understanding of correct idea ( concept ) . for example if we do not know the fact of nowadys world , we can not why we must learn history . we learn history because of contrasting nowadys and old type or just learning the how the historical world wa . and , if we understand fact we can understand more easily about concept . the second idea is we must understand fact for understanding concept . it mean if we learn really about concept and some tip of fact in our brain the idea will be mixing and make u confusing . for example of history , if we learn about only a lot of contry 's damage of world war second it is fact of history but it too specific and we are confusing that we are learning about the situation of each country 's damage or the world war second . in this situation we are learning about world war second , so to make u no confusing at the first we must learn about fact . that is my opinion that we must learn the fact than idea and concept because of understanding what the important thing and main idea is . everytime studying about the main topic of major and understanding about the feature . however the most important thing is to understand the feature and use feature to understand the main idea .
