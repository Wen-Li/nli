if the most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are is a very interesting problem . how student in communication study i had the opportunity to spent long time thiking about this statement and i feel to me to say that i am agree with it and now i want to explain the reason : is the nature of communication to build a illusory world , also called how simulacre world . that mean that everything wee see in television o hear by radio or , again , seen in the billboardsi n the street is not real rappresentation of the true world , where we live in , but just a product persuasory world . this persuasory world is managed by great economic group that have the only target of : sell the most product possibily to the mass . the problem is that there are a lot of good the the people do n't need . so we can understand how the core business of the advertisement is make product seem useful and great . for this purpose there are lot of trick coming from the commercial sphere of : music , text , visual art . the copywriter are people able to use all this expedient to invite the costumer to buy the product . so , other than a communication student , i am a costumer and i want to point off my experiece . in particular i want to talk the case of the pizza . when we see it in the television advertisement , we can a fantastic slice of tomato and mozzarella and the green the basilic but when we get it out of the box , we just a poor slice of something that we think how probabily pizza . the problem is this . there is word that ask and invite you to buy a product and then there are the costumer , that use that product and find the true but is only business .
