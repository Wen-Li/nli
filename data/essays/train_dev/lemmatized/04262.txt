students have many choice of their study method . learning fact are outweighted to understanding concept in three way because learning fact is easy , quick and efficientive . firstly , fact is not abstract a concept and idea so it is easier to be comperhensived by student . besides that , it is easy to rememeber to a fact than the long definations . in darily class , teacher always like to use some example and fact to support his or hers opinion . when people talk to each other , someone threw a fact that nobody heard of before , people would think that person is knowledagable and it is easy for those listener to retell the fact to others . secondly , learing fact is a fast way to learn . most of the fact do not contain only one concept or idea applied in the book . since fact is not a simply a concept and idea , people are able to learn town of concept and idea though one fact . this can shorten the time of study because people only need to learn several fact and these fact maybe cover all the concept and idea in the book . last but not least , efficiency is another improtanted factor that made me think that learning fact is better way to learning concept and idea . people live in a society and thing happen every second . therefore , we can learn all the time when we commuincate with the society . people can learn fact from talking to others , observing someone 's action toward some event or even listening to the news on people 's way back home . there are so many way to learn fact and almost at no cost . leanring concept and idea are quite limited comparing to leanring fact . people have to spend money on book and pay for the lecture . to conclude , learning fact in easy , fast and efficientive .
