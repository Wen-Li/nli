i completely disagree with the wiew that young people do not spend enough time helping their communiy . in fact i believe that the most active member of community are young people . community need are varied , and not are not just limited to helping out elderly people , or servicing in hospital , or other typically welfare duty . nonetheless many of the young people i know spend much of their spare time volunteering on ambulance , or performing play and music for elderly , thus contributing significantly to the total amount of time spent by the communty in general on these task , and often being the promoter of such activity . on top of this i am firmly convinced that community need space and occasion on which to gather , in order to strenghten their mutual tie , to get to know each other better , thus exchanging culture and knowledge . it is my experience that young people are the best and the more commited to organize such event . in fact many of the art display in my community are organized , and kept running by people in their twenty ; and often the work displayed are also made by young people . this show that young people are helpful to their community in two different way : they both organize cultural event and are the main cultural point of reference and innovation in the community . i also know a lot of youngster involved in politics , both trhough political party and political association . i have been in a political association for many year too . in the meeting that were frequently held , important topic regarding our city and province were usually discussed and debated , and often innovative and revolutionary idea were developed , some of which were later successfully implemented by the local authority . moreover an advancement in political and social belief will not be possible without the fundamental partecipation of young people to public life . it is my opinion that this misconception of young people not helping their community is mainly spread by old conservative , who fear what new the young generation can bring , and always have their head turned back , remembering how life wa much better when they were young .
