i disagree with this idea because i do not think idea and concept are more important than the fact . there are three reason to support my opinion . first , concept and idea are only needed to be well on their school . student have to understand the concept and idea to solve question on their test . but i do not think it is `` learnig '' . acutually , it is `` memorising '' . second , fact are the most important thing in this world . no one can deny any fact and break it . we have to know the fact to be well on our sosiety . if student understand only concept or fact , they will be confused finaly . third , not only student also adult have to understand fact to understand it 's concept and idea . in my opinion , nobody can understand completely the concept and idea without the fact . that 's why they have to understand the fact first . a lot of student are learning only concept and idea to be well on their school . by this education , they can not solve any irreguler question even if it is using same idea a what they could solve before . because they do not know the fact for the problem that 's why they can not enhance their knowledge . those student would be wondered that why they are using those concept and idea to solve their problem after they started to work on their major corces . i think , people have to know the fact first to study what they interested in . when i study something new for me , i am always wondered that why we are using this idea and how it is used to solve problem in acutual situation . to solve these question , we have to know the fact for the satatement . from my opinion , i think the fact are more important than the concept and idea to solve our question or study what we are interested . that 's why i disagree with the statement .
