pursuit of wise i hereby agree than in the learning procces , you have to combine the experience which are fact , with the knowledge which mean idea and concept . since you are a kid , you start to learn fact , to ilustrate this , a crowling baby is going to know than crowl is usefull to touch thing , to get what he desire , to experiment sensation or feeling , though the baby doe not have enough develop of his body and mind to undestant the concept . i meant learning fact is almost per se for your condition like human being , on the other hand , whereas idea an concept are the second step in the learning process . according with the imformation above the student have to have the knowledge ( idea - concepts ) from book , from search , from teacher , to know how to apply in the experience , nevertheless study about education showed how the experimental learning is more effective than knowledge that you have in your mind but you dont know how to use them . despite the importance of theory , the experience that you life , you never are gonna forget it because is a bunch of feeling , thought , conclusion . this argument support the idea about why the curriculum have to be experimental , this way the student became his own teacher and the knowledge that he will get from book suppor his own experience . to summarize , i belive the education is one of the most important value and award that you can obtein in your whole life , is why , if you are a lucky or fortunate to do it , filling your mind of idea and concept that day by day you are gonna life a fact .
