do you agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ? most people may diagree that because they think people will rely on car more in the future than today . however , i agree with the statement because i think the technology will create new transpotation tool to replace the car . i will argue over my perspective with the following reason . first of all , accoring to the insufficient of the petroleum , scitients are eager to device new tool to replace the car . nowadays the oil resource become a searious problem all over the world . since the resource are limited , human can not use it without restriction . however , people are too late to get aware of that , so the price of oil starting soaring up and it might cause the third world war . in order to avoid the energy problem become the trigger of the war , every country will decrease the use of car . secondly , people in the future will develope a more efficent and rapid transportation tool which can replace car . although it only happens in the movie now , the future people will fly in the sky , i still believe it can come true under the scientist endeavor . people become more and more lazy and the ground get crowder than before , without any space to extend , it seems to reansonable to enlarge people 's living to the sky . in addition , fly can save more time and also solve traffic problem happens now . however , this need the technology to reach the goal and i expect that . to sum up , although car are main tool that people depend on , with the overuse of car , there are a lot of peoblems emerging . in order to release ourselves from vicious circle , human being will initiate one new thing to help u attain the same goal . in other word , people is going to invent air-transpoted tool to declin the number of car .
