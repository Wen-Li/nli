everybody want to be successfull in life , nevertheless only some people achive this . i 'm firmly agree with the statement that successfull people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in the present essay i will endouver to figure out my reason . from my point of view , one of the major factor in reaching success is self-development . but how can it be possible while always doing the same thing . you should try new thing to reach better solution . otherwise you can not develop what you are doing . moreover in our high compettative era it is more difficult to be successful . because everybody endeavor to do their best , you must do something different . being different always make you more easy to being recognised , nevertheless you must try something different , even something never tried before . and this mean risk . when we consider the successful people lived in the history , we see a common point . this is risk taking . although there are many people in history who ha taken risk and than fail , i think we must be thankful for their effort because we have reached our modern era with the effort of such kind of people . for instance madam currie risked her life to find some radiactive material . but she made a huge progress in chemistry area . in conclusion , i want to remark that doing what we already know how to do well , without taking risk in lfe , we can not make progress . from my point of view success is worthwhile to take some risk in life .
