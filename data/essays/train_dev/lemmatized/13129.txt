in life there are situation for everything . in case of this statement i belive that there are certain time when the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide but there are also sometimes that you want to travel with your family , friend or by yourself . it depends on your expectation of the trip and how you like to travel . traveling with a tour guide is always much more practical and easier . here , most of the time thing work a they are supposed to work . flights are booked , hotel have reservation , restaurant are good , time are scheduled and thing just run easly . this is a perfect choice for a first time visit to a place . if you only have a couple of day , and want to get to know a much a you can , a tour is perfect . it will show you all around , the most interesting site and what everyone talk about . in the other hand , traveling by yourself is completely different , here you get to make your own choice . you decide when you want to wake up , at what time and where you want to go to dinner and what museum you want to go visit . this is a much more relaxing time . it is a perfect situation for a second time visit , here you get to go to the place you most liked the last time you visited and do exactly what you want . it requires much more individual planning , well no one is going to to that job for you , but it also ha certain priviledges . i also belive that a group and a tour is not a thing for everyone . you have to be tolerant with the other people around and you have to let people bos you . if you are not a type or person that like to rush and be with a lot of people , traveling by yourself is the best choice . i dont think you can say what is best , you just have to consider the type of trip you want to have and the type of person you are . then you can make the right choice and enjoy a perfect trip .
