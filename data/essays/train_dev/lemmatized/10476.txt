it could be said , it really depends on what kind of type the person is , therefore , i agree with this opinion . some people successed with only doing what they already know how to do well but i hardly believe that the kind of peple could successed only in limit of level . no risk but no big return . i think that successful people try new thing not just to money but they like to try new thing . as a result of their action , they earn a lot of mony and find a different way to successed from others . thinking about our computerized life , when i wa a junior high school student , nobody know what the internet mean . only few people showed their interest on it and start some internet business . nowadays internet business is the one of most successful business but they always have to try new thing and develop their knowledge and technics . if they do n't , no longer become to successful people ! also if people in this world are doing only they already know thing , our culture and industry have no chance to improve . we always need to seek something new to u . of course there are some risk all the time to do new thing , but if we do n't try , we ca n't gain anything including the meaning of successful . i do n't want to think all the time to become successful person but i always want to try to be a challenging person for everythins . and someday , i may become one of a successful person .
