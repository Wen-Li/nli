conflicts between generation have been aroud for century and still generate much debate . older generation often disapprove of the behaviour of young people , and this disapproval is obvious in the way that we understand young people 's commitment to their community . although i acknowledge the generous contribution of some young people in helping their community , i agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . in the last three year , i have volunteered a a tutor for child from disadvantaged background and for various job at university . i feel that it is very important to help one 's community , but when i try to think of example of such generosity in my fellow student and in younger people , i struggle to find two example . i only need to look at the employment website of my university to see that the voluntary job being advertised are not popular ; the website count the number of time that a page is seen and that number is particularly low for voluntary activity . if we forget about volunteering and think of helping one 's community a just spending time with that community and taking part in it activity , one will still find that young people are rather absent . life ha become a very private enterprise now . the advent and the popularity of video game , the internet and mobile phone show that it is now possible to enjoy oneself without leaving a room . it is possible to be part of a virtual community ( in chat room for instance ) without having to spend any time with the local community . this privatization of entertainment and of life in general mean that young people seem much le concerned about their direct community and are more focused on themselves . most teenager are rather self-absorbed and forget about the community around them . for instance , my sister is often more concerned about the outfit that she is going to wear the next day than about sick member of the family . she feel that she doe not have any time to spend with my grandmother , so absorbed is she in her fashion concern . in a way , young people are involved in another community . it seems that community have become much bigger in the last century . while a few decade ago event happened at a local and community level , the development of information and communication ha led to an enlargement from a village community to a world community . in the 1900s , people would listen to the news of their community , of their village , and maybe of the nearest town , but today we learn about the world on the news . although young people might be part of that community , there is still little sign of them truly helping in that community . i therefore do agree that young people do not spend enough time helping their community . however , they should not necessarily be blamed for this ; we just need to give them a sense of community to make them want to participate in that community ; it is up to parent and to the educational system to achieve this for a better world .
