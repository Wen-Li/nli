in my opinion , succcesful people try to new thing while they are with many mistake , and they will keep until it will be success what they want to make somothing . for example , egyison tohmas who made a electolonic thing . he is familier with everyone and he is popular person for successful . so i agree with successful people try new thing and take risk . there are two reason . one reason is seccess and failuer are conected always . when i learn cooking first time . i could n't cook anything even though just cut food , at that time i cut my hand , yet when i cooked a food second time , it wa a success . another reason is try new thing are discover somthing new ever i have n't knew thing . i like to know new thing and i do n't care what kind of risk . thus i think it is important to try new thing and take risk for successful people .
