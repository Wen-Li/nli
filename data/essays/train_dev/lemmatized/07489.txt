i agree , it is a general trend nowadays , that many young people leave their own country in order to find new opportunity . young generation tend to spend time on computer or finding new thing around their living palces a well a getting more educatoion is seemed more important for them thatn inlvolving in helping family or even spending few time with community . we have other problem facing young people that is drug and being victim of sex and other time wasted activites , where all end up in not using the wright time to develop their self and to help the people around them . on the other hand , we find that young people are having sort of unstable life due to some family problem such parent divorce or family break-up . another thing , which can explain why young people not doing so is that community are not repsenting one structure they lack thing like real value , communitites nowadays are calling for political engagement and racism issue and not promoting for reall value and building society around them . young people often complain about the military task given the government to do at their early life , where this service is not considered a a communial or social service performed certain youn people . there is a lack of educating the young people about the value they may have to serve the community and have the best of service towards them , it is very important at shcool level to educated young generation to know the importance of community service and it impact withing the society and even the outcome of it on their family to have better life and understand the communial work where it can get result on the country . if we follow all these step to bring back young people on track , we certainly have achieved our objective and we would see many young people working in their community and be an example to others and their child how they worked and served their community , so all the socity will praise them for their great achievment
