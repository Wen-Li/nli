yes i do agree with the statement most adverstisement make product seem much better than they really are because without having advertisement how can we know about the product . for example take product like oat which is used a food item we can have with hot water and mixing milk and sugar , it can be shown a a tv add by playing a role by reputated person like sport , film actor and like model . play must be for 30 sec only in that we must show all type thing like what oat contains and how it is usefull for daily used people by prefoming and add with in 30 sec showing the embalem of the product . the advertisement should be shown globally to people . giving advertisement for a product it give complete picture or use of the product which should be seen by people . product should have import and export value by their demand . the product should gain the demand by showing proper advertisement . people should have proper idea on the product they should believe it by seeing proper advertisement . means advertisement should impress the demander . advertisements should be shown globally , there we can find the demand . advertisements should have proper theam which impress consumer and they should attract by seeing that , there are many way to sell the product by giving attractive gift on using advertisement , showing that if product is buyed you can have gift coupon of worth of x / rs . the whole advertisement should take abcitvate and should gain more demand . advertisements play an major role to sell a product . because product should show in real and caption shown below with small letter that indicates these play is performed by expert so please u do not follow the same , means it incdicates true but not real . one good example is that cigar selling are shown on tv advertisement but on packet it will retuen smoking is injurious to health . the best example for advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
