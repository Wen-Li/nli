the thesis of the given topic is sucessful people are intrested to try new thing instead of doing they already know . although some people disagree with the given topic i agree with the topic : sucessful people try new thing and take risksrather than doing old because of several reason . all the reason are explained below . the first reason to support my point of view is : since they taste the sucess they can try for new thing . without inventing new thing there is no world . since this people know how to do thing , it is better to try for new one . let u consider an example of early human being . at the first he know only how to produce fire by using stone , this is a great sucess in early man life . and then he take risk and inventes the whell , clothing etc . from this we can say sucessful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing old one . so according to this example we can say sucessful try for new thing and take risk . another reason to support my point of view : if a sucessful person think this sucees is enough mean there is no development in the world . so inorder to develop the world they try for new thing . another example to support my point of view is-if thomas . a , . adesen satisfies with the invention of electric bulb mean we may miss his other so many invention like `` theory of electro magnetic '' . since he know the basic thing he intrested to try for new thing and taking risk instead of doing the same old thing . finall reason to support my point view is it is good for sucessful person to try for new thing . because of these thing they may get good name and fame in the society because of inventing new thing . more over they get huge amount of money by selling new thins to the people in the siciety . so they try for new thins and take risk insead of olsd thing . so in conclusion these reason are enough to support my point of view . so agree with the given topic .
