i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . one of the best example that come to mind from my personal experience is a mcdonalds burger . have you ever seen a mcdonalds commercial on tv or in a magazine ? the burger look big , juicy and fresh . every time i see one of their ad on tv i want to run to the nearest mcdonalds to buy a big mac ! the problem is that when i get there and actually buy one of their burger i am always left very disappointed . the burger look in no way alike to the one you see on tv . it 's smaller and it surely doe n't look a fresh . the taste at the end is ok but the fact remains that their ad would never show what their real burger look like . otherwise nobody would ever feel the urge to go out and buy one . advertisements are therefore misleading . not always but very frequently . having said this , if i were to make a commercial to try to sell one of my product , i would probably do exaclty the same thing . if everyone is doing it , i do n't want to be the only one being honest because this would negatively effect the sale of my product . the only way to solve the problem is to help the whole advertising community to be honest . we should always remember that consumer are not stupid . they can be naive at first , but not stupid . you can fool a consumer once , but the consumer will never go back to you again if he is not satisfied with your product . at the end of the day , it probably doe n't pay to delibarately fool consumer . they will find out sooner or later and they will punish you . this being said , everyone is always going to try make their product seem a little more appealing to the public . this will never cease . but the consumer know this and is aware of this . in conclusion , i will always go back to mcdonalds not because of the commercial i see on tv but because i like the taste of their big macs even though they look disgusting !
