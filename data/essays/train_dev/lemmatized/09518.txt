some people think that course taught in university are too theoreticals and should be more based on fact instead of general idea and concept . i strongry disagee with this opinion for several reason . the first reason why i think that idea and concept are more important for student than simply learning fact is that you can always learn fact by yourself . actually , you do n't even need to be a student in a classroom to learn them . indeed , most fact are just data that can be memorized with no or little understanding . but what really matter is the the underlying cause of a fact , even if it is very general . for example , a fact in finance is : `` you should diversify your portfolio in order to lower your risk '' . but what is really important behind this fact is to understand how the risk can be evaluated , and what are the main factor that make diversification an efficient investment strategy . if you do n't understand the concept , you might still be able to learn the fact , but it always will be a limited basic understanding . secondly , idea and concept will eventually help you to understand the fact and therefore are more important . for example , you may be able to memorize the list of all the president of the united states , but is n't the idea of creating a democracy in america more important than a list of name ? students do n't have to become factbooks or encyclopedia but should be able to understand the fact based on the concept and idea that they have understood in class . it is a deeper knowledge and probably more general but it is also a key to deal with new situation . in conclusion , the role of a university is to make student become responsible person able to think by themselves and to give them key to better learn and understand fact : idea and concept .
