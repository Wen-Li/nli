in my point of view , there will be more car in use in twenty year than today . there are two major reason that can explain this : first is an economic view and second is an ecologic and scientific point of view . more and more country are growing up and becoming powerful economically , such a china , india . .. their demography is very impressive and their grow up will permit more people to obtain a car than today . the fact that the economic situation is positive contribue to the grow up of the car market . and more we need car , cheaper they will be . nowadays , many people have a car . i have recently read that california , where there are nearly thirty two million people , count an estimated number of twenty eight million of car , whcich is such important ! this asks u the problem of pollution , that could be a factor to brake the expansion . but more and more , researcher are working on developping another alternative carburants or energy source that will soon replace the petroil . indeed , other carburants issued from the agriculture and fewer polluant may be used , but they they are muite marginal and it will expand when the petroil will decline . furthermore , electric car have recently appeared , and make a very good substitute . they are more expensive than other car , but with the technological progress they will become cheaper and more currently than they actually are . in conclusion i think that we will find more car in twenty year than today , but these car will be different because of their adaptation to the pollution and new technology .
