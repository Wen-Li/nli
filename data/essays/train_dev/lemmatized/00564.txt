i do n't support the idea that is better to have broad knowledge than to specialize in a specific subject . therefore i think that beeing professional mean that a person ha to acquire many theorical concept at the beginning of his carrier , but he ha to grow his specific skill in his major during the job-s life . during my life i found many reason that bring me on this idea . first of all , a person who chooses his specific subject can be focused on his personal goal . infact , when someone doe n't care about nothing in particular , he is usual to find a job just to earn money and take more time to think about his intersets . the time is very precious for personal knowledge and for the life in general . second , be focused in a specific knowledge 's area doe n't enhance more problem , otherwise more alternative . i really believe that there are many aspect in every subject and everyday we have to make your best choice . for instance , when a student is improving his skill on many matter it is more possible that he will fail in one of those , than onether guy who is learning about only one subject . flexibility is n't a synonim of the dispersion of personal idea . personally , when i graduated two year ago i chose where i would like to work , in which sector and what will be my goal . i really appreciated the advice of my parent whose suggested me to find a general job to be able to change it in the future . anyway , i preferred to be focused on my major . now i am gratifyied by my decision and i will suggest the same to my friend that are still studying . for those reason i discourage everyone to have broad knowledge .
