a more common and well accepted saying is `` it 's better to be a master of one trade than be a jack of all '' . being a person who would like to specialize in the field of wireless telecommunications , i disagree to the statement `` it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' , a against what the current world is demanding . most of the human being is talented in one specific skill . so he can concentrate and outperform well on a subject or topic that he ha chosen depending on this skill . also his performance will be better when he work on this liking subject or topic . for example , a person who like singing can contribute better if he specializes on music , a compared to his performance in other subject . speaking about academic , a person specializes on a subject which he like the most . he chooses that subject in which he feel he can contribute more . having a broad knowledge of many academic subject , can certainly to one extend , help a person . it will help him to have a wider aspect of thinking . for example , knowledge of mathematics will certainly help a person specializing in physics . but at the end of the day , it is what he contributes to the society that matter most . for example , albert einstein , famous for his theory on relativity , concentrated in improving his knowledge in a specific subject physic , a against scratching his head in different science available during that era . he wa able to contribute a lot in the field of physics , though he wa poor in mathematics . so i would like to summarize that , having a broad knowledge on different academic subject will surely help a student , but specializing in a specific subject will help him to master it and in turn will help him to contribute back in that field . thus contributing to the society , more than to himself .
