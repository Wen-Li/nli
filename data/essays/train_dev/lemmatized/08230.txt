i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . just learning fact might be too boring for student and they might lose their interest in the subject . one reason why i believe that , is that understanding a bigger meaning or cohesion of something may enhance the student interest in the subject . to get the context of an issue is far more interesting than learning fact and not knowing their meaning in a bigger picture . furthermore , student might develop more independence when learning concept rather than on fact . a scond reason why i believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , is that student tend to forget dry fact quite fast , because they can not relate them to something sensefull . if they however , understand a whole concept , they might know why it is important and they might be able to connect that concept to the real world and aplly it . in that case , the student will know what for they are learning in school . another reason , why i believe that idea and conepts are more important for student to learn than fact , is that in general fact are difficicult to apply in the real world , because they are just part of a concept or an idea . understanding just a part of something doe often make not much sense and is useless . understading something in a whole , make student be more interested in more concept and idea , because one idea may lead to another , and so on . to sum up , i believe that fact should be the base that is to be learnt in order to understand big context . just learning fact doe not prepare the student for the real world , since the real world doe not consist of fact , but of idea and concept .
