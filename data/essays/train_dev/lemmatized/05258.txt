since their first appearance on the market , car had gone through an outstanding increase concerning their rate of production . it is starting from this idea that i do not agree with the statement . in fact , looking back at history an evident growth of car production can be seen , together with a rapid development of competition between the car industry that are also forced to follow people 's need . first of all , since their first production during the 1920 's ( with tom ford ) , car have gradually gained an even bigger role in society . their introduction into people 's life started to completely revolutionize their everyday life and their standard . people obtained the possibility of moving throughout their country and to become more independent . since then , car have become part of our life , even influencing our deicisions and our plan . it is for this reason that today 's car production ha more than doubled it sell and it is still continuing to do so . secondly , i do not agree with the statemetn because competition among industry producing car is pushing their production to augment instead of decreasing it . in today ' s society it is fundamental to invest and make money , therefore competition between industry is reaching really high level . it is due to this increasing competition and rivalry that car production is not going to stop and not even to slow down . finally , car producer are also following people 's need in society and , since our request and need are increasing and changing a time go by , the production of car is following our demand . people from all over the world need such a fundamental mean of transportation in order to travel , work and fullfill their own goal . when industry decide to sell a product , they first refer themselves to society 's and people 's need and since car are even more present and necessary to u , their production is continuing to proceed in a positive way . these three point are the reason why i do not agree with the statement . not only i base myself on historical evidence , but i also analyse the influence people 's need have and the company ' interest in producing something which is worth selling .
