i defintly agree that the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . and we have to admit that part of the problem is that we believe in it , the people in the marketing market is pretty smart they make u feel we need something when we actually do n't , just because we saw our favorite pair of jean on a famous person we need them , they made u feel that necessity just because we like that actor ( actress ) , he/she look good in them but that doens't mean that you 'll look the same with them on . it 's pretty amazing they just get the perfect enviroment in a commercial , everything is so well planned that even if it did n't seem good enough for you , they are going to make it seem in other commercial , poster , etc . the perfect way of presenting a product better than it really is in this new age of the marketing , where you can buy stuff you see on tv or just online . usually what we see on tv , is not worth the price , or what it doe but it seems to u a such a good idea , and then again , they make you feel you need it , and when you have it the material they are made of are not good , or it brake , and all the magic and the wonderful idea go in the garbage can . you can get cheated the mayority of the time and that 's abussive from the people that sell the product and know what they are showing is not even half of what you are getting . it all will depend in what are you buying , who are you buying it to , and what are the condition of the purchase . usually the stuff that are reliable have good condition of purchase , they have flexible returning policy , i think every time we have to be careful and councious with the stuff we 're buying , because nobody is going to return the money back into our wallet .
