i agree with the statment that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . if i think about my past when i wa younger . i can remember the idea that my friend and i had about helping our community . we used to spent at least few hour a week to provide service and help people that were in some kind of trouble . naturally our help wa related with our age , but it wa a good way to teach u the sense of community . nowadays i can see in many different occasion that young people are more selfish , they think just about themself and what is the best thing to do just for themself . during last year i have never met a young person that wa giving some of his time to do something helpfull for the community . in our modern society there are many thing that everybody should do for the benefit of our community , and some of them should be done expecially by young people . for example they should spent part of their time staying with old peolple and help them . i think this is a good way to learn the history and get a sense of responsability . i remember that i used to do that expecially with all my grandparent , and i learnd many thing from them . nowadays young peolpe prefer to stay with their friend maybe waisting time or doing something really useless . probably there are different reason why young peolpe have this kind of attitude , but i think that the most important reason is related with their parent . i think they forgot wich are the most important value in a sociaty . they also did not teach what a kid should do for his growing and how relate with the community . i am sure that if i will have a child i will teach him how to give his help to his community and how to relate with it .
