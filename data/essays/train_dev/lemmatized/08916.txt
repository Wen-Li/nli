i agree with the following statement that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is more better than having specialize in one specific subject . i am a japanese high school student . i am studing various subject in my school . it is too hard for me to understand all of these , but studing a lot of subject is very interesting and i can feel happy when i understand the something new . so , i stronglly feel we should study and get broad knowledge from many academic subject . then i would like to explain more detail . these day , there are many enviromental problem around the world . for example , grobal warming , water pollution , air pollution , many rain forest are destoloed , and rubbish problem . i think these problem are not solve with a single subject knowledge , so scientist in the world should share their opinion and result of study with other field of masser 's scientist to solve these problem more better . if we have broad knowledge of many academic subject , we could think about many thing , and we could get ability something new .
