i strongly agree with the fact that successful people are avid risktakers . but first let specify what success mean ?? success not only mean to be happy in term of wealth , fame and appreciation , it also ha a lot of bearing to self-satisfaction and the feeling of being at peace with oneself . only if successful people cared about fame and money then i surely think that percentage of successful people living would have been far higher than it exists . the reason being there are defined and speculative way for ganing wealth and fame or making pot of money . but for being successful in truest sense you have to be a risk taker . not essentially in term of an explorer amid the ghostly white setup of artic in his mission to reach the pole , but also in term of an individual whose philosophy involves inviting new idea , redefining the convention and more importantly unlearing the redundant practice . the people we today see enjoying corporate success , political success or even a movie star have one thing in common . they dared to look beyond what wa obvious . then they took the next step or `` risk '' of questioning it and redefining it with a new startegy . thus not only warren buffet , fidel castro and robin williams did that they changed the way people look at the usual and maybe mundane working of earning profit , driving a nation and being an accomplished actor . this kind of reversal and effective transition of the geography of task , work and assignment in to challenge and goal is what defines successful people from rest of the lot . i firmly believe that certain degree of non-conformity and questioning of dogmatic belief is also an ingredient to take your success to the next level . people would ridicule you , laugh at you or even hurl abuse at you but remember company like apple inc. were n't born out of cosy cushion of money and self apprasing practice . it grew rapidly due to creativity and innovative idea which also involve considerable risk and questioning but payback is healthy and self satisfactory . to summarize the essay the society should be made of free thinker and risk taker alongwith people who understand there vision , garner it and substantiate it into a reality .
