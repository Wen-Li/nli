i do believe that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . as the care are going cheaper and cheaper , many family bought the car . this directly caused the shortage of parking space . our goverment published a new rule that increase the charge of parking . also , the goverment also raise the fee for the annual exam of the car . people are getting more and more care about their money rather than their convinience . my father is exactly an example . we drove our car anywhere we were goin to , though it wa only 2 km away from my home . but now , everything changed . when he plan to drive the car , he will count whether it is worthwhile . of course , this is a effective way to reduce the use of car . now it is , and it will . secondly , people are going to concern the enviroment . as so many disaster happened in recent year , we do realized that car do make a big contribution to the worldwide pollution . more and more polluted gas are out , and we can not live healthily . it may caused disease such a caugh , headache and so on . we can easily hear the people around u say that take care of the dust outside , it will make you sick . not using care mean we are taking care not only the enviroument but also we ourselves . thirdly , the goverment and scientis are also devoted to set up a convient public traffic system . my father picked me up from school every day . though i could straightly get to the gate of my house that subway or bus can not , i had to suffer the traffic jam everyday and stay in the car just listening to the `` beep '' . that 's convinient , but absolutly not comfortable ! also , the control of the population in many country is also an important reason that support my opinion . the le people , the fewer car . this is certainly right . all in all , we know what is the best for u . reducing the use of car make our life more comfortable . so i believe that the number of the car will surely reduce in twenty year .
