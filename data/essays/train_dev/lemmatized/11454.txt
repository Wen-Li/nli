throughout the century there have been many talk on what kind of education would be best for student . is it more important to help student understand idea and concept of what they 're learning , or is it more important to help student learn the fact ? different country have come up with different solution to these question , and a a person who studied under both type of education system , i will say that i personally believe it is more important for student to understand the idea and concept than to learn fact . from my personal experience of studying under the korean education system for a year and from hearing my peer ' first-hand experience , i say that korean education is more concerned on teaching fact rather than idea and concept to student . students memorize fact and statistic , line after line , without even understanding the meaning of what they are learning . this ha a harmful effect in a long run because after examination is over , student will no longer remember what they learned . on the contrast , if student come to understand idea and concept of what they are learning , the knowledge ha become their own and will stay in them for long term . for instance , when i wa little , i hated science because i had to memorize numerous formula and fact that i did not understand . however , under new american science teacher i began to thrive in science a he taught me the basic idea and concept of science . as i understood what i learned and digested it a my own , i came to appreciate science more . in conclusion , although both type of educaton is necessary and student need to understand and learn both ideas/concepts and fact , i think it is more important for student to understand fact and concept first because it will be much easier to learn the fact after understanding the concept .
