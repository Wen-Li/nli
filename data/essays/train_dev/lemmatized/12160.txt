how many time did we buy a product after been delighted by it amazing beauty or feature and then , we found out that it wa really useless , with our great disappointment ? as a matter of fact advertising doe n't show the customer the downside of it product or service , but emphasizes the essential advantage that it can bring into our life . if we go deeper into the topic , analyzing how people develop commercial and advertisement , we can identify why this can happen . first it 's analyzed the ideal customer and , according to him/her taste and preference , some characteristic , or even emotion , are underlined in the advertisement . furthermore some tecnical device are used to create the sensation of wealth in the consumer , for instance using the image of a creamy yoghurt , surrounded by fresh fruit and piece of chocolate , even if , in the reality - practically making the commercial - the yoghurt is just a white-coloured cream , so creamy that it 's impossible to recreate into reality . in addition the advertisement can use the technique of the association to something else , even something that is completely different but that must share the same feeling of the advertized product . for example gillette , a famous brand of razor , made an advertisement for it product placing , on a page of a magazine , the shape of the razor , close to a ferrari , a sportif and expensive car . the two shape had the same bright colour in order to underline their hypothetical similarity regarding the strong sensation they could offer towards the consumer . all this argument are presented in order to emphasize some feature that we feel , watching adverisements , and make product much better than they really are .
