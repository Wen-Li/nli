learning concept and fact are two common element in the process of learning . however , which one is important than the other one ? i disagree with the statement that `` it is more important for student to understands idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in my point of view , learning fact is much more important than learning concept and idea . it is important to learn fact in the begining of a learning process . before learning a new thing , we have no idea about it . therefore it is important to u know about the fact which are most outter side of a thing . for example , when a baby is learning what an apple is , they only recognize that an apple is a round red thing . he doe not need to know that apple is a fruit which is an living thing and how it grows . another example is that when we study history , we always have know about the fact first . we have to know what , where , when and how first . after we knowing the fact , we start learning the concept and idea which are hidden in the fact . therefore , learning the fact is important because it is the first step of a learning prcess . moreover , learning fact is important because it is a easy and direct way to learn something . understanding idea and concept play a supporting role in the process of learning . it is because understanding idea and concept allows u to know more about how the fact work in their way . if we only understand idea and concept but not focus on the fact , we do not even know what we are learning and absorbing . in other word , it is useless to only know the idea but ignore the fact . facts are concrete and solidary thing that we have to know about in learing . in conclusion , it is imprtant for student to learn fact that it is for them to understand idea and conc
