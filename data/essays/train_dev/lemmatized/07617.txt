i totally agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time for upliftment of their community . the reason behind this is that this young generation do not have enough time to devote it to their community because of their busy routine and immense pressure of work . our society ha changed dramatically in last couple of decade with growing population and increasing pressure on our existing resource . this growing population ha implied immense pressure on young people for their survival because there are limited number of job available which are very le than required , so what happens is that these young people devotes most of their time in studying and competing with each other . as a result there is no time for them to think about the community they live in . for ex : a person looking forward for his bright future will be more interested in his education & job opportunity and will not be much concerned about his community . i personally think that our community ha changed to such a point which is not much suitable for young people . earlier there wa le competition and le pressure a compared to now , so at that time people were more concerned about their community and had the time to devote it to for the upliftment of their society . secondly , in today 's context everyone is looking from his perspective only and care a damn about their society . there is a lack of interest in public participation from young people . for ex : young people prefer watching a movie whenever they get time instead of helping for a social cause like awareness camp for aids , which will benefit their society . so i think time ha changed , condition have changed , mental perspective of an individual ha changed which ha resulted in this situation .
