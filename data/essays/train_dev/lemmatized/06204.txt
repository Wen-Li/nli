i agree with the following statement because a the number of car are too many nowadays , people are looking for some new way in order to decrease the bad consequence of the car industry and a a result decreasing the number of car . first let 's talk about the bad consequence of the car industry . as the number of car increase day by day this increase lead to traffic problem . one ha to spend at least one hour in order to reach his destination . this creates a stress in the person and eventually the person get more agressive towards everything . as a result the person get unhappy and his efficiency for working decrases by half each day . try to imagine this situation happening to the most member of the sociey ! the second problem is the car accident , each day we hear about car accident just because of people not obeying the traffic rule and killing each other . imagine also the physcological effect of all these accident on the society . the third problem is the air polution . becase nowadays there are too many car all around , this creates a problem of pollution . espeacially in the big city , it is a very usual thing to smell the gas getting out of the car which is very unhealthy of course . so a a result of all these problem that are mentioned in the previous paragraph , people are looking for some new way in order to increase the efficiency of transportation and a a result decreasing the bad effect of the car industry . in each country people are trying to develop their railroad . by the help of this , traffic can be avoided and people can reach to the place that they want to in a shorter time . this will avoid the stress in people and they can peacefully travel . also in some country people are encouraged to use bicycle which according to my mind is a very efficient way . because it help relieving stress and also it is healthier for one 's body . as a result a the number of car and it 's effect are becoming more and more disturbing for the people , they are looking for new way in order to solve this problem . by the help of railroad and by the help of bicycle road people will eventually stop using car and a a result in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
