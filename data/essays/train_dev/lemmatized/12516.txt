the question here is that is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject or to specilaze in one subject . in my view it is better to specialize in one subject only . i have sufficient reason and example to support my claim . firsltly , although it is better to have a broad knowledge about many academic subject , but this is only useful upto a certain extent only . it is always better to specialize in one specific subject because it give you right confidence and knowledge to make a substantial contribution to your field . consider a nuclear scientist working on a project , although it is necessary for him to have knowledge of thermodynamics , fluid science etc. but it is his specialization in the field of nuclear engineering that make him suitable for the job . moreover the reasearch project are carried out in team where people who specialize in different field come together and execute the project , so there is no need to have deep knowledge of all the field . secondly , in some case having a broad knowledge of many subject doe not serve the purpose . for instance in medical field , we have doctor who specialize in everything from toe to ear . this is really necessary a only a cardiologist can do justice to a heart patient rather than a physician , who only know a bit of everything but is incapable of providing doing proper prognosis and diagnosis . so this show it make sense to specialize only in one field . finally , almost every individual from his childhood ha a field of interest , one subject which he like the most . it is a known fact people perform the best when they work on the field which interest them . there is very high probabilty that individual will contribute favorably to the society . as the saying go jack of all trade , master of none , this era demand specialist and not jack . so in my view it make complete sense to specialize in the area of your interest and make a substantial contribution to that field so that future generation remember you .
