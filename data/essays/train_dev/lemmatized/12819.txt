in our consumptive society , advertising is a mean used by firm to sell their product . that is why they may sometimes made their product seem much better than they really are , but consumer have to be responsible . . in fact , advertisement is the way to inform consumer about a new product . however , firm aim at making benefit and so , at selling most of their product . they use advertising a a way to sell them . that is why their product are embodied by glamourous and beautiful people . if we think a little about it , we can sell an ordinary product , whereas our concurrent same product is said to be miraculous or exceptionnal . for example , if we are the president of l'oreal , we will not say that our make-up is just a good product , but we will hire julia roberts to represent our brain and to say that she can not live without it . that is how advertising work . however , we live in this consumptive society , for many year now and we are accustomed to these strategy . all consumer know that they do not often buy a real phenomenal product and they have to be careful on these advertisement and not to believe everything told . children and specially teenager have to become aware of these danger , or they will quickly spend all of their money . many association have been founded in france and in other country to fight against advertising . they act in writting on all the advertisement located in the metropolitan . nobody know how many they are , but they aim at stopping advertisment expansion . to conclude , i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , but consumer also have to be stronger than advertising power . advertising is known for this particularity and we ca n't stop people to believe in this lie .
