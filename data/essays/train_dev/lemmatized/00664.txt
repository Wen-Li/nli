i am deeply sorry to have to disagree with the statement , specially because my idea of a better world includes the reduction of private transportation in benefit of public transportation . the truth is that i do n't see that happening anytime soon. : ( let 's do the math > first of all , the degree of development that country like china , india and others are achieving , will bring access to a huge portion of their citizen to private transportation . even if the rest of the world still would use the same number of car that is currently using , that would make the difference . so we can add some hundred of million to the current number of car . .. in the meanwhile , the population in developed country keep growing , what lead u to discard the idea of a possible reduction of vehicle on these developed country . so we keep adding some million . . the result of the research of alternative source of energy , if possitive , will probably boost the car sale in the future . yes , we can still consider them '' car '' even when they do n't run on gas anymore . at that point , having a car will probably make more sense than ever . the idea of making 500 mile for only 2 dollar sound definitely very appealing . ttraffic jam could be the only reason to use public transportation by then . our city will become more and more overpopulated and hard to move through , proving the use of public transportation a the most effective way to move around . yes , that probably will happen , but still we will probably like to have our own car in the garage to use it during the weekend . we wo n't resign to that feeling of independece and of course the rest of member of our family wo n't do a well . so my opinion is that the reduction in that respect wont be very significative . all that said , my opinion is that the number of car in 20 year will be higher than is now .
