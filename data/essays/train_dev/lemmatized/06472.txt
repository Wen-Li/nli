in my opinon travelling with a tour guide is good then going alone the three reason why i prefer the tour guide are more information about the place , can see new more place and safety . in first by travelling with a tour guide we can t get more information about the place . recently i vistied a place for the first time . i hired a tour guide by which i got more information about the place and monument which i had seen during the visit . he had told about the history , specification , etc . he also help u by translating the local language which we cant understand . so hiring give u more information about the place . in second we can see new more place because he would have the detail about the place like how much time it would take , about the accomidation , etc . because his agent , by which they can hire room very easily . they would not be any loss of time for going and waiting for a mean of transportation . we will enjoy a lot , which we can not do with out a tour guide . the last one is abouth the safety because when we visit a new place we dose n't know about the crime rate . by hiring a tour guide he would be taking u to the place which are safety . he also help u by contacting with the local people when we are in trouble . when we are affected with a fever or some sort of health problem he will be knowing the best doctor in that town . visting a place mean a happy thing , so hiring will help u to have safety trip in conclusion touring a new place with a tour guide give u more information about the place , we can see new more place and safety . i recoomend to travel with a tour guide when you visit a new place .
