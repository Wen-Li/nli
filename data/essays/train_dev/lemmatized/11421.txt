some people agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept , while others agree that it is more important for them to learn fact . although both view are valid to a certain extent , i personally prefer the former view for the following reason . first and foremost , a student can expand their knowledge by understanding idea and concept . for example , when you are solving a math problem , you have to first understand idea and concept of the situation to apply the right formula for the question . memorizing the formula doe not get you to solve the problem . you first have to understand what question is asking for , and find the right formula to apply for . by solving a problem , you can expand your knowledge of math . second , understanding idea and concept can allow student to have right veiws . for example , the holocaust is one of the event that should never be repeated . by understanding what nazism is and understanding the concept of discrimination , student can have the right view of the event , and the same thing a the holocaust can be prevented by them . fianlly , simply learning fact doe not get student understanding skill . of course , it is important to learn fact , because some understanding are based on the fact . however , learning fact doe not get student understanding of the idea or knowing the fundamental concept . in conclusion , i think it is much more important for student to understand the idea and concept than to learn fact .
