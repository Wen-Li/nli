university a well a high school student are required to having obtained certain skill by the time they graduate . this is what make their degree valuable . the skill can be devided into two main category : learning fact and understanding idea and concept . the chairman of columbia university 's debate club ha recently provoked great dispute a he claimed that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept rather than learning fact . i do n't agree with him . in my opinion , on the one hand , understanding idea and concept is essential for succeeding after college . only if one is able to rethink complicated process and to find own conclusion , one will be able to improve one 's ability and will be capable of managing task that require improvisation . on the other hand , this is certainly not possible if you lack the respected fact . facts are therefore even more important than understanding idea and concept a they provide the basis for the second group of skill . if you do n't even know the fact about a certain topic , then how can you draw conclusion ? for example , if a biologist doe not know how to define and to describe a somatic cell , can he investigate them and use them for research ? probably not . hence , it is a must for teacher and professor to provide their student with a broad knowledge of fact , no matter if it is in elementary school , in high school or in college . where else should people learn the essential if not their educational career ? in conclusion , understanding idea and concept is of course a required skill for graduate . however , they by far do not play such an important role a fact , or other skill not discussed in this essay , for example the ability to speak coherently and clearly , arguing and solving social problem , or teamwork .
