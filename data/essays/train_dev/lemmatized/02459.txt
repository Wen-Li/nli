everyone learns a lot of fact in life . the human learn the whole life and are always improving way to get a larger knowledge . while studing everyone should decide about the level of deepness about a certain academic subject . the knowlege could be useful , but a lot of time it happens that it doe n't have any purpose in real life . for some academic it is important to learn a huge amount of knowledge and it is easier for them to get an overview of information while making a decision . these people need job with the task like combining different aspect for a certain problem . for instance , a manager who ha to check out all kind of consequence for a problem . a basis for thst is to have a broad knowledge for finding the best solution for the problem . another example could be a doctor who care forr general sickness . he ha to know about serveral look of deseases to offer a quick help in a proper way . sometimes it is also important to have a specialist on a certain subject who is able to solve the problem faster than someone who ha just an general idea of the subject . for instance , a doctor in a hospital which is specialisted on cancer . he would be able to help with a professional look at some cell without reading in a book first or fulfilling some experiment . both way of studing are goog way to find a profession , because in reality either way is nessecary . it depends on the subject and the profession . for me it would be more interesting to have a large amout of knowledge and to get in touch with different field of academic subject . to combine different idea , aspect and theory sound very motivating . for sure , with a broad knowledge you could never be a specialist , but you are better in finding a solution by attracting more than one circumstance .
