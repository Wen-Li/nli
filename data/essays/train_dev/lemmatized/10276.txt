globalisation mean opening up of the domestic market to the outside world . there ha been development in all the area and the situation is entirely different than it used to be twenty year back and therefore , i dont agree to the statement that , in next couple of year there will be lesser car than they are now . the world a a whole ha been developing very fast . there ha been new discovery , technology , cost effective method are being employed to increase production by reducing cost expense . new car have been coming in . some year back , only few model of general motor ( gm ) could be seen on road but now the situation is different . competition ha resulted in a slew of car . new company are coming in the market and with their cost effective model , are luring the customer . this kind of competition will continue to occur . consumer demand is also increasing . people are becoming richer and richer , country are flourishing and thereby affecting the demand . since the choice of car selection ha become wide individual from various walk of life are able to afford it within their budget . attitudes of people ha also changed . they now want to spend their life comfortably . since car are a luxury commodity they dont mind to invest in it . unlike the people in the past who were merely interested in saving and were conservative , the new generation love to face challenge . they have become more pompous , also competition among the colleague is the reason for such a lavish lifestyle . everybody want to spent more money than his neighbour . and this trend is going to continue in the future a well . nowadays , people have become so busy , for them time ha become precious so in order to complete their work in time they always require an effective mode of transportation and nothing can be better than a car . hence , a redution in car use is a nightmare because people cant live without it . it ha become a neccesity for them .
