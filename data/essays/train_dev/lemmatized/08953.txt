i agree with the statement that mentioned above . for example a bussiness man should attempt new market or develop new strategy in addition to their rational state . because envirement always change with it 's advantage and threat . so if a bussines man want to survive and gain more benefit than the others ha to differ hisself with their risk . everybody know investing is a critical case . if you really do not know the rule or other parameter in the market that you attempt to exist , you will lose your money . it is clear that it contains risk because you are a new character in the market . you could be beaten by your competitor . the information and skill is a key point to accomplish the new situation risk and threat . you shoul have skill and information , lack of information could sink you . but if you have information , and qualify enough with the state of brave you could benefit and defend yourself from the threat of the market or somoething else . surely seeing the future is an ability but you can estimate the future condition with the today 's information and trend . you can be the best at what you are doing at , but if you do not improve yourself to an advanced level , you will see somebody ha already done . and ha already benefiting that you could be did if you had not been a lazy one . a sweedish king said ` i would be at a position of winnig with the help of the lossings that i had ' . this life i think not for the people who doe not improve himself or ha a lack of brave emotion , there will be always risk but we all have to try to accopmlish , and let to lead ourselves to advanced level .
