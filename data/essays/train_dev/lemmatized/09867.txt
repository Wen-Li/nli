when i wa a graduate school student , some undergraduated student asked that it wa good for him to go to graduate school or not . at that time i answered that out society requires specialized people , so you should go to graduate school . first of all , most of company and school like specialist . for example , i joined this company for my special ability about computing special algorithm and hardware information . but my manager said to me that the reason why i wa accepted wa my special ability to develop new program . and so on i had favoralbe characteristic about developing program . in my opinion the special characteristic is also personal special ability . secondly , specializing evokes evolution . for instance a lot of professor and scientist had a lot of theory after they consumed their own whole life at their taeget or result . my professor spended his whole time to modeling about electrochemical etching and finite element method . now he is very famous at modeling and he wrote some book about revised his theory and method . and my father wa a engineer in mechanic . he spended his whole time to make a new machine to make a speical register . he made finally that machine and he got a lot of momey . i heard that most recruiter wanted various experienced student or engineer . however , i want to say that special ability is the prerequisite or premis to get a new job . my friend did not have their job after graduation . so they tried their special ability about learning foreign language , special engineering course work , and how to introduce themselves to recruiter . after those course which took two or three month , they had their job successfully . in conclusion , special knowledge is more important that broad knowledge in modern society . because our society requires specialist , and specialist can make a lot of money in future . so most of student will try to be a specialist .
