a person can enhance his academic knowledge in two way . these are having a broad knowledge of many subject and specializing in one specific subject . both of these way have their own advantage and disadvantage . however , i think that having general information about different topic ha more advantage compared to specializing in one specific subject . in one hand , knowing general thing about many subject may increase a student 's overall perception of topic around . having a general perception of different subject is also a way taken by ancient greek scientist . if we examine their life and research , we find out that there is no scientist which just specialized and worked for a particular subject . with having broad knowledge about different topic , they have founded the main element of our civilization . but in our world , people sometimes need specialized partner in order to accomplish a part of the project that wa designed to be built simultaneously by different people who know their subject very well . on the other hand , specializing in one particular area may also increase a person 's academic knowledge . specialized people are le prone to error in their particular area than people who have general information about that particular area . however specializing have a negative effect on inventing new thing . when somebody is specialized in one particular area , it is sometimes hard to find innovative thing due to a lack of general knowledge about different subject . the process of invention most of the time requires knowledge about different discipline . the area of science like biochemistry and electromechanics are great example of these . in conclusion , i think having broad knowledge about different subject is better than specializing in one specific subject . it increase the ability to invent and help to see the big picture more neatly where specializing produce identical people .
