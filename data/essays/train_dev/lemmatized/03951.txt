i strongly disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the car is a very useful thing which exist nowadays and it can be more car but can not be fewer car in use in the future . firstly , sciece development . sceince is changing very much in our life . for example we can use email to connect other people who may live on the other side of the earth , we can use mobile phone to call friend and we can travel to other country by plane . like these example , the sceince caused alot of change to our life that we never even had a thought before . so in the future the development will change more car to give our human convinients . secondly , car in the future will be more than today , but maybe can be seen diffrent from today 's car . the reason is because the fuel we are using today ; the oil , can not be still exist in the future , so maybe we will use other type of fuel to reduce our planet 's pollution and to use car . thirdly , people today are thinking about traveling to the other planet because we have been wanted to know how other planet are like and also had been thinking to live other planet , such a ; moon , mercury , mar jupiter and extra . so alot of car will be made to travel to other planet . in conclusion , i strongly disagree with the statment that there will be fewer car than there are today in twenty year . as i mentioned before , firstly because of science development ; will development can make more car . secondly , because the exsistant of car will be more than today ; the fuel change . thirdly , because of people 's thinking ; to travel to other planet and live in other planet . so from these three point i strongly disagree with the statment .
