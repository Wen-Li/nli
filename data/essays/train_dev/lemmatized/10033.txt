yes , i agree with that in twenty year there will be le car in use than are tody . there are many resones to hold this view just like air pollution will go out of control , no fuel to drive car , no space on road for car and finally new technology will develop new thing . firstly , human are useing more car , so by more number of car produce more air pollution . so such air pollution will go out of control of human being . so at that position human can not live and that time he will not use car . secondly , human also useing much more fuel now a day to drive car . this approch of human being is not good and resourse of fuel will end at some time . so due to shortage of feul man can not use car in future day . for example , my friend use his bike for shorter rich work , by that wrong approch feul is wasting and it is not good for future . thirdly , a year pass human will find new faster or good option for car . so by such new technology it will happen that car will out dated in next few year . finally , a the number of car are increasing but the place for drive or to park car is constant . so in next few year there will not any place to drive car on road . for example , my friend 's family is having three car for three person . so that number of car they can not have place to park all car in their plot . in short , by human act pollution will increase and they will not use car . also human being useing more feul and that will cause of non use car . also their will not be any place to drive car on road and new technology will give new option to man . so according to in next few year car will not be used .
