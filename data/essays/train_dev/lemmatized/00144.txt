does young people enjoy life more than older people do ? if i am asked to answer this question , i would say no . many older people think and say that young people have freedom and they can do whatever they want . however , that is not true for young people because there are many thing to do for young people befor they become an adult . as a young person , i feel like i have very limited life . teens go to school everyday , they have to do their homework and project , and they also have to prepare to go to college . preparing for the college give a lot of stress to young people because most of the student want to go to good college . in order to go to good college , they need to work hard in school and also they need to do many extracurricular activity . even though they have something that they want to do , either there are no free time for them or there are thing that is not allowed to young people . also , in order to achieve their goal in the future , it seems it is necessary to go to college and study in the field they want to study . without that education , it is hard to get a job in the high position or to earn a lot of money . not only that , but also they need to listen to their parent because they are not adult yet . if the parent do n't agree with something that you want to achieve , you need to either give up or change your mind . there is actually no freedom for teen at school or at home . older people are more able to do whatever they want because they have freedom and they do n't have financial problem because most of them work . basically , they can buy anything they want without asking or getting permission to their parent , and they can also do whatever they want without being pressured under parent . we do n't exactly know when a young person becomes a older person , but what we know is that when a person becomes old enough , they can enjoy their life doing whatever they want and they have more freedom than the young people .
