in my openion , i really disagree with make the producte seem much better than they really are because it will liy to the people , west the people money and west time . most advertisement liy to the people when they make the product seem much better than they are . they make tant just to take the money from the people without trouth and that unfair . you have to tell the coustomer the truth to be awear for the product , and the the coustomer have the chooise to choose which one will be better to himself . if you liy to your coustomer , you are liy to yourself , because one day the coustomer will know and then will leave you . if you make your produsts much better than is it , you aer not just liying to your coustomer , but also west they money . they work everyday to get the money and they work hard to find thr money that can cover they family from food and clothes . then the advertisement take the money in the easiest way with untrouth product . that in not good way to have the money . you have to get money in the right way to be happey and the coustomer more happey . last thing i would like to take about is westing time for bouth of them . the advertisement west his time to do nothing and not true , and the coustomer west his time to sente to the advertisement when they liy . then bouth of them will det nothing and some time will be bad because to may go to fight between bouth of them . for all that reasones , i really disagree with the advertisement to make the product seem much better than they are . that is liying noy seeceed in the life .
