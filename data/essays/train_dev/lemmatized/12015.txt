i definitely agree with this statement ! everyday government us different measure and try to involve people in the pollution problem that our planet face at the moment . there are two type of measure that the government us to discourage people to use their car so a to fight with the pollution . on the one hand , ` green ' or social value get more and more important to the society and are stressed in newspaper and advertising . for instance in my city we can often see advertising for using public transport instead of your own car . in addition to this type of communication , the city of lyon introduced a new concept of moving from one point to another by using bicycle . this company is called velo'v and allows people to borrow a bicycle for a certain amount of time practically for free ! the subsciption fee is about 5 euro per year which is very tempting ! on the other hand , government put barrier to the use of the car in the city center by fixing entry fee or by making parking fee very high . for example in london you have to paye 8 pound to get to the city of london ! and also you have to paye again when you want to drive back home . this measure ha encouraged many english people to use train or underground , but also helped to decrease the traffic problem and the air pollution in the city . from all these statement and example we can draw a conclusion . i think the government is really concerned about ecological problem of our planet and use all kind of measure to encourage people to use their car le . as for me , i definitely agree with these policy and hope that in twenty year we could slow down the air pollution problem .
