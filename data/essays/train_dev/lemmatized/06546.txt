developing a broad knowledge base on numerous academic subject rather than specializing in one specific subject implies acquiring knowlege for the purpose of striving for quantity rather than quality . in my opinion , broad knowledge complement or rather act a a foundation of specialization rather than being more favourable than specialize in one specific subject . broad knowledge of many academic subject have been emphasized during our early year of education since it provides student a basis or tool to raise awareness to thing occuring round them and a backbone to further develop their knowledge database . it also act a an appetizer for people to explore different area of knowlege and discover one that they are willing to dwell deeper into . in addition , it secures a certain level of literacy among the population since people have sufficient knowledge to handle daily matter . however , knowledge is about gaining in depth rather than having a broad yet shallow base . broad knowledge is similar to information which is easily lost and can hardly sustain . it is by specialization in one specific subject that knowledge can be thoroughly researched , experimented , evolutioned and make a difference to the world we live in . civilizations take huge stride forward due to the innovation of pioneer who are specialist of their respective subject . multinational pharmacuticals invest billion in research and development to sponsor laboratory experiment in developing new medicine that can treat disease such a aids and malaria . lives are saved by the specialist ' effort which can not be substituted by people having a broad knowledge of many academic subject . laws and constitution which act a one of the four pillar of a society is established by lawyer who are also specialist possessing a wide breadth of knowledge is appreciated a it support the development of specializing a specific subject which can bring paramount improvement to the world we are living in .
