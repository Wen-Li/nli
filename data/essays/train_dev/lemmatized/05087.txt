i agree with the idea thinking the car will be replaced with the better tool for transportation and more friendly to environment in the near future . cars are the most common transporation tool for the present year . they are slower then flight but cheaper in cost , cheaper in cost then bicycle or whatever the vehicle manual force should be put to operate but a lot faster and the cost is endurable for the common people comparing to flight fare . however they have been issued with envormental concern that the car produce harmful substance to the nature such a air etc . of course in twenty year coming , people will try to invent the non harmful fuel to feed the car for operation however i strongly believe the smart human being , considered to be ` magic hand ' to invent whatever they need , olny the matter is the time , will get another brilient creation to satisfy the speed a plan , cost effective and also need to be friendly to enviroment . it may have a form of car-like appearance , however if you meant the car with speed like today and causing concern like they do today , i may expect the new creation or invention ( will be named differently with cars ) to replace the car today . let 's try to picture the thing that have same look a car nowadays but no wheel are flying here and there for common people 's daily transportation . there will be no much heavy traffic in the road a there is now . they are faster a plane and the fare is also endurable a i expect in the future , then not many people will be late for the job or class being stuck in the traffic . also the concern about pollution by car will be relieved . some people might say twenty year are regarded to be too short for another stage of transportation system however , i reflected my little hope to have this ` mighty tool ' for my daily commuting to work in the near future in this writing .
