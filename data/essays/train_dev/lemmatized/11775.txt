i think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because it is safer , the best touristic place are shown , and it can be cheaper . first of all , traveling alone can be very dangerous since you are in a place that you do n't now . some time even the idiom is strange to you . it 's possible that by mistake you ended up in risky place where you can be assalted . these are some risk that people like me do n't want to have , so the answer for them is to travel in a tour . because tour 's are composed of many people and are led by a local guide who know the zone , you can be almost sure that nothing bad will happen to you . furthermore , lonely traveler have to ask for interesting place in each city they go . they will visit some place , but probably they will miss others . when traveling in a tour , all the place are known by the agency , and they usually give you the best of each town . you dont waste time asking for advice and you do n't miss important place . finally , although tour agency seem to be expensive . in my opinion , they ended up being cheaper . when you travel by yourself , you can make some good deal . nevertheless , very often people are cheated by local seller , and they do n't become aware of this because they simply do n't what is the correct prize . these event never happen in tour . they know where they work , and the correct prize . thay charge you some extra money for this knowledge , but it 's worth it . overall , i prefer to travel with tour agency because an important thing to me is to play safe in my trip along with the fact that i do n't like to miss any interesting spot . in addition , tour agency end up being cheaper .
