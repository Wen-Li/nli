i 'm agree with the statement above , because usually the company want to have more costumer and they start the publicity for this . they just show in commercial the best thing of their product , but they do n't give the costumer all the true . for example if you go to a fast food restaurant , they have meal cheaper than meal that you can find in other kind of restaurant . it 's true it 's cheap meal , but also is small , and it can affect the health of the costumer , because it nutritional fact will can damage the regular system of the body in the future . in other hand , if you go to the clothes store , obviously you want to see the best and the cheapest dress that they have , but the problem is , in some case , that they do n't have your size , the clothes there is just for thin woman and you ca n't wear it . they just show the price and how beautiful is the dress but they do n't say that the clotes in this store is just for `` unreal woman '' . i think that the owner of this type of company are also costumer , and for this , they have to think like that . if they want more costumer , more sale , so more money , they have to know exactly what the `` real people '' need to wear , to eat , or just to live healthy . i come from another country and the first time when i realized the way of i 'll have to live my life here , i thought `` i 'm going to have many problem '' , because in my country the life is slower than here , and we have time to think about ourselves . we have some more time to cook , to have a good time with our friend , but we also are more lazy than american people and just think about the party time . i think because american people do n't have enough time for cook or do differents thing , they make everything easiest for everyone , and is why they just show the best of their product with do n't care about the thing that can cause a damage ( the fry meal ) to the costumer .
