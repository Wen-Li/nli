the advent of car added an entirely new dimension to travelling , an essential facet of man 's eternal urge to explore . in the beginning , car were affordable only by the wealthy and hence came to signify financial/social status . soon , with advance in technology that aided bulk production , the concomitant evolution of production design and streamlining of factory production , the cost of car dropped and came to appear in not so rich household . in the present day , if not for car , it is difficult to even imagine taking a peaceful and private family holiday . the degree of freedom car provide can not be paralleled by today 's public transportation . today , with more under-developed and developing country than there are developed country and assuming that living standard throughout the world only improve ( of course precluding the possibility of another world war in the coming 20 year ! ) and since car are considered an essential indication of a healthy income , it is perhaps not unreasonable to claim that the number of car worldwide will only increase in the coming few year . from the above reasoning , one may be tempted to conclude that the number of car will definitely increase with time had the environmentalist not interfered ! global warming ha drawn more attention and concern than ever before in the history of the modern world . the ever deepening lament by environmental scientist that the world is heading for a doom unless we change our way in a drastic manner , ha now begun to feel the ear of world leader . one of the step that would be contemplated on is a drastic reduction in petroleum vehicle which , in today 's world , translates to reduction in the total number of vehicle ( a more than 90 % of today 's vehicle are powered by fossil fuel ) which inturn translates to a reduction in the number of private vehicle , i.e. car . there are already government which are actively encouraging their civilian to take public transit . one may give yet another counter argument to the above logic . how about ` green vehicle ' which run on natural gas which is proven to cause very little or no harmful emission and also is cost effective ? the government of delhi , india , ha recently enforced a legislation that requires all public vehicle to use natural gas . it will not be surprising if this extends to private vehicle soon . this seems to balance the decrease in the number of car proposed in the previous passage . supposing that all of today 's car have been converted to use only natural gas , how about the ever increasing traffic congestion ? this definitely is not alien to any manhattan or a new yorker ! one possible solution is to literally force everybody to use public transit , ofcourse not without strengthening the existing facility . in light of all the argument we have seen till now , it is perhaps too naive to conclude either way . hence , i disagree with the statement : ` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ' . the correct answer is ` one can not predict'
