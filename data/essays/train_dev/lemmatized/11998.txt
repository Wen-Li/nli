some people might say that it better to a ` master of one than being a jack of all ' . but in my personal opinion , it better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in just one . life is made up of not just thing , but a variety of thing and subject . it is important for any individual to know atleast the basic of almost all , if not all , subject . life is integrated with various issue . the main reason for me to support that experience and knowledge is needed in various aspect of life is to survive in this constant-changing world . world can take up any turn in any time of life . it is hard to predict the twist in the market . market in one field can drop down suddenly one day , and all business in that field will close . so it better to have knowledge of other field , atleast the preliminary knowledge and skill so that the person can think of starting up of new business if one doe n't work . second point is recreation . if a person know few more thing to do life other than his regular routine work , it will be like a change for him , which he can enjoy and have fun . you get to know more people around you when to interact , and will help to build relationship between them . its a part of our duty to maintain a balance of everything in life . let u consider one example , currently it the trend of computer and technology , and many people will only take up subject in computer science and neglect other aspect like ecology , sociology and economics . who should care for the betterment and preservation of nature and nation , if no person is knowlegeable about the least the basic of ecology . everyone should be aware of thing taking place in and around his place , his society and nation a a whole . general knowledge is required to be successfull in life . every business tycoon in this country ha a varied field of experience and knowledge . if we consider the owner of mcdonald 's , who is not just a hotelier but a realtor too . only because of this , he is able to start up million of mcdonald 's center in every busy commercial corner of the world . he integrated his knowledge of marketing and real-estates into the knowledge of food-industry . thus to conclude , in my view i feel that to lead an independent and successful life , it necessary to have broad knowledge of many academic subject and strongly agree with the statement .
