i 'm absolutly agree with this statement . i think that is important for all poele not only for student to understand the information than it is for to learn fact , in fact in every situation , for example at school or also in the job , it is better understand very well before to do samethings . the italian university is based on this concept and i think that it is important study the concept to do n't make a mistake . i study industrial design and the course are organized in this way : during the first semester i have to do course of theorie subject , for exsemple math , phisical or geometrical draw , instead in the second semester i have practise matter called laboratory . in laboratory class i can use my theory information , that i have studied in the first semester , for design a product that have not bed caractheristics . i can write an example to exprime better my idea : i design a table , this table have to be stable and resistent , so i can do the table with this caractheristics only if i have studied `` statica '' . make a mistake is too simple when i do n't undestand what i do , in general , and how i do somethings , in particular . i have to know all the step that i have to pas to arrive at the end of a product . in short i believe that it is better at beginnig undestand the request , keep all the information about a concept and after that i can do everything .
