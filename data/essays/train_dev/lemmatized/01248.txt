i agree to the author 's opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . the present generation face various challenge , work with too many responsibility in a world of immense competition . they hardly have ample time to help their community . man 's life today ha changed tremendously with the advancement in science and technology . the more the change over the year , the higher their aim have become , the greater the responsibility to be carried out and the greater are the accomplishment to be made . his need have changed tremendously with advancement in technology and science . this change ha not made his life easier but also challenging to succeed . man irrespective of his age is working harder than what he wa doing a 20 year back . if we cosider a small kid , he too is busy with his academic schedule with a change in his syllabus , amount of material to be studied . he hardly find time for his co-curricular activity . if a teenager is considered , he is busy making a career for himself . a middle aged man is quite occupied in improving his skill or standard of living . its only a retired person who seemingly ha time for activity but lack enough energy . the change in technology over the past few year ha brought a change not only in man 's life making thing easier for him but also in his way of thinking . today even a small kid think about what advantage he can get for sacrificing something . every individual is more focussed on what he or she can become , how much can he or she earn and how to make more profit . they lead a very mechanical life where they mainly believe in the famous saying `` time is money '' . they would not like to spend their time on something that doesnot benefit them in term of money or luxury . as considered in management science theory that man 's social need come only after his financial need . in such a society people hardly think about their community and take out some time to help their community . therfore the author 's opinion about the young people not havin time to help their community is very much agreeable .
