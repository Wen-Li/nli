i neither agree nor disagree with the point suggested above . i believe that the success can be obtained by trying new thing a well a practicing what is already known to u . things that are already known might not be a refreshing and exciting a new technology or knowledge , but they 're still important , because you can not do anything advanced without learning the old thing correctly . for example , let 's say that i 'm a member of a medical research group that is trying to develop a new type of medicine for brain cancer . even if the point is ` trying to find a new way , ' you can not perform the task successfully unless you know and perform the previous thing very well . that is , in order to develop the new medicine , you have to learn all the previously accumulated knowledge about medicine and brain cancer first . at the same time , however , new technology and trial are certainly shortcut to the success . many people who had denied the stereotype and tried new thing had succeeded and become a billionair . and that is indeed how our history had advanced so far . people have tried new idea , knowledge , vogue , system , and so forth , and up to now we 've become a highly industrialized world . even only 3 or 4 hundred year ago , our life used to be all about church and work . but thing get changed and changed . and if those new thing have n't been tried , our world must have been stagnated and still . and that rule applies to an individual a well . as long a you stick to the old topic , you can not go forth . history ha proved that for you . so my whole point is that the success can be obtained only when you respect the already known thing and new thing equally . neither old thing nor new thing can exist without the other . old thing exist to be used and to be replaced by new thing . but without the accumulated history , new thing can not come into it place .
