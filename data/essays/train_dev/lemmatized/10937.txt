many people in this modern world wonder if successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in my opinion , i think successful people are the people who try new thing , but in the end it ha it advantage and it disadvantage . i think that successful people are the people who try new thing because these people work hard , research and try there best to find new thing a well a getting thing better and more efficent so i guess these people deserve to get more than the people who are just sitting in their place , repeating the same procedure again and again through out the year . successful people in my opinion never stop the hard work , never stop researching a well a never stop or speed down the pace from looking for the better and the best a this modern world is modernizing , and improving day after day so you have to be on the pace and never stop from working hard to find new thing . always a person , who stop or slow down his pace in researching and working hard , will be thrown out of the competion . there are few disadvantage of trying new thing and one of them is that by trying new thing you may risk yourself , a for example if the new thing did not work or benifit it will cause failure and sometimes may cause great lose to a specific person or even company . in my opinion , some time trying new thing is worth the risk a the percentage of success is much higher than the percentage of failure in most time . some advantage of doing what you already know , which are few is that you do not risk your self in danger , it keep you out of the red zone and into the green zone . in my opinion , people who dont like competition , facing , and people who do not have strong heart stay doing what they already know how to do well in . finally , successful people always try to find new thing while people who want to stay in their place and not change keep doing what they already know how to do well in and i am a person who think successful people are who try new thing and bare the risk .
