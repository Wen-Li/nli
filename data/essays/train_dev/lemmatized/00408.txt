there is no denying that travelling in group led by a tour guide ha become controversal , not only for the professonals but for the public a a whole . some people prefer the travelling that is in group and is led by a guide , and would like to put an end to it , while others do not think this is the best way . as far a i am concerned , i contends that the travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel . the reason supporting my assertion will be shown bleow . first of all , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is funnier . both common sense and our experience have informed u that if many people stay together , they will be happier and can make more fun . for example , when we travel in a group , we can share our funny story , chat with one anothe , and even play some interesting game . all these activity help u to spend the boring time on the bus or the train . and also , the guide can tell u some interesting local custom which enjoy u . in addition , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is safer . it is well known that the thief usually attact the people alone , which situation is eaier for them . while if the tourist are in group , we can look after one another , and also can take care of the belongs when some people go to the washroom . and also , there are some danger in some resort , which the guide know well . in this situation , the guide will remind u to being careful . moreover , travelling in a group led by a tour guide make u know more about the local culture . we know that the gudie is professional and get good training about the resort that we visit . at each resort , the guide will explain the history of it , and even give some information we can not get from the guide book . thus the explaination made by the guide make our tourist more efficiently . notwithstanding the fact that travelling in a group led by a guide is noisier , this demerit can be compesiated by the many merit associated with the group travelling . beyond the doubt , when the fact are examined , it advantage and disadvantage weighed , and biased opinion casted away , it is not difficult to draw the conclusion that to travel in a group led by a guide is the best way to travel . given the practical reality of the modern society , in fact , not only i prefer the safety , fun , and knowledge brought about by the group travelling , but also i hope that the group member can be quiet some time when some people are tired .
