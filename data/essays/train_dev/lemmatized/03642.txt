successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they know to do well . this is true , but with some limitation . becuase sometimes successful people are those who dont try new thigs and only do what they already know how to do . those poeple are usaually called old school people . on the other hand , to be successful you need to be a risk taker . a well a being able to change and adapt to all change that occur arround , in technology , medicine , life style and science . for example poeple who dont beleive in changing or trying new thing , they will eventually fail to keep on the track of development and growth , which in turn will force them to quit or stay behind and accept the failure and loss . for example : when computer wa intoduced to every aspect of life , and then the internet . if someone doesnt take the risk to change , or try the new technlology , in the following year will notice the bad effect on his biusness or life style . also , the other aspect is taking risk . especially in making major desicions that can change life forever . for example , when poeple from developnig country take the desicion to migrate to the developed country for better chance in studying , working and better life style for family which is more safe and ha stability in good living condition . another example , which is real that me and my husband used to live in small town in north crolina . we had very limited income , and very little number of poeple from our community , so we decided to take the risk and move up north to take our chance in dearborn michigan . now my husband ha better income . we socialize more with poeple from our community . which built our network here . this helped u to find better job and give u better commuinty support . if we were not risk taker we would stay in the south with le cahnces for better life style for u and our child .
