i agree with the the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people . i think that young people have more opportunity to enjoy their life . the older people can enjoy their life when they are retired , they can have a more confortable and relaxible life . they have all they time for themself . they can spend more time with their family . they are not able to do all the activity that a younger people can do . the younger people have a different point of wiew of the life , they do n't have a lot of responsabilities so it 's easy for them to act how they want . the older people have to think about their child . the younger people take the life easier but the older people have to think a lot before taking an important decision because they have a lot of thing to care about . the younger people have more energy for enyoj life that 's why the older people prefer to spend their time at home .
