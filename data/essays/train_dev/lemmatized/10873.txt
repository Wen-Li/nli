i completely agree with the statement which say that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to well '' . those people , who are well known , they often want to be more popular and to attract more and more attention . we can talk about politician a an example . like bill clinton , former president of the united state of america , or nelson mandela , ex-president of south-africa , who are helping the poor contries in africa and asia , a lot of this category of people work in organization which have the same purpose . another example is the entertainment artist . many singer after beeing very successful and popular a singer try to move to hollywood where they have the opportunity to start acting . and they even take a lot of risk like investing in a lot of business all over the world . the benefit for them is that they are known and they use their name to attract people ; and even their investement doe not succed a they want , they always able o try others thing because they have the money they need . in the united state a lot of artist , singer and sport-players have their own company or team . consequently , month after month , year after year , they become more and more successful and popular and try news thing . consequently , they seem like handling the world in the pame of their hand . in conclusion , people who are successful definitely try new thing and risk ; they rarely just do what they already know how to do well and most of the time , tey do it to get more money than what they own . as a result , that create in my view the problem poverty because the rich are becoming more rich , exploiting the second part of the population which is the class of the poor .
