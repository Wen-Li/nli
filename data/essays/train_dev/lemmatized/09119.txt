advertisements are today part of our life . we can see them everywhere , on television , in the street , on highway , in our mailbox . it is the best way to make people know a new product and to sell it . but , in my opinion , most advertisement make product seem better than they really are . an advertisement is studied by a company in order to present a new product . the obvious goal of advertising is to make the product appear ideal and appropriate for the custumer . to sell shower gel , for instance , the advertiser will tell you that it smell like nature and that you will feel really relaxed by using it . in most case , the customer will think that this product is appropriate for him through this completely subjective presentation . advertisements are playing also with customer and making them dream . on advertisement , only the quality of the product are mentionned . this way , the customer can not really imagine what the possible disadvantage are . for instance , in france , suchard , a chocolate maker , made beautiful advertisement for it new product . they were so well done that you wanted to taste one immediately after having seen the advertisement . but the composition of this new kind of chocolate wa not specified and this wa the negative aspect of the product , after testing it . natural source were rare and the global taste wa artificial and chemical . furthermore , on advertisement , the customer only see the product ; he can not take it in his hand and touch it . for clothes it is a great problem . when you look at picture where a new dress is presented , you can not touch the material and see the right color . light play a major role in clothes'advertising and it may give the customer a false impression on color . it is also impossible to see if the global quality of the product is good or not . because of this , the customer often imagine what he can not see and touch . that is the major problem of advertising . we naturally imagine what the quality could be , without having any evidence . in conclusion , i would say that advertising is made in order to sell a product . in this way , it only present the good aspect of the product . but , if these advertisement are making product seem better than they really are , cutomers are also responsible for it , because they use too much their imagination . as a consequence , they are often disappointed when they see the real product in front of them in the store .
