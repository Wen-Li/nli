` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ' , i think that this statement is true and based on my experience i am going to explain why i agree with it . when i wa younger , i have been fooled by advertisement several time . one of the better example is when i decided to lose weigth , i saw at the telivision , peel that seemed like magic because without any effort , user could lose a lot of weight and very quickly . of course , these pill did not work a well a the advertise said , however it help me to understand that the purpose of advertisement is to sell a product and to tell to the client what tey want to hear . on one hand , i think it is quite normal for an advertise to only talk about the advantage of a product , even if it is a kind of lie not to tell to the client everything that they have to know about the product . on the other hand , it can be really annoying for an user to see that it is harder than in the advertisement to make the product work . for instance , it is always making me laugth when i watch my mother trying to use a very complex oven that she bougth because the old one did not have all the function of the new one . she never achieves to correctly put the alarm , thus the food is nowadays too much cooked . however , now before i buy something quite expensive , i always go on the internet to watch the point of view of user . this is very helpful , for example , when i decided to buy a new laptop i spent over a month to compare the producer 's advertisement and comment from user . furthermore , i think that when the promise of a product 's advertise and reality are close that show the seriousness of the producer .
