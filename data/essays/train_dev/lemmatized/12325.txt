the guide give u a lot of good imformation about the place , and they know where is good place to see . we do not have to reserch about the place where we travel . it is very easy to travel . but i think that the best way to travel is not in a group by a tour guide . there are some reason why i think so . first , i think it is not intresting to just follow the guide when i travel . i think , however , it is important to find something interesting or something new by myself . i am happy when i find something that other people do not know and when i find somewhere beautiful by myself . second , traveling by myself make me feel confident . when i went to australia . i went to the zoo by myself . i researche the fee to enter the zoo , how to get there , what to see . it made confidenceto me that i can travel in foreign country by myself . above all , if the travel is in foreign country , i would like to travel by myself definitly , because traveling abroad is chance to learn the language or culture of the country where i travel . the tour guide might explain what is good , what to eat , where to see , and so on , in japanese . i think it is important to be surrounded by the air of the place to have best experience . i do not think traveling led by a tour guide is bad , but the better way to have fun is to travel without her . i think finding or learning something new is good experience and the experience will never be the same , on the other hand , traveling led by her is almost always the same . i think people who want to do something different from the otheres should travel by theirselves .
