i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . undoubtedly , a successful businessman always try to make his business different from others ' . the area that ha never been explored by other people is always attractive to him , because he is so smart that he understands that an unexplored field always ha a large potential . even though new thing can hardly be accepted by customer initially , a farsighted businessman would rather to take this risk , becasue he understands that once he succeed in his first step , a huge profit will follow with it . my father is also a businessman . however , he is not one of the successful one , since he is always afraid of challenge new thing . my uncle ha a big resteraunt which is very successful . seeing the large profit my uncle ha gained , my father decides to set up a small one a same a my uncel 's . even though my father is told that doing business relevent to food is not suitable for him , he insists in his decision . however , quickly , my father find that he ha made a wrong decision a he keep losing profit in his resteraunt . the reason why he doe not succeed is that he is not brave enough to challenge new thing . moreover , he think that if he set up a resteraunt , he will be a successful a my uncle . consequently , without taking a risk , he fails . in conclusion , once the mind of a bussinessman is limited , he can hardly be successful . sometimes , courage of taking a risk is the most pivotal factor of being successful .
