i totally agree the above statement . now a day every student ha to understand the idea and concept . this is very useful to improve knowledge . if we can understand the concept properly , we can do anything easily . therefore every student ha to innovative in nature . student life is the formative period of life . but in now a day student can face many problem to thier classmate & senior . this is the main drawback of the student life . we should always help to another people . in this way our knowledge will also be increased . first of all every student ha to prepare the time sheduling . this is is the most important work in every student life . student should be idealist to every one . first of all student prepair a note what she/he ha to understand . then we got a proper idea about the topic . once we can get idea , then we can easily understand the topic . student should always maintain the time factor . because time is the most important factor to do anything . therefore a student understand the idea & concept . once we get good idea , then we can easily understand the anytopic . so idea is stepping stone for sucess . not only a student , every should must in innovative in nature . if we can have a proper idea or concept , then we can easily sloved any problem . therefore `` understading the idea '' is more important in student life .
