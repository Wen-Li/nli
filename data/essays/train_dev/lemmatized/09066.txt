in modern capitalist society , advertisement are a natural part of life . in this situation , i believe that it is all but inevitable that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the fundamental reason is that modern consumerism ha made it necessary for company to advertise their product simply because there are more good than are necessary . before the advent of mass production and mass consumption , the situation wa vice versa : there were probably fewer good than are necessary . naturally , therefore , producer did not need to advertise at all . but in today 's society , because of the tremendous advance of technology , it is possible to churn out unnecessary commodity produced mainly , or perhaps only , to gain profit by selling them . as a result , producer are forced to make their product look much better than they really are so that they will be able to sell them out . another significant reason why advertiser exaggrate the value of their product is people 's expectation to have newer and `` better '' thing . in order to keep up with these consumer ' demand , company are compelled not only to make new , slightly-upgraded product all the time but also to make the small improvement a impressive . the case in point is the computer industry . pc maker change their model three or four time a year even though the improvement is minor . because people expect this and because all the other competitor do so , a pc maker can not afford to continue to sell a pc first put on the market a year ago . as a result , it is necessary for pc maker to make their product look signficantly better than their previous model by , for example , changing their look although the content is not much different . in conclustion , i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are for two reason . modern consumerism ha made it necessary , and a a result , people are accustomed to have `` better '' product , which force producer to exaggerate minor improvement . it would be impossible to change this situation , and , therefore , consumer need to be wise enough not to be deceived by advertisement .
