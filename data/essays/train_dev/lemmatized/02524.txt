the issue at hand is that `` young people do not give enough time to helping their community '' . i totally agree with this statement because in today world man is a very busy animal . for him ` time is money ' . therefore , man can not devote more of his time to various other soacial activity . firstly , i agree to the statement because life is too fast in today scientific world . man today ha many personal and professional responsiblities . he ha to live up to the expectation of many and so he need to be hardworking and enthusiastic in his work . this doe n't allow man to work more for his community . seconly , there is a lot of competition in today 's world . for example , student going to college have to do better in their academic a well a in extra-curricular activity because the job demand for student who are all-rounder . as a result student spend much of their time studying , doing project , organizing event in college etc . this leaf them with no choice but sacrifice to the help they could provide to their community . additionally , today youth prefer to stay independent . they prefer being financially independent . as a result people along with study even do part time job . this demand of time for one self ha made man le interactive with his own people . as the saying go `` god made man , man made money , money made man mad '' , this statement rightly prof that today youth is more concern about personal benefit than doing something for others . another reason , why i feel the youth is can not help their community is lack of appreciation . this can be inferred at time when the change the young people would like to bring in either organizing a event or festival in their community the people are not ready to accept change a a result the young people prefer spending le time for community . therefore , i conclude that man ha become much more responsible towards himself than others and the various reason above justify that young people do not give much time to helping their community .
