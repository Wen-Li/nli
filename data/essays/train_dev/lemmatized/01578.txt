i think the knowledge of a lot pf subject form the culture of each people . a person with a certain culture who is involved in a discussion , is able to speak with others of several issue . this mean to avoid ignorance , and with this fact many purpose can be achieved . someone who ha a knowledge of many subject can speak of everything , not feeling submitted to anyone because of lack of information , or because he doesn \ t know what to say . this mean people to feel more secure of themselves . it is interesting to enlarge the knowledge of a subject more and more , but it isn \ t always possible because of time and cost . so a person who is specialized only in a particular subject can speak only about that , feeling ignorant about the rest . it is also interesting to improve the knowledge of several subject in order to form our personality and to find always other thing to disvcover . if you only know a specific subject you don \ t know very much what surround you . with the knowledge of only one subject , you know a little , if you know le specifically many subject , you know a lot . it is interesting to underline that a wide culture , the knowledge of many subject , also give people a sort of common sense , give the faculty to understand properly what happens around them , something like consciousness . in fact the most advanced country have a school system that go through the knowledge of a lot of subject , and only after that they have something improving the skill that regard each person future work . first of all you have to give the basis , then you can build something specific on them . if there \ s a lack of basis , there won \ t be anything else .
