the answer is . i agree about it . the world is developing now and follows it people developing with that , which mean the fact that we have to learn is getting now useful . i live in korea , and in korea , the student need to learn every subject that we do , so we have usually almost 12 subjest to learn , the reason why i mention is korea academical learning is old , the subject we learning is the fact that ha been finished by long time ago , we know it , but sometimes we are learning something that it 's not useful . the world ha developed and we have to follow that the technologe is really high now , which answer that fact are not useful to know , we can use it fact , but we do not really need to konw it , because we can find the knowlege from the internet which mean we do not need learn about the fact that we do n't know , which mean we do n't need to know all the fact that we had to know before , on the other hand , some fact are need to be known a common sense . the world is developing and person is developing , people is developing , so the society doe n't want the people that good for everything , which mean the major knowledge is more important , which mean we need to be good for one major thing . we can understand something better with fact , which mean understanding idea are better than known fact , like now developing country , we have a lot of competition with the others , and we have to have major skill to make a job , so we ca n't really think about the learning facters , because a i mention that internet doe that job , so now we problem is how much we understant about it , not how much we know . that also mean we understand the society .
