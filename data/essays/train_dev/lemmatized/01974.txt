the good way of the group travelling with a tour guide is that the group touring is make travel funny . we can meet many people who have n't meet yet , and we can also be friend . and if i have tour group we can talk each other about place we went and could discus about it . also if i go to truvel with a tour guide she will teach u about good place , good restaurant , and lot of other thing . it might be very good thing for u . thats because if that place we travel is unknown country , we do n't know where is here and also we ca n't speak language . when that happen if we have a tour guide , she will set up all thing that we need for u and surely she will presentate place where we travel correctly and truely . the good way of travelling yourself is that you can go to anywhere you want , but if i go to travel with group it might not be true . example , if i want to go to dysney land , but the tour guide said we will go to univertial studio so you should follow them . my think is not agree , but not disagree . that mean i think you can choose group travelling or yourself travelling in the stuation like if you want travel with many people , you can go with group . when you want travel all around freedom , you can go to travel yourself .
