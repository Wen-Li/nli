it is often said that there will be no more traffic-jam in the future . scientists have been developing a flying car and bigger and faster public transportation vehicle will be developed . howevere , i formly disagree with the statement that there will be fewer car in next twenty year . there will be more population than today and there will be many barrier to use those technology actually . to begin with , growing the number of population will make the world more complicated and complex and each person will have own car . compared with the past , it is true that we have a lot more car nowadays than the past . for example , in seoul , korea , three of ten had a own car even ten yea ago . how about now ? the percentage of possesion is almost same with the past . however , the number of car is five time more than 1990s ' . in addition , twenty year are not enough time to develop some new technology and actuallly use it . the government have tried to make new subway system and monorail system within ten year , but the thing wa already twenty year ago . there is no any change and they have still been planning . for example , one of the expert from the government said last week , they were planning to adapt new system for aircraft within five year . the essay for the next day , however , criticized that the government should finish the airforce-military system changing plan which had not been finished for age . also , it said , `` no more people in this country believe the government ! '' in conclusion , we all hope that a fewer car is in the world in the future . it should be replaced by the great public transportation , such a subway and bus . also , government should make the cost of flight much cheaper than now . however , i do not agree with that there will be a fewer car in use than now in the next twenty year with all these reason .
