advertising wa created in order to make people buy thing . nowadays , competition is very significant between brand and each brand ha to struggle in order to convince people to buy their product . marketing department deal with that . as for me , i do agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . because of globalisation , we can nowadays find almost whatever we want in each country and more particularly in developped country . which implies that competition is very rude since there are so many product available for customer . the choice is huge and how can we decide which product to buy when we do not know them ? as a consequence , brand launch many advertising campaign . they do their best in order to do the best campaign . thanks to advertising technique , they enhance their product a much a they can . because they need to have the product that would the most catch people 's attention usually , when someone look at a billboard or watch a commercial on tv about a new food product , it is so well promoted that we are most of the time very interested by the product and we are very excited to go and test it . but we are unfortunately often disappointed . indeed , if i take the example of a new burger launched by mcdonald , the burger will seem very very good in picture . however , when i will go and try it , the bread will be too dry , the cheese will not have the same aspect . .. and once again , i will wonder why thing are almost never the same a in the advertising . advertising agency usually deal with significant budget and they use amazing technique sometimes to enhance the product . not only , the aspect are not the same , but also the feature are not what they tend to be . actually , some product ensure to do this or this and when you try them , the result is not the one you were expecting . finally , i would like to add that this doe not only occur for product but it also happen for famous people . most of the star you see in magazine are gorgeous but in the real life they are not the same , you can be very surprised . all this is due to the marketing that make everything or evyone being perfect .
