i agree with this statement . i do n't mean that fact and learning about them is not important . but the complete understanding of something come with the acknowledgement of it basis . ideas and concept are the base in wich knowledge and progress are built on . so it 's essential for a student to manage the idea and concept of a topic of study , to be capable of completely understanding everything about it and to work correctly with it fact . when a student approach his learning process , he must go through two moment . first , the understanding of the basic concept of the topic that he 's studying . he must be able to manage and handle all the basic idea and knowledge of what his studying . and then analizyng the fact . in this second moment the student , using his previous result , the student compare and associate the concept and idea he learned earlier with the fact that are given to him . this way the student can fully learn about the topic and generate conclusion , that are correct and useful in his and in others whole educational process . teacher should point out process like these , so they could get much better result out of their teaching and could more accourately reach their goal . and student could really be prepare and could really trust that they have a solid educational formation . so in conclusion , it 's not that knowing about idea and concept is more important than knowing about fact . is that the proper learning of basic concept can lead to a better use and to a better understanding of fact . if student reallly want to reach a correct use of their knowledge , they must know everything about the concept and idea that they are working with . and teacher must make their structure of teaching easier to point out the basic idea .
