success is a very common word that people use very frequently to express their ambition . it is probably the best goal someone may have and it can be reached in every field , but how ? the main element needed to have success is studying . studying will always bring somewhere better than where you are now and this is another great goal to which you should always aim at in your life . another fundamental factor is risk . risk is not a very common word , because when it is used , it usually represents a very difficult and intense situation . apart from businessmen , people do n't like very much to pronounce this word . as a matter of fact , it is mainly used in business discussion . in economics , risk is what lead to success . for instance in stock exchange , no one who ha n't ever risked is successful , and never will be . in business , you are compelled to gamble on ton and ton of factor that will determine the way through of your day and consequently of your life earnings . there is a great motto that state the importance of this curious behaviuour : `` no risk , no earns ! '' it is a hundred percent correct and it illustrates very exaustively what people 's behaviour should be like . yes , because risk are not to take only in business field . risks are at the basis of worhty living , morally and economically speaking . if this behaviour occurs , people would not do what they already do well , but they would improve . improving implies some risk initially , but paradoxally in the end , it always brings you to riduce risk and gable on your life . so in conclusion a key advice to be given is : `` always improve , because in life there is always more to learn about and more to risk on .
