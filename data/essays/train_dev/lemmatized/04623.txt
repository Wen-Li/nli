many people consider that it is better to specialize in one specific subject , but in my openion , to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is better . there are three reason to support my statement . people have broad knowledge of many academic subject can make subject more interesting , broaden their horizon , and have many different perspective to watch the world . although some people think that spcialize in one subject will make themself more professional . however , if they do not pay much time on their study , or think the subject is so boring , they still can not make themself professional . hence , study in many kind of academic subject will make people feel more interesting , once they enjoy what they read , then they will real understand what the book said , people still can become professional . next , major in broad knowledge of many acedemic subject can broaden horizon . for example , if people just major in one subject , they only know the field , but if they study in many subject , they may know history , the foreign language or learn hot to appreciate the fine art , they will not limited what they study . `` enjoy what i learn , then i will become excellent . '' if people interest in t many kind of subject , that will broaden their vision , and it could make people to have different respect to watch the wonderful world . they may have positive thinking than those people specialize in one specific subject , bucause people have broad knowledge may also have positive mind .
