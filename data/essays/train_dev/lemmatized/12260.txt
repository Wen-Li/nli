youth represents a large percentage of the world population . recently we had an increasing number of new formed organization , which are specialized in helping the community . most of these organization are constitute of young people . i do believe that young motivated people can serve and help there community . young poeple are usualy highly motivated . but due to many circumstance they might not find the time or the appopriate way for helping their community . for example i am a lawyer and most of the time i have to work for 10 to 12 hour per day . and during the weekend i usualy have paper to study and review . therefore i do not have that much time to do any social work . but that doe not mean that i do n't want to , or that i find that helping my community is that not that important , it is just that the rythem of the fast world that we live in today , force u to fix some priority first . but i do try my best to participate in any available community work that i can find . during my college year i did a lot of charity and social work . i wa a memeber of a social club , where we accomplished a lot of beneficial project that i 'm really pround for being a part of it . and we were not the only club , there where over 50 club in my university . we believe that the important thing is to help the people who need a hand , try to make there world a better place . like for example in the summer of 2002 , i participated in a project where we had to pant a primary school in a very poor district . the student of this school also helped u on this project , and it just felt great seeing these great smile of happiness painted on there cute little face . i believe that the young people are a very important element of the society . but all they need is just to find the right direction . they are full of hope and faith and have alot to give . and that nowadays they do give there best to help improving there community .
