at first is to say both way are important for student . you have to learn fact sometimes but also you have to understand idea and concept in general . i would say you can really understand concept if you have learnt a few fact before . i imagine to be a student in information technology . how could i understand the requirement and the development of a secure and professional working it network for a company e.g. , without exactly knowledge of the feature and performance of the component for such a network , both hardware component and software component ? in my oppinion the learning of fact is often the basis to go the next step . only if i have achieved a very good level of detailed knowledge , a very good level of known fact and information i will be able to think in higher dimension and to understand the context and goal of this descriped idea and concept . the experience from practice will support the ability to create successful concept . to talk about another example . i have to develop a marketing concept for a special new product . how can i do this without knowing how the product work , what the consumer requires and so on . in other word , before i can develop marketing concept i should have sold a few product , i should have talked to a few consumer of the regarding market segment . i should also have done a few market research to learn the most important topic about competitor . all this `` to do '' can be descriped a learning of fact , either learning in theory or learning in practice . both way of learning fact are very important to be successfull later in understanding and also creating idea and concept . so a a summary i would say it is not the question what is more important , learning fact or understand concept but it is the question what come a first . i am sure both of them are very important
