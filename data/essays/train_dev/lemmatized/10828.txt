i agree with the statement that most advertise show more fact of the product than they really have and make it much more easy to be saled . this phonomenen are showed almost all over the world and i think it is reasonable to be accept . the first reason is that , the advertise is mean to show the good effect of the product and appeal people to buy them . it is the use of the advertizing . people who make advertise always study the merchanes carefully and make it more useful and more worthful to buy . they of cause will show a lot of unconvince fact to be convinced . just even a piece of papper can be discribed to have the capability to make user more healthy than use other kind of pappers . you may think it is rediculers , but the advertise offen make those problem . second , the company pay for the advertisement is focus on the profit of it . the company do this thing just because it want to increase it sale and make more money back . input and output is the first thing to a company . so the manerge people want to make the product more attractable to the market . and the advertise will be a better a it could be . no concern about the fact . there are many illigle advertises in china that misleading people and make terrible effect to the society . the last reason is , sometimes , people are like to see some amazing thing in the advertisement though they do not believe it . for example , a woman who is not so fit may want to see some medicine that can help people to lose weight . and she may dream that she could be a beautiful a the ficture shown at the advertisement . she dose not want a really product , but just a dream . so the advertisement offen seem much better than they really are and accepteble to the society .
