it is difficult for me to answer this question , because we must define some concept to answer this question . first of all what is really meant by using the word `` nowadays '' . comparing young people from now and those who have lived fifty year ago is not the same a comparing them to those who have lived a century ago . let me suppose we are comparing nowadays young people to those who were young just at the end of the second world war . for that example it is difficult to answer again for a particular reason that is that the society wa not the same at that time . the city were not so crowded , excepted for a few of them , and then several people used to live in small city . in that kind of town the people are more likely to know each other than in the big city centre . when you live in a small town you can for example help your neighboor with his garden when he is not at home and you are more likely to do that kind of thing just because you know very well . in the city almost nobody know his neighboor . a second thing that ha to be clarified is the meaning of `` helping their community '' . must there be a benefit for every body or just for a single person ? the action that benefit all the community are so easy to do for young people just because they do not care about that at their age . to finish i would like to give a part of my opinion on this suject . i would say that the young people nowadays give le time that their parent used to do in the past , but to my mind this is not due to their selfishness but to the today society 's selfishness .
