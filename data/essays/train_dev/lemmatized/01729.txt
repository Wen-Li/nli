i think that for student is more important to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . in my opinion , if you understand the concept , you have always time to learn fact or date . in child education , for example , it 's important to give them the instrument to understand nature and society . i think it 's not so important to fill them with date and fact . morever , if a child understand a concept , he will keep it in mind for the rest of his life . if he learn a fact without understanding it , he will forget it in a month . for example , i can remember poem that i learned when i wa 6 year old , just because my teacher explained the meaning of them . i can remember song and historical fact because i had an explenation of them . if a teacher tell a fact without explaining it for the child ha no sense and they do n't put attention on it . the same is in adult education . in the university of medicine , for example , is much more important to understand how to visit a patient , than to know exactly the name of the 56 bone of the body . you always have time to take a book and learn it . i have to mention that there are fact or notion that people need to know . for example a doctor , of course ha to understand how the body work and how to visit a patient , but he also ha to know the dosis of the medicament or the name of the most important part of the body . an antropologist ha to understand the human behavior but he also ha to know about history and language and culture . so , even if idea and concept are more important in education , there are some fact and notion than student have to learn .
