i would love to believe that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . but it is sad to see in human history that most time we have made the good choice too late . however two major contemporary problem seem to support this opinion : the huge ammount of air pollution caused by vehicules all around the world and the fact that we are running out of fuel reserve . which mean that basicly we should stop using our car a much for the sake of the environment and we are going to have to anyway in the future . at least in what concern car a we know them today . so the question is : why are n't we changing now the way our vehicules work since we are going to have to do it anyway ? why not find today an energy that would keep our car running but would n't pollute ? the truth is that modern technology is able to do that - car that run with electricity or solar panel exist - but the finantial intrest of these massive gas and oil company seems to come first . i once heard a sentence that resume this attitude . two oil investor , one say to the other : `` one day with all the money we make from industry we will be able to clean up the environment '' . but this is simply not true . at one point it doe become too late . we have to act now so that in twenty year there will be indeed fewer car that cause pollution . this transition can be done today with significant change . for example , why should every member of a family have a car when one is enough ? we should all start taking the bus .
