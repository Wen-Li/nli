some peole like to try new thing and make successe ; while others enjoy doing the same task or matter they already know . as far a i am concerned , i am the person who hate doing repeated thing . as a result , i agree successful people experience new matter and take risk . following are the reason . first of all , some people like me like to enjoy the fresh thing . these people will cultivate their interest during the new thing , and they will love and immerse themselves to new thing . take me for example , i major in the industrial and information management department . in this field , we all have to study the operation management subject . however , i thought it wa very boring after two year studying them . i turned to related subject , which called logistics . i had not studied before , but i developed my interest in this subject and now i love the subject very much . in the second place , some people like to take risk and make fortune . imaging that you have some money on hand . will you deposit your on-hand money or you will invest them to get the expected reward and take some risk . the interest rate in bank now is very low ; therefore , if we choose save our money into the bank , we can not get the same amount a the investment doe . now , what do you think ? however , there are still some successful people through doing what they already know . i am of the opinion that these people have experienced many new thing and own vast knowledge in their mind . when they face some situation , the vast knowledge is the basis for decision process . these successful people easily know how to transform the knowledge into the real case . that is to say , they are not doing the same thing ; rather , they utilize the basic concept in their mind to solve many diverse situatations and make a success in the long run . due to the mention above , i am of the opinion that successful people try new thing and take risk .
