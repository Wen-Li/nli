as consumer live in the society of advertisement , they see abundant of commercial advertisement . and they often face the situation when the quality of the product doe not meet their expectation made by the advertisement , because it is natural that the advertisement make product look much better that they really are . it is a given characteristic of the commercial advertisement to maximize the positive side of the product and to minimize or even hide the negative side of the product . and this process will alter the impression of the consumer toward the product . for example , the advertisement of fastfood restaurant such a mcdonald 's or burgerking , do not mention about their nutrition fact . not because they do not know about it , but because they know it will harm the image of their food product . they mostly try to show how delicious the burger are . and without getting all the bad information about the product , consumer , of course , think the product are much better than they actually are . also , the medium take influential role in this process . there are limitation for consumer to analyze the product . it is extremely difficult to evaluate the product in short period of time while advertisement are on the medium , and also because they are indirect way to show the product , consumer just can not get correct impression of the product from the advertisement . and surely , it lead to the misleading of the impression about the product , usually to exaggerated way . psychological factor of the advertisement are also worth to discus . as consumer look at the advertisement of the body spray `` tag '' , they get the notion that anybody who spray the `` tag '' will attract numerous beautiful female . by showing that one who us `` tag '' can attract numerous female in the advertisement , the company try to give consumer an impression that `` tag '' is attractive , and effective body spray . although there is n't too much of a difference between `` tag '' and other body spray , this advertisement make consumer to think that `` tag '' is better than other body spray . so , i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
