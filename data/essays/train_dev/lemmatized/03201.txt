i believe everybody can not know everything and it not so good to be ` jack of all trade and master of none ' . specific knowledge is very much desired in both professional and academic field . specialized knowledge of the subject is many time indispensible . one good example would be from field of medicine , where general physicians are valued but specialist like cardiologists or neurologists are indispensible and are the final option for particular kind of treatment . too much generalized knowledge may become very superficial and will not be of much help in solving complex problem in specific subject . for instance , if we look at the field of science , say biology , a generalized understanding of all it branch is required but a taxonomist and a biophysicists have very le to do with each others and can not help each other in solving their specific problem . however all this discussion is not meant to diminish the value of general knowledge , a for application of knowledge from one subject in to other requires understanding of both . for example if principle of mathematics are to be applied to biology then general knowledge of both subject is required . however it will be done more appropriately if two specialist i.e. a biologist and a mathematician interact with each other . also i believe that human memory ha it limitation and one should use it judiciously . we should confine and focus our brain towards solving problem related to specific subject . too much unnecessary knowldge will occupy space in one 's memory and will not be put to use very often . therefore having general knowledge in moderation is good , but having only general knowledge is of no use . to apply knowledge for usefull purpose one ha to specialize in particular subject .
