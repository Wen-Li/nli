they are different kind of people , some of them like to live their life just the way they have and they are some other that love to continue improve their result , their goal , their life . one example of this kind of people are the successful people , who one day had a dream and they follow and make it real . in this kind of people , some thing can happend . one thing is you will know you task and skill so well that you could became a costum or a rutine and you can stay stock in the job , the idea or the the proyect you are working . also you can loose you profesional level because of that . another option is to try new thing that breake the rutine or take risk that will improve your idea day by day . for example if i 'm use to take the second avenue to go to my job and always get late , to be more success in the time that i arrive to my job i can try a new road to get to it . another possibility is to evaluate periodical the process and traid different way and then choose wich is the best . i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk , because they are not affair of change the thing , change the process for an option that will be better and at the end will give them the chance to continue with the successfull that they have .
