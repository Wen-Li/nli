some people might think that successful people try to new thing whereas others might believe that they should do well what they already know for the success . in my opinion , i can agree with the statement only if the success people already do well what they already know . one possible reason is that doing easy thing can reduce the risk of failing to do new thing . if small problem that can be easily coped with are left for long time , it will be the interraption of the succession . even tiny problem can be bigger when they are left over for a long period . if the basic ha been done , the successed new thing will yield more benefit . even if there were small thing which were easy to be done , they would result the liability . to success , the thing that are basic and have known already sould be well done . it decrease the risk of the failure , and the new thing that are tried will increase the benefit from the succession . if only new thing are tried from no background , that will yield nothing and cost .
