i want to state my opinion wether a broad knowledge of many subject is better than to specialize in one subject . both way have their specific advantage and disadvantage which i would like to state in the following text . having a broad knowledge is always an advantage , not only when it come to game-shows like `` who want 's to be a millionaire '' . knowing a lot give you an open view to the world a it is . it open you for alternative explanation and solution and might even make you into a more tolerant person . even though from this point of view it seems very usefull to gather a broad knowledge it also brings with it some problem . many specific knowledge is what make you an expert in some area . when beeing a competitive person who always try to be the best you will not achieve your goal , if you are not focussing your energy to some few subject and even if you are not competitive the everyday job-requirements force you to have a certain amount of knowledge about a special subject . even though the capacity of the human brain seems to be nearly unlimited , the time of most human is not . getting a broad knowledge need a lot of time to gather this knowledge . if you try to get to this knowledge on a university you soon will have to face the fact , that not just the time but also the money of most person is limited . in most country all over the world , studying is not for free . even in germany where universities where free for decade a growing number of federal country is intoducing study fee . so at one point or another most people have to make a decision between the amount of knowledge to gather , and the time and money they got to do this . in my opinion a broad knowledge is an ideal which is very hard to reach . so i think it is better to first concentrate on one subject and to get to know everything possible about it , get a job by using that knowledge and try to broaden your horizon afterwards . not doing so will turn you into an unemployed academic with a broad knowledge . when talking about this topic another pretty important thing ha to be mentioned . more important than finding time to gather knowledge , is to make sure you do n't loose the one you once had . in germany it is said , that when finishing highshool one ha the broadest knowledge in his whole life . when starting to study often just a few month are needed to loose this knowledge , mostly because one focus on his primary subject in college . so maybe the mentioned ideal is easier to reach by not forgetting knowledge than by gathering it . to summarize my personal view : i for myself always try to gather a much knowledge a possible even though i know it is just possible within certain limit given by the environment . but even though it is surely better to have this broad knowledge i will never say a bad word about someone who just try to be the best in his primary subject .
