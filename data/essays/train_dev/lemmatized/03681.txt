recently , some criticism ha been raised regarding the little interest of young people in helping their community . however , i do not agree with it and think young people are still playing an important role in helping their community . first , they do a lot of volunteer work . every spring and fall when the farmer are busy planting seed or harvesting crop , many college or university student are seen to make volunteer group to give them a little help . furthermore , a great number of highschool and middleschool student are taking in part in helping orphan or disabled people . secondly , young people attribute greatly to the community economy even if they do n't know they 're or do n't intend to . they 're the main consumer in the shop which is why so many brand have young people a their prior target . they 're also the main passenger for a lot of public transportation . while many adult tend to drive ther car to work , young people use bus or taxi to go to school . thirdly , thorough demonstration , young people keep the community in a good direction . they protest against unequal treatment or improper administration . these help the community habitant make sure that nothing unfair should be happened in their community . for the formentioned reason above - young people do a lot of volunteer work , help the local economy , and have the community aware of improper thing through demonstration - i think that young people are doing their job in helping our community a better place to live .
