in my opinion , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because fact make student bored while the idea and concept seemed a interesting . first , from the beginning of my education in my school teacher always gave me some fact and everytime i asked myself what would i do with them . i think learning fact would not improve student because we can not change these fact we can not deny them or we can not develop them . the reason for this is that they are all about the past . they have already proved and the last thing we can do is admitting them and living according to these fact . on the other hand , bringing some idea and understanding concept is very important since you are thinking and creating your own value . second , when making a career , it is necessary to define what is happenning around the world . you can not defend yourself according the fact but idea or concept . you should make logical comment about global event not only about their obvious feature but also what is hidden so that you should understand idea and concept to make sensible sentence . finally , i agree that it is important to understand idea and concept to be creative and sensible .
