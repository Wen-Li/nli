i agree with the statment that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . people become successful when they achive a goal which is considered to be appreciable by not only their peer but also the society a a whole . consider the stock market for example , one of the leading men in investment banking is warren buffet who made his fortune by investing in idea that others were scared to support . eventually he became one of the richest men in the world . '' taken the beaten path wo n't take you anywhere '' is what he said . i have seen my father benifiting from investing in a contra fund , i.e. a mutual fund that invests on stock which contradict the market dynamic and trend . so it doe pay to go into uncharted teritories . some of the most important discovery of modern time ha been electricity and the antibiotic ( like pencilline ) which would n't have taken place if people like faraday and fleming did n't dare to put their life on the line . thus i would say that the people who dare , do reep the friuts of their success better . famous explorer became successful because they believed in their instinct and sailed on for day in search of new and promising land . the most important discovery ha been that of the americas by the european explorer . and look where america is today , arguably the most powerfull nation in the world . when you are a one in a million you are not recognized , you have to stand out from the crowd and make your own space , create your own niche . and there are many stoires of success where an indivudal attained success when he go out and take some chance . so i do think that the a person willingness to take risk along with a dash of hardwork and dediction will eventually make him successful
