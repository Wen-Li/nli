in the matter of fact , if people invent a new mean of transportation rather than using the car it could be true . actually , i agree , however , i do not think that in the next twenty year , people are going to get rid of car , i mean there would be no fewer car , but on the contrary there would be more car to use , and the street are going to be too crowded . because if we consider the expanding population , i mean the growth of people , we will have a great need to have a car for each person to use . car is one of the most important mean to move and travel from one place to the another , however , the car need gas and this would be a problem , if car increased in the next twenty year . so , in my point of view , if we could think of another mean of transportation to help u moving and fulfiling our need , this would help to make the street a good environment for people to walk and run if they want . lets say that in the next twenty year there would be no car , and now i am going to give example of transportation mean people might use to move , for instance ; are people going to use there own leg like the old man did ? or are people going to use hours and camel or big animal ? . i am sure they are not going to use these mean , because the world recently and in the future is becoming more quick , and what i exactly mean by quick is that the time is running too fast , so we have to consider managing our time well and at the same time we have to think of another mean to go from a place to another . eventually , we can not ignore the big importance of car in ourlives , however , we can reduce their problem by putting alot of solution .
