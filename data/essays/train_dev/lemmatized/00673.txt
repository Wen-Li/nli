i do n't agree with the statemant . i do n't believe most advertisement make product better . one example of advertisemants is to happen in my couontry , japan . there is a pretty popular company of vinegaer . the vinegaer 's color is black . it is said that it is better than normal one . actually , it is better , but the company said that black one contained many time nutirition . it wa wrong . i ca n't believe avdvertisements . another example is when i wa in japan . i sometimes brought something on the internet . i ca n't remember what i bought , but i just remember it that it wa terrible . i decided to buy something when i saw a advertisement on the internet . it wa said that we sold the product with the lowest price in japan . but , one of my friend already had same product , and he bought in tokyo with lower price than mine . i do n't believe advertisement since that . last example , in japan , we bought by advertisement , we could n't get better product that on advertisement . avdvertisements just show that how product is better . so , actually advertisement are not better than real product . i never believe it .
