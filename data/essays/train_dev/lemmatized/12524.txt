i agree that understanding idea and concept are more important than learing fact . in our society , people study in school for long time and learn about lot of thing such a math , english , science , and history . when we learn concept or idea of any course in the school , we have hard time to remember concept and fact because we do not understand idea . i believe understanding idea and concept are important because we can remember longer than learning fact and easy to learn new study . first , if we understand idea and concept , we can remember longer than learn fact . we learn process or concept before we learn fact because it is the easy way to understand . although many people learn fact , they can not remember for long time . for example , i am in anatomy class and the beginning of the year , i just memorized fact and i did not try to understand concept ; i did not get good grade on my report card . but , after i got first report card , i tried to understand concept and i got a good grade . understanding idea is first step to get knowledge . second , in my opinion , . all study that we learn in school connect to other study in high school or college . after we graduate high school , we go to college for our dream . if we understand concept ; we can learn other thing easily . for instance , my friend , she is college student and she stuided european history in her senior year and her major is art in college . she realized that the history connect to the art alot although they are not same kind subject . in addition , she think if we understand any concept . they connect to the other study ; it is easy to learn new thing and get better understanding of study . in my opinion , understanding concept lead easy way to remember study and convenience way to study new study . i believe understanding is one of the most important concep of the education .
