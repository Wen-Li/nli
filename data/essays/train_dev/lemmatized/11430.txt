there are different way to develop an activity or to approach to a problem . some people prefer to try new thing and take risk . on the contrary , a more conservative group of people prefer only doing what they already know how to do well . but there may be succesful case in both gropus . then , what is the best attitude ? when people stick to their own traditional method they are able to solve basic , elemental problem , but do not have the psychological or intelectual resource to imagine a new possibility , a challenging solution or a new discovery . they fear failing , and feel more secure doing exactly what they have always done for a long time . these people do not innovate but maintain tradition and keep everything in it place and relatively under control . on the other hand when we try new thing and idea we touch different dimension of the problem . we are not prejudiced by common opinion and statement and sometimes we can see or foresee completely different aspect of the situation . people who belong to this group are eager to take risk and do not fear failure , danger or doing special effort in order to reach their goal . in this case , people have to be energetic , very enthusiastic about their idea and good team leader . personally , i think that in order to succed you should try something new each time . it is very rewarding when you discover something that maybe wa so close that nobody could see . even though you may find that many people turn against you because they think your idea are ridiculous or stupid , you have to insist and keep on working because at last , thing will go well and something very good will happen . so , next time you have to solve a problem , i recommend trying something completely new for a change .
