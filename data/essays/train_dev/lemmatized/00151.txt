understanding idea and concept and leraning fact are important for student . however , in my opinion , i disgree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . to begin with , we can learn idea and concpets in class and our teacher , but sometimes they do n't work in the real society . for example , i worked in one restaurant before . when i cook the fish by following the recipe which our teacher taugh me , the chef blamed me . he said , `` customers wo n't like what you cook by this way . '' the fact improved what he said is right because the people who ate the dish i cooked went to complained to my bos . i wa upset and depressed . from that day , i do n't believe the recipets i took in my class . in addition , sometimes fact is very cruel , but we need to accept them . that 's the reason why i regard fact are more important . for instance , i almost lost my job when i cooked the awful dish by following the recipets . my bos told me that the fact wa whatever you cooked , the most important thing wa the customer liked it , especailly about work . what he said made me trust fact is the most significant factor again . in short , i learned the precious lesson by realistic and painful experience . i would n't say that understanding idea and concept are useless or not important ; however , i really believe that it is more importnat for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept .
