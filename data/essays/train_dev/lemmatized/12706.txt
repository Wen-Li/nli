i agree with the opinion that one need to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than specified knowledge of one subject . there are two main reason ; one is that the modern society need someone who ha multiple background , and the other is that one specific academic subject is limited to define the complexed reality . most of all , a a society is getting developed and modernized , it need someone who ha multiple knowledge of various subject . as someone who is specialized in one specific subject ha a limitation to utilize his knowledge and experience to other part of the society , his value in this society will be reduced . for exmaple , my uncle , who work for samsung electronics , majored in computer science in university . because he doe n't have any knowledge about the business and economy exept for the specified computer subject , he could n't make success when the company offered a good position in the business planning team . in addtion , one specified subject ca n't explain and define the complexed reality . in the past , it wa possible to analize a natural or social phenomenon by using a specified knowledge and theory . however , in order to analize and define a modern phenomenon , we have to mix the various academic background and knowledge . for instance , when we analyzed the main reason of imf period in early 2000 in korea , we had to utilize such many academic knowledge a politics , economics , socialogy , statistic , international economics and finance to get the correct answer . as a result , having abroad knowledge of many academic subject is very essential in that the modern society need someone who have various academic background and the complexed reality is hard to be explained by one specific subject .
