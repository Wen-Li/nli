i strongly disagree with this statement a the need for personal transportation will be even more in next twenty year than what it today is . rise in the living standard of the people and faster life style would be the possible reason behind this prediction . people are becoming more and more independent and solitary in their life style so the need for personal car is going to be more . there are certain thing wich may resist increase of the number of car in future and one of those is the fuel problem . the major fuel for car these day is petrol or other chemical derived from petroleum . the amount of fuel we have under ocean etc is expected to last for another 100 year . so there will be enough fuel for the car in next twenty year . but even then other type of fuel such a c.n.g and hydrogen etc are also used by car manufacturer now a day so it would not let the extinction of car happen . car are definetely going to increase in number on road in next twenty year becase they have been made safer now a day than they were before . with all this technical advancement and safety experimentation carried out at a war front level new model of car coming out of the factory in future are going to be very very safe for the driver . last but not the least , with all the above reason , the reason which might be the biggest and the most powerful reason behind increase in car 's population on the road will be affordability , the mass production and competition in the market is working towards cutting down the price of the car so down that the day is not far when even a common man would be able to buy a car of his choie . the freedom of mobility , safety and affordability would increase the number of car on the road in next twenty year .
