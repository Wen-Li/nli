i agree with the statement . young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , because time is changed . with the grow of the population and the expansion of the city the ideal of community is different . in the past people live togheter coperating , so young people could give an hand and a contribute to the society , but now there is an individualism society . so young people do n't feel the need of helping their community . i think that young peole must know how important is give an hand to someone that need help . everyone must give his little contribute for the growing of the society . personally i spend some of my time to help child of primary school with their homework , because i think that it 's an important think to do . during my summer holiday for a month my friend and i do the animation at the youth club , playing with child , taking them at the swimming pool , and making some mountain trip . children 's parent always thank u for our usefull service because without u they do n't know what can do . also childern seems to be happy for these activity . this is an example that with a little sacrifice everyone can give an hand to the community in particulary young people . i think that the best solution is to incentivate young people to make some activity , for example help old people or child . in this way the communitie will grow b
