i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first of all that is why company create advertisement ; to increase the reputation of their product . also advertisement is need to be like that to be effective on customer . companies create adversitement to make their product well-known , to increase the sale and to make profit a much a possible . this three reason are every company most important goal . to make your product well-know , the advertisement needed to be good prepared . also it can be exaggrated if it is needed . there year ago there were a car commercial in turkey . the commercial wa about reliability of the car . a car wa moving fast through valley and up to mountain . at the end the driver get off the car and started to walk on moon slowly and with jumping . many people in turkey still remembers this commercial , so doe the car brand . if the company or their brand are well-known they can increase the sale . as a result the profit which they make would increase too . that is the reason company make deal with other company to enter a new market . for example sony made deal with ericcson and create a new brand , sony ericcson , to enter the turkish cell phone market . advertisements are need to be effective on customer . some scientific research in usa during 1990 's show that people forget very big part of what they see easily . to make it hard to forget or unforgetable their emotion are needed to be effected . if advertisement can effect people 's emotion it will effect people 's idea too . to effect people 's emotion advertisement need to show more than what product really are . i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are because company creates advertisement to make their product well know , to increase the sale and to increase the profit . also people can easily forget what they if they are not effected emotionally . we need exaggrate to effect people 's emotionas .
