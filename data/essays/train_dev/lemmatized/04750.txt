we all are aware of the fact that `` knowledge of divine '' . by academic study we gain some knowledge to prove ourselves in our concerned field . i disagree with the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge than to specialize in one specific subject '' . as we know `` rolling stone ha no moss '' , similarly the man with interest in many subject is not worthful . the reason for which i disagree is that a person with specialisation in one specific subject will have more demand than a person with knowledge of many academic subject . as we see people in our daily life , a lecturer , a draughtsman , a lawyer , etc. these are all specialist in one particular subject . the second reason is that a we know that this world is full of competition . everyone face competition in his field . if we are specialised in one particular subject , we can thrive hard and we can get rid of this competition , by having immense knowledge of one subject . the third reason i would like to present , is that a person 's ability of learning may be more , but it is limited to a particular filed or a particular subject . if anyone wish to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subject he may not be able to grasp all the stuff from the subject . its not just the matter of possible or not , it just impossible to anyone to have such a memorising or knowledge accumulating power . the last and final reason is that though having broad knowledge of many academic subject , he will work to a filed or organisation where he us the knowledge of one particular subject . but not all the knowledge of his all subject . if he want to switch over to other filed , he ha to work from the begining i.e. like a beginner . so i prefer to have broad knowledge in one specific subject to having broad knowledge in many subject .
