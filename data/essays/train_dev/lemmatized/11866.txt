as in all area , there are many disagreement on education approach . regarding teaching method , some believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . both teaching method are highly used in all over the world , but when it come to my teaching method , i am a clear defender that it is far more important for student to understand idea and concept rather than learn plain and simple fact . it dose n't require any type of creativity for a student to understand a fact . facts are fact . facts can not be developed nor changed . on the other hand , idea and concept require creativity and development . by teaching student to understand an idea , you are teaching him the why and how of the fact . you are fostering the student to think about it , analize it and reach his own conclusion - a conclusion that with time , will develop in take the example of a teacher who is trying to teach his student not to swear at other people . if he would tell him not to swear beacause swearing is against the kinder-garden rule and it sound bad ( which are fact ) , the kid is most likely to stop swearing because those are the rule , he wa told not to , not beacause he ha understood the concept of morale , or because he regret hurting people . if we teach him the idea , the concept about swearing and all it consequenses ( which are such and such ) , the kid can truly understand why not to swear . by teaching our student the idea and the concept behind the fact that control our life , we are encouraging our student to become flexible , analize and have a mind of their own . we are forstering student who do not only know the fact , but also know the why and the how of fact . david zuniga leyton
