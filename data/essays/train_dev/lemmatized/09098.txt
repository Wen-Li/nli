no i do not entirly agree on the statement that group travel led by a tour guide is the best way to travel due to numerous reason i have gone to many country both in a group with my parent and alone , in my experince the best time i had wa with a group of teenager my age in usa because we were all the same age and of diffrent background , but it wasn ' entirly like a vacation where you had your peice of mind , and complete freedom to they way you wanted to enjoy your time . rather than waking up at 6 in the morning and going accordiong to set guideline made by the tour guide i would chose to roam the place alone , discovering numerous place on my own and taking the vacation a an adventure . altough moving in a group can be fun , but i belive going with a small group of maybe about 2 or 3 freinds that think alike is a better option and even though going with a huge group is amazing fun , the tour guide is what spoil all the fun . tour guide usually have the whole vacation planned out with set timmings making the holiday seem like another school day where you have a worked up schedule to follow . therefore in my opnion the best way to travel would definatly be in a group but without a tour guide , because then you get the freedom to do you want and the liberty to make you own dicisions rather than following a tour guide . but if the tour guide is another person similar to the group your traveling in and know the place well the tour could defintly be the best one . but going to the himalays for adventure with a tour guide would defenitly kill the adventorus feeling that could be achived by going alone . therefore the statemnt ha it pro and con dependiong on your tour guide , the group and the situation . but if all the three are perfect then the statment is defenitly justified .
