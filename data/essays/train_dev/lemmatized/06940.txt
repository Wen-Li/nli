i personally agree with the statement that `` it is important to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . cause it is enough for a student to understand the idea and concept . according to me , a a student , it is more important to have a clear idea and concept of a topic rather than going for the fact . the student should get a clear idea and grip on the topic so that he can know the thing well . student should first learn the thing from their lecturer and then should have a knowledge on the particular subject , so gaining knowledge is really very important in building one 's carrier . so the student should carefully follow the instruction given by the lecturer in order to understand all the concept . for example , when i wa doing my 10th class , i wa very much interested in learning the fact rather than the subject . i allways use to spend time on finding out the fact and concentrated very le on the concept of the topic , a a result i got a poor grade in my acedemics . so after this my teacher advised me to understand the idea and the concept than to understand the fact . i followed the instruction given by the teacher , and performed very well in the next exam . so it really important to have the knowledge of the subject than the knowledge of the fact . so a i experienced personally , i can surely say that the student should have idea and concept of the topic . being a student it more than enough to get the knowledge of the particular subject , and under standing the concept of that particular subject than searching for fact . . so , i personally feel a a student , that understanding the idea and the concept is more important than to learn the fact .
