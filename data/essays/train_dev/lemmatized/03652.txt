in my opinion , i would agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more than other people do because they do n't have to do anything but diostract themselves , i assume very young people around four or five year old when school is still a pleasure and a kind of distraction . while growing up their life will become more and more complicated . homework going along with school will take most of their time until they 'll be graduate of an university . at this point most of any human a achieve twenty-five percent of his live and it ha been painful . then they 'll start to work . for some of them it will be fine and other will consider work a the worst experience they ever lived . during that time they will be able to do everything they want whenever they want only if is not during the time they are supposed to work . they will enjoy life but they will always remember their childhood a the good old time . then they 'll have child and they 'll have to work to provide them everything they need or want until they 'll leave the family house around eighteen year later . some year after the child will be gone , it will be time for them to get retired . and at this point they will enjoy life again even more than when they were young because they will be totally free . itm is the time when people learn to take their time and enjoy life . most of them will use the money they saved to travel around the world and see all they ever dreamt about . and then after they had had all the fun they wanted . it will be time for them to accept the fact that they can not fight against getting older and they 'll die sooner or later . i will finish with the point that on a ninety year long life , an human would have really enjoyed life around 25 year . yes i agree with the point made in the statement , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
