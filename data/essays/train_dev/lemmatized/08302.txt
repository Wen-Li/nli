when you ask me , if i agree or disagree this statement my answer would be : both . on the one hand are many young people active community-members . they help for an example in sportclubs , take care of older people or are in a political party . all these activity support the community . on the other hand many young people don `` t care about the community . they are a kind of egoistic and the reason vary . often you hear from young people that they don `` t have enough time to help their community , because they have a lot of work to do . but i think this is not the entire truth . some people are afraid of taking responsibilty for something or can `` t act in team . moreover they are thinking only of time or money and forget that it can be a great feeling to help others . mostly these people are great critic but they don `` t try to improve thing by helping . my guess is they are lazy too . advantages of helping in your community are that you meet interesting people and learn some skill , like speaking in front of a group or teamwork , that no teacher can teach you . although it cost you some leisure it can be fun . in summary i think it `` s good for your community a well a for your character to say yes to a task and help in a community .
