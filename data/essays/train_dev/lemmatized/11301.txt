in this world of never ending technology and demand for it , it is highly unlikely to predict the shift from the conventional mean of transport to rather slow and unconventional mean . before going twenty year deeper in to the future let u review the past five year . there ha been an increase of about a drastic 150 % in the number of car manufactured and the number sold in the market . this aptly explains the sate of mind of today man kind . the increase in the number of automobile would increase the pollution level but man is not able to switch on to a le dustructive mean . popullation is also a major draw back . this can be explained by the simple logic `` more the people , more the mean of transport required '' . as the number of vehicle increased by about 150 % in five year a decline in it is nearly impossible in this parasitic human world . though many of the educational institution are not allowing vehicle in their campus the effect on the public is decimal . a person would always choose a faster way of transport rather than a slow mean like a bi-cycle . it may also be possible that some day man made fuel with no pollution effect could be invented and the number of vehicle may increase a need is always the source for invention . but if such a marvel is not achieved then the world will have to face an inevitable natural catastrophy . hence according to the thing standing a on today and the reason stated it can be said that the number of automobile would increase in the coming twenty year and man kind can not try to stop the increase but should and ha to try to decrease the negative effect of the increase .
