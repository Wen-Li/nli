imagine a person in annual vacation in rome and waking up at 7 o'clock in the morning . this is what happen when the person travel with group and usually the group are more funny but they are much le comfortable because they visited le place , tight the person to a committment . the group usually visited le place eventhough they usually know more place but because there is a large number in group and to manage them and take them in a tour or to guide it demand such a great effort . but when the person is alone , he can go indivisually , smoothly and simply from point a to point b andcan manage him self to visit where ever he want because the indivisual can tell if he got enough energy for a long tour among the old city or better for him to stay in the pool area relaxing , drinking and taning . and also the group always tight the tourist into a restrict scedule and committment . when he sometimes the tourist is tired or out of his energy do n't ever try to miss the tour because it 's simply not repeated . and for indivisuals it 's always a matter of mood . finally it 's quite a difference between indivisuals and group but i highly recommended for tourist to travel a indivisuals and enjoy the real tour and cruise .
