it is true that young people enjoy life much more that older people do and i support this statement entirely . we have to however , realize that we maybe refering to a specific time period and different stage of age-groups at different time , this may include one 's year of adolescence or even the teenage year . as an adult with a family to look after , there are a lot of additional responsibility that are thrust onto one 's shoulder . as a younger person there maybe the academic pressure that one ha to cope up with but not a problem a such . afterall , it is the duty of every child to study . the adult are incorporating into their life what they have already learnt , while the younger are still in the process of learning the basic trick of the trade . learning however , is a never ending process . as a younger person , there is always a tendancy to experiment . sometimes this may prove to be successful or may lead to failure . the whole point is that a a younger person , we are at an immature stage in our life and thing may not affect u that adversely and this is a big advantage and a huge motivational factor to go out and try different thing . after all a said by george bernard shaw in his famous play pygmalion , `` what is a life but a series of inspired folly . '' younger people have a lot more freedom , in the sense that they have a much wider curriculum and whole lot of facility to avail off , which our elder could have only dreamt of having in their time . ofcourse there is no shortcut to success and the required amount of hardwork ha to be put in , only we are luckier that we have access to better and quicker resource to consult . a great example could be taken from within a school community itself . the senior-junior relationship . as a junior there is not much expected out of one , except a good academic , which go for everyone across the board . as a senior one may be vested with great power , and with great power come great authority and greater responsibility . it is really surprising , yet true to see such a major shift of responsiblity even among a smaller group . school is however only a micro-cosm of the world and this is how the heirarchy is maintained the world over . the younger lot have no tension a such . the younger one 's always have a much relaxed attitude towards towards life and it other various aspect a well , and why should'nt they , there is the right time for everything and a they grow older the burden of responsibility will get to them . life at a younger stage is much more relaxed and stress-free . as an adult one may be dealing in a very rigorous and challenging climate , with a lot of intense competition , however , different than that of a younger person . thus , i can conclude by saying that the younger lot do enjoy life a lot more than the older people do .
