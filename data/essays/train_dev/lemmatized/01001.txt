`` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' i agree with this statement . probably the secret of many successful person might be this only . if people go on with the well known thing they might feel their life bored and they ca n't think innovatively , which lead to miss their success hence the fame or reputation . for example a man could not be a scientist unless he try to invent or invent a new thing . for instance take the astronomer who would always think of doing something or discovering or analysing something new from the space which an simple man ought to do , make them to do rick like space travelling . evenif they will fail once they would try besides their life for new thing . which make them great successful citezens . i wa always encouraged by my father to do new thing so that i can give wing to my mind and think beyond and become a sucessfull guy in my society . which brought me several prize by participating in the science fare . also when people try to do new thing they will adopt for that and they will get habituated to those despite of the difficulty . also trying new thing would also give some self satisfaction for oneself . if we do a new thing and succeeded in it we feel proud for that . it will also be play full to do new thing . kids usually have this behaviour that is they would like to mplay alwaya with new toy or others which they like the most for them even candle light would be so attracted that they would like to touch it which may bring rick for them but unknowingly he doe it and find out what would happen uf he touch a harmful thing . that is trying new thing willl make a person to leatn new thing which help him through out hte life finally i conclude that going for newer thing make man more successfull . as success not mean only success in acedemics or other but selfsatisfaction is also a type of success which make u to stand still for any circumstance we face .
