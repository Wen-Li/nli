i completely agree with the statement . it is clear that everyone 's life is full of obstacle and problem and often we 're not be able to prevent them by accurate project or by putting ourselves in certain condition . owing to this fact , people who experiment many difficulty in their life and can get over them , even not easily , are more prepared when any other obstacle occurs . in addition , who have the luck to try in his own life a broad variety of experience have surely a more flexible mind that can help him solving problem or getting higher place in the society . for example , a man who ha tried different job and ha learned many different skill , would surely learn and do faster a new work than another worker who just applies for it and who never experienced other job . so , people who like adventure , new experience and thing they 've never do before will most probably gain much more skill and way to get over problem than other people ever could do . since those are the most required characteristic in all activity of the society , those people have great chance to get succes in their life . even the attitude to take risk is a fundamental characteristic to be successful , because if you never try other thing , you will surely stay on your current state of life and you 'll never have the opportunity t get higher . moreover , take risk teach you to accept both winning and losing , that is the most important lesson one should learn in order to achieve any kind of objective . on the other hand , people may have good reason to not take risk and to not experience new thing , such a family , study an other thing that may be much important that have a successful life .
