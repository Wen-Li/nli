i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are two reason : busyness and lifestyle . the first reason why young people do n't use much time to their community is thier busyness . recently young people have le time than before . because the world change very rapidly , they have to learn a lot of thing to catch up the change . imfomation technology brought u internet which let u contact easily to the world network . then , we have to check flood of information nowadays , while it wa enough for u to check some specific information in old day . in adittion , recently young people have more complex job than before . they have to learn many thing to do their job in order to get enough money to live . the second reason is the change of young people life . many young people prefer to live in big city where do n't exist much community . so they do n't have any insentive to use time helping their community . it 's not rare case that they do n't know even the person who live in nextdoor . in conclusion , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .
