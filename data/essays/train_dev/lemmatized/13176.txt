i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . when i wa a high school student , i usually learned just fact . it wa a system of korean education . for example , in math class , i could learn a lot of information in short periord . however , i usually got low grade each test . because teacher changed style fo problem in each test , i could not use such factor which i learned before . that 's why i think to understand idea and concept is more important . next , if i understand idea and concept of problem , i can use them in our life time . for instance , i learned effective value of electronic product through my physic class . therefore , i can save utility fee because i can find which product are more effective than others in home . finally , if we know about concept and idea of some accident , unfortunate accident would never happen in the future . for example , if we just know factor of invation from other county , the invations would be face again because we did not know how to prepare them . obviously , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . we can use idea and concept in our life and prepare bad accident .
