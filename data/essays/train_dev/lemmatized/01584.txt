i agree with the statement a it is true that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the producer are using the latest trend of marketting , advertising and promoting their product . some of the common method used are - promotions , product launch offers , door to door selling , discounts etc.allt hese method motivate the consumer to purchase these good without even knowing what the good is actually made out of or what is the good actual function . advertisements make the product look really appealing and user friendly . for example an add for a car would usually include the car speeding away really fast and about the interior technology and luxury of the car . but what the add doe not tell the consumer is that speeding away cause accident , technology advance everyday , etc . a good add should be planned in a manner to show the use of the car that is how can it help not only you but other people aswell or even the environment . if the add for the car displayed the comfort , the space available in the car , etc it would be more usefull for the people . advertising is taking over the marketting sector tremendously . adds in form of banner , flyer , stall etc are providing all the information to the people and these method make sure that the consumer look at the product ina apositive manner . usually the quality , functioning and look of a product are quite different from what they appear on an add and this make the consumer suffer . some of the add provide u with the information we dont need and some of them diplay material which offend people culturaly , religiously or make them feel at a low status in the society . example - an add for an underwear would display the man wearing it and running behind a horse which is not true . i conclude this essay in regard to ensure people that they are aware of what they consume and how is it gonna affect them or others or wether it would still be of any help for the consumer in the future .
