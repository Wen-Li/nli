although sometimes we need specialized knowlege , i agree with the statement . it is important for u to have borader knowledge of many academic subject . the detail of my reason is a follows . sometimes knowing only one subject may narrow possiblities they choose in their life . for example , my friend wa studying english literature at his university . at that time he wa so interested in that and did not study other subject such a mathematics . now he is job-hunting and got stuck because english literature is not importatnt for the company which he want to get in . much broader knowledge is required by the company . also , i found very interesting to talk to people who know thing which i do not know . those people look very confident , and speak convincingly . i think the reason why they are so is connected to his/her extensive knowledge about so many different subject . knowing about many academic subject clearly make people attractive . finally when people are stuck in their life , what they can count on is themselves . they have to use their knowlege when they are in trouble . if peple have broader knowlege of many academic subject , they might be provided with more chance to get out of trouble . to conclude i agree with the idea that people should know many academic subject .
