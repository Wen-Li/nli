i agree . history ha teach u that successful people take risk . when people take risk they take the dificult path . a more complex and difficult path it in front of them . they are in front of the unknow . the unknow it a very difficult path becuase people do not know what it going to hit them next . important is when the people accomplish the unknow and make a use of it , they become a successful man . i want to become a successful man , and for that reason i need to take risk . the risk that im going to take is to go away to a different country and study there . a new world with out my famiy is going to shape my soul . im going to learn new thing and take new risk . i am trying to become a better man . i am trying to become a better person , and that is success for me . in the path of success there are many unknow trap . i have to learn from the trap and use them in my future life . i could stay in my house and do what i do well . i know i can be a successful man doing what i know already well . but i ca n't stay home and not try to accomplish my dream . i feel a successful person ha to accomplish treir dream and take new risk . this is the second time i take the toefl exam . i need 90 point and i got 89 . do you thing im going to stop there . no , i need to take risk and do the exam again and again until i pas . a successful person is someone who acomplish what ever they are looking for . when you want to accomplish something you have to take risk and do not stop ; you have to try new thing and do not stop until you accomplish your dream . my dream is to study in sydney and im not going to stop taking risk until i accomplish that . becouse that mekes me a successful man . that is what successful people try new thing . i believe people have only one life and they have to take the best out of it . for that reason there is a need of every successful man to take risk . thank you , emilio chalita
