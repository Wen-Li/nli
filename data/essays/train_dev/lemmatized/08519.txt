only those who take risk will be the successfull one . that is what one of my professor in spanish economy in my university in my university used to repeteadly say in class . he wanted u to be adventured , to have the courage to start up new bussineses and , basically , to take the risk to do something different . of course not everybody in class agreed with him , a such way of thinking and living ha defenetely pro and con , but in my oppinion being brave and taking risk in life is important in order to find true happiness and be succesfull . as previously stated , some of my colleague in class did not agree at all with the professor idea that taking risk is something necessary . they advocated that people should only do what they feel comfortable doing and what they are sure they are going to do well . therefore , not taking risk would somehow ensure your own happiness or sucess . it is true , they would argue , that it might not be the higher level of happines that you would be able to reach , but you make sure you are not going to fail in life . this wa infact the particular argument of one of my colleague , who just wanted to graduate in order to apply for a job in a public ministry and work there for the rest of her life . i thought that it wa certainly a safe decission , a she would never have to worry about loosin her job , but in my oppinion she would also renounce to her chance of achieving some higher professional goal . on the other hand , some other colleague used to say that taking risk is something very important in life , specially when it come to the economic sector , in which only those who are brave and not follow the rule are really succesfull and acomplish their goal . from my perspective , a key allegation to support this argument is the fact that important business leader around the globe are people who took risk at some point in their life , something which give a lot of food for thought . in a nutshell , having the courage to take risk is not something easy a of course there is a chance that you might not succeed , but the idea of always doing what is secured and not being able to find and try new thing is not atractive to me . i believe that my professor wa right and that , in particular in economics , taking risk is what make the difference .
