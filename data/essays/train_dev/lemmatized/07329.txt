i 'm sure i can say i totally agree with the statement . in fact it 's the reason why i choose a course of degree that cover a lot of different subject . i think one simple ( but not so stupid , i suppose ) reason is because studying a lot only one subject can easily become very very boring . i ca n't immagine to pas all the year of the college studying all the aspect and feature of the same subject over and over again . i 'm sure that this way one will become a great expert of the subject , but i think in the end he could even begin to hate it , unless he is totally fond of it . another good reason to achieve some knowledge in at least more than one subject is that you can never know what life 's deserving to you . one question : what if you ca n't find a job that 's concerned with that subject you have studied ? it mean that you are really unlucky , but it could happen . one extended knowledge in only one subject mean that probably you are very little competent in any of the other numberless subject that exist . with an academic preparation that cover a lot of different subject , you have at least medium-to-high skill in a greater number of them . so on your curriculum it 'll written that you have matched during your academic carreer a number of subject , meaning you could more easily find a job in a variety of environment ; after all , i think , you can achieve the real expertise in a field of knowledge only with the direct experience on the working place rather than with the academic study . i think this is true at least for what concern my biomedical engineering study , i 'm sure that the knowledge of chemistry , physic , mathematic , biology and medicine that i 'm learning , although they 're not totally complete will help me in future finding a possible job in a number of biomedical application .
