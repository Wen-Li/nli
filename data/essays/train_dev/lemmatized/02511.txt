`` young people enjoy life more than older people . '' that is a statement which i do not necessarily agree with , due to a variety of reason based on the sheer wording of the statement , a wellas other issue like the current circumstance of individual , their definition of `` enjoying life '' and what activity it involves . the very first issue that need to be addressed when discussing this statement is how we are to characterise the `` young people '' and the `` older people '' ? does young mean child , aged 1-12 while older is above that ? or doe young include all pre-adults and older include those beyond 21 ? the term `` young '' and `` older '' are very subjective and therefore greatly limit the credibility of this statement . in order to be a precise a possible , for the purpose of this response , let u assume that young people fall into the age bracket of one to twenty nine year of age , while older people are above thirty . the pleasure involved with enjoying life for young and older people vary tremendously , based on the stage of life in which they are . for instance , a child could derive immense pleasure from spending a day on the beach , simply building sand castle . on the other hand , an older person could derive even more pleasure from driving a million dollar sportscar . how can we measure the relative enjoyment received ? therefore , without being able to do so , it is impossible to make a claim that young people enjoy life more than older people . it is possible to argue that in general , the pleasure of the young are more simple and pure a they tend to be carefree , with little responsibility , especially when compared to older people who probably have job to go to every morning and a family to support . looking at it from this angle make it seem like young people have the better life . however , another way to look at it is that at a younger age , people tend to have more restriction placed on them , like parental rule , school code etc , while adult or older people are free from such restriction , to a certain extent , which give them unlimited access to enjoyment . older people also tend to have stronger financial capability that enable them to enjoy many perk of life that youngster do not have access to or can not typically afford . therefore , for the above stated reason , i can not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people because that involves having to make many assumption which are unrealistic . it all depends on the individual himself/herself , the circumstance in which they live , their like , dislike , their personality trait and so on . a child could enjoy his life just a much a an fifty year old adult . there is no limit that can control such a feeling and so agreeing with the statement is completely out of the question .
