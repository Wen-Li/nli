there are people who think the perfect way to travel is alone without a tour guide . however , i disagree with theirs opinion . i belive the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . becase by a tour guide , i can see more detail about the specific place and it make not time comsuming . first , with tour guide , i can get more impotant and detail information what i wanted . becase of guide 's explation , many people feel thier travel is more bountiful than alone trip without guide . for example , last summner , i went to kyungok-gung which wa the place of choson-dinesty in korea . first time , i went around alone . however , i found a group with a guide . soon , i participated in this group , i heard about many information of this place more specific . after tour , i could learn about my nation 's place and had more pride of my country . from a tour guide , travel make more plentiful . next , tour guide go around important place and specific cite . it can reduce time consuming . when i had europe travel alone , i wa very confuse be
