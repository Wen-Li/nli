fist of all i think will be useful an historic approach , let 's see how community influenced young people 's life in past time . we can consider the first half of 20th century , we can image that the society had a solid structure that ruled the way young people should behave . since they were child , because of the more spreaded poverty ( especially after the war ) and because the limited open-minded of the higer class ( that were often very influenced by old tradition ) , they were automatically scheduled in fixed school program or they were obliged to work at early age because of the lack of money , a a result the spare time wa considerably reduced . these condition were usual and widespread in common people and changed in some way young ' opinion through society . nowadays i think society ha reached an higer level of opportunity for young people , mainly because of the growth of whealtness and the reduced power of tradition . they most part of them can now attempt school and ha also a most variety of choce . i think it 's not true that nowadays young people do n't spent enough time to helping the society , well maybe not a much a in the past but i think that the quality of the time they spent is much higher , they are investing in themselves in order to be able to help the soviety in the future
