in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i agree with the issue stated above . the detials and example listed below state my view on this issue . its a known fact that car accomodate fewer people when comapred to bus and train . let u say for example there are 100 passenger for all these person in order to accomodate a bus requires 2 bus in case of a car the number is large say around 25 car . we have to use fuel in order to run these car and bus . compare the fuel that is wasted when we use 2 bus and 25 car the fuel wastage is heavy when we use car . so that we can save some fuel for future generation . another reason is that a more car are moving there will be more amount of pollution on the earth the pollution in turn effect health of many people . for example some city in italy celebrate one day in a year a car day on that day no car will be in the street the main purpose of this is to celebrate one day with out pollution which clearly state that riding more number of car will have a devastating effect on the environment and the fuel price are increasing rapidly it is very difficult for common people to maintain a car so they wo n't use a car frequently . the other reason is that in these present day global warming ha increased rapidly which mean the temperature on the earth surface is increasing rapidly this cause melting in polar ice cap if it happens so many of the part in this world will be submearged . of course car are not only the mean that are causing this however if we reduce the usage of car we can reduce it somehow . so in future government of various country will took necessary step to use fewer car . in conclusion car are not only the only mean for transportation but there are some other mean of transport which can be used by the public in effective way so fuel can be saved for the future generation . hence after twenty year fewer car will rum on the road .
