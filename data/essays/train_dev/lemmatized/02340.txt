nowadays it is quite difficult to answer such a question a we all live in very hard time . first of all , i would say that , a being a young person , it is quite more easy for u to enjoy life a nowadays everything is possible . our grand father had not even the half of what we have today , meaning that the range of possibility have largened . it is also due to the fact that at our age , they were fighting at war . several time my own grandfather told me this so i would realise the chance we have . secondly , i think this is so not to compare a we have totally other leisure time because of our age . by this , i mean that for instance , a younger one will enjoy doing a huge travel aroung the world while at the same time , someone older wo n't enjoy it a it mean to much trouble and moving all the time . also it is not true to state that we , being younger , enjoy life more than elderly people a we do n't have the same meaning of enjoying life . for me it could be reading book while for another it would be boring to do so . this mean the same for elderly people . however , if it is a question of travelling a whole year long or to practice some extreme sport , it is true that we take more advantage of life than anyone else whose working hard to raise a family . so i would say it is more a matter of what kind of schedule you have . if you are someone who ha plenty of time to do all the thing you like instead of having to earn money to survive , then it is true you enjoy life more than anyone else . but it is not a matter of age . in conclusion , i would say that i do not agree with the statement above . it is not a because you are younger than someome that it is obvious you are enjoying life far more . it is a question on how you oragise your time and with who .
