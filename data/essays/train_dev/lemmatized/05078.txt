as i am studying business management at the university in bayreuth i am specialized on one specific academic subject . but many people ask me what i would do if i do not get a job in a company or need knowledge of another subject to fullfill a new job . so is it better to have a broad knowlege of academic subject than to specialize in a specific one ? well , i do not think so . of course , if you have a broad knowledge of different thing you are not so much restricted to a certain job . you might know a lot of thing other people might not know . nevertheless , what kind of job will you get ? maybe you are able to work for a lot of different company or do something on your own but the job you can get will always be in a lower position a you are missing the necessary background information to fullfill the complete range of task of this job . one might say that if you are specialized on a certain topic it is hard to get another job . this might be true , but why should you even look for another job ? you are specialised on your subject because you think it is the best for you and you want to spend your lifetime with a job working in this special segment . if you have enough knowlege in your subject you will soon reach a higher position a you have all the necessary background knowlegde to fullfill your entire task . people who know more about their segment they are working in have more success and therefor live a happier life . as arthur lassen said : `` nothing will make you happier than to succeed in the thing you love . '' as a conclusion one ha to say that specialized knowledge will help you much more to find an apropriate job . even if a broad knowledge could help you in different part of your life , knowing more about your subject and going below the surface will lead to much more success and maybe even happyness .
