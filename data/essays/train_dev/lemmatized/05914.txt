people in general tend to do either one of these : enjoy or not enjoy life . it doesnt matter if the person is young or old , enjoying life is a matter of personal decision . comparing who enjoys life more , old people or young people , is a matter of opinion , because they ca n't be comparable . comparing a young life with an old one is like comparing green grape and purple greapes , eventhough they are from the same specie , their taste is totally different . young people enjoy activity that old people do n't enjoy anymore and viceversa , a young person wont enjoy some activties a much a an old person will , eventhough they are both human . old people tend to enjoy life in different way . some of the activity that are common for old people to do and enjoy include reading , listening to music , eating , sharing time with the family , learing , watching t.v etc . there are some activity that old people are not able to accomplish anymore , but they enjoy to watch it . the man next door , carlos , used to play soccer . now he is too old to play soccer but still he enjoys watching it , and believe it or not , he scream to the tv and cry if his team loses . carlos , a many other old men , enjoy more watching the soccer than playing it because his physical habilities are now limited by his age . many young people belive that old people cant enjoy their life because they cant do certain activity that they do and enjoy . this is an erroeus thought . old people enjoy their life just a young people enjoy thiers . that someone young like more to play soccer than to watch it doesnt mean that watching soccer should be boring . old people , like my grandfather , love to tell story and bring back memory of thing he did when he wa young . he like to go through his life and tell u , the grandchild , about it . eventhough he cant do those activity or trip anymore , he still enjoys to share them . young people enjoy their life just a old people enjoy thiers , but again , differently . someone around 17 year old might enjoy going to party , dancing , playing sport and hanging out with friend . while someone about 70 year old wouldnt enjoy that at all . martha , a friend of mine , used to enjoy going to party , hang ingout and dancing . today she is 65 year old , and she doesnt enjoy that anymore because she get tired and she usually belief that the music volume is too high . she now enjoys cooking , talking and reading . a young person can not judge who enjoys life more because they havent lived that old to comment on that . they dont know the perspective of an old person because they havent been there yet . meanwhile , old people are more likley to know by their personal experience wheather they enjoyed life more a a young person or a an old one and it is all matter of opinion . enjoying life is a matter of decision . one might decide to live a happy life while others might decide not to . it doesnt matter if one is young or old , enjoying life is a matter of personal decision . old people and young people , both can enjoy life to the same level only that by doing certain thing that one , either the old or the young , might think that is not something he or she would enjoy . so who enjoys life more , the old or the young people , is up to them , to u . it is up to every individual on how they decide to live their life .
