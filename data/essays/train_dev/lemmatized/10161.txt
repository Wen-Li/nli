i support this opinion that to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject . to learn one special subject sometime might lead to bright future , for example in term of invention in science . if someone who do n't devote oneself into one special subject , most of amazing invention wa not created . but in general we need to have broad knowledge . one reason is focuing on one particular subject make predjudes , and such kind of person can not make flat decision in proper manner . i 've learn a lot of thing thoroughout learning for example moral study , world history , asian history , japanese history , math , chemistry , physics , art , art history , japanese civil low , internatioal low or what ever . to learn broadly is important to realize `` truth '' between broad range of knoledge . this is just a very simple example , but we can learn ton of thing from the world history , for example , but if we do n't have any hi-leveled background in literature , we can not understand the way of thinking that we see on the text book of history . also , from leaning moral study and biology , somebody can find out heart of affection . to learn many thing would be very good opportunity to find our own tarent out . needless to say , if everybody can find out their own talent without seeng many thing , but it is not realistic . some scientist found out their talent or their way to live in the future , but it is too rare case . in general we human being should know a lot of thing to reach their own principal . this is not only for personal issue , but also for all people in the world . so i agree this opinion .
