some people may believe this is true , but i totally disagree with this statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . from my point of view , i think that young people do not enjoy their life more than the older people do . first of all , young people have le spare time than the older people , because they are young , they have a lot of working pressure and long working hour . they must strive for their future by hard working therefore , they do not have much spare time on what they are interested about . however , older people have le working responsibility and they have le working hour than the young people do , and many of them are retired form their work . they can spend more time to stay with family and do many hobby that they are intersted about . secondly . older people have more friend than the young people do . as time past , older people have been in society for so many year , so they have met a lot of people , they can have fun with so many friend . it is really a happy thing to stay with many friend , and there must be a pleasant atmosphere . finally , they older people have le living pressure than the young people do . many older people have already retired from their work . they did n't think much about how to keep their work and how to make more money . they have already done this when they were yong . now the only thing that they need to think about is that how they sepnd rest of their life to enjoy the wonderful thing in the world . they can travel to many beutiful place in their spare time , moreover they can visit their friend and have fun with them . they do not think much about work , and just playing for fun . however , the young people will still face the heavy work and the pressure from the society . so , they can not enjoy themself a much a the older people do . making my father and my grandmother a an example , my father work more than 40 hour a week to earn money to afford my study fee abroad , and he doe not have much time to have fun . however , my grandmother have a lot of spare time and le working pressure , so she can play a lot of funny staff with her friend . therefore , from the reason i listed below , i think that older people enjoy their life more than thhen young people do , because they have more spare time , more firends and le working pressure .
