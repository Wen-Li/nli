i believe that one that want to be succesful and that want to achieve many goal is the one that try new way , idea , and thing in life . without trying or experiencing new way , one will not learn or be successful in life , because one will not have the ability to achieve new thing , and technology would n't have been so great a it is now a day . for example , without scientist we would n't have way to study , and experiment to learn about in school . scientists would n't have learned and invented all those theory without trying and experimenting . another example would be if one want to achieve good business , one would n't achieve it without trying new way and idea to make his business grow bigger and better . another reason for this statement would be that without experiencing and trying new thing , technology would n't have been a great a it it these day , and people would just be doing thing they are use to , and would n't have the chance to experience new thing in life . technology is getting bigger and better everyday , with the help of scientist and all other people that try to make new thing and more developed thing from thing that were nothing . i completely agree with the statement , because a i said above without experiencing , trying , and learnig . nothing would have been invented , learned , or used now a day , and people would just be doing what they are used
