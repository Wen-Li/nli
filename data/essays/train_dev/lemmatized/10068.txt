everybody want to succeed in something . but for some people , success is more about keeping a certain kind of safe situation and not taking any risk to obtain what they want , for other people , risking and jeopardize an established situation is the essence of success and one could'nt make it without it . is taking risk and trying new thing the only relevant way to success ? on the one hand , one must acknoledge that , in spite of a more glamourous aspect than basically choosing for safety , taking risk remains by definition . .. risky indeed . taking risk or trying new thing might lead to sucess , but can also often make one 's situation worse than before . the statement should n't so be applied in any circonstance : take the example of someone who is burdened with a gambling problem . such a person will often loose all his money on the very justification that he can win tremendous amount of money by taking a small risk ! trying new thing doe n't implies success at any time too . one good example is the franchising phenemenon that keep on spreading around the fast food restauration service . experience have shown that using an established brand and well known product can be far more interessant for fast food restaurant . customers may be scared of new thing , and introducing new product doe n't necessary mean being successful . but on the other hand , no one can be really succesful without taking any risk . if someone only follows established footstep without adding any new thing , it is sure that his fate wont be extraordinary too . many of the `` success story '' one could heard about are mainly grounded on an invention , or on a risk taken : bill gates became the richer person in the word by creating microsoft windows , fosburry won all the high jump competition by using `` fosburry '' technique . .. galileo himself took the risk of claiming that the earth go round the sun while nobody else at his time dared believe it ! to conclude , i would say that to succeed , taking risk is essential but must remains a calculated thing , keeping in mind the fact that loss can occur , and dealing with this possibility .
