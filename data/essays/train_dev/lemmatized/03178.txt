i do n't agree with the idea that the best way of traveling is to join a group led by a tour guide for several reason . first of all , no matter how many people are contributing to the group , hiring a tour guide is always a lot more pricy than traveling by yourself or with a friend or two . indeed , i find these tour a tourist trap because the tourist pay double or triple price when they visit museum with the ` knowlegable ' tour guide , compared to the amount they pay at the door . for example , i went to moscow last year and at the kremlin palace i noticed that the visitor are given two option , either you can hire a guide at the door for an outrageous price or you buy an audio guide for only three dolars . is n't it obvious which one make more sense ? some people might argue that a tour guide ha a lot of information about the city that is being visited , so it is essential to be led by one . however a well-writen guide book would compensate the need for a tour guide and these guide book could easily be obtained from the bookstore or even tourist information office . recently these guide book are being written by local of the place and they contain all the valuable information that a visitor may need . furthermore they are being updated a new place open or anything change in the place . also traveling with a group ha the inevitable disadvantage of moving a a group . despite of the fact that each individual ha there own interest and their own preference , the group ha a certain schedule for the entire trip and mostly it is required to follow this schedule . this requirement led people to see place that they have no interest in and in a way it turn the trip into an unpleasent event .
