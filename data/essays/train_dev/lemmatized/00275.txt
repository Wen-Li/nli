i agrees that it is better to board knowledge in one specialized specific subject . they are many reason to claim for the second option because to have board in one specialized subject we can know the deep concept in that subject . i did not prefer boarding knowledge of many academic subject can not bring much concept in all subject . when we r specialized in one subject we can apply the concept in the real world . by studying about the different subject some people cannnot know the concept in their aware subject . most of the people are intersted to do specialization in one subject because some willl show more interst in their specialized subject . if people is forced to do the academic subject he will show the preference in this intresting subject . but knowing of the different subject come may confused by the concept they did not know the concept is specified in that subject . doing job in one concerd subject is our aim . by studying about one specilized subject one can grasp many idea form that subject . by know tooo may subject is waste because we can not grasp the concept in different subject . the familiar in one subject make theman a scientist . in conclusion , doing the specialised in one subject is better . by knowing one specialised subject we can challenged to the real world by our concept . we can tackle the subject more and more . we can apply the fundamental and we can invent many many kind of concept in that field . so for these reason i support specializes in one subject is better .
