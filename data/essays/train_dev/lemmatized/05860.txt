cars are among the greatest invention of the time . acting a a product of modern technolody , car have greatly enhanced our mobility . whenever we want to visit friend , watch a play , or take our child to school , they 're always there . aware of all these benefit , i still believe that the number of car will greatly decline in two decade . so serious is the environmental problem on earth that we 're forced into looking for their origin . cars are mainly responsible for the air pollution . hardly can anyone find pure blue sky in a car-intense city . being regarded a of great use , we fail to recognize how many ton of poisonuous gas they produce everytime we drive on the road . we have no choice but to limit the use of car , or else our descendant will only have access to blue sky in the photo and their parent ' memory . meanwhile , take a look at the traffic jam in big city . most people live in noise , work in noise and die in noise . how many people are in the hospital , concerning ear problem because of the noise ? numerous . how many life are deprived of by traffic accident ? countless . who is the killer ? the car . cars are so dangerous that we 're doomed to reduce their number in the future . with the advance of civilization , there will be fewer car in the future . while some people still live under the illusion that car are somehow helpful , pollution , noise and accident are already too high a price we paid for the use of this transportation . if car are not limited , the blue sky , the clean atmosphere , the sense of security of people , will all become a golden memory .
