we are living in a consumistic and individualistic century . that statement is the point from where i think we have to start to reflect about this topic . people are more interested in their success and in their own world rather then in a social and environment problem . in my opinion , if the coscience of the humanity is not going to change immediatly we will arrive soon to a really dramatic increase of car number . i sayed `` dramatic '' because the consequence of this increase would be , of couse , an increase of pollution in the air and the major risk of hilness for all the eco-system . in a few thousand of year we could arrive to destroy all the eco-system and to end life in our world . this doe n't seem scared too much people today because they are too egoistic and in thouch only with their own personal problem . as a futur designer i wish wa possible a change of beahviorurs 's direction . i 'm really intersting in sustainability and i will be focused in my futur work to project eco-products in respect of the environment where we live . in particular i think electric car design should be improved and take more in consideration . it 's important perhaps think about how a designer can grabb the attention of the consumer on a sustainability problem . we have to organize some publicity compaigns to make the consumer more conscious about the problem . i think there is a tiny possiblity the world and the people who life in this world are going to change . and is for this tiny possiblity that i 'm going to work a , i hope , a succesful designer . in italy we say : `` hope is the last emotion to die '' . i
