in general , people have different learning method . for example , some student tend to memorize the fact without understading the idea and concept to keep it simple . however , i think it is important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact for three reason ; fact come from the idea and concept , it is easy to remind when you forget the fact , and this method brings student to improve independent studying skill . fact that people usually accept is occured after the idea and the concept . not a thing just happens . there are step before it happens . for example , if i have a car accident , there must be idea of drink and driving driver or me acrossing the road ignoring the light . similar to this , fact come from step , idea and step to be here to believe . as well , it is easy to remind the fact when we forget it . if student understand all the idea and concept , it is not a problem to remind the fact by taking step backward to where the fact come from . for example , when i took my math exam , i could not remember the formula . i tried to think of the process how the formula came from and finally i could make the formula which wa exactly the same a i looked for . therefore , understanding idea and concept help to identify the fact . lastly , understaning idea and concept bring student to improve their independent studying skill . if the student do not know a fact or find a new fact from the idea and concept , they could continue to research for it . from this progress , they could expand their knowledge also share with others . although many student tend to learn and memorize the existing fact , i think they should understand idea and concept first because the fact come from them . in addition , it is easy to remind the fact and it could improve student ' independent studying skill . therefore , i think student shou
