i agree with the statement . the reason are maybe not a straightforward a they seem and i would also argue that depending on the person , different reason apply . for the most part though i think that education on behalf of the parent but also the teacher need to instill a sense of social responsibility in a child . the need to help others that were not a fortunate or the community a a whole ha to be developed . our education system ha increasingly become a job training center where many of the aspect needed to be a leader in other setting than on the job have been neglected . while i think there are difference between urban and suburban community , you often get the sense that people are only focused on their little microcosm . the family is much more detached from the community than it maybe wa a couple of decade ago . children are unlikely to feel they need to help the community if their family is not an active and integrated part of one . young people tend to have a whole host of attractive alternative to spend their time . whether that mean sport , meeting up with friend or just spending time infront of the television . lastly , the financial situation of the family might also require the child to take on a job to chip in . helping out in the community generally is voluntary and hence , unpaid . bottomline i think it is too easy to just blame it on the young . the environment also play a large role in whether or not a young person will spend time helping in their community .
