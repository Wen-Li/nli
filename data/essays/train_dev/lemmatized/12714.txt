`` the more you know the better '' . i do agree with the statement that a person must enrich his knowledge with many academic program to enable him to achieve a greater level of success and finally be a well educated person . a person who is familiar with a number of different subject or rather topic , is more able to communicate with the world around . furthermore , the individual will practice and enjoy the essence of the material he studied when it come to implementing it in real life situation . to start with , a a fact , a person 's area of knowlege is unlimited , people can study alot of different subject , if they have the will to do so . a person for example , who enriches his area of knowlege will be able to reach new sophisticated level in life . the world around u in dynamic , it change rapidly and people are not aware of that . a broad level of knowlege will help the person coupe with such change , allowing him to understand and communicate with different people from different area of the world . knowlege is not only limited to only particular subject . moreover , when you study a subject and do understand all important information a well a the idea behind the information given , then when it come to real life situation and you have to implement what you studied , the feeling that you have achieved something great will cross your mind , and so you will be more keen to actually continue what you are doing inorder to achieve the greatest . to sum up , i beleive that all individual are able to develop the area of their knowledge and to widen their horizon about the the many thing taking place in life , because at the end it is you that will benefit from becoming successful . learning is never to late .
