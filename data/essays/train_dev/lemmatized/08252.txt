importance of understanding ideas and concepts to learning the facts yes , i do agree with the statement that idea and concept are more to be stressed upon than learning the fact . the `` idea '' are one individual 's . and `` concept '' are formed on the basis of the depth of research on a topic or a statement . concepts are the basic and easiest way to approach any diversity of topic . it help to comprehend the subtle nuance conveyed in the text . once formed they can not be shifted into a new frame unless otherwise proved through year of regular study . as an example newton gave three theory of motion after proved and approved by other scientist also . einstein thought why an apple fall on the earth downwards from the top of a tree . he did not accept this a a fact but worked on it and improvised a mathematical approach to it . it wa an idea that wa hitting his mind and at last he came over with a genuine proof for it . '' ideas give birth to new invention '' . it is best said by some body . it is just important that how seriously we study on the topic and how far we prove them to be correct in a more logical way . learning fact is least important . it is simply getting the thing into your head without giving a thought to it . it is called `` cramming '' . yes , one must be aware of the fact but reasoning is equally important . one must not learn but abserve them , analyse them and reason them so hat the same previously learnt concep can be applied without any panick . ideas and concept are the basis to learning the newer and inventing the newer technology . facts can be created a many time a we desire from it basic root . the beautiful boulevard of life is full of new experience that further form the learning or a concept . just enjoy the new experience giving a logical thought to it .
