different people can have different opinion about this topic . some will go for understanding the idea by keeing their point of view a - learning can be made easier by understanding the idea . but some consider learning fact are more important then understanding the idea . considering from my point of view - i totally concede with the statement `` it is more important for student to understand the idea and concept then it is for them to learn the fact '' . i endorse my view by saying that `` learnig in depth can result in more innovation '' . it is very important for a student to understand the basic fundamental of the problem . suppose if a student is solving the problem related to mathmatics and he is doing calculus , then it would be quite difficult for the student to solve the problem by just remembering the fact there , instead if he know the basic formula and method use those formula according to the question it would be easier to solve the problem . in the second place `` to be practical '' it is necessary to have full fleged knowledge about the subject and the concept behind that. , and scientist have proved that . they may not be able to find new innovation by just learnig fact . if we will run only after fact and learn them how we will be able to grow our mind to create mental agility , to explore ourselves , to think beyond other 's point of view , it is very important to have greater and deep knowledge of the concept . by knowing the idea afer the situtation it becomes easier to have a command over that . so i would say that student should learn the fundamental behiend every problem , because it will help in creating their mind , power of thinking , abilty to take quick decision , flexiblity to adapt to different situtations , because the are the backbone of the nation and in their hand lie the fate of the nation
