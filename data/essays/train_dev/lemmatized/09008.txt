i agree with the statement . economic rule changed a lot during the last sixty year . the arrive of television and the expansion of mass medias in general brougth to a different consideration of people forming a society : we 're no more considered a a mass of different personality who must share rule to coexist , but also and very often only a a mass on consumer who have to buy the same product . this brougth to a challenge to convince consumer to buy a certain product instead of another one . to do this , advertisement try to make product seem much better than they really are , and expecially better than the direct challenger . a typical example that come in my mind referres to the michelin tyre advertisement . all over the world we can see advertisement stating that michelin is the best producer for tyre and where is possible , the advertisement explains that michelin in much better that bridgestone , that is another tyre producer , directly challenging michelin . in the formula1 championship , that is a race car championship , michelin and bridgestone face each other directly , since they are the only producer allowed to build those special kind of tyre that are required for formula 1 . in the 2005 indianapolis formula 1 grand prix , michelin and bridgestone equiped a different number of car , a always . during the racing weekend , a lot of michelin tyre explosed , and only them : no bridgeston tyre had problem . because of this problem , no car using michelin tyre could challenge on sunday , during the race . only car using bridgestone tyre were allowed . that wa a perfect example that michelin is not the best tyre producer a the advertisement stated . michelin , after the problem created , had to refund the cost of the ticket to the spectator , paid for the damage occurred to the team and first of all , had a huge image damage , since every consumer could't forget what happened that year in indianapolis .
