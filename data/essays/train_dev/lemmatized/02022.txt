i do n't think that it 's important for student to understand idea and concept a compared to learn fact . i think idea and concept help the student in learning in their intial class only . in my opinion , the fact are more important to learn a they are used in long run . for example , i wa a student of the physic class . as part of our course structure we have numerous derivation to understand the idea behind a particular fact . at that time i used to cram all the derivation in order to get good mark . but now at this point of my age i can just able to remember what wa the fact not the idea or the concept behind it . like i remember that what is the density of water but i do n't know how to calculate it . so , i belive that student should more concentrate on fact than understanding ides and concept .
