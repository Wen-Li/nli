i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , mainly because today there are a lot of option available for younger generation for enjoyment . young people can get involved in various adventure sport . they can do scuba diving , trekking without getting too much worried about their health and fatiuge . however i do n't contend that older people do not get involved in adventure sport , but how many older people do we know who go for adventure sport a compare to the number of young people who participate in that . their are various night club that are specifically made for younger generation , which like to chill out there after long working hour . and the number of young people their is more their a well . every generation is more advanced than the previous generation in term of technology and variety . younger people have greater market in front of them , where they can buy thing according to their own need . market ha become so competitive and shoulder that are responsible for innovation , have become youth centric . today 's generation ha access to various thing that are now made primarily considering the youth of today . manufacturers of bike give advertisement of a youth riding attractive bike just to capture attention of younger generation . and seeing adverisments like this and buying the same product make life more enjoyable . additionally , younger generation ha access to all the form of enjoyment that older generation ha . some people might state that older people have more time to enjoy life , however , i am of the opinon that it 's the quality time that matter . who ha n't heard the word : ` work hard and party harder ' . in the end i would like to conclude that younger people enjoy life more than the older people a the resource and option available to older generation are limited .
