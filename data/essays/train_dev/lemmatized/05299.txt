i certainly agree to the statement and there are conspicuous example which make me believe this way . firstly it is anchored in the `` nature '' of advertisement that they make product seem much better a they are . you must only ask yourself some quite simple question . what are the intention of the advertisement making people ? why are there advertisement in nearlly every place all over the world ? and so on . the explanation can be introduced by only one single word : `` money ! '' . do n't belive advertisement have been evolved to inform people about the best product , they have been evolved to make you buy a product without regarding it quality . there are several example . for instance if you want to buy a fat-burner you will find a lot of different product all promising achievement in a very short period of time , but if you try them out there will be nearly no achievement at all . moreover the advertisement ha fulfilled it purpose , because you have bought the product . an other example is advertisement for cigaretts . think about the notorious marlboro-country and ask yourself if you really feel like a cowboy enjoying the lonelyness and endlessness of the prarie when smoking a marlboro . this example lead to the next paragraph . advertisements want to present their product in the most typical way with refernces to the consumer . let me explain this a little bit more . would a company which sell tuning part for car let play the main role of there spot by a gay guy . definately not ! there would by promiscuous woman a well a `` real-men '' representing the product because it would be more convincing to the people buying these product than a gay guy . so the advertisement exists in a reciprocal relationship with the consumer . this is necessary if the advertisement making people want to reach their goal . to make you buy their product . as a conclusion i would like to assert that the advertisement which represents it product objectively doe not exist .
