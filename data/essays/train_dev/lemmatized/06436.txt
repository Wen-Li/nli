i can see no reason to object it . but i would like to make it clear that this issue is limited to most of advanced country . it is needle to say that the infrastructure and facility is not still prepared in most of developing country . even if the condition is getting better , it is far away from discussing in this point . any way , there are three principal reason to support that i completely agree . firstly , other transportation system such u a train and a plane have been developing in the matter of time and also in the matter of money . now , the number of train is available everyday . of course about a plane , too . gradually , the cost ha become cheaper than before . actually , i could fly to u.s by 300 dollar . it is much ceaper than before . secondly , from environmental point of view , people have changed their mind into preserving clean air . this is largely due to the fact car have influenced badly . lastly , the family structure ha been changing . for instance , there many family which do not have their child in it . this mean they do not need their car to go away in more safer way . i know the importance of car . however , i would like to stress the advantage of environmental problem . to sum up , i agree this idea .
