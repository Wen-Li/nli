i totally agree with the statement because i consider if people did n't take their chance and take risk trying to gain something else in reward the world would not be the one we know today . if hundred of year ago a crazy guy would n't have taken the risk and tried finding a different route to get by ship to india we would probably still be living in tree and hunting animal to obtain food and the rest of the world would still believe the earth is n't round . or if the wright brothers would n't have risked their life a well a their pride trying to invent a revolutionary way of transportation based on bird it would still take for u week or even month to travel from america to europe . that 's why i think people should always be willing to take their chance and not be afraid to risk something that in the end might bring an enormous bennefit not only to them but to others a well . we have always feared what we do n't know and that 's why normally we try only doing what we know to do well , but in my opinion we are the only creature on earth with the ability to learn something new every day and evolve thanks to those knowledge . if we have that possibility we might a well try to gain something from using it , or else there would be no difference between a person and an animal . i also consider that a peson that doe n't do anything new in his life and always try to do the same thing will end up by not liking what he doe . and even though that person might be successful in life doing what he doe it wo n't matter because in the end he wo n't be a happy person which is , in my personal consideration , even more important that success . in conlcusion i agree with the fact that it 's necessary for u to take risk , we even take them every day when we get up , but it 's only a matter of luck to gain something in return if we not only risk something but also try our best while doing any activity .
