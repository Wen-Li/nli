to be successfull in my opinion succes is not same for all people . it can change in which are it is gained and people have different feeling about the area which they are successfull in . however ; for me it is true that successfull people can do the best while they are trying new thing and if they take risk although the area which the success is gained change from person to person . this is true because of three reason . first of all , successfull people used to working and studying and they wonder what happened around them . thus , they try different thing which they wonder . for instance , the engineer of a big company always try to find new product to sell . in other saying , the company is big because of successfull engineer . the engineer are successfull because they are not doing the usual work in company . they are trying to find new area which they are not already know how to do well . secondly , successfulll people are interested in everything . they read different kind of book , they watch different type of programms and a a result of this , they know so much about different are . so they can find varios type of innovation . if we look at the research in the world , people who have different looking to the problem or the event are generally successful in their job . thirdly , successful people try to solve problem with different solution . the person who ha a second solution for a problem usually successfull . this is because of their decides . a person who ha a second or third solution mean that he or she can take risk at least one time to solve the problem . take what i have mentioned above into consideration , success come with trying new thing , with interested in different area and with taking risk .
