i disagree with the point that understanding idea and concept are more important than learning fact . some people more concentrated to the idea and concept when they learn about new thing and they think learning is done , but there are most important fact what we learn about . for example , i just start to attend at a church and start learning about bible . if i just study about what god say and meaning of the word , i do n't think i can learn about god and what is more important , and also it will be difficult to have strong believeness . without learning fact just understaing the ieads and concept are useless and after a certain time we will forget what what we wa learning . for example , when we learn about our history , if we just concentrated the concept and idea in the subject , we never learn about our curture and our emotion . when we are reading a newspaper and if we just read about idea , we can not see what is important effect or the fact what the article want to teach u or what is the reason that this matter have to be in the newpaper . when we learn a second language in school , if we learn about just vocabulary and grammar in that language , we do not have good reason to learn the language , we should be spaking to the other people in this language , that is most important fact that we should learn about new thing . if we can not speak to other people in the language it is useless at as a result , learning about fact and understand the point is most important than just understanding idea and concept .
