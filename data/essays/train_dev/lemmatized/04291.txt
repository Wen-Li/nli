if the `` success '' mean economical or scientifical success ( big money or new deveropment ) , i agree with the statement . recently , the people 's life becomes more convinient because of the development of industry , and more homogenius in the mean of infomation because of the progress of communication technology like internet . so relatively comfortable life can be achieved by the routine task , or work . it mean new chalanges are not necessory for common life , so many people seem not to like trying new matter . the chalanges is more impotant now ! in the field of science , new result only derived from new chalanges or idea . already known work only make already known result . in the economical sense , also new chalange sometimes make big success . but economical chalanges always bring some risk and easily become gamble , so we should manage our total risk . but l think it is also important to keep the traditional matter , theory and caltures . they can be the basis of new one . and we can avoid some failure and accident from previous one . so in the mean of `` importance '' , or `` important people '' , i can not choose one from these two .
