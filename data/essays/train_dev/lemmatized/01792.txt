yes i agree with the statement , it is more important to understand the idea concept of a particular thing . because it is more important for any one to have an clear idea about that particular thing to work on it . i would explain with an example , when i am doing my first semester of my under graduation i use to do my assignment with out understanding them and with out any clear idea about the topic given . i use to submit my assignment in this way only . when my examination is nearing , i dont have any idea about the topic because i did n't work on them clearly . because , i thought just submitting my assignment in time would help me in the examination , but when i appear in the exam i could not do well because i dont have any idea of the concept of the work . this make my grade to be lower . when the next assignment is given i used to work on it for a long time and tried to get a clear idea about the topic and made my assignment . this helped me a lot in the final examination to succeed and got a better grade . this is because understanding the concept of that made me to do well in the examination . another example is that , when an experiment is explained in an class room it is again asked to make the same one in laboratory . i used to neglet to concentrate on the laboratory class . when i used to revise the topic covered after so many day , i used to forget the particular thing expalined in the class room and i again should see the particular professor for the left over one . if i would have performed the paritcular thing in the laboratory i would get the clear idea and the concept of the topic and would have remembered the thing in that topic . so i conclude that it is important for student to understand the clear concept than it is for them to learn fact because understanding the idea and the concept of the topic would do more than fact .
