successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i completely agree with the statement above . albert einstein quote , `` try to be a man of value and not a man of success . '' success follows people who are innovative in their idea and are expressive to present them freely . albert einstein never set out to come up with the `` theory of relativity '' . it wa his desire to explore and question every aspect of everyday life which brought him the fame to be the inventor of `` theory of relativity '' . constant change is the human nature . and the people who bring about this change in an evident manner are the one who are ready to think out-of-the-box . centuries ago , everything wa done on paper , story to account , medicine to religion etc . today , everything is written on tape drive and stored electronically . thanks to mankind , who wa constantly looking for option to change . we went from pen to typewriter and then to computer and to super computer today . the numerous invention made in every field of life are all because some one somewhere wa thinking beyond the way which they know how to do well . it wa the quest to do thing better and add value to what is being done today , which led to new discovery . take an example of bill gates , he is successful today because he started microsoft , a windows operating system which sits in almost every household today . his desire to do something new brought him this fame . and his quest to constantly bring about the change to the world is keeping his success intact . in summary , it is seen all around , people who have taken the risk to do something new are the one who got success and fame .
