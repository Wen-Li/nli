travel in a group with a tour guide is gaining poularity nowadays and some people do consider it the best way to travel . however , it is not for me . i am a person who belief in self-discovery and i like discovering place on my own and at my own pace . for me , travel is a discovery and making friend with local people , getting to know them and living their culture is the true experience of travel . i believe in taking out time to understance the cultural nuance of the new place and attempt to comprehend the true culture of every new city that i visit . i have heard quite a few story from people who had a fantastic time in group travel with tour guide . i myself have sent my parent to such trip when they come to visit me a they are old and having a tour guide is the easiest way for them to have a comfortable , safe trip in a foreign land . but , for me , with age on my side right now i do n't feel the need for a guide . i believe that when you travel to someplace new you should be in that mood - willing to explore , try new thing and meet new people . traveling on your own give you the opportunity to converse with the local people and the `` authentic '' story that you hear from them are incomparable to the pre-planned , oft-repeated stale information from a guide . so far my experience with a group led by a tour guide ha been fairly limited . it wa only on one occasion that i opted for such an arrangement and that wa on my trip to kerala in india . the group wa well organized , our itinerary fixed and lot of place planned for in the short trip . i do n't think i got the real flavor of the state a the pace wa too fast for me to understand the diversity and the traditional value the country is so famous for . there are benefit of a group-travel . but , personally i am all for travelling on my own . i like to set the pace of my trip , relax on some day and explore a lot on some other day and most importantly , get the true flavor of the country and not just visit the so-called `` point '' of tourist-attraction that group travel arrangement usually entail .
