i completely agree with the statement that sucess come to those who take risk and walk the path le taken by . numerous stoires revealing how great discovery and invention took place by the people who went on to take risk . to state a couple of example i would like to start with neil armstrong , the first astronaut , who took the risk of going into the space and walking on the moon . man had never thought that could ever reach moon but it wa made possible because some body thought differently and then went on to risk his life for that thought . otherwise man kind would have never been able to reach the moon hadent he had the faith in the thought that it could be achieved . another example that can be cited supporting my thought would be that of j.l baird the inventor of television , he thought that by emitting electron on a surface through a cathode ray tube image can be formed , it wa only then that he could develop something which laid the base of the modern tv , he thought differently , and then put his thought into practice , it could have been dangerous but then the development of the modern tv would not have been possible . mahatma gandhi the father of the indian nation used the most unique method of `` ahimsa '' or non violence to gain independence , nobody thought of it , using non violence against violence , wa unique , he risked his life to that thought and went on to gain independence for india . thus i would like to conclude my essay by saying that you have to think out of the box to be successful , normal and conventional everybody think and doe , but what click is a unique idea , what sell is a unique idea and for that you have to think and do apart from the league and the people who do that are hero or weave success story .
