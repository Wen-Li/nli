for a long time ago , i visited europe with my family in a group led by a tour guide . although my family payed a great deal of money , we enjoyed the travel since the travel wa convenient and helpful for increasing our knowledge . like my case , people should notice that the best way to travel is in a group led by the tour guide . first of all , since the tour guide provides enough knowledge and information to people , it is the best way to travel in a group led by the tour guide . there are two purpose of travel . one is to have a rest and the other is to earn information related coutries or place that people travel . when people travel to acquire knowledge , they need professional guide a it is hard to get information about certain place by their own power . in contrast , when people travel without the tour guide , they will sightsee without getting information and this will not be beneficial for increasing their knowledge . safety of the tour guide also make the tour guide more attractive . the foreign country or place that people have not visited can be dangerous to people since they can not know factor that can be harmful . therefore , people who travel alone sometimes get in trouble . for example , i heard news that one traveler who visited the foreign country alone wa kidnapped . thus , to decrease the risk of travel , people should travel in a group led by the tour guide that ha been guided people for a long time and ha bountiful knowledge about the dangerous factor , so the tour guide can make the traveler to travel safely . finally , the traveler do not need to concern about their travel plan , if they travel in a group led by the tour guide . when people plan to travel alone . they have to consider various factor . they have to arrange hotel that they will stay and they have to purchase airplane ticket . also , they have to plan their schedule and choose where to visit to see . however , people who travel in a group by the tour guide do not need to worry about these factor because tour guide company plan everything . what the traveler have to do is just to pay money . to sum up , the best way to travel is to travel in a group led by the tour guide because people can earn knowledge properly and travel safely . in addition , people do not have to endeavor to make plan .
