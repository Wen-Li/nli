according to my opinion , the statement that succesful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know is the one open for debate . curosity ha become a driving force which led to the new invention and discovery from century . man from the time when he hunted the food than today when all the latest technology are available . in this essay , i will first analyse ideology of succesful person and whether optimism and audacity is the only criterion for becoming succesful and base my suggestion in favour of being optimistic . if we turn the page of the history , one thing we find common in all the greatest leader is the quality of being optimistic . they do not hesitate to take any audacious decision and exploring new thing . take for example , george washington , america first president , he always showed enthusiasm in trying out new thing . the other example is abrahim lincoln , a person who had reached the great height in his carrear by taking risk and experimenting with new thing . i also support the point that , if we do those thing we already know we can do those task more accurately and with le effort . however , this doe not increse our effecincy . think of the primitive world , where our ancestor were very good in hunting and if they have never tried out of breaking the old ritual of hunting and started living like civilised people we could have not reached the apex on which we are today . obstacles are are the milestone which show u the path of success . while overcoming obstacle and taking new kind of risk people become stronger and discover new limit of success . i would like to conclude by stating that , if u want to reach the apex of success than make yourself accustomed with different kind of risk and obstecle and in all conscience u will become succesful
