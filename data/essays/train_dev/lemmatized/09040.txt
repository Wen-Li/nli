young people are le helping their community than before . that is a fact , they do not spend enough time helping . in my opinion that is a sad fact and their are two major reason from this . nowadays , we live in a selfish socity where capitalism is taking the biggest role . i talk about capitalism because in my opinion it is not only an economic fact but it is also a social one . for instance , the game that my 17 year old brother play are much more different that the one i used to play when i wa younger . he play video game that are in my opinion `` selfish '' . in those game he play by himself most of the time . so there is no socialisation with other young people . this fact doe not teach how to share thing with others and specially how to help because they teach that helping others is a weakness . people are independent younger than before . they do not rely on their parent for a long time a before . most of the 16 year old child dream of leaving home and having their own appartment . in my culture , the moroccan one , familly is really important . but i see that young people are loosing this value more and more . they tend to leave their parent , the `` first community '' the have been in . they are selfish and they do not like to share thing and help others . we are actually fasting for ramadan . during this special occasion , all the familly come together and everyone have to prepare something to eat for instance . braking the fast have always been something that we all live together . but those last year , i see that my younger cousines doe not want to share it with u . it 's more an obligation for them than a happy event to share all together . it emerges from this discussion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help and be with their community . that is an awefull fact but that is the truth .
