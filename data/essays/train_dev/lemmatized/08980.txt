being young or being older influence the decision , personal character and the way of life , a well . by statement the way of life , i refer not only type of living but also the enjoment of that life . do young people enjoy life more than the elderly ? i agree with that statement , because youngster are more enegetic , not stessful about the future , and not reluctand to experince new thing . on the other hand , due their valuable experinces , senior citizen could have chance to enjoy more than youth . firstly , the younger people , due to very biological and hormonal feature of their body , are very enegetic , which could not be compared to energy of older people . being energetic give youngster a chance to do too many thing within very short period of time . on the other hand , elderly even there are too many energetic old people , can not due the same amount of thing within the same period and also within the same quality . secondly , young people do not worry to much about their prospective future . of course , they have some kind of concern about their career and study but it is better to think about the end of the life like somehow elderly do . it is more probable to the elderly to feel deppressive due to feeling old . finally , younger people do not have any opposition against living and experiencing new thing , such a new taste , new adventure and even new friend . in contrast , senior citizen generally prefer to live in peace rather than in adventure . they have more concern to continiue the stablity of their life , which make them somehow conservative , a well . in addition , we should not forget that due to their valuable expereinces , elderly in some case can enjoy the life more . for instance , their experinces allow them to know what to do in which time . i hold the view that younger people enjoy life better and more than elderly .
