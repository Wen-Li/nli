i disagree with the statement made , i strongly feel that young people do spend some time by helping their community . they also play a primarilly role in this issue thereby doing the work ethusiastically . primarily , i would state that nowadays the young people are advised in their school and college to their community to grow & they give lot of valuble suggestion based on their experience . thus the young people with this information use their creativity to help the community . furthermore , the community & their organisation have started conducting plenty of meeting then previously done . thus they also state the current problem in the community and nurture the future generation with valuble suggestion based on their experience and they also encourage the young people to paricipate in these issue . consider an example , which i have experienced during my young day . once there wa meeting arranged by our community and a wa problem stated regarding helping of disabled people in the community and adult gave some money to help them . but we young people helped these disabled people by helping them to cross the road , and also assisted them whenever the needed some help . in addition to the example mentioned above , we also had another accasion where we were given some job by the community member , i.e they had problem regarding the increase in pest like mosquito & we helped them by pouring sand in place where water tends to stagnate , a stagnant water is the main cause for breeding mosquities . finally , i state that nowadays young people spend enough time to helping their community than done before . thus i conclude by saying that the young people play a primary role in the developement of a community
