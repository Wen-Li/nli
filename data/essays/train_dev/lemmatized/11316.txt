nowadays most product are advertised in order to be well selled . but do advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ? first an advertisement is made to sell a product that could be brought back to the shop if it doe not suit the customer , who might dispise the brand and not only the product if he is unhappy with it . therefore it ha to aim at the good buyer . it need to describe the product in a positive way , of course , but in a honest way . but many people do not really care . and a some advertisement make a hole story about a useless tool , it competitor have to go further to make their product look better . for example , we first got `` the wash powder that washed white '' . then a couple of year later a people got used to this statement , we got `` the wash powder that wash whiter than white '' , whitch doe not mean any thing at all . what is whiter than white ? coluche say , in one of his scketchs , that he wa afraid to use one of them because he wa afraid it would make his clothes disapear ! but a people buy product with such an exagerated advertisement , i think it encourages the brand to make them . another thing that make advertisement make product seem much better than they really are is that everything about the product that is not good , all it downside , are only written in so tiny letter that nobody can read them . that partially hide the truth about the product and , of course , make it more attractive . for example , when you see an advertisement about an internet connexion for 19 euro a month you are happy . but when you sign in and you notice it is 19 euro a month only for the first three month and then the price double , you are disapointed . that is why i totally agree with this statement : `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ''
