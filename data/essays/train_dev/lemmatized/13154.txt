there is a phrase that say : getting old begin when regret replace dream . on one hand , it is true that young people are more able to enjoy their life than older one . when you have almost your entire life before you and you can make a lot of plan for your future . the youngest people do not already have to many reponsabilities like child or work and they have more time to enjoy their own life . for example , i want to go and study in australia for the next semester and i am sure i am going to enjoy me stay and maybe me life there . in our day , there is a lot of way to entertain . young people can enjoy it because they are still physically able to do so . indeed , young people can do more sport , walk on the mountain , surf , party etc . that is a way not to find their life too boring . on another hand , i think that being old is a beautiful thing because they can see their childlren growing up , help , advise and support them a much a they can . and they also can enjoy visit from their grandchild which is certainly a bit magic for anybody . a lot of old people do travel a lot once retired and really like it . it is much easier to make trip , see new people , make even short-term plan for your life . i know a friend of my grandmother who is travelling all the time over the world and i think she enjoys her life a lot in discovering all these country . i will spend a lot of time to the same . but when people are working during 30 , 40 year or more , they can not travel this much and enjoy the possibility of traveling by plane wherever you want . finally , i think that older people can enjoy their life a much a young people . we all aim to find happyness in our own way and the question is : how to find it ? who with ? there are a many awsers a there are individual .
