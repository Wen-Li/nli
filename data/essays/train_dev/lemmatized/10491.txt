it is well said that the first 20 year or the time till college is the golden time in a person 's life . i fully agree with the point that the young people enjoy life more than the older people do . some of the reason to it are that the youngster ha le responsibility on his shoulder , youngster are innocent and which help them to enjoy each moment and moreover youngster have more zeal to learn new thing . firstly i would say that the youngster have very le responsibility on their shoulder and are supportd by the parent having said so it help them to enjoy every moment of life without thinking of tomorrow . eg a youngster will not have to think how to earn a livelihood for him or how to support his family behind at home but for a older person all these are a big task . secondly , i would say that the youngster are innocent and have a lot of people behind him to explain the pro and con of a situation on the other hand a old person will think on his own . eg a youngster ha a lot of guy to guide him if he ha to make a career move on the other hand if an old guy ha to take a business decision he will have to do on his own . thirdly , youngster have a zeal to learn new thing and explore them on the other hand an old person may have apprehension on doing that . for eg a young person will be very entusiastic visit new place explore new thing which a old person will not be able to do may be sometimes because of the time constraint and sometimes because of physical constraint . thus we can conclude that a youngster can enjoy life much better with no string attached to the family in term of earning the livelihood a well a physical constraint and time restriction .
