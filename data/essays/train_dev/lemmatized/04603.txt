in our scientifically advanced world , mass medium have become a major part of people 's life . we consume most of our information from medias like television , radio , internet and newspaper . they all have information for people to learn , but they also have advertisement a a part of their income . therefore , the advertisement on the mass medias have come into people 's life a lot . although the adverisements should provide accurate description of it product , they often exaggerate the positive characteristic , hiding the negative part , and suggests unrealistic possibility to convice the customer . on television , every channel ha period between program to show the commercial . i watch most of the car commercial very carefully , because i 'm interested in automobile . what i observe from the advertisement are the biased display of fact about the car . for example , a car with very low horsepower and torque is shown only the good characteristic such a fuel efficiency . there is no way for the customer to find out how small and weak the engine is from the commercial . also the car company often increase the fuel efficiency by not giving the average , but the maximum value they got from their experiment , which is an inaccurate information for the customer . advertisments make the product look better by only giving selected and biased information . another example is advertisement lik the nike commmercials . the sport equipment brand like nike hire famous sport star in their advertisement to connect the performance with their product . they show great action of sport star like andre agassi and show their product saying the their great performance are derived from the use of their product . it convinces the viewer that the product can also increase their performance a much a the sport star ' . these kind of suggestion fabricates the product a a much better good than it really is . in conclusion , advertisement are a method for the producer to sell more of their good . therefore it is obvious for the produicers to make their product good better in order to increase the demand . the car advertisement with selected and bias information make the customer believe the product is a better car until they find out the negative characteristic on their own . also the nike commercial with sport star convince the viewer that the product is good enough to help them become like the star , which is highly unlikely . i do n't believe making the product look better is neccessarily bad unless they present true information , because it is the whole point of advertisement and competition between brand to earn more money .
