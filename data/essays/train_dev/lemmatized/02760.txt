it is impossible to determine weather younger or older people enjoy life more . youth ha wonderfull advantage , inocence , coming of age , naivity . what a wonderfull surprise to see something for the first time , to touch the snow , to fall in love , to meet a goal . to realize life , it potential and beauty at an age when one is still vigourous , perfect and with all those future ahead . not one future , multiple future , so many different path , option and possibility . a bounty of choice and a healhy body to fullfill them . the option to choose a life , our life , with such few string attached . to pick up up our thing and start againg over and over , to sit down and establish ourselves when ever we want , such are the choice of youth . intoxicating situation abound in our summer yet a fall and winter come around one develops certain joy , ode to the time allready spent . memmories come into play , recolections have a special flavor , those thing that we will never do againg and those friend we no longer laugh with . yet no one can take away those song you 've all ready danced to , age allow u to see our error and our goal flourish . a successfull buisness can keep u going for many year past the the retirement age , some say it the thing which keep one alive . while a successfull son can yield beautifull grandaughters , happiness keep coming yet in different package . a bittersweet moment when one switch from the driver seat to the passanger seat , from being an actor to being a spectator , from the field to the stand . yet enjoyment is an everyday activity which no one is deprived of , let just hope we relize this sooner rather than later .
