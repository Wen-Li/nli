i do strongly agree with folloing statment , i think it is very important for the student to fully understand the idea and the concept of the subject or the topic befor learning the fact . i belives this way for several resones , first of all , learning the the concept of any topic will allow the student to learn the fact of this matter in many different way and memorize them in better way , for example in a mathmetical class , if the teacher start giving the student a formulaes to solve some problem without explaning to them how we got the formulaes with approval , it would be very had for the student to learn the best way of solving problem , eventhough somtimes student can get the answer right , but giving a fact without the maim concept will not add to the student information . another example why i think is good to know some of the concept about the topic befoer learnig the fact , it is more enjoyable to know the whole story 's concept befor you get to the end of it , for instance in you are taking a history class , it is more fun to go hear about many story befor you get to some fact happen in the past history . learning the idea and the concept of any subject will also improve any student wayes of thinking , it will devolope a wider imagenation and skill of thinking which helpe them in their real life . in conclusion , student will enjoy , memorize , devolope the skillesof thier thinking and learn the material much more better by going through some of the idea and the concept befor learning the fact .
