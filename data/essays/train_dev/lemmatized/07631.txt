i feel that in general , today 's youth do not show much concern for the community . however there are a few exception , and by gaining inspiration from such people we can change the current situation . let me illustrate this with an example . in my institute there is a social service group called nso . all student are supposed to work for a minimum of hundred hour for this organization over a period of two year . the nso carry out activaties like educating poor child , tree plantation , cleanliness campaign , etc . however , a a secretary of this organisation , it is extremely disheartening to see the apathy of the student towards such activity . whenever we plan something , only a few volunteer come up . ultimately they run short of completing their hunred hour and ask me to help them in an inappropriate manner . what are the reason for such lack of concern . one could be , lack of time . there is a lot of competiton amongst student . as they strive to achieve the result they aim for they forget what they owe to society . often student are motivated to do community service just to make a statement on their resume . however , i would be wrong if i said that this applies to all youngster . i have a friend who is just the opposite . he is very passionate about community service and doe it because he feel for it . recently the college cultural festival wa organized . it is time for enjoyment and fun for most student . i wa amazed to see my friend running a stall during the festival to raise money for an ngo while the rest of u were having fun attending rock concert . to conclude , i feel that although most student feel the need and the urge for working for our community , it is only a few who turn that inspiration in to action .
