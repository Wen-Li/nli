some people like trying new thing and take risk . by contrast , other people always do what they already know well . there are some advantage and disadvantage to both way . however , i believe the saying : `` no pain , no gain '' . trying new thing and taking risk are worth doing . first of all , succes come from innovaton and risk . history show that only brave and creative people have made impact on human life . for instance , thomas edison invented light bulb . during his work , he tried thounsand kind of material . he did not succeed until he found last one . in fact , he wa not sure if he would find the right material all the way throgh . he took more risk than others could bear to . as a result , his courage and perseverance ha changed our life . secondly , people are scared to try is because they are afraid to fail . nevertheless , failure is the mother of success . even though after all the hard work they may fail , the experience they acquire is valueless . the new gained precious experience will in turn lead them toward to their destiny . this is a common process to success . without trying , this process will never happen . thirdly , staying where one is will eventually make him fall behind . in the 21st century , everyone is trying to overcome any adversary to achieve their goal . if someone stop progress and doe what he already know how to do , he will be left behind . therefore , taking risk and breaknig the mold is the only way to survive in this competitive society . overall , in one 's success and victory , trying new thing and taking risk are the two vital factor . as people try to advance , the one who stay the same are determined to be the last one of the race in life . only improvement brings a eternal success to a person .
