i think that learning fact is more important for a student than to understand idea and concept . but i do think that idea and concept are also important . i think this way because if a student is able to know the fact in reality then he can understand the concept very well . i can take myself a example in the statement which i made . during my schooling , i wa tought about various concept and idea of biological science but i wa n't able to understand very well because the teacher were not giving a fact about the science that is experiment which were given in the textbook wa n't being demonstrated in the class . due to that i wa not clear about the topic or concept covered in my schooling . in my bacholers i took biological science a my major and here it wa not the same case a that wa in the school day . here i wa able to understand the concept and idea what are being thought . this is because i wa applying all the concept and idea in the real life . i do n't say that concept and idea are not at all important but they are a little le important than to learn fact . i can tell that it may be any subject which a student take but he can better understand the concept if and only if he find that in reality . i also agree that only a few student can understand the subject through idea and concept which are given in the textbook and the other case of student find a different source to study that is muging up the idea and concept and present them in the final paper . thus , atlast my statement is that learning the fact should be given more importance than understand idea . a student can better understand an idea only when it is applied in reality .
