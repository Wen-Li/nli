fist of all , we need to think about envoirement . so my anwer is definitly `` yes , i agree . '' of course , everything wa very easy and possible because of car . they 're really usefull and convinent . and we are already good at that situation . this mean it will be very difficult u to give up driving car . but we know the first period of life on the earth , people did not die . they could live . i want to say it could be a habit just for u . habits can be change by effort . but the envoirement which wa distroyed by human being can not be recorver . i 'm sure about the judgement which we have to choose . no one will give up their life . but everyone can change their life style for their serious health problem . what kind of thing will be instead of car ? i want to suggest bicycle ! for the both of a good envoirement and a health , it 's really good . many people also have good memory which connected with childhood and bicycle . .. we have to care about our future
