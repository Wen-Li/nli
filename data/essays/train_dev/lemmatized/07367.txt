do young people just worry about their life and academic course , and not worry about the society ? are young people so selfish that they can not contribute just a little bit of their time to the society they live in ? how about all the homeless people who have nowhere to go ? what about the old beggar who do not have money to support their family ? even a young people , we do help our community by creating club such a unicef , and cleaning up place for a better environment . in my school just a year ago , a teacher , ms. levine , started an organization called unicef . it is an organization where we help the child that need help . mostly , the child who need help are the one who have no place to stay , no money to support medication , or no proper education . when this club wa introduced , a lot of young people joined , not because they could get community service credit , but because they could actually help by devoting their time to it . just by dedicating time to provide service , we could raise money to save a child from neumonia or starvation , and that 's what 's most important . the environment , a place where we 're all affected , is gradually polluting the place . every year , the school decides to take student to the beach to clear up glass piece , plastic bag that are polluting the environment . the student who join this event every year did not join because they could ditch one day of class , because the event is on a saturday . the young student are willing to give up their weekend to stay under the boiling sun and clean up in the beach and make the world a better place . time is unlimited . young people have time for themselves , but they would also find time to help the community . if not , they would n't be willing to go to the beach on a saturday morning to clean up , nor would they join unicef to help child who have no affiliation with them . most young people would actually enjoy helping the community rather than take it a a threat .
