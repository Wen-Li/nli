the speed and the pace by which technology proceeds is very fast :: if we look at the past , we can recognize how human progress and invention have changed and restricted their own time of preparation and creation . a set of material in which man ha improved his condition of life is transport . nowadays it 's very common to own a car and to get a licence to drve it a soon a possible . this mean of transport ha become essential to u . this lead me to openly state thet i do n't really think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the following are my reason to hold my opinion . firstly , it 's commonly known that the number of car owned by family ha been strongly increasing in the last year : more and more car are daily being purchased by people , and a clear proof of it is that center that are specifically built to gather old and over used car are overcrowded . besides , it 's becoming more and more difficult to find a bare parking in the neighborhood of your house , expecially if you live in a city . secondly , although the fuel ' and gas ' resourses are being strongly decreasing and scientific research is trying to find alternative way to satisfy the huge supply for fuel , statisics in the market can ensure u that car will constitute a well built buisness for still many year , no matter with what is concerning with fuel 's lack . thirdly , techology work very fast , but not so fast to completely revolutionate our way of move and carry within twenty year : flying car that we often see in fantasy-scientific movie are enough far from u . it 's true that many other way of transport have been invented ( such a airplane ) , but car , bus and van are too important to u , because they work on the ground ane we live on the ground , too .
