technology is going on increasing day-by-day and many of the people are not getting stick to one thing . they are planning to get in touch with atleast something about the other subject and gain some knowledge about that . i partially agree with the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' because getting specialized in one area may be useful but the person must have atleast some idea about the others also . for example , b.tech offer number of course like computers , electrical , mechanical , communications etc . . any student who join in any of these course come across some subject related to these course i.e. i 'm a computer science student and i 'll come across many subject in my curriculum which include some electrical and communications subject also . along with these i 'll come across specialized subject in computers after two year . specialized subject give me the knowledge how to design , analyze , code and test our project that are going to be done in future . and if i would like to choose any of the field after my b.tech i must have atleast some idea about the other subject . if i would like to learn mobile repairing after my graduation i must have some idea about cellular and mobile communications which i have already gone through in my curriculum . it make my work easy in mobile repairing , by having some idea about the subject in advance . by summarizing the above point there is a need to have a broad knowledge of many acedemic subject and specialization in one specific subject because , if a person is interested in his own field he may go that side and others can get some benefit by having atleast some knowledge about other subject .
