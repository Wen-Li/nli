personal intrests are far more important than the intrests of the community , especially in a world where it requires utter dedication and hardwork to survive . in the yesteryear , the world would have been moving at a far more relaxed pace and never this competant . this not only enabled young people to dedicate their time but also their energy toward their community there by taking it forward . not only this , there would have been much le distraction to their work . for example , if we take a student pursuing study at a university , he would had to deal with far le competition in his study . there by allowing him to allocate certain amount of his time for community activity . with le population in olden day , there were sufficient opportunity for suitable young people to work at their hometown - giving them an opportunity to work with their community . the young people of the bygone day would never have had to deal with the pressure of contemporary time . hence there would have been an obvious amount of time for them to work towrds their community development . the situation which the current generation of young people have in their hand are far from what the young people from the bygone day would have had to endure . they have to deal with constant pressure to succede in life without loosing out much . and young one of this generation are often burdened with the responsibility of family . this definitely leave them with very little time and energy to work towards their community . adding to this , the everlasting temptation to earn more money and enjoy the luxury that other seem to enjoy , which in a sense not a negative thing at all . after all every single indivudial ha the desire to enjoy his life to the fullest . i therefore conclude that , it is not wise to accuse the younger generation of not being able to apens much time for their community , given the desire their reach great height in life .
