it is reasonable that it can be helpful to travel in a group by a tour guide . if we used a group tour giuide service to travel , we could easily connect with a way to travel . however , i disagree this statement on the ground that to travel alone or with close person is more meaningful to traveler . admittedly , to travel with tour guide is the way to travel easily . a tour guide serf to assist traveler . a tour guide have an effort to have an reservation about ticketing and traffic and they list somewhere traveler to go . also , tour guide know more about travel region than traveler . they explain about the travel region professionally . these fact reveal need of a tour guide . however , the virtue of travel is achieve the knowlege of a travel region by himself or herself . the point of traveling is to achieve a character of the region and to understanding a well a to visit the region . also , if the traveler searched and got the information of travel region , the information would be remain very long time . these information will be helpful to live . besides , traveler without a tour guide have a choice to travel where and when they want . they do n't need to visit region they do n't want and they can plan to follow their wanting by themselves . on balance , tour guide in traveling is helpful to travel . however , to travel without a tour guide ha a great advantage . to travel himself or herself make achieve information about the traveling region and have a choise to travel . therefore to travel themselves is meaningful to travel .
