i agree that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . certainly , there are many reason to discourage people from using and owning car . the first reason is pollution . cars burn fossil fuel which give out lot of greenhouse gas and other pollutant . as people become more aware of the environment , more and more people are against the idea of using car now and in the future . the second reason discouaging the usage of car is the depletion of resource . the number of year we will be running out of petroleum is calculated and it is shortened again and again due to rising demand . the price of oil skyrocket in recent year , and so doe the price of gasoline . suvs are no longer favoured by the consumer and more and more people gave up driving their car totally or reduce their usage of car due to higher oil price . as the number of car on road increase steadily , road conjestion and parking space have become serious problem in many country , especially in fast developing country like china and india . it is quite normal for a driver in shanghai to take two hour to complete a twenty minute drive in conjestion . finding a vacant parking place can take up to half an hour in the central part of shanghai . unsurprisingly that many driver get frustrated and give up private driving . however , solution to the problem of the current car have been implemented and some of them are working . hybrid car invented by toyota are selling fast , because the hybrid car save energy and use le gasoline . but the problem of depletion of oil is not directly addressed here a the electricity needed to charge the hybrid car is generated mainly using oil . oil price will still increase and discourage people to drive car .
