in my my opinion i would agree that most advertisement make product seem much better then they really are . there are many reason and way in which people can make low quality product look brilliant . the main highlight which people see is the packaging of the product which can be excellent and also interesting also through tv and newspaper advertisement people give in easily without knowing the quality of the product just because they have seen or heard from their friend and neighbour . a product which can be good for others need not be neccesarily be good for you because nowadys in the market there are more fake product then their original . the choice is is yours whether you would be comfortable with the product and doe it satisfy your need it would be safe to buy form a store where there are more customer which show the market value . . i would also disagree for the following reason . first , a new product which come in the market may look bad but can also turn out to be excellent eg-a new shampoo which your friend ha used caused her hair to have split end this may not be neccesarily happen to you you may have a better reaction to this product like even for perfume you either like the smell or you dont . mainly advertisement are the best technique to sell a product and a good way to get recognized in the market . other method also include selling the product through door to door selling . people in the world believe many advertisement which come in magazine or newspaper eg-for a fitness program medicine there are many fraud in the market selling fake medicine instead of the original and these cause people to destroy their life due to the expense and uncertainity of the item . i have dicussed both opinion why advertisement can be dangerous and brutal to your pocket if u do not pay attention from which shop the product is sold and whats the market demand . but i would say that there are more fraud out there then salesman .
