i clearly disagree with the statement . fistr of all because the car is an essential method of transportation . people use the car for everything ; for working , going shoppping , travelling , etc . it is true that the city are getting saturated of car and the public transport is the best way for moving inside the city , but people are also moving out to suburban area where the public transport doe n't reach . these family have to use the car for picking the kid at college , going to the mall , or even to buy the bread . we are turning into a a society that doe n't walk , we use the car for everything . this is mainly because we do n't live in the city where we have all type of service and supply just down the corner . secondly , the car manufacturer are making cheaper car every time that can meet the economical possibility of people who colud n't afford a car year ago . these car are also cheaper to mantain and more reliable . i just bought a car last year and the first mantainance check is after twenty tousand mile , when my previous car had to be checked every seven thousand mile . the only challenging point of view is the duration of the `` petrol era ' . the humanity is using up all the petrol ; plane , car , boat , industry . .. they all need petrol to function and the resource are limited . there will come a day when there will be no more left and the engine will not run any more . but the car industry ha done research for new source of energy that are clean and , best of all , unlimited . this will promote the use of the car , nowadays a little bit pinpointed due to the contaminating effect they produce .
