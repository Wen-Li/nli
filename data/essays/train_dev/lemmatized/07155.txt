i completely agree with this issue that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i believe there are some reason about it . young people can be more interested in many thing than older people . young people are likely to be able to do more active sport such a baseball , soccer , tennis , runnning , swimming ; on the contrary , older people are likely not to be able to do them . young people are likely to have stronger body than older people . moreover , young people are likely to get more new ability than older people , and young people are n't likely to forget them . in addition , young people are more hopefull than older people . yong people have many choice for their future . they can easily find the way their life go . people make many friend and look for their partner when they are young . thus , young people are likely to be able to enjoy their life more than older people because of these reason . however , despite of the reason , it 's important for both young and older people to make effort to enjoy their life and hope to be happier than now .
