in the follwing essay i am going to write about the difference between the general and specific acadamic knowledge . i am writting about this topic because pepole are conflicting a lot upon it . to reach my opinion in this subject iam going to first clearfy the point that support my opinon . then i will include a personal example from my own experiance . then i will demonstrate a more general examole to support my opinion . at the end of my essay i will restate my opinion and summerize my finding . i beleive it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . ell having a broad knowlede is much better than having specific knowledge because a broad kowledge is much more common than a specific one . tj \ his is specially the case in durring the last stage of study in school . where some school make the student choose ther feild of specialization in such an early stage which they are not yet ready to make the dission in their life at that time . for that they specify the course that they take under a specific feild and prevent them from taking subject from other feilds . this effect student alot in their future so it is much better for them to have general knoledege than specific one . however , i have suffered this problem by my self where iam know a twelvth gread student specialized in the feild of medicne and from the last year i did n't take any physic or computer seince course . you may think that it is easier that way but trust me it is not where know i have chnged my mind from medince to graphic deigning and i am having huge problem in my application for collage and this is sttoping my way of developmant and i truly hope to have a solution for that probelm soon . this is not the case for me only but there are many other people in the world that are having the same problem . a graduate friend of my mother had actully studied in the collage a very specifed feild that could n't counter for her any good realated job but she is setting home with no job to do . by that we can see clearly the effect of very specified knowledege can harm a person 's future . i have reached the end of my essay where i can say again that i am totally against specific feild subject study specially in last stage if school . noting that having a more a broad knowledege is more useful and let u always put in mind that a good leader hanve enogh knowledeg about every thing in life . also a broad knowlege would affect the future of a person more effectivly to make a person choose his future correctly and more effectivly ,
