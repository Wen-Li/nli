i agree with the statement , that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , for several reason . first , i think that the student should understand idea and concept because then they really know how a thing work . when they just learn a fact they will forget it soon after . on the other side it is obvious that they when they understood something once they will not forget it for a much longer time . however , sometimes it can be important to learn fact . the student should learn some important fact , because it is nessecary . for example , i think everzbody should know when the second world war startet and when it ended . this is just knowlege that everzbody need that live nowadays . second , i think in the modern world it is much more important to understand idea and concept because today it is to difficult to know all the fact . we live in a world where everything is specialized . nobody is able to know all the fact , so it is much better to understand the basic . facts are getting more important for the person who work and don t go to school anymore . a doctor for example ha to know how the human body work . he ha to know all kind of bone of a human being . for student it is not important that they can show all the specific bone of a human body . it is possible that a student that learns all the bone , will become a lawer in the future . then he ha to know completely different thing in conclusion , i agree in general with the statement . i just think that it is important for the student to know some basic fact .
