on a personnal account , i think that everyone should have broad knowledge of many academic subject . according to me , specializing in one specific subject is extremely dangerous and could undermine the way our society work . firstly , i assume that being specialized in a particular academic subject is most harmful to your intellectual skill and the way you think . when you are being taught about a particular subject , you not only learn fact , theory or historical event but you also learn a way of thinking . for instance , learning mathematics will help you develop a rational process of thinking , nonetheless you will not improve your human relation by resolving equation . this could explain why some engineer , with a scientifc cultural background , find difficult to evolve in company . secondly , i think that in our developped society it ha become impossible to remain specialized throughout you entire life . imagine an artist , she ha never taken any course but artistic one . she found a galery to expose and sell her work , how will she be able to make it if she ha never learnt accountancy or marketing method ? she will certainly go on bankrupt in a few month . had she followed management course , she would have made her gallery flourish . i recognize that society still need very specialized people . what make thing work ha become so complex that you can not hope to succeed if you do not have deep and acurate knowledge . however , extending this specialization to everyone could jeopardize our society . if people did not share the same knowledege and the same cultural background , they could no longer support themselves and live together . knowledge creates bound within people and should always be shared . in conclusion , i assume that knowledge is a precious gift , you have a right to protect it and share it . by endorsing broad academic knowledge , you have a clearer acount about people and society , and will be more useful that if you are too specialized .
