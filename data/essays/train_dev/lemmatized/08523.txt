in my opinion trying new thing that you never did before is the apportunity to have more chance to succeed . because people would know what they are good at by trying . it is very important to know what you can do well and also you can enjoy as an example , i used to play the piano when i wa young . and i always thought that i wa good at playing piano and it would be my career in the future . but a i grew up , i experienced that i lost the interest and the joy from playing the piano . after that , i started to learn playing the violin for a year . but it wa only interesting at first several month . then i started to take an art class in school . i used to draw and paint when i wa young , but this time i felt the passion and joy from it . now i look forward to attend in art school . the several art award that i received are always making me to think learning new thing are so important . although i already decided to study more about art and work in art industry , i try to learn new thing to improve myself and for my future . i learnd tae kwon do two year ago and i try to meet a many people a i can from volunteer work to understand different kind of people and their culture . also i joined many club in school that i want to do . i think successful people try and learn new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . it is like to explore yourself what you are capable of . also i believe that the trying many thing will become your valuble experience and knowledge to make you successful and it will be also very helpful for your life .
