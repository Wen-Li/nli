i support the notion that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i would like to support this with the following observation from my personal experience . with the advent of technology , a greater number of mean are available for young people to enjoy life . when i wa kid the aveneues for enjoying were limited in india . now kid at young age have different option such a video game which i never had an access to . this translates to the older people too , who would have no access to these gadget . even if they have access they have to develop the aptitude and zeal to learn how to operate these device . in the era of consumerism more and more product are offered for the young generation because they control the spending . companies that tailor their offering to the old people are between far and few . i feel this also ha to do with the age . as people grow they become more mature , their interest change and they also tend be more appreciative of the need of the family member . as a result they curb their activity and go into their own shell . last but not the least , with the onset of the old age people start suffering with various ailment that take off their most time . they have to restrict or avoid outdoor fun activity which they would have done in their younger year . having said that young people enjoy life more , i would not like to state that old people do not enjoy life at all . but a discussed above the mean change a the time pass and they start limiting their activity .
