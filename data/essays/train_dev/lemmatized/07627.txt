i agree with this statement even though i personally preffer traveling by myself to joing the package tour . i agree with this statement with some reason in the term of price , security and the time . as the first reason to agree with this statement , it can be said that if you join the package tour , it sometimes is much cheapter than organising and planing by yourself because you can get `` group/party discount '' . moreover , the travel company know which place to go or to eat so that the tour price will not to be too expensive . some people belief that it will be cheapter if you organise by yourself but it is not the 100 percent case . second point is about the security . even if you get the insurance when traveling by yourself , you still might face the danger especially when you travel the place you are not familier to . in the case of group tour , however , the tour guide know much about the place and it is the tour guide 's responsibility to take the customer safe to the trip . many elderly people seem to join package tour due to this security matter . thirdly , if you join the package tour , you do not have to spend any time to organise the tour and to book for accomodation and so on . and most of the case , the package tour includes famous and popular tourist place to go and moreover , the tour guide will explain thing such a historical background od the place they visit and so on . as i stated above , there are many advantage when you join the package tour led by a tour guide but there are also some disadvantage . first , if you joing the package tour , you can not and you do not have to communicate with local people . by communicating with local people , you can experience many thing such a local life and you can get much information . and in the best case , you can be a friend of them . second , you can not see the place other than the place which are not included to the schedule . i still agree with this statement but i also think it depends on people .
