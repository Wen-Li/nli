i think it depends how you want to travel and where are you going ? . when i go with my family i prefer to travel without having a tour guide . and also if i want to see some specific place or visit some friend . because when you go with a group which are ledding by a tour guide , you have to do what the guide say , and you have to go where the guide go . and sometimes i prefer to do what i want at the time that i want . usually this kind of traveling [ by a tour guide ] it can be a little bit boring , even more if you do not understand what doe the guide is saying . and also it could be tired . for example there is a schedule in this kind of trip . you have to wake up early in the morning otherwise the guide and the group will leave and they wo n't wait for you . and then you have to do what it say in the ittinerary . of course if you want to know different place , for example europe and you go with a group with people in your age , i think it could be really funny and great . because at the time you are knowing new place , knowing about different culture , you are making new friend . and in this case you do not waist so much time looking for the place or asking where to find what you are looking for . also in this kind of trip you know more place in le time . because they already know the important place and the rout that we should take . i agree , fortunately i did this way to travel twice and i will do it again if i have the oportunity . any way of traveling is good , of course if it is for fun or culture .
