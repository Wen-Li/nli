broad knowledge is very important in academic life . a person who want to have an academic career should be aware of a lot of academic issue . however specialization make people more successful and unconfused . so i do disagree the statement . first of all , it is obvious that people who have academic career , should have a broad knowledge of not only academic subject but also the global issue around them . however specialization is needful for academic periphery . let u imagine a professor ; when a student ask some general question about his or her research project , he can answer them but if the student asks some specific question , the professor can not be satissfying in detail . brain ha a capacity of knowledge . if a human behaviour focus on a lot of issue , he or she can be aware of much more thing but can not know anything in detail . secondly , when we look at developing country , we see that specialization is the main point in this development process . people do what they know best . without argument it is clear that entellectual knowledge is important in social life and benefit people to have a vision of life . however , in the academic career specilization make the people successfull . people have a peception capacity . therefore people should choose the subject which are in their perception of academic career . in the conclusion , all of those reason show that , person who want to succeed in his or her academic career , should specialize in some subjests . the academician can be confused on the other option . people should do best in their working life . making best happens only if specialization happens . broad knowledge brings broad intellegence , it can be denied . however focusing on his or her work make academic person more clear about his or her knowledge .
