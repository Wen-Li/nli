nowadays the competetion for academic success ha increased a lot over the last decade . the youth , most of them student , donot find time to help their community . i am not denying the student ' participation in the activity ngos and other social organization . but their number are not much and a significant fraction of them do this work for personal advantage . this should be looked at more a a consequence of the changing lifestyle and culture . the role of decline in the importance of tradition , not in the significance of occasion and festival , but following of the tradition in `` everyday living '' , which ha almost vanished is undeniable . the religion and the culture have always preached `` giving back '' to your community . the youth can not be alone blamed because this trend is generic . most people , with the exception of may be the older citizen who still stick on to their old habit and custom , donot show social concern for their community . in the indian context all of the above have been most obstreperous . increased competetion could be thr driving force in decreased importance of other issue in the youth 's point of view but the role of changing custom is nevertheless present .
