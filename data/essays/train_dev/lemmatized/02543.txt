i agree with this statement . if they do not get the main idea and just knowing some fact about it , it would n't be a good thing for the student . for me , at the same time , i wa thinking if i agree or disagree with the statement . because , i am in high school freshman year right now . i take ancient history for social study . first of all , when i just start reading the text book and trying to understand the main idea about history , i cant get everything in my mind . maybe it is just me but first i always have to get some interesting fact to make myself want to learn about history . right now , i am learing about the crusades . i did n't have any idea what crusade were . so i started reading the text book and trying to get a main idea . but it never made myself want to read farther . i decided to go online and look up for some fact about the crusade . i think it wa something like there wa this girl who lost her mother when she wa small . all she knew about her mother wa that she lived in a different country . she knew that the crusades traveled around and spread christianity . although she thought it wa going to be hard to find he mother . but she thought it is better than doing nothing . therefore , she decided to spread the christianity with them . i got that fact online and i am not sure if it a true fact but it still made me want to know how the crusade travelled and their where . by getting fact , i got the main idea at the end . but if i get the main idea at first , i think it would of been easier to study later on . so in my opinion , understanding idea and learing fact are both really important . but idea are more important for student first .
