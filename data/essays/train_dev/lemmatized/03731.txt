in today scanario it seems that car are the important part of life and driving a car is status simble . by viewing the growth in production of car and us it seems that in future time all the way are overcrowded by car . but i believe that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today because of some strong reason like fuel problem , awairness about pollution and health problem causing by car . fuels are limited on the earth . in world very small region are known where fuel are found . fuel are the main source of car . due to a large quantity of consumption the scarsity of fuel ha been generated and the price are growing up and up . so when fuel is ended their is no car on the road and automatically reduces the car . now people are very well known about the harmfull effect of pollution which is causing by car after the burning of petrol . it cause severe health problem like asthama and other breathe related problem . people do n't want to take risk on their life . pollution also cause the environmental change by which all the inhabitant are affected . and the last reasion that due to spending more time in car people are affectd with their back problem and getting fat which cause the disease . i would like to give an example that in recent newspaper study show that due to using car and lacking exercise 60 % people have suffering from back pain in the age of 30 . so when they consult with the doctor and knew about the reason most of them leave the car and start the us of bicycle . although it is true that it seems very difficult that the car are decreased in 20 year but most of the people thinking about bicycle which cause no pollution , and also good for health , also reduses the risk of accident are good for them . they also adappted cycle and certain country the car are also decrease due to awairness of people . so i belive that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
