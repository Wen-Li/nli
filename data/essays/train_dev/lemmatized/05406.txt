have you been any other country ? i have been europ and america , now i am in the america . some people said the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour suide , but i disagree with it . first reason we have to go with other people who i do not like . this is big deal , such a when i went to the europ , the guy who very old , bring a denjang which is smell bad , and he eat this in the restorant when the bread came out . the other native people cover their nose with their hand , and i feel bad because they will think the korean is bad . another reason that is the other people can feel bad about u . forexample , if the group is big , we can make a big noisy , and the other people can make their feel bad . supose you are in the hunny moon , and you went to somewhere very specal . however the big group of people come and make a noisy . what you going to do ? i know the answer . you will get med of them . last reason that we can make different think with guide . forexample , when i wa 5th grade , i went to the paris , france in europ , at night , and we want to go to the epal tower becuase the light would be beautiful . how ever the guide do not want to because she wa tirde , so we say to bus driver . the bus driver wa very nice , so we went to the epal tower . after we went there , she wa so med , and the adult fight for pay with guide . in conculusion , the travelling in a group led by a tour guide is very bad way to travel . if i travel just with my friend and no tour guide , than i will feel happy than that way .
