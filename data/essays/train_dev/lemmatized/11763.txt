planning future ahead college time is probably one of the most important time in a student 's life . i believe this is so not only because we are student and we get our education at college but also it is a place where we actually shape our future by making our decision now . therefore while we are studying at college , we should think ahead and focus on what we expect from ` our ' future . in the country i live in , many student take tha national university entrance exam and after they recieve their score couple of month after they took the exam . then come the decision process , in which you are supposed to determine your college and department . as we might all guess , a student may not perfectly choose the deparment he want to be educated in since he is quite young and inexperienced . the trend is that if you have higher score , you are just placed to a college and a department you have selected . let 's imagine a case in which the student is not satisfied with the department and field he ha been placed . since it is not always possible for student to be transferred to other department , he will probably have to keep on with the field that he is supposed to study . however , if he keep his area of study broad , he can have the chance to study about different topic he ha been interested in and maybe he can continue his study further away in time . the question of whether having a broad knowledge of many academic subject ha also something to do with the year you spent in college . for instance , if you are an undergraduate student , it might also be a good idea to study wide range of topic coming from different discipline . this would help you get a better understanding of yourself so that in turn , you can further define what you really want to do in future , whether to study in a differet field , whether to join the work life or to go on further studying the subject in the prospective cycle of your education life . having a broad knowledge about many academic subject may also come in handy when you are hired for a job that requires you to collate your vast amount of knowledge coming from different area . based on my experience , i can say that most multinational company do have this tendency of hiring people who have broad knowledge about many academic subject . these company believe that they can use the manpower * in term of intellect * in various area depending on the time and their need . hence a time go by , these people in turn can have greater experience on various work-related subject than their colleague who have le broad knowledge about these academic topic and become more qualified and desired employee . nevertheless , studying wider range of topic and having a broader knowledge of many academic subject might not be a good idea if you are a graduate student . this is because the aim of graduate education is that you need to specialize on one topic of your interest that you can study it throughly , collect specific data and carry out your research based on these gradual step . in the end , you * a the real knowledgeable person about this topic * are supposed to come up with a conclusion that would make a difference in the academic world . when we say difference , it is not always meant to be that you are supposed to prove something new , but you can also contribute with your finding - on this very specific subject for sure . all in all , we should be careful about what we expect from our future to determine whether to study wide range of academic subject and have a broad knowledge a a result . having all these in my mind , i believe that the ideal solution to this complexity will be making use of an appropriate combination of these approach while we have time and then plan our future study accordingly .
