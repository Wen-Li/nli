i agree with the statement , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . for example , the health care industly , especially those diet product . `` it is so easy , and so quick to lose weight . '' then why is 50 % of population overweight in this country ? advertising with loud background music , good looking model , and catchy frases . that 's all you need to convence people to buy product . unfortunatley , i am one of the people who just overpowered by advertisement on tv . i bouthg a treadmill which i thought it wa the greatest product that i can lose weight with le work . now it is in the closet and i will never see it again . when you are wathing these commercial , you feel like you can be what the commercial say you will be . almost entire nation watch tv everyday . advertisements are everywhere not only tv , but also internet , magazine . and these mass medium have so much power these day . it is so powerful that overpowering people 's ability to think in this materialistic world we live in . if the commercial say so , it is good product . you need to stop to think what is really going on . it is so controled by advertisement industry , people forget that we do have ability to think what best for you . we need to share the information which producuts really work , and which do n't . we have to protect ourselves from overpowered medium misleading .
