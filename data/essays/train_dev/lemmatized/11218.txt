i totally agree with the given statement beacause i 've taken broad knowledge from my school till college . i think it is very important to have knowleged about the thing around you . studing or specializing on just one subject is not enough in today 's world . for an example , to become a doctor a student must not only take science class like bio , chemistry , physic and math , but they also have to take some elective class aswell ( politics , economis , humanity ) , in order to understand how thing work around them . i 'm an engineering major studnet i 've completed most of my science class , but i 've also taken class like history , art , socialogy , which helped me to understand the importance of the other subject . these class developed the understanding of other topic like politics , history , socialogy and world religion in me . i wa very suprise to know how important these other subject are in order to understand the nature of our society . after taking all these class my way of looking/thinking about the people around me or in other word the society that we are living in have changed a lot in a positive way . someone who does't get a chance to learn about the other subject find hard time to get a job , because his knowlege is just on specific subject . in modern world company are looking for people who have knowledge of all sort of field , rather than having knowleged on just one field . for example there is more chance for a computer programmer who also ha some kind of background in the field of electronics than the other programmer who just know about his own programming field . in my opinion it is really very important for all of u to have a knowledge of all aspect of life . if you go to university it very common for a student to have double a major that mean to have degree in two field . becasue they know what company are looking for once they graduate . thats a kind of having another tool when other doens't work . we should defenately have knowledge of other field aswell .
