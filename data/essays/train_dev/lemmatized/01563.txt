cars are one of the most useful and important invention . there are million and million of car in each country nowadays , but for the continuous incresing in the number of people living on earth and technology reason i think that there will be le car to use in the world in twenty year . the first reason is that the number of people living in the plant is increasing every day . i read an article once that said that over 100000 baby are born each day , but only le than half of that number of people die each day . it will surely be very cowded by 2026 and much more people will be living on earth than now . houses will be built and more building will exist . parking lot will always be full and there will never be enough space to drive a car on the street . the second reason is that in twenty year car may not be a useful a they are now . little , cheap airplane might be invented and on the roof of each house there might be space to park it . on top of each buiding there might be a parking lot on the roof for plane to land . cities might all be connected with underground train and no car would be needed . it is amazing how everything is changing in a short time . 100 year ago there were no car at all and we can not imagine how peolpe used to live , and in a short term of time there might be a new invention and people would imagine how `` we '' used to live !
