i agree with the statement that there will be fewer car in use than today . there are many reason to support this view . firstly , twenty year from now there will be very le space avilabe to drive due to sharp increase in population and vechiles . thus traffic snarl and long waiting time at signal wiil be the scene . thus people will prefer other way like walking , cycling to save time and to reach their work place safely on time . as it is aptly clear from the present scene long wait will make people impatient and due to shortage of time one may drive fast thereby leading to more accident . thus to avoid accident peiople will prefer ultra modern public transport like metro train etc. which will help the reachsafely on time there by leading to decreae in number of car and other vechiles . more over , technology will increase the production . thus , car will be cheaper than today and no longer will be status symbol . moreover , their maintainence cost and high cost of fuel price will drive the customer away a is clear from the present spirraling price of fuel . furthermore , educated people will be definetly be more health concsious and will prefer cycling and walking etc. than car driving to keep illness at bay due to thier sedntary lifestyle when everything will be handy due to tehnological advancement . also people will try to reduce sound and noise pollution and what can be the best way than to not use car unless one desperately need it like going with family to a family ocassions . goverment wiil also support such thing and also comr uppolicies to reduce pollution and one them is their le usage . thus it can be safely conclude that thier wiil be le use of carstwenty year down the line than today .
