the world is becoming a small village because of the technology . every year a new discovery and a new invention is found . long ago the car were one of these invention which made our life much easier and made u able to go where ever we wish to go in no time or in le time than the time we needed to transfer from a place to another in the past . of course in twenty year the technology will grow rapidly even faster than we can imagin and that mean more way of transportation that may cancel the car or make it a second way of transportation i really think that in twenty year there will be fewer car for several reason . first of all we are all facing a great problem with the crowd so poeple are trying to find a better way to go where ever that want to go by using another way of transportion like the subway for example which mean that people are trying not to use that car a much a they used to in the past to escape from the crowd so the car will be fewer second of all i 'm sure that there will be more invention that may be better than the car and faster and so people will rely on the new invention instead of the car a a way of transportation so the car will be fewer . third of all we all know that the car are actually pollutiing the nature and ha got many bad effect on the environment and on u therefore the scientist are trying to find way to solve this problem which mean that they will find a better way for transpotation which will be faster , safer and that will not pollute the weather . for these three reason i strongly think that car will be fewer in the futur and new invention will be invented to save the world from the crowd which is every where and to save the world from the pollution .
