`` mom i do not want to to study these theory again and over again '' said my little child , so many question about this crossed my mind like ; what is really more important for a student to know , understanding idea and clear perception or take fact a they are printed in their text book ? this issue that describes the type of learning , is really a contreversial issue for plenty of reason , and a learning is concerned , i wish to see change in the learning way at many level and angle. , i personally , strongly believe that a person in general , should be given the opportunity to understand the idea and concept , first , becasue that is what shape a person 's personality , let u take young child a an example , most of these child have their personality shape when they turn ten year old , because all the abundant perception , knowledge , idea and even thing which they like and thing , which they dislike have already configured , a soldier is another example , this fighter learnt the concept of loving his country when he wa a kid , did not he ? !! another thing i would really do , if i had the chance to change something in how our young student should be tought , that i would build a whole city of learning , and i would make it unique in it given course , it would be built based on the concept of loylaty , love , team work and encouraging individual talent , moreover , no normal test would be giving , because they would be tought that the concept of examination is not always the right concept , also they would have weekly debate about larger concept like enthusiasm , ethic , aesthetic and racism to have these young generation prepared to involve in real life life . in conclusion , learning concept is the best way for someone to have a balanced family , community and even country , because it is a circle of wise idea , which never fails , in my opinion , no war no violence would be existed if evaluating our concept and respecting other concept were every body 's dream to fulfill .
