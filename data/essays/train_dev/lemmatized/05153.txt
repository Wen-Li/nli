i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people tend to be innocent and naive to their surrounding world , and thus can enjoy life without worrying about the future . older people know how the world work ; they have bigger reponsabilities than can affect the world more , thus they have to keep worrying about the consequence of their action and can not enjoy life at it full potentail . young people , including child and teenager , are being introduced to their world . the learning process is like a enjoyable journey about the meaning of life . their innocence prevents them from thinking beyond the future and thus they enjoy life without thinking about the consequence of their action . they tend to be more liberal when making desicions ; they want to try everything that is ahead in their life . this form of thinking allows them to enjoy life with liberty . an example that best illustrates the liberty of young generation is the free expression of love on the 70 's embodied by the ` hippies ' . older people tend to think differently than young people . they think more about the future and and emotional stability . they are experienced and know the danger and benefit of their surrounding environment . they tend to be more conservative when making decision and always have to speculate about the outcome of their choice in life . thus they more reluctant to try all the different taste that life can bring , because they can judge the future consequence of their action . in conclusion , i agree that young people can enjoy life more than old people ; because young people are naive and can wonder through life without thinking about the consequence of their action , while older people have bigger responsabilities that prevents them from acting freely .
