are young people nowadays not giving enough time to helping their community ? i disagree with this statement because i think many young people give enough time to helping their community . first of all , while you attend a school , the school requires a certain amount of time of helping your community . moreover , almost every university requires those time when you apply for the university , so you have to help your community if you want to enter the university whether you wish to help your community or not . some of the young people may think that they are forced to do this , but it doe n't change the fact that young people are doing the community activity . secondly , there are many club which are organized to serve for the community in university . these club are made with the student ' freewill , not against their will . for example , i am an university student and currently i am a member of a club mainly help the orphan and serve in orphanage . thirdly , older peple usually have more family member to feed than young people , so young people have more finical , mental , physical energy and time to help the community . my father , for example , used to go to a volunteer ' club to serve in a certain place that need people 's help like a place for the disabled before he got married , but after he got married and gave a birth to me , he doe n't have enough time and energy a much a he used to have , so the frequency of his visit to a club ha decreased and he doe n't go there any more now , even though he want to help . finally , young people are more open-minded so they are willing to help the others than old people . because the fact that you are young mean that you have a flexible mind so that you can understand the circumstance that others are facing very well . this will make you easier to help your community . for those reason , i think that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their community unlike the statement .
