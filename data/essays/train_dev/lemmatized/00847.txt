i agree the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and conceps , though fact are essential to learn some subject such a history . in this following statement i would like to disucss the importance of understanding idea and concept . firstly when student understand idea we can diversify through this idea . for example , student are wondering where the idea come from and how they think about it . after they undestand idea and then when have a discussion class to diversify the idea , they may start to think about it more carefully and desirably . in this sence student can broaden their mind and view . this process encourge them to learn more and may start to have an interest in a certain topic . thus , they like to learn at the end of it . understaing idea are very valualbe for student to learn . secondly , i belive it is more practial to understand idea than to learn just about fact . after graduating school student have a job and work to do for their life . whatever occupation it is valualbe to understand idea and concept . becase in real world it demand the ability of analysis and evaluation resulting from undestanding idea . ability of analysis and evaluation is the key to be successfull in the world such a resech programm for teacher or sale profit for company or organization related to some industry . for example , we normally solve the problem the cause and effect to analyze exactly what happenes the accident after undestanding idea and concept . as a saleperon , i always need to some what i have stated so far is to proved that i agree the statement . i agree with the statement in the above the reason .
