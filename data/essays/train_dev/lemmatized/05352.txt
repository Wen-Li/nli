if we think about the statement , that `` it is better to have broad knowlegde of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific sucject '' , we can make a lot of comment on it . because everyone have different ability to answer any question or make comment on any question . in this essay , the specific subject , that is stated before , is critisized and compared and contrasted . firstly , in my opinion , half of people living in the world may choose different one of the choises in the statement from rest of them . if i say something about that topic , i say that of course everyone should specialize in one spesific subject , that is beneficial for humanity , but he or she also have a little knowledge of everything , because nowadays human population is developing increasingly . so technology is . as the matter can be seen , specializing in one specific subject doe n't enough for working somewhere you want . bosses are searching for man who can do every job that necessery for the firm . for example , if you are a computer engineer , you must know management because in the future you will be a manager , there is no reason not to be maanager , because nobody want to die a retired engieneer . most people want more than they have . in order to that , besides you specialize in one specific subject , you should know another academic subject a a hobby . on the other hand , people who did n't choose specializing in one specific subject , are always loser , because there is n't any job anywhere . the cruel world make u to study whole day . we must study english to pas prep class or must study buisiness administration to finish the school or must increas u culture to become more social , etc . however i choose the second one , i suppose that the right one is the first choice to become more successful . to sum up everyone should make his own decision about that subject to becaome successful and happy ,
