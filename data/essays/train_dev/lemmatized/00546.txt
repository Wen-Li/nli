'' during the time is passing , year take so many thing from our life . old people are mostly angry and unhappy people . actually year make them like that . older people experience more thing than young people . they also have lived more sadness . for example , when a person face with a death of a member of his family , everthing take different shape in his world . because of that old people sometimes lose their willing to live more . on the other hand , old people can feel that they are aproaching to death day by day . they feel like they are waiting for death . it dusturbs people in a very effective way . on the other hand , young people have got bigger dream because they have long time to do everything . dreams link them to the life more strongly . young people also do not have more responsibility . it make their life easier to live because when you are free to do whatever you want to do , it protects you from stress and the thing which make you unhappy . as can be seen , getting older cut the link between you and the life . if a person ha got no aim about future , it only make you sad . aimless is the biggest enemy in front of a man . finding energy to enjoy the life doe not change according to age . if you want to be always young , you just should dream because dreaming is the realist thing in the life .
