nowadays , only few people take risk . this happens because everybody to be sure that what they are doing will be successful . the problem with this approach is that if a person do n't take risk , the benefit are the same a the average . one example of risk are sport , the mayority of person that participate in an event , such a marathon , know how to train and what it should be done to finish the race ; but only some of them win the race , and these specific individual usually not only win one competition but a lot . these one are successful in reaching their goal not because they know what it wa , but because they have trained to the limit of their body and went beyond them . this approach is the correct to success in life . this teach u that in order to success a person ha to know what is the goal he want to achieve . after that , this individual ha to understand the path he ha to follow to get this goal . because a lot of people should be looking for this goal and following the same step , it is important to stand out of the crowd . this is where innovation take part of it . persons need to know that even if is well known path all people advice you to follow , it is important to also know there are other unexplored road to take . in my life i have experience some situation that have helped me to understand this , for example , i had the same job for about three year , and i wa sure it wa doing in right because i always did everything my bos told me to . i get a raise once but never wa promoted , which wa my goal . so , after three year i changed my attitude and start to participate more in the project , i got involved more in my co-worker ' task and working more hour i they ask me to , after two month i wa promoted . in conclusion , it is important to take risk to stand of the crowd , if you do n't do it , you just have the average result everybody can get . in order to be successful a person ha to know that hardwork pay .
