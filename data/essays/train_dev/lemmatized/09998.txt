the life change more confortable and easy to live , and also the price of car decrease . the people prefer to buy and use their own car then to use bus or subway . so , some people can think the car will be more and more in the future , but i disagree that `` in the twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . first of all , the peple will rethink the pollution , so they will decrease to use the their car . as you know that the car is reson of the pollution , and people use the more and more then pollution also getting worse and worse , because of carbon dioxide which is from the car , and other bad gas . so people will decrese to use the car . secondry , when all people use the car , this thing will make trafic jam problem , so people always live in the road , and they can not do what they want to do on time . so they will prefer other trafic such a bus and subway , because those go faster than the car . thirdly , it will be obvious anyway the people always die even the medical is developing . and the future there are too many people that do not get married and have the baby , so there is just few increasing people . hence it is not different from the now . hence , people will not use more the car in the future than rutine . because people always think their enviroment than their confortable . and also they do not want to late all their appointment . as someone said that `` time is the money .
