i strongly agree with this statement . when i wa in secondary school i had to spend huge amount time in memorizing what year what treaty wa signed on , what kind of crop wa imported or exported in and out of korea in what year , what philosopher founded what school of philosophy . however i do n't remember much of those fact but i still remember the idea and concept that i learned from mathematics or physics class . for another example i had attended `` principles of economics '' in korea about more than 10 year ago and i learned the same class in america last year . though many of the concept were reminded to me , i could tell the big difference , too . that wa i wa not expected to memorize the name of the scholar or several characteristic of each theory without understanding the concept first . i could not quite grasp the idea before when i read some newspaper article in business section about business trend or reasoning for a new economic policy even after i had finished economics class in high school and college but i am smiling in my mind patting on my back remembering the concept that i learned in class last year not 10 year ago that i just had to memorize short fact and history of economics . another good example is even though i wa not good at mathematics and had to spend a lot of time solving problem , that time helped me to understand the concept of math and i still can help other student understand at least level of 8 or 9 th grade . however i do n't remember not much from history class or chemistry that i had to memorize and memorize all those year , name of people or chemical . when you get the idea and concept you can utilize it and it is easy to apply to various usage or purpose but when you only try to shovel short fact and knowledge into your brain it is highly probable for you to lose the grip of that knowlege and you wo n't retain it long enough to share it with your child or your student .
