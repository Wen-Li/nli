i do not think that this statement is right for all the young people nowadays . i would say that it is like it ever wa in history . some people engage for their surrounding and some others are not interested in it . you can not say that all the young people do not give enough time to others . that would impline that for exampple 50 year ago they did . it is right that it would be good if young people would engage more for others , but that is not a specific problem of young people but of the society . there are not only the young who do not care about the need and problem of other people but also the grown-ups . i know a lot of example where people had a big probleme like an accident . they could not do their housework on their own , but nobody out of the neighbourhood offered help to this people . at the moment i am doing a course so thst i get educated to visit and help old person who can not get along on their own and there i here lot of terrible story about the ignorance of young and older people . but i think if there would be more offer for course perhaps more people would engaged . lots of people want to help , but are afraid to do something wrong . they think that for example by staying some hour with an old helpless lady they could make a terrible mistake so that the woman fall down and break a leg or kind of that and in the worst case dy . so they do not offer help for not getting in such a situation . it is the task of the government of a state to offer course to the people so that the people get the confidence in themselves to help others . it is not always the point that people are not willing to do something but they do not feel able to do it . if they would feel lot of them would be willing to help others and spend time for them although you never should expect too much .
