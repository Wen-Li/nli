good marketing strategy and a lot of psychology are placed in advertisement . they want to make the costumer thinking they buy the best product on earth , but sometimes the company are cheating . in my opinion it 's true , that most advertisement make product seem musch better than they relly are . the big boss of the economy want to make the big money by selling a lot of their product . to reach their thought , they would nearly do everthing they could do . there are many reason why the manager try to reach much more money . one is per example the stock market , which open many people the possibility to be a shareholder of a company . they invest their money with the thougth to get more money back in an future time and so the put the manager under big pressure , because he 's the man who ha the investment of the shareholder in his hand . i think that many manager do n't want to be unemployed and so they starting to find the best way of selling . some make their product without good quality , so that the costumer need a new one after using it a few time . the disappointment of this is , that the product are presented like unbreakable wonder which can change the world . this strategy get a lot of monez for the company , but only the first time , because the costumer are not stupid and after buying one or two time this product they wo n't come back to the company with such a bad quality . so if the company want to have success it ha to improve the product , but they only do small change and sell them the same strategy thez do the first time . in my opinion a lot of company do it that way and that make it very difficult to separate the good product from the bad one . the costumer have to test the product even more clearly . has it become that worse case ? i do n't think so , because the state ha to improve the law and give more right to the costumer .
