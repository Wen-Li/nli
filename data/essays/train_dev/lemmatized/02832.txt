i agree with statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' . advertisement is main used to promote a product . and also to reach the public . reason why advertisement made like that because to promote the sale of the product . for an example if u take an automobile advertisment . they show the paticular vechicle in different angle with you of sophiscated digital camera 's to attract custmers . if they could not do these how can they sale their product . advertisement deptartment wa one of the greater creative field the subject taker should greater anyalsis capabality . because the subect ha desiened like these . when a paticular product ha to be advertised by a director he had paticular specification by the manufacture of the product . wat we called a draft . he ha to fellow the draft and feature of the product which should be highligted in video . they use three techinques in making a advertisement . whether it should be used to advertise a a audio , or printed on big board , or video . depending on that they decide a draft and they should fallow these instruction . since advertisement are you used to promote the product . it is nothing wrong in showing the product much better . unless he is not effecting any one 's personal feeling or religious feeling . they use these techinque to reach the people and communicate about their product . for example if you want make a pizza advertise . they us world class chef 's to cook and to desiegn it . when you go to eat pizza it not be look like but you can satifies with taste . from above reason i can claer state that it is not at wrong to show the produts much better than really look . except to medical product . the false may once health . so , i agree with statement
