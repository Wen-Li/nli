travelling , visiting different country and meeting various kind of people is my hobby since my childhood . since both of my parent are journalist , i have an opportunity to travel a lot . depending my huge experience in travelling ( you can call me expert ) , i strongly believe that the best and the funniest way to travel in a small group , preferably close friend who know each other very well , led by consensus of that group . this short essay will explain why i prefer travelling in a small group is n't led by tour guide and disagree with the given statement in the question . first of all , travelling time are supposed to be the most enjoyable time of the people since they are away from their job , responsibility . in these kind of time , people should spend their time with the friend because in the routine of the life , we share limited time with them . secondly , buying informative book about the geography , history of the place that we travel is much more accurate information for me than trusting on the knowledge of a tour guide that we do n't know whether or not s/he is expert on the region . thirdly , travelling in a group that doe n't know each other very well may cause irritating problem . for example , last summer i joined a tour to turkey , led by a tour guide ( unfortunately ! ) and we waited for exactly three hour for a person who wa shoppin , ignoring the people who were waiting for her . we lost very valuable hour by only sitting in the bus because our tour guide told u so !! fourthly , chatting with the people that you are n't gonna see them in the future and wasting your time by listening their childhood or their relationship with their husband/wife is another thing that affect my opion about travelling in a group led by a tour guide . in my style of travelling , you can chat with your friend and also listen them because you are caring for them . they are your friend , not the alien that you have to spend day with . last but not least , deciding together with a consensus about what doing next is much more better than taking directive from a tour guide . it is your holiday and somebody try to decide your schedule . in my view , it is unacceptable . i believe in democracy and freedom of individual and even by a tour guide , i do n't want to be governed . to sum it up , i definetly prefer travelling with a group of my friend and we do n't need any tour guide because our heart and mind are our guide .
