in our technologicall world , advertisement is the key for the success and development of an old or new product . you can not escape the constant presence of advertisement if you live in an average totaly or developped country . you read about it in news , magazine . you hear about it on the radio , on tv , or at the movie . companies pay fortune to advertise for their product in such a competitive way that they may override the truth about describing it or their use . i recently saw on tv a program about the president of a famous soda company whose policy wa to keep changing the advertisement of that same product very often to keep the public interested . part of what is true for each and every add , seem poor when you think about the real benefit of a soda . caffeine beeing the main incredient , it can keep you energized but doe not have the same positive effect on each one . my son is one example , if he drink one of those soda , he get really hyperactive , in a negative way . companies in an other hand are practiccally obligated to give information on the product that is not always right , because it becomes competitive with another product . when you think about all the different product offered for your hair , shampoo and such , for which i am very interrested , it becomes impossible to see which one you really want to buy , because they all promise to make your hair beautifull . where is the truth , once you 've tried , you know ! when i want to buy a product that wa advertised , i look at the composition of it , the feature , the cost . i think people should be carefull not to spend a fortune on purchasing a product that could be wrongly be advertised for .
