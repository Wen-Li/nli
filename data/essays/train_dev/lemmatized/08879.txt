i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people because i think that the definition of `` enjoying life '' is very subjective and change during life . at first let me talk about the subjectiveness of enjoying life . there are so many different kind of people all over the world . enjoying life can mean to have a great job and a carrier rising up . but there are also people who think that nobody can enjoy life while working . another example are child . on the one hand there are couple who never want to have child , on the other hand a family can consist of the parent and five child and everybody is glad to live within such a big family . what i wanted to say is , that enjoying life can not be putted into a definition to test out if somebody is enjoying his or her life because it match this definition . another point is , that certain feeling or activity which could be defined a part of a joyful life , change during life . young people who are going to school or university like party and dancing and most of them doing a lot of sport . they have hobby and activity they are participating in and friend they meet with . these thing help them to enjoy their life . older people for example between seventy and eighty year enjoy their life in a different way . they are glad if everybody is healthy , they maybe like watching television and drinking a glass of wine in the evening . what i wanted to point out is that people enjoy their life in many different way . what way it is depends on their personality and their age . that is why i disagree with the statement . i do not think that young people are happier than older one . they are only enjoying life in a different way .
