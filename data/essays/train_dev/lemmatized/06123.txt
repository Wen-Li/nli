in facti agree with both of the statement , because i think that it 's an two adges statments . in my oppenion i see that it important to make a relationship between understanding idea and concept with learning fact , because by understanding idea and concept , the idea will take an uneraseable part in the student mind so i think it an ecellent way to let the idea on mind , morover if ou add fact to the idea , the idea will have a stronger maening and impact ; example ; if the taecher gave the student an idea for example about war and poletical broplems and add to this idea some picture from the real world or fact and articals , the student will more able to understand the idea in the right way , and by this way they will have the opportunity to undrestand idea and concept also to learn fact .
