i think that today , with the advancement in tecnology , anything is possible . i agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car than there are today . there can possibly be total minimisation in the number of car too . since the beggining of time , man ha survived through many way . not only is he fighting to survive , but he is trying to improve the condiitions around him , so he may make his life more comfortable . cars started with travel through animal ; in early time , people would sit on horseback or on a donkey back to reach his destination . then later came the bullock cart , where the animal pulled the cart which wa on wheel . like this , many advance have been made in the mean of travel such a bicycle , tricycle , motor cycle , train , ship , plane and ofcourse the most convenient mean of transport - the car . nowadays , that is , in the twenty first century , in many place , the metro is being built . it is a development of the train which are generally used to travel long distance . the metro , is a faster mode of train , it can be used to travel short distance - which may take the place of car . cars , being a very useful vehicle , ha a lot of disadvantage such a parking space - nowadays , almost every family owns three car . parking is becoming a great problem , a there is no space at all . another problem is traffic . traffic is the worst problem of all - it cause people to get late for appointment , meeting or other important place . even the price of the car are rising , which people can not afford a there are other expense to make too . so , i think , that in the near future , many people might sell their car and may travel by metro which is built in many country such a india , u.k. , u.s.a. , and is being built in many other place too . i think it will be much more convenient for those people who do wo n't use their car and for those who still have their car , because there will be le traffic and le parking problem .
