this is a complicated question and the answer depends on the region and the technology . in more developed cosmopolitan , i feel quite sure that the use of car will decreas or be forced to reduce ; in some poor area , on the contrary , more car will be used under the fast construction of transpotation equipment . the problem of over-crowded is already serious in some large city such a shanghai . though the goverment is planning to build more road and bridge , there will be fewer car eventually . people are more and more annoyed with the slowly crawling traffic . i have heard a lot of people saying that they do n't like car a they did before . they prefer walking , bicycling and using public transportation . they rarely drive car on the street not only because they have to drive in a very low speed and spend much of the time waiting , but also because they can hardly find parking space . in fact , they can not easily stop while they ca n't go very fast . based on those inconvenience , i dare to predict that there will be fewer car in use in large city . on the other hand , thing happen differently in some under developed area . there is not even one road suitable for car in some rural area . people there are struggling for a better life . if they want to flourish , they should communicate and trade with the world outside . consequently , when road are ready , car will go . people there will be able to earn more money and enjoy a higher life standard . villages will develop just a the once rural city did and will own numerous car . in the future twenty year , there may be one more impredictable factor about the car . the car can be replaced with some unimaginable transportation like floating plate . no one can tell what crazy scientist can make in the future . cars are so endangered . more generally , car will go to the right place where they are urgently needed . it is quite normal that car owner get fed up with the traffic jam and abandon their car while the prospective car owner are looking forward to driving in their own car and do some business . that will be how the city get rid of car and the developing region earn car .
