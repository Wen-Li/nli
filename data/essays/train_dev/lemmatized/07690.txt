i agree that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide even though some people might prefer travelling on their own . first , people can make new friend in the tourist group . when one person travel alone or with his or her family member only , it is quite possible that he or she willl get bored . if people travel in a group , they can meet different people and make new friend with the group member during the trip . generally , tourist will remain in the group till the end of the trip , which provides adequate time for people to get to know each other and make new friend . second , to travel in a group would bring more fun . when people travel alone , they might feel it is a pity that nobody share this experince with them . while in a group , people can share this wonderful experience with the group member . the lasting memory of travelling would be enriched by the happiness added by the group member . third , it would be efficient and organized when the tourist group is led by a guide . the guide would arrange the travel in the best way , which mean traveller need not spend a lot of time to plan for the travelling . travellers do not need to find information themselves and they do not need to worry about where to sleep at night , how to find the direction or how to take the transportation . in addition , the tourist guide can provide adquate information for the history and uniqueness of the scenic spot . the tourist only need to listen to the guide and enjoy themselves . because people can make new friend , enjoy and share the travelling experience with others and tourist agency would offer the best arrangement and high efficiency for travelling , i support the idea that the best way to travel is to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
