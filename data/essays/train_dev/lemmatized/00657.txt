i do agree with the statement that advertisement make product seem better than they are . this should come to no surprise a an advertisement by definition responds to an aim . the aim is not to give an information to the consumer ( for which there is the press ) , but rather , to make the particular pruduct more appealing . an advertisement is supposed to increase the sale of a particular product , which is sold for a profit of course . so the manipulation of the human individual is the purpose of the advertisement . advertisements are sponsored and financed by the producer , who essentially dictate what they should say . this fact is known to everybody , so it is even fair to do some overtstating within limit . of course there are consumer protection law in all western country . these law discourage an advertiser from making outright false claim . so , realistically , outright lie are probably uncommon in advertisement . however within this limitation , it is rather easy to make non verifiable statement or suggestion , which are neither true nor a lie . anti-aging , cosmetic product are typical example . of course , nobody suggests that you can stop aging . but , most advertisement for such product do implictly suggest it a an undelying , implicit , message , without explictly saying it , by the layout and setting of the advertisement etc . cosmetic product ' advertisement always show fresh , young character who have no issue with aging . .. also , advertiser usually try to convey a dream , a feeling , and not a rationaly verifiable message . for instance advertisement for expensive car , watch and generally luxury good always advertise the quality and substance of the product , which is greatly overstated , but in the end , the customer buy it for intangible reason , such a prestige and exclusivity associated with owning a luxury product . it is unrealistic that a expensive swiss manual watch is more reliable , precise , than a cheap chinese copy . .. but that is not the point .
