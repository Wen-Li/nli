i agree with this statement . in my opinion being successul requires you to be uncommon . you need to have some unique quality in order to be recognised and acknowledged by public . repeating the same thing you in which you have acquired perfection might earn you attractive result initially but in the long run they are n't much fruitful . the competion in all field of life is very tough these day . so to overtake others you need to posse some distinguishing charecteristics . working on a same project again and again is not going to solve your purpose . because gradually other people also acquire mastery over them and may even surpass you . though trying to do new thing , say , for example starting a new business may ultimately turn out to be a disaster and in that context the other view appears to be more appropriate but a we all know ` failure are the stepping stone to success ' . history is full of instance that support the idea of endeavouring new thing . one common example is of scientist . its well known that only those who have tried to innovate have been able to register their name in the book and are remembered even after hundred of year . what if einstein had accepted the already running theory ? the concept of relativity would have never arose and of course einstein could n't have been able to get the noble prize . there are numerous other example of various leader , businessmen , researcher who became successful only because they tried to introduce new concept . to name a few , mahatma gandhi who pioneered indian freedom movement , businessmen like bill gates who intoduced window and revolutionised the computer industry and now he stand a the richest man on earth . so based on above mentioned example and fact i am of the opinion that only those succeed who do new thing and take risk
