young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community . i would agree with this statement . when you go to big city you would see this , that everyone mindess his own business . the poor guidness youth have these day will keep them away from there community . where you live always explains alot about who you are . people from the city tend to have a stuck up attuide and minding there own business . say your from a city and someone ha a flat tire next to your house . there will be a very little chance that he might come and help you . which will be the oppoiste in a little town where people are more connected togther . finding a good leader or teacher to guide young people is hard thing these day . who will get them on the right track . who will tell them thats wrong and thats right . also teach them how to respect others and how to respect life . if you look closley to youth in city you would no notice that most of them have no respect for older people . also a very high number of them are on drug and alchole . which play a big role in keeping them away from there communites . in conclusion , today way of living ha a big impact on young people way of thinking and being in touch with people . also the dark road of drug and alchole have another reason way young people stay away .
