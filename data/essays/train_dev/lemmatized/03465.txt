i agree with the statement that advertisement deceives the consumer and make product seem more attractive and/or much better than they really are . in fact it is difficult to disagree with this claim since we are living in a world in which , people prefer to live in phantasy . not only the variety of product , but also the way that these product are presented to consumer have increased . thus , the advertisement became one of the most important component of our daily life . advertisements are everywhere , and the way they present a product is even more important that the product itself . companies have understood the importance of advertisement and commercial long time ago and allocated large amount from budget to them even when they do not expect significant return in the short-run . more strikingly , a language that is based on the purpose of promotion have emerged in the last two or three decade in other sphere , like politics . as a consequence of this , we can see the effort of country to promote themselves for attracting tourist and investor . of course , fancy street and high-rise building are prefered rather than the scene of misery and deprivation in these promotion . even the everyday conversation have been affected by this trend . in order to have a good career , we have to buy some book that will teach u how we can promote ourselves and increase our value in the labor market . today we are living in a world in which not only the producer but also the ruler are trying to sell something to u . all these thing have become ordinary component of our life . nevertheless , there are few who criticizes it since looking at the material is deleterious for our mental well-being . our reality is constructed by tv and our satisfaction is secured by the the product that we do not need . advertisements is the interface of this fake life .
