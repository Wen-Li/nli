i agree to this statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they know how to do well . a person who is successful is successful because they have worked hard on something that made them successful . and being successful also allows you to do different thing instead of focusing on one thing because you have that extra time to think about other thing . trying out different thing and taking risk kind of go together . if you are trying out something new , you are taking the risk of trying something you have never done before . everyone in the world want to be successful , but everyone ha their own opinion on what being successful is like . some that it 's money , some say it 's power , and some say it 's having a good life . but the main question is , what qualifies you to be successful ? in order to be successful , you have to work hard . you ca n't just sit around and wait for success to come to you . you have to act in order to be successful . for instance , succeeding in life usually involves education . if you work hard and study really hard in college , or school , there 's a higher chance for you to be successful than the others who did n't try hard . so in order to be successful , you have to work hard . when you are being successful , you have the time to try out different thing . you have the spare time to try other thing , so you keep trying different thing . after you try number of different thing , you want to succeed in more thing . it 's kind of like an addiction . for instance , a successful mathmatician might want to increase his range of what he can do , so he might raise the hurdle a little and memorise the first 100 digit of pi . after doing that , he might move on to 200 , then 300 , then 400 , and so on . a successful person doe n't try different thing . a person trying different thing become more and more successful . if you are trying out different thing , you are also taking a risk a well . you are taking the risk of being afraid , and fighting with yourself . because everyone is scared to do thing their first time . think back to the first time you rode a bike . you were scared that you were going to fall , so you had training wheel . but after you got used to that , you tried something new and took the risk of taking the training wheel off . this is the fist step in trying out something new . in order to try out something new , you have to take the risk of improving what you can already do . this give you more experience in life making you a stronger and more successful person . as mentioned above , being successful is about working hard , and achieving goal . but in order to do this , you have to try out different thing instead of focusing on one thing . and finally , taking a risk and not being afraid of what 's to come are inportant factor in order to be successful . again , a successful person doe n't try different thing . a person trying different thing become more and more successful .
