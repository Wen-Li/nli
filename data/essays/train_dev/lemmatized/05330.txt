there is no doubt that everyone want to be success , what are the personality and skill that successful people have and we do n't have ? successful people are intelegant and independent . for me the most important personality to success is creative , a for brave , i agree with that , i think successful people like to try and take risk of new thing . the fist tought i stand on this oppiean is they are not afraid of challenge , because of that , they will want to try anything new , ti find out which thing is better , they are not afraid to fell down , because they will stand up again . the seacond reason is the desire of success . if you want to be succesed , you must take risk in lot of new thing , to find out which one is good which one is bad , find the good one to stand your work your bussiness , after that you will learn a lot from that experence , be stranger to face more thing , that really make you to be successful .
