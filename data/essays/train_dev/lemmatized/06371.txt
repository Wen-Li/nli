as a young turkish man , i am disagree with the statement . in my opinion older people enjoy life more than young people do . the reason why i think are older people have more experience than young people , they do not have to struggle with life and they can be happy with their child . firstly , older people have a big advantage to be happy , they have lived different thing before than young . for exmaple , they know a birth 's happiness or a death 's sadness , thus they have to change to be happy more than young people . i think there is a lot of event which can be hurted for me , but they can not hurt an older one . secondly , older one have not got a struggle in life a big a youth . i for instnace ; need to more work than my parent because they got their side at life before me and their task are reducing . for these reason older people live in more comfort than young people . in my opinion older people 's comfort is the best happiness at the world . finally , older people have their child but young one not . although young people have responsibility , they can not know the responsibility and happiness to having their own child . children may be most important thing to happiness for a person . for this reason young people should not be sure about their real happiness before they have not got a child . to my mind i will be really happy when i see my own child . to conclude , although young one have lot of advantage to be happy , in my opinion matures have real happiness , and have more thing to satisfy . i think vast majority of people think a me in turkey .
