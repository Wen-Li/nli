generally speaking , there are various type of people in this diverse society . some people tend to risk in order to become a successful man in the world , while others are afraid of risking and trying new thing because they worried about losing their money and possesions . but personally , i agree people should try and risk new thing in order to be a successful and well-know person for the following reason . most importantly , people who like to try new thing tend to have more possibilies to success . in other word , they might find out something that they are very good at and start to do other thing they are talented . to give a personal example , two year ago , when i wa in saint andrew-sewanee school , a very small private school in tennessee . i took calculus course , which wa extremly hard and i thought i would do terrible on that semester , a oppsed to get an a on it . however , after i tried to study several time , i found out it wa not a difficult a i imagined . i studied hard and got an a on every quiz and test . needless to say , my semester grade wa an a. consequently , i started to have interest examing the math world beyond calculus . now , i successfully become an expert of math due to the fact that i took risk to take calculus two year ago . in addition , people would more likely to learn the old experience and invent something great by trying the new thing . if you keep trying new thing , you would learn the experience why the old method is not working and would find out the new method that would make it work by continuing to try . for instance , edison , a great inventor in the united states , invented a substance called `` light , '' which is one of the useful and neccessary item in the world nowadays . during his experiment , he had failed to find the correct metal that would make a substance lighten . however , he did not just five up . instead , he kept trying new trail and new metal thousand of time . and eventually , he invented light . this is a good example that people would likely to be successful by trying new thing . ultimately , some people prefer doing what they already know how to do well , whereas others would rather try new thing and take risk . of course , i sometimes would review what i already know . but most of the time , i always like to try something that are unfamiliar to me .
