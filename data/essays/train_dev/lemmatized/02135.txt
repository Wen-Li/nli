life is a wonderful gift of god . this should be enjoyed till one ha it last breath . i feel that it is in the younger age you can enjoy life the most . there are three main reason for this . first factor for enjoyment is health . only healthy person can enjoy his life by indulging in various kind of activity like going to diffrent place for vacation , thriling activity like bunging jumping , sky gliding and so on . i am sure such activity though enjoyable are not possible for the older people . it is a fruit only to be tasted at younger age . second thing is that when a person is young he dosent have to many responsibility like earning bread and butter for the family or to support some one in the family all he is supposed to do is attending college get good grade and have fun . during this period of one life one can enjoy the life to the most . person in old age ha responsibility and his priority to enjoy had changed he rather enjoyes in supporting family . last but not the least to have fun one requires money . everyone agrees that during younger age when you are in college or have just completed the college to start a new job earning to expenditure ratio is quite high . one can easily spent on one self to go on vacation and thrilling support without having much difficulty . in conclusion i can say that god ha given this presious gift to enjoy . future is very uncertain and unpridictable what ever is there is present . one who can not live his present happily can not expect that happiness will come to him at dawn of his life .
