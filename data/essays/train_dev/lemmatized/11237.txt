nowadays , one must consider about the development of transition method in 20 year . will car be such important than today or will they lose their significance and replaced by other kind of movement ? will it be possible to use a car in twenty year , at all ? when you take a closer look to that question , you will realize that the human population on earth is growing rapidly and thus the demand for car will increase , too . furthermorem , production cost on car will decrease because of the growing globalization , so price for car decrease and more and more people can afford them . moreover , another important fact is that our knowlwdge on new technology is growing very rapidly , a well . maybe a totally new kind of a car will be invented and everyone want to buy one . when i take a look on the street of my hometown i do not see any car older than a few year . thus , the quantity of car will not decrease . but there are also argument which support the statement above . oil is more and more getting shorter . in a few year there will be much shortage on oil so gas will get more and more expensive . the poor people on earth will not be able to spend their whole money on gas so the quantity of car in use on earth could decrease . furthermore if there are no invention which make it possible to reduce air pollution caused by car there will be probably some restriction relating to car production to slow down change in our climate . all in all , my opinion is that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use because oil will definitly get short . there are no sign that the car building industry will make such a new invention which change our life - related to car - significently .
