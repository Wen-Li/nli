i strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . eventhough organized tour are usually cheaper and more convenient , i think traveling by your own is a richer experience for several reason . the first reason of my belief is that organized tour bring you to the most touristic site . these place are over-crowded by other tourist , and a a matter of fact , attracts also many local merchant that sell small commodity at expensive price on all your way . for example , in my trip to china , the tour guide showed u a part of the great wall called `` badaling '' . the place wa full of people , i could hardly walk up the wall , it wa very unpleasant ! on a second trip , i went myself to another point of the great wall , which wa further to the city than badaling , but there were much fewer people . also , the scenery wa much more spectacular . the second reason why i hate organized trip is that you do n't have the choice of the timetable . every visit is precisely scheduled and we should not stay overtime otherwise the bus or tour guide would leave you at the point it dropped you . a visit of the louvre museum in paris is not worth if you can only appreciate the `` mona lisa '' painting , and not contemplate the other , le famous , painting . last but not least , i strongly believe that the most interesting part in travelling is when you make contact with the local people . in my trip to foreign country , i learned a lot through the visit of the country , but i also learned many thing about the culture through conversation with local . it may be disgusting to see chinese people splitting in the street . but once you understand that they do that to reject bad element ( such a those coming from pollution ) instead of keeping them in their body , you may find it smart or at least understandable . communicating with people , that is how you begin to respect their culture . to conclude , a per my experience , i always recommend people to make a trip by their own and not with a guide . this is the best way to discover , understand and respect a culture .
