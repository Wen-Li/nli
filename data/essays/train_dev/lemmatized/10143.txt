everything in life had to go new way at one point . evolution for example . without going new way , human maybe would still live in cave if they existed at all ! to connect this example with today life , you only have to look at famous people like bill gates for instance . he tried new thing , and today he is one of the most famous people in the world , pushed the technology a huge step forward and ows up to that more money than i could ever count . of course , on the one hand i have to say , that you are on the safer side of life if you only do the thing you know you can do . because you are selfconfident in what you do , and you will do it the correct way without having to worry about not solving a problem perfectly , for example given by your bos at work . but on the other hand everyone want to improve and be ` a good a can be ' , and that is not possible withoug moving on . a good exampel is a tennisplayer . if he would never change his way of playing , everyone would know how to beat him , and he could quit his tennis career . that 's why he is trying to learn new technique . and this wa only one example . another one could be , that he get bored of playing and feel unsatisfied his whole life through . in every part of life it is the same . you want to improve , so you have to accept the fact , that you have to try and learn new thing . so i do agree with this statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what the already know how to do well '' . because mankind want to move on - thats in it nature . and you can only move on if you try new thing .
