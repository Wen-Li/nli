when i wa fifteen year old , my father told me somthing which i have never forgot it , and actually it helped me many time , he said `` try to know small thing about about every subject and try to know everything about one subject '' . for that i tried from that time to identify which kind of science i should specialized , and what are the related science which i should know about it . i dicieded to specialize in the structural design engineering and that force me to do well in the academic subject dealing with that science . but i find that to do that well i should have a good knowledge of mathematics , physic , mechanic and in sometime medical subject . it seems to be strange , how can some medical subject related to related to structural design ? the answer is the way the human is standing with by his bone is similar to the way of structure to . so according to my experience i think that specializing in a certain academic subject is very important , but you must have a small knowledge about the other academic subject . on the other hand people that supporting having a board knowledge of many academic subject say that ; it will help student to have a bigger chance in the market , but that is not correct . the market nowadays is searching for the specialized person in a certain subject , and also they pay for these kind of experience too much . actually not specialized people always playing small rools in their company and even if they are working too much they did not get a good appriciation a the specialized worker got . and ofcourse that will affecting the working environment by spreading the feeling of jelous and make the one team project hate each others .
