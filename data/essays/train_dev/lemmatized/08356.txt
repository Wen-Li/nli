actully i agree for the student to understand the idea and conecpts before learing the fact because the fact at the biggining wa un idea then devloped till came fact . for any student going to make any study he have to develop the idea of his subject and make plan how to make fact in order to be acceted other wise no body will support his idea . the student when they are preseting any project they make it or any study they do they should start showing how they reach this fact which is the result of thier project or study . in order to make this fact accepted from the teacher whose evaluting their study they have to show the idea of the project then the concept which they follow and the result which is the fact . any student whose not start his learning from knowing the idea and the concept and going directlly to study the fact his knowlage base will be weak . knowing the idea it will help for future growing and developmet and improvment . all te scince start a idea then devloped ti they came a fact . and since all discoverd technolgis start a idea then develped till reach which we see in our world know ( very advanced and high tech . ) . we should learn our student to belave in studying the idea till they reach the fact and this is for more development in the future . know every student who have un idea he will go and work hard to make it fact by follwing the concept but if he learn only the fact he will be not able to develope him self . so that let all the atudents start studying the idea and how it v \ come fact at the
