in the case of latin america i think that is better to have a broad knowledment of different subjets because you can manage more activity and realize multi-task job . in my own experience , to find a job the recluiters ask you not for specific knowledge in a specific field . they ask you more about the knowledge in different area that can help you to solve problem . in addition , when i wa working i learned about diffrerent subject because my job demand it . for example , i am electrical engineering so i have a background in electronics and technical aspect , my last work wa project management so i learned about risk of the project , financial stuff , logistics , manage of human resource . i have friend , he 's profession is architect and he read a lot about different subject because he is trying to apply the mathematics , the psicology , and the maketing to the decoration of a room . he analizes the psicological profile of his client and try to design according with their interest and hobby . the people who have broader knowledment can manage more task and can make the job that others dont know . its easier to explain how to make something to a person who ha knowledge in more field . on the other hand , some activity requires specialized resource for example people who repair , and build airplane . those work need specialized knowledge , but need more year of specializacion in a field . in conclusion , i 'm agree with the statement because for the society it better to have people with knowledge of different branch . in the case of latin america the people can make multi task job .
