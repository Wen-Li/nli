my classroom teaching give me several evident to agree upon the statement , that it is important for the student to understand idea and concept , although learning fact are also important . as in my case , i learn well when i understand the idea and concept . this help me to learn faster and to retain for a long time . facts can be forgotten when some other important information enters into the mind understanding is the key factor to learning . students learn better when they understand . in an example , i wa teaching to one of my student about world war i , she is on georgia alternative assessment , i gave a video to watch about the world event . she understood the fact it is a war , but did not understood the idea and concept of the world war i . when answered the test she generally answered it a war without knowing it is an world event . today 's education system emphasis on elementary education because when the young student understand idea and concept it is easy to learn the material . it doe not matter how difficult might be the task . showing fact is an additional information given to the student to understand and remember the work . fact itself do not help . projects are well done when they are understood . i can take an example of my daughter shaina . she will not understand the fact unless i give her the idea and concept . i remember her asking me the same topice after day . example , she learned about the solar system . it took me get afford to make her understand the working of the solar system . i bought chart and model to give her idea and concept of working of solar system . she completed her own project and did received ` a ' on it . it take time and afford to do this but learning is intense and last longer . thus i prefer understanding idea and concept to be cleared to me , to my student . students doe show progress in their work . learning is more fun . students are motivated to learn more .
