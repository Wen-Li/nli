to answer the question , i have to define what `` successful '' mean first . to me a successful person is someone who is in control of his life and able to live it the way he want it to be . he is not limited by various barrier in his job or social life and ha already achieved a high position in his profession a well a he ha a large and stable circle of friend . one important barrier that stand in your way to fullfill your dream is fear . if someone doe n't dare to take a new job opportunity or to meet new people at a party , how could he possibly improve his professional or social situation ? we live in a society that is confronted with change constantly : may it be a new techincal innovation like the mobile phone ten year ago or the latest fashion in clothing . the creation of new thing mean that there are new product to sell which lead to a growth in economy . and this is good of everybody . someone who adopts all the new thing show that he want to be part of market-society and will be successful in it . people who do n't will be recognized ( a they were unfashionable clothes and are not able to send sms ) and excluded . especially the technical developement openes a wide range of new possibility ; for example in transport and communication . people who are the first to try these innovation can take advantage of the improved transportation or communication the longest . they have a head start . on the other hand , taking risk can be dangerous . all those people who bought new economy share in the beginning of this century will agree with me . if you start something new there will always be the chance of failing . so i can also understand those who stay with what they know they 're good in . i guess , a truely successful person is able to tell what is a risk worth taking and where they should keep their hand of . all in all i am more or le agreeing with the statement . in the world of today it is better to go one step to far than to be left behind .
