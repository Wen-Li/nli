people think that it is smart that you know everything . however , human ' s ability is limited . sometimes you need to be concerned about what you are really capable of . some people do well on one specific subject some people on another , so i think that it is very good to have broad knowledge but not all the time . when you really think about it , if we specialize in one specific subject we would have more time to do it , and also we 're more expert in it . when we focus on one thing , we could spend more time on it than when with the other thing so interrupting . it 's like that . people do not have two seperate spirit . once we were interrupted , we might lose the important part that we had been focused on . it would be too hard for normal people . secondly when we specialize in a specific subject , we have more attention on it . we would n't be confused with two thing . that way we remember more information from that thing we studied . lastly there is always something that we 're good with and not food with . for example maybe i 'm really good at playing tenis but once it go on the table like ping-pong i totally messed up , because it is natrual . i were born this way . people ca n't forced me to do it , because that doe n't do any good either . being an expert on one specific thing make life le confusing . however , i 'm not saying those smart guy who know everything is n't smart enough to make lifeeasier . it 's just i like it
