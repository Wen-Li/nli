although some very populated country such a china or india are going to become modern industrial country in the next few year , and then increase their demand of car , i do n't think that the supply will stay a high a today . several reason support my opinion . first , the pollution issu is an obstacle to an increasing of the car number . even though these country can produce and build by themselves their own car , there are more and more law in order to reduce pollution , including car pollution . second , gaz oil ressources are becoming rare , and some reaserches state that in le than fifty year all of them will be end . besides , the organisation of arabian country that produce oil ( opep ) stilll put up the price of the baril . then it becomes very expensive to provide oil . so , on the one hand there is the will of many country in the world of leading a western way of life , which the feeling of liberty that implies car drivng is an important part . but on the other hand it is an order for humanity to reduce global pollution . nevertheless maybe scientist will find new place where oil is avalaible . however the global warmer climate is still a big issu due to car pollution in a part . maybe that is why policy concerning driving license are becoming so strict in western country . .. anyway , i would conclude by writing that i believe that in twenty year there will be fewer car than today
