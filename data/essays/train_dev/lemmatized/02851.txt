i disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . rather , i am of the opinion that it is better to specialize in one subject than to have a broad overview of different academic subject . having a broad knowledge would give an individual a superficial understanding of different topic which he may not be able to put to effective use for the society . specializing in a field give greater insight into the particular field and an individual can explore further and create new wealth of information . this way he would be contributing to the society and the civilization . different academic subject base themselves on different concept and it would also consume more time of the individual in trying to get a grasp of the fundamental of different academic subject . we can draw water from a well only by selecting a right place and by continuing digging at that point rather than by starting digging at different location . similarly , an individual would be more productive if he spends the same amount of time in exploring a single subject and specializing in it . a civilization need new idea to advance itself . looking at the collective , if everyone try to gain a broad knowledge of many academic subject , we would all the sustaining only on the information wealth created already and there would not be any improvement in the status quo . to futher itself , the society ha to have different individual specializing in different subject , exploring the new topic in their specialization and create or discover new information for futher generation .
