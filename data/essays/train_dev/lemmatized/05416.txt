i would like to believe this statement will come true , but i think it will be very difficult . first of all , the degree of car increasing doe not seem to stop and mainly in that country that are growing up economically in this period like china , india and brasil . so i believe it will be impossible stop this raising for the next year . another point is that the nowadays culture is not ready for changing it habit . the most city in the world are plenty of car because the governements do not support alternative transport , like for example public transport . i think if the tram , subway , train , ect . would be more efficient than now , people would choose to catch the underground instead picking up the car and staying stopped in the traffic jam . for instance , the problem in my city is that the only way to move are the car or the tram . besides , this public transport is not modern at all , very dirty and in add you can not rely on it . so it is obvious that people prefer driving their car . i know that some new city for example in china are developped with a powerfull net of public transport to encourage to not take the car , but we need to consider that in the most old city is very difficult improve new form of transport because it is not so easy to integrate them with the environment . according to this opinion , rome doe not have the subway because digging they found out anchient piece that are considered very valuable so they can not go on . sometimes in other city subway or train are very expensive and so this do not encourage anybody to move by public transport . of course , later on , thing have to change . one of the most actual trouble in this period is pollution because of the car smog . so it will be a must trying to decrease the number of car and finding alternative transport way .
