most people consider that young people enjoy like more than older people do . but i disagree with this idea from the reason below . firstly , older people know what is their interesting from their long experience . when poeople are still young they are in the time to seek what they are really interested in . on the contrary , oler people have already know because they probably have found their hobby , additionally they know enoughly how to enjoy them . for example , to enjoy carigraphy deeply , it need to much time to be familliar with it . secondly , older people have money that younger people . in any country , people earn plenty of money from their long laboring to sepnd their retired time without working . for example , in japan , many company aim at senior and produce many good and plan for older people 's hobbuy such a carigraphy , computer game , shogi | japanese chess ] . therefore , being different from their younger age when they earn to feed their child and let them enroll school , they can use money for their own because they do not have duty to raise child . thirdly , older people have enough time to spend doing what they like . recently , in japan , many older people enroll into some community to enjoy with other senior . although younger people do not have enough time because they have to work to live or feed their child all day long . from these reason , i disagree with the idea to consider that youn people enjoy life more than older people do .
