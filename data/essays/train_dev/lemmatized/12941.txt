although i understand people who say it is better to specialize in one specific subject i would prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . there are three reason why i would prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . firstly if you have broad knowledge you can talk to much more people or student about academic topic . for example i am studying three subject . this is a reason why i can talk with many different people about many academic subject . that is why i met and got to know student from different subject . we often spend time together while we are talking abuot our or one of our subject . i enyoy this time . secondly i think it is better for your future when you have broad knowledge of many subject . it show that you are interested in many thing or subject . for example when you want to get a job it showes better when you can say i am interested in different subject and when you have different knowledge than having very deep knowledge in only one thing . another thing is when you are working in a company and someone ha problem with something you can help or give solution about that topic . and that is why a lot of people habe a lot of success in their job or in their life . thirdly if you have child i think the child have more respect when you can say i am familiar with different subject than with one deeply . the child can learn more from you when you have different knowledge . i think it is very important for child when the parent have more knowledge than one deep knowledge . to sum up for me there are only important aspect to have broad knowledge of many academic subject and i would do the same way again because it is more important to have different knowledge of many academic subject than to one deep . for example in a job or to talk with different peole or for your child .
