i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . first of all i can have idea for a lot of thing . if you specialize in one specific subject you can only talk about it . hovever if you have broad knowledge of many academic subject you can talk about a lot of thing . i want to have idea for a lot of academic subject always . when i wa in secondary school i have a teacher who have idea for everything . i want to be like him . he wa also the most popular teacher in my school . all of the student love him and also all of the teacher love him . may be this is the most important reason having broad knowledge of many academic subject for me . also i have lot of reason for it . i want to be a person who can talk everything . some people can say to specialize one subject is better than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . may be it is good for talking your special subject but the others ? you can not say any about other subject . for example in my university there are lot of profesor can not say anyting about other academic subject . most of my friend do n't want to be profesor because of this reason . they think if you specialize in one specific subject you can not say any about other subject . i want to explain my idea about having broad knowledge of many academic subject or specializing one specific subject . also having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better for me . if you have broad knowledge of many academic subject you can talk about a lot of thing . do n't you want to be perfect ?
