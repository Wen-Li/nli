i disagree . in an academic subject you have to specialize in one spesific subject . in an academic career you have to improve yourself in one topic . your knowledge have to be more specialized than ordinary people . honestly broad knowledge is an asset for an academic career but it is not enough . in academic subject you have to your own thesis , hypothesis , research and also stastistical result on your subject to promote . academicians are the people who lead to the society . by their opinion and knowledge our life become more qualified . for that reason they have to be specialized in one spesific subject . university life and enviroment ha to supply them all the equipment they need to specialize . broad knowledge in many academic subject , support to discus and create new thing but not enough . all over the world assistant and professeurs are remembered by their research report and thesis , they have to work hard and help each other by sharing their research . to find out something we have to focus on a spesific subject like einstein , archimedes .
