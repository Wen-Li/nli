when i first went to moscow , i did not want to sightsee by a tour guide because i did not know how he could be neseccary for the discovery of moscow . after that time , i travelled the istanbul by the tour guide . i think that having the tour guide is the best way to travel in term of explaining the history , knowing the resting place and health center . first of all , while travelling with the tour guide , i always wonder the history of the place . for example , when i went to moscow , i did not have the tour guide , and i did not ask and learn whatelse i wonder regarding moscow . however , in my next trip to istanbul , i and my friend had the tour guide and asked whatever we wonder about istanbul . therefore , i and my friend learnt everything about the history of istanbul . in addition to this , having the tour guide is also important for travelling in term of knowing the right place for resting . while we were sightseeing in istanbul , we got so hungry . but , the place where we are at is so far being familiar to . thus , the tour guide showed u the way , and he took u to the best restaurant . if he were not there , we could not have eaten those delicious food . finally , having the tour guide is so crucial in term of health problem because they were alraedy used to be familiar with the area and if you face any bad health situation , they know where the health center are . for instance , after we ate our food , the weather wa so hot that one of my friend passed out . our tour guide showed u how to get the hospital . because of these three reason , having the tour guide is the most important thing for me. after the istanbul trip , i always joined the trip which involve the tour guide .
