i do think that most advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are . in my opinion , advertisement have reached such an important and omnipresent place in our everydaylife that they should never lie about a product . all is studied to make it attractive , brillant , colourful , nothing is left a a coincidence but i reckon it is overpowerful . it occured many several time that the product wa truly disappointing comparing to the advertisement . of course , it depends on what is the matter but very often i came to try new product that were not a `` fabulous '' a they were supposed to be . i spent some money on various thing , from cds to a dvd player , beauty product for my sister or very diverse thing , which happened to be smaller than it wa said to be , le efficient or to break very easily . my brother , who is keen on new technology also tell me how unfaithful an advert can be . the quality is below what he expected or the use of the mp3 player , for example , is not a varieted a it wa written on the box . apart from the high technology , i would tend to say that advertisement doe not lie so much about food product . is it because it is part of everyday life or more frequent to buy it ? we can buy a television once within a couple of year , be upset by the product considering we have been interested in it through it advert in priority , it is different from the food advertisement , or the item we regularly need to buy . actually , if it doe not satisfy u , consequently we will buy another brand . obviously it is important to say that it doe not happen all the time , with everything , but well , i think that advertisement should not ` pretend ' so much thrilling quality over a product . however i understand it is part of the commercial system , the advert ha to focus on the pro of the concerned thing and the greatest it will appear , the higher the sell will be .
