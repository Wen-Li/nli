ya , i do agree with this statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do wel . '' most of the well known people who got successe surely went on with lot of risk 's . this is because one wont have a special attraction untill he do somthing which is extrodinary . if he/she is success with that new idea , then they will surely be praised . succesas only come with one who came over lot of hard work and faced lot of hardship . the person who wanted to invent an aeroplane , at first kept there life at risk by flying themselves into air . the shape of that idea is an aeroplane . if they wouldnt have get that creative idea and if they wouldent have implemented that idea one couldnt see an aeroplane at this time . such great invention are to be remembered forever . every individual should have a right goal and should know how to succesed . success play 's a vital role in one personal life . one will have it impact surely in his upcoming carrier . even though there are lot of success story around u , we maily give our importance to the one which is unique . doing the same old thing may also bring some importance , but a when compared with the success which includes risk and different turn all over it way , it nothing . we have many well known people such a newton , right brother and so on . these people are well know for ther great invention due to which we now have the `` law of gravity '' , aeroplane , telephone and all . the major aspect of success is hard work , creativity and a good intelectual brain . every person can become an inventor or somthing else only if he/she is studious , very much conserned with his/her idea , innovative thinking . one should surely try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do to come out with flying colour .
