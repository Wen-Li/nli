i totally agree with the given statement . the statement say that an individual or a student should understand the idea behind a concept rather than just learn the fact about it . according to the statement if a student ha to have overall growth then this ca n't be done just by mugging up the fact that are taught instead they should undergo a thought process to develop idea and understand the concept thoroughly . this would help a student to improve in all the aspect of a personality and would rather gain more intelligence . if two student are compared or tested for example a student with sharp skill who understands the concept and the try to produce something of this own and a student who just try to learn over thing a it is , then the student with more capability of learning would always be a winner . this can be justified a when a person try to understand something then he is putting in more effort to make up his career . whereas if a student just read the fact and prepare for exam and then just forget it a part of the curriculum then he himself is at loss . this would not give any sort of personal a well a academic growth . he would stand where he wa earlier . considering the fact that it is important to understand idea and learn the concept we would list the merit that a student would acquire . when the student start understanding the concept mean he/she is showing interest in whatever he/she is doing . secondly this improves the knowledge of that particular student . thirdly the student can gain in more mark and have a successful career certificate for the lifetime . though the whole of our life we got learn new thing that come our way , this would easy only if the basis of our education is strong . it is a similar a a foundation of a large building . if the foundation is strong then the building can long last i mean it is strong enough to face adverse condition and vice versa . in this way if a student ha a more grip on his/her subject and put in extra effort to generate new idea then the individual is said to flourish in his life and a well a in society in which life . thus to conclude my view i would always prefer to have a successful career with my personal growth a well a the organisational growth for which i would work . this give you the ultimate satisfaction and you can easily come up in life . though it go on a slower pace we would always be a champion . a the proverb go `` slow and steady win the race '' .
